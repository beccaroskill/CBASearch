2005-2008 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO AND THE SAN BERNARDINO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION CONCERNING THE EMPLOYEES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES; CLERICAL;
CRAFT, LABOR AND TRADES; MANAGEMENT; PROFESSIONAL; SUPERVISORY; SUPERVISORY NURSES; AND TECHNICAL AND INSPECTION UNITS
PREAMBLE
ALL UNITS
The parties to this Agreement affirm their mutual commitment to the goals of effective and efficient public service, high employee morale, sound and responsible management of County business, and amicable employer-employee relations. The parties acknowledge that productivity improvement can only be achieved as a by-product to valuing people.
The parties encourage the highest possible degree of friendly cooperative relationships between their respective representatives at all levels and with and between all employees.
RECOGNITION
ALL UNITS
Pursuant to the provisions of the Employee Relations Code of the County of San Bernardino and applicable State law, the San Bernardino Public Employees Association (SBPEA) was certified, on July 20, 1977, by the County’s Employee Relations Panel as the exclusive recognized employee organization for County employees in the Clerical; Craft, Labor & Trades; Management; Professional; Supervisory; and Technical & Inspection Unit; on March 10, 1989, for County employees in the Administrative Services Unit previously found to be appropriate by said Employee Relations Panel; and on April 20, 2004, for employees in the Supervisory Nurses Unit previously found to be appropriate pursuant to said Employee Relations Code.
The County hereby recognizes SBPEA as the exclusive recognized employee organization for the employees in the employee classifications comprising said Units as listed in the Appendix, “Salary Adjustment,” hereof, as well as employees in such classes as may be added to these Units hereafter by the County.
ACCESS TO PERSONNEL RECORDS ALL UNITS
Personnel records are confidential and access to personnel records of the employee shall be limited to the Director of Human Resources, the appointing authority, the Board of Supervisors, or their authorized representatives. Employees currently employed by the County of San Bernardino and/or their representatives, designated by the employee in writing, will be allowed to review the employee’s personnel records during regular business hours.
Letters of reference and other matters exempted by law shall be excluded from the right of inspection by the employee.
Negative information may be purged from the personnel records maintained by either the Department or Human Resources, subject to legal constraints, at the sole discretion of Human Resources or upon the request of the employee or the appointing authority, and upon approval of Human Resources and the employee shall be so notified.
Employees desiring to review such records shall make such request in writing at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance to their appointing authority or Human Resources as appropriate.
1
ACCESS TO WORK LOCATIONS
ALL UNITS
The parties recognize and agree that in order to maintain good employee relations, it is necessary for Labor Relations Representatives of SBPEA to confer with County employees during working hours.
Therefore, SBPEA Labor Relations Representatives will be granted access to work locations during regular working hours to investigate and process grievances or appeals. SBPEA Labor Relations Representatives shall be granted access upon obtaining authorization from the appointing authority or designated management representative prior to entering a work location and after advising of the general nature of the business. However, the appointing authority or designated management representative may deny access or terminate access to work locations if, in their judgment, it is deemed that the visit would interfere with the efficiency, safety, or security of County operations. The appointing authority shall not unreasonably withhold timely access to work locations. The appointing authority shall ensure that there is at all times someone designated who shall have full authority to approve access. If a request is denied, the appointing authority or designated management representative shall establish a mutually agreeable time for access to the employee.
SBPEA Labor Relations Representatives granted access to work locations shall limit such visits to a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the nature of the grievance or appeal.
The appointing authority or designated management representative may mutually establish with the SBPEA Labor Relations Representative reasonable limits as to the number of visits authorized with the same employee on the same issue, and reasonable limits as to the number of employees who may participate in a visit when several employees are affected by a specific issue. The County shall not unduly interfere with SBPEA’s access right to work locations.
ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT
ALL UNITS
Any employee may purchase amounts of Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance coverage for themselves and dependents through payroll deduction according to the following schedule:
EMPLOYEE COVERAGE	DEPENDENT COVERAGE	
	SPOUSE ONLY	EACH CHILD
$10,000	$5,000	$3,125
$25,000	$12,500	$6,250
$50,000	$25,000	$12,000
$100,000	$50,000	$25,000
$150,000	$75,000	$25,000
$200,000	$100,000	$25,000
$250,000	$125,000	$25,000
The County agrees to provide these benefits subject to carrier requirements, to be administered by the Employee Benefits and Services Division. Selection of the insurance provider(s) and the method of computing premiums shall be within the sole discretion of the County.
New employees shall become eligible to participate in these programs on the start of the pay period following completion of 1,040 service hours of satisfactory service.
Note: All persons eligible for the foregoing programs of insurance will be covered for the insurance on the date the insurance becomes effective, or in the case where the employee is absent on the date the insurance becomes effective because of illness, the insurance will commence on the date of return to work.
2
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE
MANAGEMENT UNIT
Effective pay period 1 of each year, an employee in a regular position will be provided with eighty (80) hours of administrative leave time for the employee’s use. Employees hired after the beginning of pay period 1, shall be credited with administrative leave prorated on a monthly basis, based upon the annual rate of eighty (80) hours (i.e., 6.67 hours per month, or any portion thereof). Such administrative leave may be cashed out at the employee’s then current base rate of pay in increments of one (1) hour one (1) time during the calendar year to the extent that the hours would have accrued at the rate of 6.67 hours per month minus any hours used up to that time. Any administrative leave accrual balances in effect at the end of pay period 26 of each year (or if applicable, pay period 27) will automatically be paid at the employee’s then current base rate of pay. Employees may designate that cash-out of administrative leave be allocated to the County’s Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plan consistent with the requirements and restrictions of such Plan. Upon termination of employment or appointment to a position in another occupational unit, unused administrative leave will be paid at the current rate of pay only by the amount of hours that would have been accrued at the rate of 6.67 hours per month minus the total number of hours previously used and cashed out.
Administrative leave may be used on the same basis and under the same conditions as vacation leave. Employees may only submit amended Time and Labor Reports to charge or restore administrative leave for pay periods in which another leave type was requested, approved and charged, if such amended Time and Labor Reports are submitted within two (2) pay periods of the pay period to be amended.
SUPERVISORY UNIT
Effective pay period 1 of each year, an employee in a regular position will be provided with forty (40) hours of administrative leave time for the employee’s use. Employees hired after the beginning of pay period 1, shall be credited with administrative leave prorated on a monthly basis, based upon the annual rate of forty (40) hours (i.e., 3.33 hours per month, or any portion thereof). Such administrative leave may be cashed out at the employee’s then current base rate of pay in increments of one (1) hour one (1) time during the calendar year to the extent that the hours would have accrued at the rate of 3.33 hours per month minus any hours used up to that time. Any administrative leave accrual balances in effect at the end of pay period 26 of each year (or if applicable, pay period 27) will automatically be paid at the employee’s then current base rate of pay. Employees may designate that cash-out of administrative leave be allocated to the County’s Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plan consistent with the requirements and restrictions of such Plan. Upon termination of employment or appointment to a position in another occupational unit, unused administrative leave will be paid at the current rate of pay only by the amount of hours that would have been accrued at the rate of 3.33 hours per month minus the total number of hours previously used and cashed out.
Administrative leave may be used on the same basis and under the same conditions as vacation leave.
SUPERVISORY NURSES UNIT
Effective pay period 1 of each year, an employee in a regular position will be provided with forty (40) hours of administrative leave time for the employee’s use. Employees hired after the beginning of pay period 1, shall be credited with administrative leave prorated on a monthly basis, based upon the annual rate of forty (40) hours (i.e., 3.33 hours per month, or any portion thereof). Such administrative leave may be cashed out at the employee’s then current base rate of pay in increments of one (1) hour one (1) time during the calendar year to the extent that the hours would have accrued at the rate of 3.33 hours per month minus any hours used up to that time. Any administrative leave accrual balances in effect at the end of pay period 26 of each year (or if applicable, pay period 27) will automatically be paid at the employee’s then current base rate of pay. Employees may designate that cash-out of administrative leave be allocated to the County’s Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plan consistent with the requirements and restrictions of such Plan. Upon termination of employment or appointment to a position in another occupational unit, unused administrative leave will be paid at the current rate of pay only by the amount of hours that would have been accrued at the rate of 3.33 hours per month minus the total number of hours previously used and cashed out.
3
Administrative leave may be used on the same basis and under the same conditions as vacation leave. Employees may only submit amended Time and Labor Reports to charge or restore administrative leave for pay periods in which another leave type was requested, approved and charged, if such amended Time and Labor Reports are submitted within two (2) pay periods of the pay period to be amended.
ANNUAL LEAVE AND ATTORNEY LEAVE
SUPERVISORY AND SUPERVISORY NURSES UNITS
Effective pay period 1 of each year, an employee (except Supervising Deputy District Attorneys and Supervising Deputy Public Defenders) in a regular position shall be credited with forty (40) hours of annual leave for the employee’s use. Employees hired after the beginning of pay period 1, shall be credited with annual leave prorated on a monthly basis, based upon the annual rate of forty (40) hours (i.e., 3.33 hours per month, or any portion thereof). Annual leave will be separate from and in addition to any vacation or holiday leave. If any annual leave remains at the end of pay period 26 (or 27, when applicable), it shall not be cumulative into the next calendar year nor shall there be any conversion to cash.
Employees who are appointed to a position in an occupational unit that does not contain an annual leave provision and who have been denied in writing the opportunity to use the leave due to work urgency shall receive in cash payment the prorated amount of annual leave from the start of pay period 1 to the date of Unit change (i.e., 3.33 hours per month) minus any annual leave hours used up until that time. Where an employee has elected to use vacation leave in lieu of annual leave, the prorated annual leave shall be reduced by the number of vacation hours utilized. In those instances where an employee returns to the Unit prior to the end of the calendar year, the annual leave for the remainder of the calendar year shall be credited on a pro-rata share, i.e., 3.33 hours per month. This provision applies only to these specific circumstances and expressly excludes its application to any other set of circumstances.
Employees may only submit amended Time and Labor Reports to charge annual leave for pay periods in which another leave type was requested, approved and charged, if such amended Time and Labor Reports are submitted within two (2) pay periods of the pay period to be amended; provided, however, that annual leave may not be substituted for holiday leave.
Effective pay period 1/2004, each employee in a regular position in the classification of Supervising Deputy District Attorney or Supervising Deputy Public Defender, shall be credited with forty (40) hours of attorney leave for the employee’s use. In subsequent years, effective pay period 1 of each year, an employee in a regular position of Supervising Deputy District Attorney or Supervising Deputy Public Defender shall be credited with forty (40) hours of attorney leave for the employee’s use. Employees hired after adoption of this Agreement, or after the beginning of pay period 1 of each subsequent year, shall be credited with attorney leave prorated on a monthly basis, based upon the annual rate of forty (40) hours (i.e., 3.33 hours per month, or any portion thereof). The maximum unused balance of attorney leave shall be 240 hours. Attorney leave will be separate from and in addition to any vacation or holiday leave, and may be taken with the approval of the appointing authority at such time as will not impair the work schedule or efficiency of the department but with consideration given to the well being of the employee. If an employee has reached the maximum allowed unused balance and is unable to take attorney leave because of work urgency and has had requests to use such leave denied in writing, the appointing authority will notify the Auditor/Controller of the situation and request a waiver of the maximum allowed unused balance for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months. Appointing authorities are encouraged to give first consideration for attorney leave requests to employees who have exceeded the maximum unused balance and have been granted a waiver of the maximum unused balance due to work urgency. Attorney leave shall not be a vested right and will not be convertible to cash. Any attorney leave remaining on the books upon termination or other separation from the Unit shall be forfeited.
Employees may only submit amended Time and Labor Reports to charge or restore attorney leave for pay periods in which another leave type was requested, approved and charged, if such amended Time and Labor Reports are submitted within two (2) pay periods of the pay period to be amended.
4
ASSOCIATION LEAVE
ALL UNITS
Section 1	- Purpose
The County shall establish an association leave bank of 1,040 hours that may be used by designated members for the purpose of attending periodic union-sponsored training, seminars and conferences. Association leave shall not be granted for members to engage in political and organizing activities.
It is expressly agreed and understood that the County shall not be obligated or responsible for any of the expenses or costs of member attendance at such training, seminars or conferences.
Section 2	- Release Time
Members who wish to utilize association leave shall notify their immediate supervisor as far in advance as possible prior to the date they wish to use such leave. The release time for association leave shall not be counted as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime, and the work schedules of members who use association leave shall not be adjusted to provide paid release time that would otherwise be off duty time. The use of association leave shall not unduly interfere with operations of County departments nor shall the County unreasonably deny any request for use of association leave. SBPEA shall maintain records of the amount of association leave used by its members. These amounts shall be kept current by SBPEA and shall be provided to the County upon request.
AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES
ALL UNITS
Section 1	- Authorized Employee Representatives
SBPEA may designate employees as authorized employee representatives or alternates to represent employees in the processing of grievances or during disciplinary proceedings subject to the following rules and procedures:
(a)	SBPEA may designate at least one (1) authorized employee representative in each geographic location for which the County maintains a work force. SBPEA shall be entitled to designate two (2) alternates for each authorized employee representative, provided that these alternates shall be located at the same major geographic location as their appropriate representative.
(b)	If there is no employee representative in this Unit at the work location, representation may be provided by an employee representative from another Unit, provided that rank and file employees are not represented by Supervisory or Management Unit employee representatives or vice versa.
(c)	SBPEA will designate only employees who have obtained regular status.
(d)	SBPEA shall file with the affected Group Administrator, Department Head, Department Human Resources Officer, and the Employee Relations Division Chief, a written list of all employees designated as authorized employee representatives and alternates, such list to be kept current by SBPEA.
(e)	Time spent during regularly scheduled work hours by an authorized employee representative or alternate in representing an employee shall only be compensated by the County at such representative’s or alternate’s base rate of pay.
(f)	County vehicles and supplies may not be used. County telephones may not be used in implementing the provisions of this Article if such use would unduly interfere with the efficiency, safety, or security of the County operations and result in telephone costs to the County.
5
Section 2	- Handling of Grievances and Disciplinary Proceedings
(a)	At the request of an employee, an authorized employee representative or alternate may investigate a formal grievance and represent the employee at the resulting proceedings or represent the employee during disciplinary proceedings.
(b)	Prior to participating in a grievance or disciplinary proceeding, the authorized employee representative or alternate and affected employee shall first obtain authorization from their immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor may deny such request if it is deemed that such a request would unduly interfere with the efficiency, safety, or security of County operations. If the request is denied, the immediate supervisor will establish an alternate time convenient to the County and employees when the authorized employee representative or alternate and affected employee can reasonably expect to be released from their work assignment. A denial of permission will automatically constitute an extension of the time limits established in the Grievance Procedure equal to the amount of the delay.
(c)	Employees must use the authorized employee representative or alternate assigned to their geographic location and representation unit, except as otherwise provided herein.
Section 3	- Employee Representative Committee
Up to eighty (80) authorized employee representatives or alternates will be permitted to attend Employee Representative Committee meetings on County time; provided, however, that no such employee shall be released for more than two (2) hours per month. In January of each year of this Agreement, representatives of SBPEA and the County will review the maximum number of attendees in this Section.
Monthly, SBPEA shall notify the County of the employee representatives who attended the previous Employee Representative Committee meeting.

Section 3	- Health and Dental Plan Coverage
ALL UNITS
(a)	All eligible employees scheduled to work forty (40) hours or more per pay period in a regular position must enroll in a health and dental plan offered by the County.

7
(b)	To be eligible for County health and dental plan coverage, an employee must be in a regular position scheduled for a minimum of forty (40) hours and have received pay for at least one half plus one hour of scheduled hours or be on approved leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act. Employees on an approved Workers’ Compensation claim shall receive Benefit Plan contributions for up to twenty (20) pay periods while off work due to that injury.

Employees are responsible for notifying the County within thirty (30) days of dependent’s change in eligibility for the County plans.
(f)	Dependent(s) must be removed mid-Plan year when a dependent(s) becomes ineligible for coverage under the insurance plan eligibility rules, for example divorce, over age dependent, gain ofcoverage on spouse’s or domestic partner’s employer provided insurance, or termination of domestic partnership.
(g)	Premiums for coverage will be automatically deducted from the employee’s pay warrant. Failure to pay premiums will result in loss ofcoverage for the employee and/or the dependents.
(h)	Employees eligible for health plan coverage who are also enrolled in comparable group health plan sponsored by another employer or are covered by a spouse who is also employed with the County may elect to discontinue enrollment in their County-sponsored health plan (opt-out or waive).
(1)	Employees who previously elected to opt-out of County-sponsored health plan coverage and continue to opt-out during the term of this MOU will receive the following bi-weekly Benefit Plan as follows:
(i)	Administrative Services, Clerical, Craft, Labor & Trades, Professional, and Technical & Inspection Unit employees scheduled 61 to 80 hours per pay period who opt out shall receive one hundred thirty-three dollars and eighty-five cents ($133.85) per pay period; employees scheduled for 40 to 60 hours who opt out shall receive sixty-six dollars and ninety-three cents ($66.93) per pay period.
(ii)	Management Unit employees scheduled 61 to 80 hours per pay period who opt out shall receive one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per pay period; employees scheduled for 40 to 60 hours who opt out shall receive seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per pay period.

8
(2)	New “opt-outs” or “waives” (i.e., newly hired or current employees who opt-out or waive effective beginning with the fiscal year in 2005 and any time thereafter) scheduled for 61 to 80 hours per pay period will receive forty dollars ($40.00) per pay period; new opt-outs or waives scheduled for 40 to 60 hours shall receive twenty dollars ($20.00) per pay period.
(3)	Employees in all units scheduled to work 61 to 80 hours who previously elected to waive health plan coverage to a spouse employed by the County and continue to waive during the term of the MOU will receive one hundred ninety dollars ($190.00) per pay period, except Supervisory Nurses Unit employees who shall receive eighty-five dollars ($85.00) per pay period; employees scheduled for 40 to 60 hours who continue to waive shall receive ninety-five dollars ($95.00) per pay period, except Supervisory Nurses Unit employees who shall receive forty-two dollars and fifty cents ($42.50) per pay period.
(i)	Employees eligible for dental plan coverage who are also enrolled in a comparable group dental plan sponsored by another employer may elect to discontinue enrollment in their County-sponsored dental plan.
(j)	The rules and procedures for electing to opt-out of County-sponsored health and dental plan coverage are established and administered by the Human Resources Employee Benefits and Services Division.
(1)	Employees may elect to opt-out of County health and/or dental plan(s) within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of coverage of another employer-sponsored group plan. Proof of initial gain of other group coverage is required at the time that opt-out is elected.
(2)	Employees may elect to opt-out of County health and/or dental plan(s) during an annual open enrollment period. All employees who are newly opting-out during an open enrollment period must provide verification of other group coverage.
(3)	To continue to opt-out, employees must re-elect the opt-out benefit and certify that they have other group coverage during each annual open enrollment period. Except as required at the initial opt-out election, employees are not required to provide verification of continued coverage unless requested by the Plan administrator.
(4)	An employee who elects to opt-out of dental plan coverage may not re-enroll in a County-sponsored dental plan for a minimum of two (2) years unless the employee involuntarily loses coverage from the other employer-sponsored group dental plan. Employees who elect to enroll in County dental coverage, for reasons other than involuntary loss of another group sponsored dental plan coverage, may enroll during the open enrollment following completion of the two (2) year dental opt-out restriction. NOTE: a voluntary loss of other group dental insurance may result in a break in dental coverage until the two (2) year mandatory opt-out period is complete.
(5)	Employees who voluntarily or involuntarily lose their other group health plan coverage must enroll in a County-sponsored health plan within thirty (30) calendar days. Enrollment in the County-sponsored plan will be provided in accordance with the requirements of the applicable plan. If the employee elects not to enroll their eligible dependents, the dependents may only be added at a subsequent annual open enrollment period.
(6)	There must be no break in the employee’s health plan coverage between the termination date of the other employer group coverage and enrollment in a County health plan. Terms and conditions of the applicable plan will determine the required retroactive enrollment period and premiums required to implement coverage. Failure to notify the County of loss of group coverage within thirty (30) calendar days will require the employee to pay their insurance premiums retroactively on an after-tax basis.
(k)	An eligible employee whose spouse or domestic partner is also an eligible County employee may elect coverage as a dependent on their spouse’s or, if the employee is age eighteen (18) or younger, on their parent’s County health and/or dental insurance plan in lieu of individual employee coverage. This is called a “waiver” to their County spouse’s or parent’s County insurance coverage. Such election must be made within thirty (30) calendar days of the employee’s, County parent’s or the
9
County spouse’s eligibility for County health and dental insurance. During the Plan year, an employee is responsible for notifying the County within thirty (30) days of ineligibility forthe waiver, for example the dependent child turns nineteen (19) or the spouse leaves County employment. Changes will become effective on the first day of the pay period following the receipt and approval of all appropriate documentation. Loss of the spouse’s or parent’s County plan coverage will require the employee to immediately enroll in the County’s health and dental plans. Waivers may be changed during any subsequent annual health and dental open enrollment period.
(I)	For employees assigned to work in the Needles, Trona, Baker, and Ridgecrest work locations, the County will establish a “Needles Subsidy.” The Needles Subsidy will be paid by the employee’s Department and will be equal to the amount of the premium difference between the indemnity health plan offered in these specific work locations and the lowest cost high option health plan provided by the County. This Subsidy will be established each year when premiums change for the County-sponsored health plans. The Subsidy will be discontinued when the lowest cost health plan becomes available to the employees.
Section 4	- Medical and Dental Subsidies
(a)	The County will establish a Medical Premium Subsidy (MPS) in an amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, would offset the pre-determined percentage of the cost of health plan premiums charged to eligible employees. The MPS shall be applied to health insurance premiums only and shall not be applicable to dental plan premiums. The MPS amount payable to each eligible employee shall be based upon the lowest cost high option HMO plan (currently Health Net or a plan equivalent to Health Net) for the number of persons the employee enrolls in the County-sponsored health plan (i.e., “employee only”; “employee + 1”; “employee + 2”). No MPS shall be paid where the Benefit Plan contribution exceeds the amount of the total premium to be paid by the County. The applicable MPS amount shall be paid directly to the provider of the County-sponsored health plan in which the eligible employee has enrolled. The MPS shall not be considered compensation earnable for purposes of calculating benefits or contributions for the San Bernardino County Employees’ Retirement Association. In no case, shall the MPS, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, exceed the total cost of the health insurance premium forthe coverage selected.
(1)	All Units, Except Supervisory Nurses Unit - Effective July 9, 2005, the County will establish a MPS, if applicable, in a amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, will equal sixty-five percent (65%) of the lowest cost high option “employee only,” “employee + 1” and “employee + 2” HMO premium. These MPS amounts are as follows:
	Scheduled for 40 to 60 Hours	Scheduled for 61 to 80 Hours
Employee Only	0	0
Employee + 1	0	0
Employee + 2	$30.20	$60.39
Supervisory Nurses Unit - Effective July 9, 2005, the County will establish a MPS, if applicable, in a amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, will equal ninety percent (90%) of the lowest cost high option “employee only,” “employee + T” and “employee + 2” HMO premium. These MPS amounts are as follows:
	Scheduled for 40 to 60 Hours	Scheduled for 61 to 80 Hours
Employee Only	0	0

Employee + 2	$110.85	$221.70
(2)	All Units, Except Supervisory Nurses Unit - Effective July 8, 2096, the County will establish a MPS, if applicable, in an amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, will equal seventy percent (70%) of the lowest cost high option “employee only,” “employee + 1” and “employee + 2" HMO premium, up to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the total cost of such premiums from the prior year.
10
Supervisory Nurses Unit - Effective July 8, 2006, the County will establish a MPS, if applicable, in an amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, will equal ninety-five percent (95%) of the lowest cost high option “employee only,” “employee + 1” and “employee + 2” HMO premium, up to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the total cost of such premiums from the prior year.
(3)	All Units, Except Supervisory Nurses Unit - Effective July 7, 2007, the County will establish a MPS, if applicable, in an amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, will equal seventy-five percent (75%) of the lowest cost high option “employee only,” “employee + 1” and “employee + 2” HMO premium, up to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the total cost of such premiums from the prior year.
Supervisory Nurses Unit - Effective July 7, 2007, the County will establish a MPS, if applicable, in an amount that, when combined with the Benefit Plan contributions, will equal ninety-five percent (95%) of the lowest cost high option “employee only,” “employee + 1” and “employee + 2” HMO premium, up to a fifteen percent (15%) increase in the total cost of such premiums from the prior year.
(b)	Effective July 7, 2007, the County will establish a Dental Premium Subsidy (DPS) for all employees whose premium costs for health and dental exceeds the Benefit Plan contributions in an amount up to nine dollars and forty-six cents ($9.46), but not to exceed the combined total of the employee’s out-ofpocket costs. For example, an employee who selects “employee only” coverage for health and dental with a combined per pay period premium cost of one hundred ninety-four dollars ($194.00) will receive a DPS in the amount of four dollars ($4.00) per pay period.

CLASSIFICATION
ALL UNITS
Section 1	- Purpose
Classification review is a management tool to ensure the accurate reflection of tasks and duties involved in each County position for the purpose of recruitment, compensation, and organizational structuring. The County shall notify SBPEA in writing of all classification and salary changes to classifications allocated to this Unit within two (2) working days after such changes have been approved by the Board of Supervisors. Whenever positions are subject to any change as a result of a classification review, such change will be determined by the County, subject to the classification appeal procedure. New and revised classification specifications shall be furnished to SBPEA in a timely manner.
Section 2	- Implementation of Classification Study Results
(a)	Upgradings
An upgrading is the reclassification of a position from one classification to another classification having a higher base salary range. Whenever an incumbent employee is upgraded as a result of such reclassification, pursuant to the Personnel Rules, such employee’s step placement in the new salary range shall be governed by the Article on “Promotions.”
(b)	Downgradings
A downgrading is the reclassification of a position from one classification to another classification having a lower base salary range. When a position is downgraded, the incumbent employee may continue at the same salary rate payment where the salary rate is within the new base salary range. Where an incumbent receives a salary rate payment greater than the maximum of the new base salary range, the Director of Human Resources may authorize continuation of the same salary rate payment to the incumbent employee that the employee received prior to the downgrading of the position by placing the employee on an “X” step, provided that the employee shall receive no future salary rate increases until the salary range maximum of the new classification exceeds the “X” step. In accordance with San
13
Bernardino County Personnel Rule III, Section 6(b), upon request, an employee with regular status occupying a position which has been downgraded shall be placed on an eligibility list for any classification equivalent to his/her former classification for a period of two (2) years. Equivalent classification is hereby defined as one requiring all of the following: (1) the same kind and amount of experience; (2) the same degree of skills, knowledge, and abilities; and (3) a salary level no higher than the employee’s former classification.
(c)	Salary Rate (Equity) Adjustment

(1)	If the employee’s original base rate of pay is less than Step 1 of the newly designated pay range, the employee shall be placed on Step 1 of the new range. The employee shall be eligible to advance to the next step upon completion of 2,080 service hours at the new range and step, in accordance with the requirements of the Merit Advancements Article. Subsequent step advances shall be administered in accordance with the Salary Rates and Step Advancements and Merit Advancements Articles of this Agreement.
(2)	If the employee’s original base rate of pay falls within the newly designated pay range, the employee shall be placed upon the step in the new range that is equivalent to his/her current rate of pay. The employee shall be eligible to advance to the next step upon receiving a satisfactory rating on the employee’s next annual performance evaluation, in accordance with the requirements of the Merit Advancements Article. Subsequent step advances shall be administered in accordance with the Salary Rates and Step Advancements and Merit Advancements Articles of this Agreement.
(3)	Employees who are at their current step for at least 2,080 service hours and receive an overall rating of meets standards on a work performance evaluation covering the 2,080 service hours, shall be placed on the step in the new range that is approximately a five percent (5%) salary increase, not to exceed the maximum step of the new range.
Section 3	- Classification Appeals
In accordance with Personnel Rule III, Section 5, appeals of recommended allocations may be filed by incumbents in positions included in a classification study or by their representative. The burden of proof on any classification appeal rests with the appellant to establish why the recommended allocation is not appropriate. The content of and decision on classification appeals shall be restricted to consideration of the recommended and the requested classification. All classification appeals shall be limited to a discussion of duties and responsibilities performed at the time the position was studied.
Classification appeals are heard by a mediator with classification expertise. The decision of the mediator shall be advisory. If the decision of the mediator has an economic impact, the decision of the mediator shall be in the form of a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors for final action. The mediator shall follow the appeal procedure established by the County and SBPEA, and provide written justification to the aforementioned parties on classification appeal recommendations. An employee/appellant not represented by SBPEA shall be obligated to pay half the total cost for the mediator. Any decisions awarded in those cases where SBPEA does not represent the appellant shall be limited to that singular case and the decision may not be cited as precedent by the County, SBPEA or any other appellant representative in subsequent proceedings.
Step 1 - At the conclusion of the classification study, Human Resources will make a written recommendation to the appointing authority, unless the mediator’s recommendation would have an economic impact. In such cases, the Board of Supervisors would take final action.
Step 2 - The appointing authority will notify position incumbent(s) of study results and the timeframes for filing an appeal.
14

The appeal form should thoroughly explain why the incumbent believes that the allocation is not appropriate and why the requested class is more appropriate. Appeals must be based on the duties performed at the time the position was studied. Changes subsequent to the study will be considered under Personnel Rule III, Section 4(c) upon withdrawal of the appeal.
(b)	An appeal to a non-existent class must clearly show that no existing classification describes the duties and functional responsibilities of the position.
(c)	Disagreements on title of a class, or on the format and wording of class specifications, are not bases for an appeal. Requests for revisions will be presented in writing to Human Resources for review.

(b)	Human Resources staff will respond in writing to the Appeal within fifteen (15) working days. Copies of the response will be sent to all involved parties.
Step 6 - A mandatory prehearing conference will be scheduled within a twenty (20) workday period from the date of Human Resources’ response. Appellants, exclusive employee organization staff representatives, and Human Resources staff will meet and attempt to reach a settlement. At the request of parties involved, additional personnel may attend to offer clarification of job duties performed by the appellants). If no resolution is reached at this conference, the appellant(s) and Human Resources will stipulate the issue(s) in dispute.
Step 7 - Following the prehearing conference, Human Resources staff and the appellant/appellant’s representative will consider the information exchanged. Human Resources may revise its allocation recommendation, and appellant(s) may withdraw appeals.
Step 8 - Any additional supporting documentation must be filed with the mediator by both appellant(s) and Human Resources staff fifteen (15) workdays subsequent to the prehearing conference. Lists of witnesses and all written materials/exhibits that are to be discussed at the hearing must be included in this final brief. All parties will receive copies of these briefs.
Step 9 - All of the aforementioned timeframes may be lengthened or shortened upon the joint concurrence of Human Resources and the employee organization involved.
15
Step 10 - Appeals which have not been resolved through the preceding steps will be forwarded to the mediator.
Step 11 - Appeals presentations will be limited to the incumbent employees or spokespersons elected from the group of appellants, exclusive recognized employee organization staff representatives, and members of Human Resources staff. Witnesses may be heard for the purpose of clarifying technical aspects of job duties.
(a)	Prior to the appeal hearing, the mediator will have reviewed copies of the appeal documentation submitted by both parties.
(b)	Appellants will present arguments first. The burden of proof is with the appellant why the recommended classification allocation is not an appropriate recommendation. Twenty (20) minutes will be allowed for presentation. Time not taken for presentation will be forfeited. Arguments should be centered around why the classification allocation was not appropriate and what classification would be the most appropriate.
(c)	Human Resources staff will present arguments. Twenty (20) minutes will be allowed for presentation of this argument. Time not taken will be forfeited.
(d)	The mediator will have twenty (20) minutes for questions.
Step 12
(a)	Decisions of the mediator will be limited to the class recommended by Human Resources or the class requested by the appellant on the Classification Appeal Form.
(b)	A written decision shall be given within thirty (30) days of the hearing, indicating the basis for the decision.
Step 13 - Following the appeal hearing, the mediator shall forward the written recommendations to Human Resources and the San Bernardino Public Employees’ Association. Both parties will be allowed a two (2) week review period prior to submission of the decision to the Board of Supervisors.
Step 14 - Parties will agree to support the recommendations of the mediator unless there is a failure to act in good faith in implementing the spirit and intent of these procedures.
Step 15 - This procedure shall remain in effect until it is changed through the meet and confer process. Requests for changes to the procedure may be presented at any time.

Employees may have multiple assigned work locations. Mileage allowed is based on the assigned work location for that day. When employees have more than one assigned work location in a standard tour of duty, mileage shall be allowed between assigned work locations.
In no case will mileage be allowed between the employee’s residence and the assigned work location.
(c)	Travel Via Rental Vehicles
Reimbursement will be provided for the cost of a rental vehicle for business purposes if such use is approved by the appointing authority. Rental vehicles are covered for liability and vehicle physical damage under the County’s self-insurance program. Reimbursement will not be provided for the additional costs incurred if any employee purchases additional insurance or signs a Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) when renting a vehicle for County business. Requests for reimbursement for gasoline for rental vehicles must be accompanied by a copy of the rental agreement or rental receipt and gasoline receipt.
(d)	Travel Via Air
When commercial aircraft transportation is approved, the “cost of public carrier” shall mean the cost of air coach class rate including tax and security surcharges.

Section 7	- Meals and Lodging
(a)	Meal and lodging expenses shall not be allowed without prior approval of the appointing authority or designee as necessary for the purpose of conducting County business. Excess charges greater than the amounts listed below in paragraphs (b) and (c) may be authorized under special conditions, such as a convention requirement or in an area of unusually high cost (such as San Francisco Bay area, Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Diego). Original receipts are mandatory to obtain reimbursement for all lodging expenses, and except as provided below for all meal expenses claimed.
(b)	The allowance for lodging is seventy-five dollars ($75.00) plus tax, per night, single, with receipt.

Section 8	- Expense Advances
Advancement of funds for business expenses can be obtained from the Auditor/Controller’s Office through submission of the appropriate form. Advancements shall not exceed the maximum per diem amounts set forth herein. The minimum amount to be advanced is twenty-five dollars ($25.00). Upon return from travel, the employee must submit an expense reimbursement form and all receipts documenting expenses incurred. If the employee does not submit this accounting within fifteen (15) calendar days of return from travel, or prior to termination of County employment, the Auditor/Controller’s Office may recover the amount advanced from the employee’s pay.
Section 9	- County Credit/Debit Cards
The appointing authority may issue a County credit or debit card to an employee and require business expenses be paid for with said card. Further, the County may require that meal and lodging expenses be limited to the maximum amounts listed in Section 7, paragraphs (b) and (c) above. If unauthorized charges are placed on the card, the employee shall be required to reimburse the County. If the employee fails to reimburse the County within fifteen (15) calendar days or prior to separation from County service, the Auditor/Controller’s Office may recover any unauthorized charges from the employee’s pay.

The employee’s contributions to PST Deferred Compensation shall be automatically deducted from employee’s earnings. Maximum total contributions shall be 7.5% of the employee’s maximum covered wages for Social Security purposes. Employees shall enroll in the Plan on forms approved by the Human Resources Division Chief, Employee Benefits & Services. This paragraph shall not apply to any employee who is otherwise covered by the County Retirement System.
The County shall provide the Association, upon its request, a report each quarter of the department, employee name and total hours worked during the year of employees working in an extra-help capacity in SBPEA-represented classifications.
FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT
ALL UNITS
The purpose of this Section 125 Medical Expense Reimbursement Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is to permit eligible employees to make an election to pay for qualifying medical care expenses, as determined by Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), on a pre-tax basis by salary reduction in accordance with Sections 125 and 105(b) of the IRC and regulations issued pursuant thereto. FSA shall be construed to comply with said Code Sections and to meet the requirements of any other applicable provisions of law. FSA exclusions from gross income do not affect compensation for retirement purposes.
FSA will be administered by the County Human Resources Department, Human Resources Chief Employee Benefits and Services Division, consistent with said IRC Sections.
(a)	To be eligible for this benefit, an employee must be in a regular position and regularly scheduled to work forty (40) or more hours per pay period and paid for a minimum of one half plus one of the scheduled hours, be on an approved leave designated as Family Medical Leave Act or on an approved military leave.
(b)	Enrollment in the Plan is limited to the annual open enrollment period or no later than the last day of the pay period following the pay period of becoming eligible. Failure to submit an election agreement within the specified time frame shall result in an election to not participate in the Plan. The FSA Plan year will coincide with the County’s Benefit Plan year.
(c)	Enrollment is required every Plan year. An employee must elect to contribute to FSA through salary reduction on forms approved by the County Human Resources Department, Human Resources Chief Employee Benefits and Services Division.
(d)	Eligible employees may contribute, on a pre-tax basis, a minimum of five dollars ($5.00) and a maximum of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per biweekly pay period to a Flexible Spending Account. An employee election to participate in the Plan shall be irrevocable for the remainder of the Plan year. Once a salary reduction has begun, in no event will changes to elections or discontinuation of contributions be permitted during the Plan year except to the extent permitted under Internal Revenue Service rulings and regulations and with the County’s Plan Document. Examples of eligible mid-year Change in Status events include: marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, death, overage dependent, loss of student status, the employee’s or employee’s spouse’s reduction in work hours, and loss of spouse’s employment. The employee must submit a request for a mid-year Change in Status event within thirty (30) days of the qualifying event. The Human Resources Chief Employee Benefits and Services Division, or designee, will authorize changes provided that the change is made on account of and consistent with an employee’s qualifying Change in Status event.
30
(e)	Pursuant to IRC Section 125, any amounts remaining in an employee’s account at the end of the Plan year must be forfeited. The County will use any forfeited amounts to help defray the Plan’s administrative expenses.
FULL UNDERSTANDING, MODIFICATION AND WAIVER
ALL UNITS
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the full right and adequate opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter within the scope of representation, and that the understandings arrived at after the exercise of that right are set forth in this Agreement. The express provisions of this Agreement for its duration therefore constitute the complete and total contract between the County and SBPEA with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. Any prior or existing Agreement between the parties, whether formal or informal, regarding any such matters are hereby superseded and terminated in their entirety. Therefore, except as provided below, the County and SBPEA for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily waives the right to meet and confer in good faith with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered in this Agreement.
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
ALL UNITS
Section 1	- Purpose
The County and SBPEA fully realize the importance of a viable Grievance Procedure to aid in the resolution of disputes among employees, supervisors, and management. It is recognized that conditions may arise which can create employee dissatisfaction, and that to maintain high employee morale and harmonious relations, an orderly method of processing grievances is necessary. This procedure is intended to establish a systematic means for obtaining answers and decisions regarding employee complaints. This procedure is not intended to be used to effect changes in the terms of this Agreement or those matters not covered by this Agreement. The Board of Supervisors and SBPEA have pledged that their representatives at all levels will extend active, aggressive and continuing efforts to secure prompt disposition of grievances. The initiation of a grievance in good faith by an employee shall not cause any adverse reflection on the employee’s standing with immediate supervisors or loyalty as a County employee.
Section 2	- Definition of a Grievance
A grievance is a disagreement between County management and an employee, group of employees, or SBPEA concerning the interpretation, application, or violation of a specific Article(s) of this Agreement. SBPEA may not independently submit or process a formal grievance, unless it alleges that at least one (1) employee within the Unit has suffered detriment as a result of the aggrieved contract provision.
Section 3	- Jurisdiction
The Director of Human Resources or designee shall have the sole authority within the County structure to provide the official management interpretation or application to any and all provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator has the final authority within the County structure to adjudicate all grievances, as defined or otherwise provided herein. The arbitrator holds no jurisdiction over a grievance where the remedy has been granted.
Section 4	- Exclusions
Any dispute which may arise between parties involving the application, meaning, or interpretation of the Personnel Rules shall be settled by the Civil Service Commission in accordance with the appropriate appeal procedure established in the Personnel Rules except as modified by the parties in this Agreement via Section 11 of this Article. All matters are excluded from this procedure which deal with the “NonDiscrimination” Article; ’’County Management Rights” Article; the project compensation provisions of the
31
“Temporary Performance of Higher Level Duties” Article; federal or state statutes, rules or regulations; or County Charter.
The appeal processes that include the Classification Review Board, the Civil Service Commission, and the Memoranda of Understanding grievance adjudicatory process are mutually exclusive remedy bodies. Accordingly, there shall be no double or multiple requests or appeals for a same case/same set of circumstances where one adjudicatory body has rendered a decision on the same. Decision is to be interpreted as excluding a situation where an adjudicatory body has determined it has no jurisdiction in the matter.
Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or state or federal statute, this Grievance Procedure shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for seeking recourse for any grievance, as defined in Section 2 of this Article.
Section 5	- Representation
Aggrieved employee(s) may represent themselves, or may be represented by an authorized SBPEA employee representative, or by a SBPEA Labor Relations Representative. This representation may commence at any step in the Grievance Procedure. A representative of Human Resources may be in attendance at any step in the Grievance Procedure. The County agrees within reasonable limits to compensate the aggrieved employee(s) for time spent during regularly scheduled hours in the handling of real and prospective grievances.
Section 6	- Consolidation of Grievances
In order to avoid the necessity of processing numerous similar grievances at one time, similar grievances shall be consolidated whenever possible.
Section 7	- Time Limitations and Notification
Time limitations are established to settle a grievance quickly. Time limits may be modified only by agreement of the parties. If at any step of this Grievance Procedure, the grievant is dissatisfied with the decision rendered, it shall be the grievant’s responsibility to initiate the action which submits the grievance to the next level of review within the time limits specified. Failure to submit the grievance within the time limits imposed shall terminate the grievance process and the matter shall be considered resolved. For purposes of this Grievance Procedure, notification to a party may be given either personally, by U.S. mail, telephonically, or via E-mail.
The grievant shall promptly proceed to the next step if a reviewing official does not respond within the time limits specified. A grievance may be entertained or advanced to any step beyond Step 2, Employee Relations Division, if the parties jointly so agree. A copy of such agreements bearing the signature of the parties shall be filed with the Employee Relations Division of Human Resources.
When notice is mailed to an employee, it shall be sent to the employee’s current address of record. Forthe purpose of this procedure, notice by mail shall be deemed to have been completed on the fifth calendar day following deposit of notice with the United States Postal Service, unless the party can establish that notice was not actually received as a result of circumstances beyond the party’s control.
Section 8	- Steps in the Grievance Procedure
The procedures outlined herein constitute the steps necessary to resolve an employee’s grievance. The attempt of settlement of grievances filed on behalf of an individual employee(s) at the employee-supervisor level is required. The grievance must be submitted within fifteen (15) working days after the employee is aware of the conditions precipitating the grievance.
Step 1 - Immediate Supervisor. Initially the employee having a grievance shall on a personal face-to-face basis discuss the complaint with the immediate supervisor. At this step, it is the responsibility of the employee to inform the supervisor that he/she is initiating the grievance process. Within three (3) working days the immediate supervisor shall give the decision to the employee orally.
32
Step 2 - Employee Relations Division. If a mutually acceptable solution has not been reached in Step 1, the grievant shall submit the grievance in writing on appropriate forms supplied by the Employee Relations Division which shall provide a detailed statement of the grievance, including dates, names, and places, applicable Agreement articles, and the specific remedy or action requested. The written grievance shall be filed in triplicate with the Employee Relations Division within ten (10) working days of oral notification of the immediate supervisor’s decision. The Employee Relations Division shall make a determination of whether the grievance is a matter for which the Grievance Procedure is appropriate after consultation with SBPEA. In making such determination, the Employee Relations Division shall determine if: (1) the grievance has been filed in a timely manner; (2) the initial step has been followed; and, (3) if the grievance alleges that a specific Memorandum of Understanding article(s) has been misinterpreted, misapplied, or violated. The determination and notification to the grievant and SBPEA will be made within five (5) working days of receipt of the grievance. Any affected party may appeal this determination directly to an arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of this procedure within five (5) working days following notification by the Employee Relations Division.
Step 3 - Division Level. If the grievance is accepted, the grievant shall submit the written grievance to the division level within five (5) working days of notification of the Employee Relations Division’s determination. The Division/Section Head shall meet with the grievant and thoroughly discuss the grievance. The Division/Section Head shall submit a written response to the grievant within five (5) working days of receipt of the formal grievance from the employee.
Step 4 - Employee Relations Division. If a mutually acceptable solution has not been reached, the grievant shall submit the written grievance to the Employee Relations Division within five (5) working days of the receipt of written response of the Division/Section Head.
Following a review of the grievance with the appointing authority, the Director of Human Resources or designee shall have full and final authority on behalf of the County to mutually resolve the grievance with the employee/employee’s representative within ten (10) working days of receipt of the written grievance of the employee. Such notification shall be rendered in writing to the grievant, SBPEA and the appointing authority.
Step 5 - Pre-Arbitration Process. If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved at Step 4 by the County and the grievant, a written appeal to arbitration must be filed concurrently with the Employee Relations Division and SBPEA within five (5) working days of notification of the decision by the Director of Human Resources or designee. At the same time and upon mutual agreement of the parties, the grievance may advance to mediation in accordance with Section 10 of this Article, while concurrently seeking an arbitrator. The appeal must be presented on the aforementioned grievance form along with a copy of any pertinent documents.
Grievances shall only be advanced to arbitration with the agreement of SBPEA. The cost for hearing all grievances advanced to arbitration shall be split equally between the County Department of the grievant and SBPEA, including any cancellation fee if both parties are mutually responsible, otherwise the party responsible shall pay the entire cancellation fee.
Pre-arbitration conferences are to be mandatory and no grievances shall be forwarded to the arbitration process without the same. Within twenty (20) working days of the approval to advance a grievance to arbitration, both parties are required to meet in such conference with the goal of resolving mutually identified grievance issues. If resolution is not attained, both parties are obligated at that time to jointly or individually declare stipulations, identify witnesses and exchange exhibits that will be carried forward to the arbitration process, the intent being full disclosure by both sides prior to the arbitration process.
Step 6 - Arbitration
The Employee Relations Division and the employee or the SBPEA employee representative shall select an arbitrator by mutual agreement. Where mutual agreement cannot be reached, the parties shall request a list of arbitrators from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service, and mutually select an arbitrator within ten (10) working days of receipt of said list. Where mutual agreement cannot be made, the arbitrator shall be determined following a striking process. The determination as to which party strikes first shall be based on a coin flip. If the last remaining person on the list is not available, the previously stricken person(s) shall be
33
contacted in reverse order until one is available. The parties shall contact the arbitrator to establish a hearing date acceptable to both parties.
(a)	In reaching a decision and award the arbitrator shall limit himself to the allegations contained in the grievance presented in relation to the express provisions of the agreement alleged to have been violated. Further, the arbitrator shall have no authority to amend, change, add to, subtract from, or ignore any provisions of this Agreement. Lastly the arbitrator shall not substitute his judgment for that of the County on matters pertaining to the exercise of managerial discretion except where it can be shown by the grievant/SBPEA that the County abused its discretion.
(b)	The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and transmitted to the parties within thirty (30) calendar days after the close of the hearing. This decision may require an appointing authority or a subordinate to cease and desist from the action, which is the subject of the grievance. The arbitrator may also require the appointing authority to take whatever action is necessary, within the control of the appointing authority, to remedy the grievance or take other action to relieve the loss, if any, to the employee. Under no conditions can the arbitrator order relief that exceeds the relief requested by the grievant and shall be limited to making the grievant whole. In the event the arbitrator determines that monetary relief is an appropriate remedy, he/she shall limit any retroactive award, including interest, to a date that is no earlier than fifteen (15) working days from the date the grievance was filed.
(c)	The arbitrator’s decision shall be transmitted to the Employee Relations Division and SBPEA with a copy to the grievant.
(d)	All grievances shall be treated as confidential and no publicity will be given until the final resolution of the grievance.
(e)	The decision by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties unless there is a financial impact of greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), in which case it shall be subject to approval of the Board of Supervisors. However, in the event an employee is not represented by SBPEA, the decision of the arbitrator shall apply only in the appeal and may not be cited as precedent by either the County or SBPEA in subsequent arbitration proceedings.
(f)	For grievance decision with financial impact of greater than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), the Employee Relations Division will submit the grievance decision to the next practicable meeting of the Board of Supervisors. If the Board of Supervisors fails to act within thirty (30) days following receipt of formal notice of the decision of the arbitrator, it shall become final and binding. A copy of the decision shall be filed with the Employee Relations Division of Human Resources, SBPEA and the grievant.
Section 9	- Unfair Labor Practices/Unit Changes
Unfair labor practice charges as well as unit modification and unit determination disputes shall be adjudicated by the California Public Employment Relations Board.
Section 10	- Mediation
Prior to Step 5 - Pre-Arbitration. The parties (Director of Human Resources or designee and SBPEA) may by mutual agreement utilize mediation for grievances filed under the provisions of this Agreement. Additionally, prior to the Prehearing Conference provided for by the Personnel Rules, the parties (Director of Human Resources or designee and SBPEA) may by mutual agreement utilize mediation for disciplinary appeals accepted for hearing under the Personnel Rules by the Civil Service Commission. The mediation process described in this Section may be invoked only by the two parties identified herein and is expressly an exception to the language contained in Section 5 of this Article.
The parameters of the mediation process, where mutual resolution of the grievance or disciplinary appeal is sought, are as follows:
(a)	The parties (Director of Human Resources or designee and SBPEA) shall exchange in writing the agreement to refer a specific grievance or disciplinary appeal to mediation.
34
(b)	The grievant/appellant shall have the right to be present, represented by SBPEA as the sole, exclusive bargaining agent.
(c)	The grievant/appellant shall have SBPEA as the singular spokesperson and the County a representative from the Human Resources Employee Relations Division, with neither side allowed the presence of an attorney.
(d)	Any written material submitted to the mediator shall be returned to the party providing the material at the conclusion of the mediation meeting.
(e)	The mediation process shall be as follows:
(1)	The mediation meeting shall be an informal process, limited to a one (1) hour presentation for each side, not restricted to the rules of evidence, no retention of a proceedings record.
(2)	The mediator will meet jointly with the parties and separately, if necessary.
(3)	The mediator has no authority to compel resolution of the matter mediated.
(4)	The oral advisory opinion of the mediator shall be given at the conclusion of the meeting and the parties may opt to agree in writing to the opinion, reject the same mutually or singularly and proceed to the next step of the usual process, or remove the matter from the process by mutual agreement.
(5)	The advisory opinion accepted in writing by the two parties does not constitute a precedent and is not admissible as evidence in any future process governed by this Agreement or Personnel Rules.
(f)	Where possible the parties shall utilize the mediation services provided by the California State Mediation and Conciliation Service. In the event that the mediation process would result in fees for service rendered by the State or by use of a private hearing officer, such costs shall be equally divided between the employee’s department and SBPEA.
(g)	The post-mediation process is restricted by the following:
(1)	No person serving in the capacity as a mediator may serve as the hearing officer/arbitrator for the same case should the same be forwarded to arbitration or a Personnel Rules disciplinary hearing.
(2)	No reference to a matter mediated may be utilized in a subsequent arbitration or hearing unless stated in writing at a step prior to the mediation. The penalty for violation of this understanding shall be forfeiture of the hearing or appeal by the party violating the same.
(h)	This procedure may be modified by mutual agreement of both parties.
Section 11	- Disciplinary Hearings
The parties agree that in the cases of “major discipline” (as defined in this Section) brought against an employee or employees represented by SBPEA, the costs for disciplinary hearing to be conducted by a hearing officer per Section X of the Personnel Rules shall be shared equally between the County Department of the appellant(s) and SBPEA when the appellant is represented by SBPEA. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, a case involving major discipline may be heard by the Civil Service Commission.
For the purposes of this Section, “major discipline” includes termination, demotion, or suspension of 30 or more calendar days. For all other disciplinary cases, either party may request the use of a hearing officer with costs to be shared equally. If only one party elects the use of a hearing officer, the party requesting the hearing officer will pay all hearing costs. For all disciplinary cases heard by a hearing officer, the parties shall jointly select a hearing officer from the list of hearing officers approved by the Civil Service Commission and utilize the striking process when a mutual selection of a hearing officer cannot be reached.
The Civil Service Commission shall either accept or reject the hearing officer’s findings and recommendations in its entirety within thirty (30) days of receipt by the Commission. The only basis the Civil
35
Service Commission can use to reject the hearing officer’s decision in its entirety, is for one or more of the following reasons:
(a)	The recommendation was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means.
(b)	There was corruption in the hearing officer.
(c)	The rights of a party were substantially prejudiced by the misconduct of the neutral hearing officer.
(d)	The hearing officer exceeded his/her powers on the matter submitted.
(e)	The rights of a party were substantially prejudiced by the refusal of the hearing officer to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefore, or by the refusal of the hearing officer to properly include or exclude evidence material to the controversy.
Should such be the case, the Commission must state in writing specific reason(s) forthe decision (a, b, c, d or e) and subsequently conduct and complete a full and fair evidentiary hearing on the disciplinary appeal within thirty (30) days of rejecting the hearing officer’s findings and recommendations unless the hearing cannot for good cause be completed within thirty (30) days.
HOURS OF WORK
MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL, SUPERVISORY AND SUPERVISORY NURSES UNITS
Employees shall be required to work during such hours as necessary to carry out the duties of their position, as designated by the appointing authority, and such hours may be varied so long as the work requirements and efficient operations of the County are assured.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the County Administrative Officer may authorize overtime compensation at straight time or time and one-half rates at any time (including retroactively for emergencies as defined in Section 13.022(h) of the County Code) to be paid to any employee in order to carry out the intent of a Board-approved program, to respond to an emergency, or to compensate for hours of work performed above that normally expected of such employee.
Employees in regular positions in these units are considered to be salaried for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). If, as a result of changes in legislation, federal regulations, or court decisions, employees are considered to be non-salaried, the County and SBPEA will meet and confer concerning changes to return the employees to salaried status.
MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL AND SUPERVISORY NURSES UNITS
Deductions from the pay of employees in these units for disciplinary and other reasons shall be made in a manner consistent with FLSA regulations. For example, employees covered by this Article who are disciplined by a suspension without pay shall only receive such suspension in increments of one (1) or more full days. Alternatively, an appointing authority may discipline an employee covered by this Article via a deduction of accrued leave time. The accrued leave time is limited to vacation, holiday, annual or administrative leave. Deductions of accrued leave time may be made in increments of less than one (1) work week. Any disciplinary action imposed under this Article is subject to appeal under the Personnel Rules of San Bernardino County. Employees shall not be disciplined by a reduction in step.

LAYOFF
ALL UNITS
Section 1	- General Provisions
Definition - A layoff is the involuntary separation or reduction of a regular employee to a position in a lower classification without fault of the employee. Layoff applies only to regular positions.

In the event of a tie in total time of continuous County service between two (2) or more employees, the order of layoff shall be determined at the discretion of the appointing authority.
(b)	Before any reduction in the work force of regular employees occurs, all extra-help, recurrent, provisional, probationary, unclassified or other individuals without regular status in the affected classifications within the affected non-group department/group shall be terminated. For purposes of layoff, trainees and most recently hired dual appointments shall be treated the same as probationary employees. Employee status will be determined as of the date the layoff plan is approved by the Director of Human Resources.
(c)	Probationary employees and employees assigned to a vacant higher level position, pursuant to the Temporary Performance of Higher Level Duties Article, who have regular status in another classification, shall be returned to their former classification where they will be subject to layoff under provisions applicable to other employees in that classification. Underfills shall have layoff rights in the underfill classification.
(d)	When a classification has a dual concept or multiple options including extended range, the Director of Human Resources may authorize layoffs by specialty or option within the classification.
(e)	Regular employees whose positions have been deleted shall be allowed to exercise their options, based on seniority, to select either a vacant position or to bump into any one of the filled junior positions within their current classification. An employee who elects not to bump into any position within the collective group of vacant and filled junior positions, thereby retaining his/her existing classification, shall be provided the opportunity to select from those options identified in (i) of this Article.
(f)	If a regular employee whose position is to be deleted does not have sufficient seniority to bump another employee in their current classification within the non-group department/group and has previously held regular status in a lower classification, reduction in classification (bumping) within the affected nongroup department/group shall be approved. Reductions in classification shall first be made to the next lower classification in which the employee has regular status. For purposes of bumping, the number of
38
positions filled by the least senior employees in the affected classification^) equal to the number of employees bumping into the classification shall be identified. Additionally, all vacant positions in the affected classification shall be made available to the affected employees. This collective group of positions shall then be subject to the bumping process.
(g)	In the event a junior employee is bumped pursuant to (e) or (f) above, the junior employee being bumped will be separated or reduced in classification. If the classification to which an eligible employee is first considered for reduction is not authorized in the non-group department/group, or if the employee does not have seniority in that classification, reduction shall then be made to the next lower classification in which the employee has regular status. This procedure shall continue until all reductions in classification and the ultimate separations are completed.
(h)	Employees in unclassified positions do not have a right to bump employees in classified positions. A classified employee may refuse to bump into an unclassified position without waiving the right to bump a more junior employee in the same or lower classification.
(i)	If bumping results in an assignment which the employee considers to be undesirable, such employee may request:
(1)	A voluntary demotion to a vacant position.
(2)	A leave of absence without right to return to work, but placement on an eligible list.
(3)	To voluntarily resign.
Options (1) and (2) require the approval of the Director of Human Resources or designee.
Section 4	- Exception to Order of Layoff
Whenever an appointing authority believes that the best interest of the service requires the retention of an employee with special qualifications, characteristics, and fitness for the work, the appointing authority may request that such employee be exempted from the bumping procedures. Such requests must be in writing and approved by the Director of Human Resources. If approved, SBPEA shall be immediately provided with a copy of the request.
Section 5	- Employee’s Rights While on Layoff
(a)	During the first two (2) years following a layoff, laid-off regular employees or an employee who is reduced in classification as a result of a layoff shall be assured the right of an interview for vacant positions for which they meet certification requirements prior to final selection and appointment to said vacant positions within their previous non-group department/group in the same classification to the one in which the employee has previously held regular status.
(b)	Any regular employee who is laid-off or reduced in classification as a result of a layoff may request that their name be placed on appropriate eligible lists for a period of two (2) years by submitting such a request and an application to the Director of Human Resources for determination of eligibility. Approval of such requests only entails placement on the list and does not guarantee employment or carry any bumping privileges. Placement on the eligible list shall be made pursuant to the provisions for requalification contained in the Personnel Rules.
Section 6	- List Placement and Training
Pursuant to Rule V, Section 3 of the Personnel Rules, the County will make every effort to place laid-off employees, or employees reduced in classification as a result of layoff, on current eligible lists, either related or non-related to their former classification, for which the salary is equivalent or lower and for which they meet the minimum qualifications. When departments hire layoff affected employees for positions non-related to their former job classifications, the department will be encouraged to consider the probationary period fortraining purposes in the non-related field.
39
Section 7	- Reemployment from Layoff
A regular employee who has been laid off from County employment and is subsequently rehired to a regular position within one (1) year shall receive restoration of vacation accrual rate and sick leave in the same manner as described in the Reemployment Article in this Agreement. Restoration of retirement contribution rate shall be in accordance with applicable state law and in compliance with any requirements established by the Retirement Board.

To ensure all necessary and relevant medical information is provided, the County shall make available forms to be completed by the medical provider. It is the responsibility of the employee to provide verbal notice to their appointing authority immediately upon receipt of their medical provider’s authorization to return to work, and no later than 24 hours after receipt of the notice. The appointing authority or designee will schedule an appropriate medical evaluation for the employee with the Center for Employee Health and Wellness prior to the employee’s return to work. The employee shall provide their medical provider’s written notice of authorization to return to work to the Center for Employee Health and Wellness at or prior to the employee’s scheduled appointment time.

(6)	The final decision on the employee’s ability to return to work rests with the medical provider at the Center for Employee Health and Wellness. In the event the employee is not released to return to work by the medical provider at the Center for Employee Health and Wellness, the employee’s status would continue on sick leave or, where there is no balance, leave without pay.
(g)	Workers’ Compensation
(1)	Employees shall receive full salary in lieu of Workers’ Compensation benefits and paid sick leave for the first forty (40) hours following an occupational injury or illness, if authorized off work by order of an accepted physician under the Workers’ Compensation sections of the California Labor Code. Thereafter, accumulated paid leave may be prorated to supplement such temporary disability compensation payments, provided that the total amount shall not exceed the regular

In no event shall any employee, except those receiving a disability retirement, receive compensation under this Section in excess of five hundred (500) hours pay computed at the then current base hourly rate of said employee.
(j)	Perfect Attendance - Employees in regular, full-time positions who do not utilize any sick leave in a calendar year (i.e., pay period 1 through pay period 26 or 27, when applicable, of the same year), and who do not record any sick leave without pay or absent without pay during that year, shall receive a one (1) year’s paid membership in a Human Resources approved health facility or utilization of perfect attendance leave. The paid health facility membership shall not exceed the cost of a one (1) year paid membership at the San Bernardino YMCA. In lieu of a Human Resources approved health facility membership, the employee has the option of utilizing sixteen (16) hours of perfect attendance leave, no cash-out provision, within the time frame of the subsequent calendar year. Failure to utilize perfect attendance leave within the subsequent calendar year shall result in forfeiture of the same.
(k)	Sick Leave Conversion Option (except Management Unit) - Employees who have used less than forty (40) hours of sick leave in a fiscal year (i.e., pay period 15 through pay period 14 of the following year) may, at the employee’s option, convert sick leave to vacation leave by the following formula: Hours of sick leave used are subtracted from forty (40). Sixty percent (60%) of the remainder, or a portion thereof, may be added to vacation leave to be utilized in the same manner as other accrued vacation leave.

No employee shall lose earned vacation leave time because of work urgency. If an employee has reached the maximum allowed unused balance and is unable to take vacation leave because of work urgency, the appointing authority will notify the Auditor/Controller of the situation and approve a waiver of the maximum allowed unused balance fora period not to exceed one (1) thirteen (13) pay period waiver per calendar year.
Written request for vacation leave shall receive a written response from the appointing authority within two (2) weeks of submission. In instances where a vacation leave request has received written, advance approval and is rescinded due to work urgency by the supervisor, that decision may be appealed to the Department Head/Group Administrator for an immediate review. In those instances where the direct supervisor is the Department Head/Group Administrator the rescission due to work urgency may be appealed to the Director of Human Resources for immediate review. In those instances where a financial hardship would occur because pre-approval resulted in prepayment by the employee, a vacation would only be canceled under the most extreme work emergency.

Employees receiving the benefits of Workers’ Compensation or short-term disability insurance leave receive partial replacement of their income through these benefits. Employees on these types of disability leaves may choose to fully integrate, partially integrate, or not integrate personal leave time with these disability payments.
The maximum amount the employee receives from integrating leave time with disability payments shall not exceed 100% of the employee’s base salary. Paid personal leave time coded on the employee’s Time and Labor Report will be limited to the amount of leave necessary to integrate benefits to the level designated by the employee. When the exact amount is not known, a good faith estimate may be made and the amount will be adjusted later as necessary. If any overpayments are made, the employee will be reguired to repay that amount in accordance with the Payroll Adjustments Article. An employee who knowingly receives payment in excess of their regular base salary is reguired to report it to their Departmental payroll clerk.
47
Employees who are fully integrating accrued leave time with disability benefits and have at least forty-one (41) hours of any type of leave time accrued as of the prior pay period shall be eligible to receive full accruals of vacation and sick leave. Employees who are not fully integrating or employees who have less than forty-one (41) hours of any type of leave time accrued shall earn prorated vacation and sick leave accruals based upon paid leave time coded on the Time and Labor Report only.
Employees who are fully integrating paid leave time with disability benefit(s) will be eligible for fixed holiday pay provided that they are on the payroll for the entire pay period, have no unapproved leave for the pay period and have enough leave accrued to equal at least one-half (1/2) of the employee’s normal scheduled hours. Employees who are partially integrating or not integrating paid leave time with disability benefits will be paid for holidays in accordance with the holiday leave provisions in Section 4 of this Article.
Section 6	- Compulsory Leave
If, in the opinion of the appointing authority, employees are unable to perform the duties of their position for physical or psychological reasons, they may be removed from duty without pay or may use accrued paid leave for which they are eligible. In addition, such employees may be required to submit to an examination by either a physician or other competent authority designated by the Director of Human Resources or designee or by their own physician or other practitioner, as appropriate. If the examination report of the competent authority (e.g., physician, appropriate practitioner) shows the employee to be in an unfit condition to perform the duties required of the position, the appointing authority shall have the right to compel such employee to take sufficient leave of absence with or without pay, to transfer to another position without reduction in compensation, and/or follow a prescribed treatment regimen until medically qualified to return to unrestricted duty. An employee who has been removed from duty for physical or psychological reasons by the appointing authority, and the employee was required to submit to an examination, may not return to duty until such time as medical clearance has been obtained.
Section 7	- Military Leave
As provided in the California Military and Veterans Code Section 395 etseq., and any amendment thereto, and the federal Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, a County employee, regular, extra-help, or recurrent may be entitled to the following rights concerning military leave:
(a)	Definition - Military leave is defined as the performance of duty on a voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent authority and includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training (weekend drills), full-time National Guard duty, and a period for which an employee is absent for the purpose of an examination to determine the fitness of the person to perform any such duty.
(b)	Notice and Orders - All employees shall provide advance notice of military service unless military necessity prevents the giving of notice or the giving of notice is impossible or unreasonable. Where available, copy of military orders must accompany the request for leave.
(c)	Temporary Active Duty - Any employee who is a member of the reserve corps of the Armed Forces, National Guard, or Naval Militia shall be entitled to temporary military leave of absence for the purpose of active military training provided that the period of ordered duty does not exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, including time involved in going to and returning from such duty. While on paid status, an employee on temporary military leave shall receive the same vacation, holiday, and sick leave, step advances and benefits that would have been enjoyed had the employee not been absent, providing such employee has been employed by the County for at least one (1) year immediately prior to the date such leave begins.

(d)	Full-Time Active Duty - Employees who resign from their positions to serve in the Armed Forces for more than one hundred eighty (180) days, shall have a right to return to their former classification upon serving written notice to the appointing authority, no later than ninety (90) days after completion of such service. Returning employees are subject to a physical/psychological examination.
Should such employee’s former classification have been abolished, then the employee shall be entitled to a classification of comparable functions, duties, and compensation if such classification exists, or to a comparable vacant position for which the employee is qualified.
The right to return to former classification shall include the right to be restored to such civil service status as the employee would have if the employee had not so resigned; and no other person shall acquire civil service status in the same position so as to deprive such employee of this right to restoration.
Eligible employees are also entitled to the reemployment and benefit rights as further described in the Uniformed Services and Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. Sections 4301-4333. Specifically, a returning employee will receive restoration of original hire and benefit date, salary step, vacation accrual rate, sick leave balance (unless the employee has received payment for unused sick leave in accordance with provisions contained herein), the retirement plan contribution rate and retirement system contributions (provided the employee complies with any requirements established by the Retirement Board). However, such employee will not have accrued vacation, sick leave, or other benefit while absent from County employment, except as provided in the temporary duty provision.

Employees who are called in for a medical examination to determine physical fitness for military duty must also use vacation leave, leave without pay, or make up the time. Employees cannot be required to use their accrued leave. Any employee meeting the requirements in (c) and (d) shall be entitled to receive their regular salary or compensation for the first thirty (30) calendar days of any such leave. Pay for such purposes shall not exceed thirty (30) days in any one fiscal year and shall be paid only for the employee’s regularly scheduled workdays that fall within the thirty (30) calendar days.
(f)	Extension of Benefits - The County recognizes the increased requirements of the military due to the current threats facing the United States of America. Employees who are called to active duty as a result of the activation of military reservists beginning in September 2001, and are eligible to receive the thirty (30) calendar day military leave compensation shall receive the difference between their base County salary and their military salary starting on the 31st calendar day of military leave. The difference in salary shall continue until June 23, 2006. During this period, the County will continue to provide the employee the benefits and all leave accruals as was provided prior to such active duty. Retirement contributions and credit will be granted if the employee had enough pay to cover the entire contribution. If the employee does not get enough pay to cover the retirement contribution, no contribution or credit will be given. If upon return from leave the employee complies with all requirements of the Board of Retirement, then the employee shall also receive the retirement pick-up allowed by the MOU. Employees should note that the Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) plan contains a war exclusion.
If the employee becomes eligible for full County payment for the first thirty (30) days of military leave provided in (c) of this Article, the extended payments provided under this Section shall be suspended and shall be continued after the 30 days compensation has been completed.
After June 23, 2006, no compensation shall be paid beyond the thirty (30) day leave period, unless such compensation is expressly approved by the Board of Supervisors. The County may unilaterally extend the benefits of this subsection upon the approval of the Board of Supervisors.
(g)	Vacation and Military Leave - Employees shall not be permitted to take vacation or other accrued leave in lieu of the military leave provisions provided in Section (c) of the Article. Employees may

(3)	Such written declination cannot be revoked or amended at a later date for a pay period for which the TLR has already been submitted.
(4)	Benefits, leave accruals, and pay will be administered per normal procedures for vacation pay; no additional benefits otherwise granted under this Article will be available.
Employees may elect to use accrued leave time, except sick leave, once all paid benefits have been exhausted.

Assignment and approval of return to work compensation shall be made by the appointing authority or designee based upon the needs of the service.
Section 2	- On-Call Compensation
(a)	This Section shall not apply to employees in the Professional, Supervisory or Supervisory Nurses Units.
(b)	On-call duty requires the employee to return a call or page as soon as practicable but not to exceed thirty (30) minutes.
(c)	Employees assigned to be on-call shall: (1) leave a telephone number where they can be reached or wear a communicating device; and (2) be able to report to their work site within one (1) hour after notification. Employees can also be given a designated time of more than one (1) hour to report by the appointing authority or designee.
(d)	While assigned to on-call duty, the employee shall be free to use the time for his or her own purposes.
(e)	On-call duty shall be compensated at the rate of three dollars and twenty-five cents ($3.25) for each full hour of duty or portion thereof. On-call time shall not count as hours worked.
(f)	The employee shall not receive on-call compensation once the employee begins work.
Section 3	- Standby Compensation

72
Examples of application of this provision for computing overtime:
Employee earning $10.00 per hour works 40 hours in a work period, plus 20 hours of standby.
40 hours x $10.00 (base salary rate)1	=	$400.00
20 hours x $ 6.75 (minimum wage)	=	135.00
$535.00
$535.00 divided by 60 hours worked (regular rate of pay)2= $ 8.92
$8.92 x 1-1/2 (overtime rate) =$13.38
Pay for this week would be:
40 hours x $ 8.92 (regular rate of pay)	=	$356.80
20 hours x $13.38 (overtime rate)	=	$267.60
TOTAL PAY	=	$624.40
1	Base salary rate is defined in Salary Adjustment, Section 2.
^Regular rate of pay is defined within the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act to include all remuneration for employment paid to the employee. When more than one rate of pay is paid for hours worked, the regular rate of pay is calculated using the weighted average of the rates of pay.
(f)	The employee shall not receive standby compensation once the employee begins work.
Section 4	- Call-Back Compensation
(a)	Call-back pay is used when an employee in a regular position returns to active duty and the work site at the request of the appointing authority or designee after said employee has been released from active duty and has left the work site. An employee need not be assigned to on-call or standby duty to receive call-back compensation.
(b)	Call-back compensation shall be paid in the following manner. The employee shall be paid for two (2) hours at one-time the base hourly rate of pay for each call-back occurrence. Said compensation shall be in lieu of any travel time and expense to and from home and the first or last work contact point. All time actually worked shall be considered as time actually worked for purposes of the Article on “Overtime.”
(c)	Employees shall not be eligible for call-back pay in the following situations: (1) special tours of duty scheduled in advance; (2) the employee is called back within two (2) hours of the beginning of a scheduled tour of duty; or (3) the employee is not required to leave home.

Appointments to regular positions of trainees or underfills are exempt from the provisions of this Article.
Assignment Criteria
(a)	For the purposes of this Article, a vacant position is defined as an authorized regular position for which funds have been appropriated and which may be: (1) an unoccupied position due to attrition; (2) a position from which the incumbent is on extended leave of absence; or (3) a new position authorized by the Board of Supervisors. The appointing authority certifies that the employee is assigned and held responsible to fully perform all of the higher level duties without limitation as to difficulty or complexity of assignments or consequence of action. This provision shall not be used to circumvent the merit system of promotion and approval of such a request shall initiate the appropriate recruitment/selection process where applicable.
(b)	Compensation related to project assignments requires the temporary assignment of more difficult duties involving a greater level of skills. Such assignment may be made to allow for employee rotation, enhance upward mobility or to determine the impact of potential operational/organizational changes. The specific, temporary duties must be identified in writing.
Compensation
(a)	Compensation shall be awarded in pay period increments.
(b)	Employees performing the duties of a vacant higher level regular position shall be entitled to a salary rate increase to the higher level for the time actually worked. The amount of the increase shall be determined as if the assignment had been a promotion. The employee shall be eligible for step advances in the higher level position in accordance with the Salary Rate and Step Advancement and Merit Advancement Articles. The employee shall continue to receive benefits associated with his/her pre-assignment occupational Unit. Differentials and other compensation shall be paid only if applicable to the higher level position assignment. Overtime compensation shall be administered according to the
78
FLSA status of the higher level position. Upon assignment to the higher level position, the employee’s service hours for determining salary step in the pre-assignment position shall continue to accrue. Upon completion of assignment, the employee shall be returned to his/her former position classification. If, while on the temporary assignment, the employee’s step due date occurs, the employee shall receive their salary step effective the pay period they are returned to their former classification; provided, however, that the employee received a Work Performance Evaluation of at least “Meets Job Standards” while on the temporary assignment. If the employee was due a step advance while on the temporary assignment and no evaluation has been completed or if the employee was not rated at least “Meets Job Standards,” the employee shall be evaluated within three (3) pay periods of return to former classification, and if rated at least “Meets Job Standards,” the employee shall receive his/her step advance retroactive to the date of return to former classification. Under no circumstances will the step advancement be retroactive beyond the date of the return to former classification. Step placement upon promotion to the same or other higher level position following completion of the temporary assignment will be determined based upon salary rate in the pre-assignment position in accordance with the Promotions Article.
(c)	Project compensation shall be in the form of a specified percentage of the employee’s base pay. The Director of Human Resources or designee will determine the amount in increments of one-half (1/2) percent from a minimum of two and one-half percent (2-1/2%) up to a maximum of seven and one-half percent (7-1/2%). The bonus will be computed at the specified percentage of the current base pay of the employee for each pay period. The bonus shall be considered earnable compensation and shall be considered part of the employee’s regular rate of pay for purposes of calculating overtime, if applicable. Such increases in pay shall not affect the employee’s step advancement in the base range pursuant to the Article on “Salary Rates and Step Advancements.”
Requests for Temporary Performance Compensation may be initiated by the appointing authority or an employee via the appointing authority. The appointing authority and the employee bear mutual responsibility for initiating the compensation request in a timely manner and adhering to the compensation provisions defined in this Article. It is important to obtain Human Resources Department review of the request in advance of the date the employee begins the assignment, because there is no guarantee the request will be approved. Temporary Performance Compensation is to be effective only with the Director of Human Resources written approval, assignment of the greater level of duties, and signed acceptance by the employee. Under no circumstances will Temporary Performance Compensation be granted retroactively.
Requests for Temporary Performance Compensation shall be reviewed by the Director of Human Resources or designee. Denial of compensation due to assignment {Assignment Criteria (c)} shall not be subject to review, appeal, or the Grievance Procedure.
The provisions of this Article shall not be utilized to circumvent the provisions of or provide additional compensation over and above that which may be provided in the Article on “Classification.” The Articles, “Temporary Performance of Higher Level Duties,” and “Classification” are mutually exclusive concepts and as such there shall be no dual or multiple requests and/or appeals, where the latter is applicable for a single situation.

12-HOUR SHIFTS IN CORRECTIONS
TECHNICAL AND INSPECTION UNIT
Section 1	- General
At the request of the parties, the U.S. Department of Labor issued an opinion letter stating that Sheriffs Custody Specialists (SCS) assigned to Corrections are considered eligible for a partial overtime exemption to the Fair Labor Standards Act under Section 207(k). Such exemption permits employees in Corrections to work up to eighty-six (86) hours per 14-day work period at straight (non-overtime) rates.
The parties have met and conferred about the application of this exemption to SCS’s and have agreed to the following conditions for application of 12-hour shift schedules in Corrections. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following provisions shall apply to employees in affected positions.
Section 2	- Affected Positions
The 12-hour shift will apply only to positions and facilities designated by the Sheriff or designee. The Sheriff or designee has the final and binding authority to designate affected positions, and shall assign employees to such positions. In that regard, SBPEA recognizes that certain SCS positions will continue to be scheduled for eight (8) or ten (10) hour work days. No employee has a right to be assigned to a twelve (12) hour position. The Department reserves the right and discretion to assign employees to eight (8), ten (10) or twelve (12) hour positions.
The 12-hour schedule will apply to some of the Sheriff’s Custody Specialist positions (meaning those positions meeting the twenty percent (20%) limitation on nonexempt work as described in 29 CFR part 553.212 of the Fair Labor Standards Act) at West Valley Detention Center, Glen Helen Rehabilitation Center, Central Detention Center or any other Type I facility such as Morongo Station, Barstow Station and Victorville Station. It is not expected to apply to any other positions within Corrections other than those meeting the criteria set herein.
Section 3	- Pay Period
Employees regularly assigned to the 12-hour shift schedule in Corrections will be regularly scheduled to work eighty-four (84) hours in a pay period, comprised of seven (7) 12-hour shifts during the pay period. The pay period will coincide with the County designated schedule, as described in the Standard Tour of Duty Article of this Agreement.
Section 4	- Overtime
Employees regularly assigned to twelve-hour shifts shall receive overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of eighty-four (84) hours in a pay period. Employees regularly assigned to work ten (10) hour shifts shall receive overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a work period.
Section 5	- Scheduling Guidelines
The County reserves the right to schedule and assign staff as necessary to meet the needs of the department. The following scheduling guidelines represent a discussion between the parties, but is not binding:
(a)	Employees will be scheduled to work seven (7) 12-hour shifts during a pay period.
(b)	Employees will (generally) work three (3) days on, four (4) days off, four (4) days on, and three (3) days off.
(c)	There will be four (4) shift teams designated as A.M.-1, A.M.-2, P.M.-1, and P.M.-2.
(d)	The A.M. shift will be from 0730 to 2000 hours. The P.M. shift will be from 1930 to 0800 hours.
85
(e)	There will be a one-half hour briefing at the beginning of the shift and a one-half hour unpaid uninterrupted lunch.
Section 6	- Rest Periods
Employees shall be entitled to rest periods in accordance with the schedule contained herein. Rest periods shall be scheduled in accordance with the requirements of the department, but in no instance shall rest periods be scheduled within one (1) hour of the beginning or ending of a tour of duty or meal period, nor shall such time be accumulative or used to report to work late or leave early. Rest periods shall be considered as time worked. Employees required to work beyond their regular tour of duty shall be granted a ten (10) minute rest period for each two (2) hours of such work.
Regularly Scheduled Tour of Duty	Number and Limit of Rest Period
After 3 hours and through 6 hours	One - 15 Minute Rest Period
After 6 hours and through 8 hours	Two - 15 Minute Rest Periods
After 8 hours and through 10 hours	Two - 20 Minute Rest Periods
After 10 hours	One - 25 Minute Rest Period and One - 20 Minute Rest Period
Section 7	- Overtime Scheduling Guidelines
Regular employees can sign up ahead of time for anticipated scheduled overtime. Such employees shall not be eligible for call back pay. Employees cannot sign up for scheduled overtime on days the employee is already working.
For unscheduled overtime, employees will be able to sign up on a list in the watch commander’s office to volunteer to be called to work on their scheduled days off. Such employees will not be required to be available and accordingly will not be eligible for on-call pay. However, regular employees being called in for unscheduled overtime (even if such employees volunteer for unscheduled overtime), will be compensated accordingly under the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
Generally, overtime will be restricted to thirty-six (36) hours per pay period and a maximum of sixteen (16) hours per day; however, pursuant to facility needs, management reserves the authority to increase the overtime cap per pay period as needed. Employees shall have seven and one-half (7-1/2) hours off prior to working their next shift. The Sheriff continues to reserve the right to require overtime to be worked as necessary, and employees may be assigned to work overtime on a regularly scheduled day off. The department further reserves the right to assign overtime. Matters pertaining to the management and control of overtime shall be governed by applicable provisions of this Agreement.
Section 8	- Leave Accruals
Employees will continue to accrue the same number of hours per year of sick leave, vacation leave, and holiday leave, as specified in the Leave Provisions Article of this Agreement. Accrual rates will not increase as a result of the 12-hour schedule. Employees will be required to use twelve (12) hours of the appropriate leave time if they do not report to work due to illness, vacation, or any other absence. All other provisions of the Leave Provisions Article of this Agreement shall remain in effect. In addition, the notification requirement of employees to call in at least one (1) hour prior to the start of their shift is of significant importance. At a minimum, employees will need to strictly comply with this provision in order for the 12-hour shift to be successful, and accordingly the Sheriff’s Department will enforce it. Similar guidelines need to be followed for any unplanned absence.
Section 9	- Retirement System Contributions
The provisions of this Agreement and applicable law govern retirement contributions. Retirement contributions and benefits are based on the number of hours the employee is regularly scheduled to work. The employees’ regularly scheduled hours will increase from eighty (80) to eighty-four (84). Accordingly, both the employees’ and the County’s required contributions will increase. The amount of the employees’
86
contributions paid by the County will remain the same as provided in the Retirement Systems Contributions Article of this Agreement.
Section 10-Temporary Assignment to 12-Hour Shifts
It may be necessary to temporarily assign an employee to work a 12-hour shift in Corrections. An assignment will be considered temporary if it is expected to last no more than two (2) months. Employees on temporary assignment will continue to be paid under the same provision as all other general employees, i.e., they will receive overtime based on forty (40) hours in a week. Their retirement contributions and benefits will be based on eighty (80) hours in a pay period. They will be required to use leave time in accordance with their regular schedule (typically eight (8) hours per day).
Section 11 - Evaluation of the 12-Hour Shift Schedule
The Sheriff’s Department is committed to making the 12-hour shift schedule work. The Sheriff has the authority to retain the 12-hour shift schedule as described in this Article, or return to the schedule in place prior to implementation of this 12-hour shift schedule.
