COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT PUYALLUP PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 3 PUYALLUP EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE AND ENTERED INTO by and between Puyallup School District No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as the "District") and the Puyallup Education Association, (hereinafter referred to as the "Association" or “PEA”), as follows:
PART I - ADMINISTRATION
ARTICLE 1.	ADMINISTRATION OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.1	Recognition
The District recognizes the Association, an affiliate of the Washington Education Association (WEA), as the sole and exclusive negotiating representative for all regular certificated employees of the District and all regular substitute certificated employees. The term “regular substitute certificated employees” shall mean substitutes who in the previous or current school year worked 20 full consecutive days in the same assignment or 30 full days during the year in various assignments. The term “certificated employees” shall include all certificated personnel regularly employed and under contract by the District or on an approved leave or layoff, excluding all administrative staff. Exclusions for newly created positions shall be reviewed jointly by the District and Association utilizing Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) guidelines or services if required. Although the Association has functions not herein described, the District recognizes that the function of negotiations is exclusively accorded the Association as the representative of certificated employees as is the function of grievance representation.
Unless otherwise noted, the terms “staff,” “certificated staff,” “employee,” and “certificated employee” shall mean employees of the District covered by this bargaining unit and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
Section 1.2	Management Rights
Consistent with the provisions covered in this Agreement or those items which are mandatory topics of negotiations, the District shall have the right to carry out management functions as required.
Section 1.3	Duration
This Agreement shall become effective when ratified and signed by authorized representatives of the District and the Association and may be changed only after written request(s) for amendment by either party and then only by the mutual consent of both parties, with such amendments being arrived at through negotiations and formalized in the same manner as this Agreement.
This Agreement and any amendments hereto shall remain in force until August 31, 2017. Either party shall notify the other party in writing of its intent to amend, modify, or terminate the Agreement not less than 120 days, or more than 150 days, prior to the expiration day of this Agreement.
Section 1.4	Status of the Agreement
Both the District and the Association recognize the need for adherence to rules, regulations, policies, and this Agreement in carrying out their respective functions. In cases where there is a conflict between this Agreement and said rules, regulations, policies, or individual certificated employee's contracts, or the application thereof, this Agreement shall prevail. The Appendices are integral parts of this Agreement and by this reference are incorporated herein.

Section 1.5	Savings Clause
Any part of this Agreement or of its application found to be contrary to law by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction shall be invalid only while contrary, and only to the extent that it is contrary, but such invalidity shall not invalidate any other portion of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is so held to be contrary to law, the Association and the District shall commence negotiations on said provisions to arrive at a valid provision as soon thereafter as reasonably possible.
Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted and/or applied so as to adversely affect current individual salaries and employee benefits or other provisions which have heretofore been recognized, practiced, or accorded by the District.
Section 1.6	Funding
In the event the Legislature substantially reduces Puyallup School District funds or there is any major financial setback to the District (e.g. substantial enrollment decline, elimination of block grants, levy failure, etc.) and recognizing that program changes are a Board decision, the PEA will still have authentic participation and a significant voice in collaborative discussions of potential District budget reductions. If this financial setback occurs, this Agreement shall be subject to reopening for bargaining on the various monetary items included therein.
Section 1.7	Distribution
Copies of this Agreement shall be printed by the District, made available to prospective certificated employees, posted on the District website, and distributed to certificated employees who request a copy within 60 days of contract ratification and Board approval. In addition, 100 copies shall be provided to the Association. Upon hiring, the district shall provide each new certificated employee with a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 1.8	Subcontracting
Bargaining unit work presently held by unit members shall not be contracted to any other employee group or entity unless no bargaining unit member can be found to perform the work, provided that any such position shall be filled for up to one year only, when at such time it shall be posted in accordance with the transfer process.
ARTICLE 2.	ASSOCIATION RIGHTS
Section 2.1	Cooperation
Section 2.1.1	Availability of Information
The Association President shall be furnished, upon request, reasonable and appropriate available data pertinent for use in carrying out the Association's negotiation and representation functions. All parties shall exercise discretion in the utilization of such data.
Section 2.1.2	Labor Management Meetings
Representatives of the Association and the District shall meet regularly during the school year to review and discuss current items of concern or of interest to either party, including this Agreement.
Section 2.1.3	Electronic Communication
All certificated employees, including the Association President, shall be provided with email addresses. The President’s email address shall be made available to all certificated staff and the Association President shall be included on the “All-District” email communications lists. Members of the Association shall be permitted to use the District email communications system to conduct

Association business. District email shall not be used by the Association for the purpose of advocating for specific political action, work stoppage, or other communication use prohibited by law.
Section 2.1.4	Orientation Meetings
An opportunity shall be provided for Association representatives to participate in orientation meetings for new certificated employees including substitutes.
Section 2.1.5	Equipment Use
The District shall honor reasonable requests by the Association for the use of facilities and equipment, the use of in-District mail service, and making bulletin board space available. The Association shall follow proper District procedures in requesting use of resources.
Section 2.1.6	Access
Representatives of the Association shall be permitted to transact Association business on school property and shall follow site check-in/check-out procedures. Such business shall preferably be transacted outside of the student day, but under no condition shall be conducted at times which interfere with normal school operation or interrupt other employees during the performance of their assigned duties.
Section 2.2	Association Leave
In order to provide proper representation of members of the bargaining unit and/or to confer with the District or its representative(s), leave shall be granted by the District according to the provisions of this section. All such leave shall be granted upon request of the Association President. Request for leave shall be submitted in writing as far in advance as possible but never later than three school days before the leave is to take effect unless circumstances prevent earlier notification, in which case a discussion will be held with the Director of Employee Relations. The arrangements for the leave shall be discussed with the Association President. Billing for the leave shall be made to the Association by the District using the following guidelines in accordance with current practices regarding frequency or for purposes as mutually agreed between the Association and the District:
A.	District-scheduled meetings such as grievance processing shall not be billed.
B.	Professional meetings affecting employer/employee relationships shall be billed at the cost of the substitute including the hourly rate, employer FICA costs, Workman's Compensation, and retirement compensation if applicable.
C.	Employee interest activities such as lobbying and Association training sessions shall be billed to provide full reimbursement to the District for salaries and employer costs paid.
D.	The Association shall reimburse the District for leave billed within 75 days of the date of use.
Certificated employees using such leave shall be responsible to provide appropriate preparation and lesson plans as necessary for their substitutes, as well as to provide appropriate follow-up after such leave. Contract provisions for Association Release time and Supplemental Conditions of the Grievance procedure are deemed not to be in conflict with this section.
Section 2.3	Association Released Time
In order to provide proper representation of members of the bargaining unit, the Association President shall be released up to full-time from regular employment to perform Association duties, to conduct Association business, and/or to confer with the District or its representatives. The Association shall request released time, if any, 30 days prior to the end of the semester preceding the one for which the leave is sought, except in cases where such notice is not possible.

If the Association President remains a part-time employee, he/she will receive full salary and benefits as though employed full-time. However, the Puyallup Education Association will reimburse the Puyallup School District for the difference between what the Association President would have received as a parttime employee and the amount the Puyallup School District actually pays in compensations and benefits, except as specified below in items one through four.
If the Association President has full-time release, the District will be reimbursed for all compensation paid by the Puyallup School District during the period of release whether the full-time release is for the entire school year or a portion of a school year. Any additional stipend the president receives, as determined by the Association, shall be paid by the District as extended days and reimbursed by the Association. Compensation that exceeds the highest paid employee in the Association will not be accepted by the Department of Retirement Services.
However, it is agreed the Association President shall be deemed an employee of the District during the period of release and shall not be penalized in regard to salary, seniority, benefits, or rights pertaining to employment. Specifically, the Association President: 1). will accrue leaves as other full-time employees; 2). will be eligible for TRI as approved by the Association; 3). will receive payment for supplemental days at the same rate as other full-time employees as approved by the Association; 4). will be eligible for State Retirement System employer contributions by the District only to the extent the law requires payment by the District during such leave.
The Association President shall have full rights to reinstatement subject to the Layoff/Recall provisions, if applicable, to his/her original job at termination of his/her term of office. If the original position is no longer in existence, the Association President shall be treated as an involuntary transferee with the rights afforded thereto.
Any employee elected or appointed to a position with the Summit UniServ Council requiring release time shall be granted the requested release and will be provided the same rights as identified for the Association President above. Reimbursement for said release time shall be paid to the District by the Summit UniServ Council as appropriate.
Any employee elected or appointed to a full-time position with NEA or WEA requiring full time release time shall be granted the requested release for the length of the term of office and shall be reinstated to a position for which they are qualified. Reimbursement for said release time shall be paid to the District by NEA or WEA as appropriate.
Section 2.4	Payroll Deductions
Section 2.4.1	Dues Deductions
The Association shall have the exclusive right to payroll deduction of dues, assessments, and fees required for membership for those certificated employees represented, provided, that the Association shall present said deductions to the District in one billing which shall change no more than three times per fiscal year, exclusive of the addition or deletion of individuals. Authorization and/or revocation of membership shall be provided to the District on jointly developed forms, authorized and provided to individuals by the Association. In order to be effective, revocation forms shall be returned by individuals to the Association not later than September 11 in order that the Association can deliver said forms to the District by September 12. The District shall continue to provide such deduction service during the period of this Agreement.

Section 3.2	Terms and Definitions
A.	A "grievant" shall mean a certificated employee(s) or the Association.
B.	A "grievance" shall mean a claim by a grievant that there exists a violation, misinterpretation,
or misapplication by the District of a specific provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or any other written agreement between the Association and the District. In the case of a grievance filed by the Association, the Association shall state the specific instance(s) or circumstance(s) which precipitates said grievance.
C.	"Days" shall mean school days during the period September 1 through May 30 and all weekdays during the remainder of the year.
D.	If stipulated "time limits” are not met by the District, the grievant shall have the right to appeal the grievance to the next step. If the stipulated time limits are not met by the grievant, the grievance is deemed satisfied and may not be appealed further. The parties involved may by mutual written agreement modify any time limits contained in the procedure. The District and the Association shall receive copies of such agreements.
Section 3.3	Procedure
The following steps are designed to secure, at the administrative level closest to the grievant, solutions to any grievance which may occur.
Step 1. The District and the Association acknowledge and the parties involved are advised that it is desirable for a certificated employee and the appropriate administrator to resolve problems through free and informal communications. If an employee chooses to meet informally with his/her supervisor, he/she may have a representative join him/her at any grievance meeting. Every effort shall be made to resolve the grievance at this level. An employee must notify his/her immediate supervisor of a grievance within 30 days of his/her knowledge of a disagreement or violation of the contract or the incident will be considered invalid and subject to no further process.
Step 2. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 1 it may be presented as a written grievance by the grievant and/or his/her designated association representative to the appropriate administrator within ten days following the supervisor’s response to the informal meeting. The grievance shall state the fact(s) upon which it is based, the issue involved, any Agreement provisions allegedly violated, and the relief sought. The appropriate administrator shall arrange for a meeting with the grievant through the designated association representative within five days after receipt of the written grievance. The date, time, and location of the meeting shall be mutually agreeable to all parties. Within ten days after the meeting between the parties involved, the appropriate administrator shall provide the grievant and the association representative with a written response. Such response shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
Step 3. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 2, the decision may be appealed to the Superintendent or designated representative within ten days of the receipt of the written response. The Superintendent or designated representative shall arrange for a hearing with the grievant through the association representative within five days of receipt of the written appeal. The hearing date, time, and location shall be mutually agreeable to all parties. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Superintendent or designated representative shall within ten days, provide the grievant and the association representative with a written response. Such response shall include the reason(s) for the decision.

Arbitration:
A.	General. Any grievance which pertains to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other written agreements between the District and the Association may be presented to the Association for submission in binding arbitration if the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition at Step 3. Such request shall be presented in writing to the Association within five days of receipt of the written response at Step 3. If the Association determines that the grievance involves an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication by the District of a specific provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other written agreements, the Association may, by written notice to the Superintendent presented within 15 days after receipt of the request at Step 4, submit the grievance to binding arbitration. If any questions arise as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such questions shall first be ruled on by the arbitrator selected to hear the grievance.
The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to rule on any of the following conditions:
1.	The termination of services or failure to re-employ any provisional employee.
2.	The content of an employee's evaluation or of an administrator's report pursuant to evaluation or probation, except for any procedural requirements which may affect such content.
3.	Any matter involving non-renewal, discharge, or probation, where other remedy is provided by law.
B.	Procedure. The following procedures shall be followed in processing arbitrable grievances.
1.	Within ten days after written notice of submission to binding arbitration, the District and the Association shall seek agreement upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator who will serve. If the District and the Association are unable to agree upon or get commitment to serve from an arbitrator within the ten day period, a request for a list of arbitrators shall be made by the Association to either the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) or the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Upon receipt of the list, the parties shall individually strike the names on the list they find unacceptable, number the remaining names in order of preference, and return the list to the selected agency within ten calendar days. The parties involved and the arbitrator shall be bound by the rules and procedures of the selected agency, except as provided below.
2.	Neither party shall be permitted to assert in the arbitration proceedings any evidence which was not submitted to the other party before the completion of Step 3.
3.	The arbitrator selected shall confer with the Superintendent or designated representative and the Association and hold hearings promptly, and shall issue the decision not later than 30 days from the date of the close of the hearings, or if oral hearings have been waived, then from the date the final statements

and proofs are submitted. The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set forth his findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any decisions which require the commission of an act prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of written agreement between the Association and the District. The decisions of the arbitrator shall be submitted to the District and the Association and shall be final and binding on both parties.
4.	The cost for the service of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, travel and subsistence expenses, and cost of any hearing room shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other costs, including attorney fees, shall be by the party incurring them except as provided herein.
Section 3.4	Representation
A.	The District recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive grievance representative for all certificated employees represented by the Association. The grievant may, at the grievant's option, request the assignment of an Association Representative during formal grievance proceedings. The Association may investigate grievances at any level.
B.	If, in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a group of certificated employees or the Association, or if the grievance involves more than one supervisor or an administrator above the building level, the grievance may be filed at step 2 directly with the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources who will assign the grievance to the appropriate administrator.
C.	The parties involved may include in the proceedings such witnesses as they deem necessary to develop facts relevant to the grievance.
D.	Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any certificated employee having filed a formal grievance to have the problems adjusted without the intervention of the Association provided that: 1). the Association shall be notified of the scheduled meetings; 2). the Association shall be permitted to send a representative to scheduled meetings and may offer an opinion pertinent to the grievance; and 3). the Association shall be notified in writing of the disposition of the grievance. Such notification shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
E.	The Association on its own may continue any grievance filed and later dropped by a grievant, provided that the grievance involves the application or interpretation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or any other agreement between the Association and the District, and the Association exercises this option within ten days.
F.	Resolution of grievance shall be consistent with agreements between the District and the Association, and the grievance procedure shall not be used for the purpose of creating new agreements between the District and the Association.
Section 3.5	Supplemental Conditions
A.	All individuals who might possibly contribute to the acceptable adjustment of a grievance are urged to provide any relevant information that they may have to the grievant or the District at the earliest possible time.

grievance require that a grievant or an Association representative be released from his/her regular assignment, the release shall be without loss of pay or benefits. Substitute costs shall be borne by the District.
E.	All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the participants.
F.	The Association and the District recognize that confidentiality and good faith are key elements to a successful grievance procedure.

PART II - PERSONNEL
ARTICLE 4.	INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
Section 4.1	Rights of Citizenship and Nondiscrimination
Certificated employees shall be entitled to full rights of citizenship as granted to citizens generally. Employees shall not be discriminated against by reason of race, creed, religion, color, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, age, national origin, domicile, bona fide political activity or lack thereof, or the presence of any sensory, mental, or physical disability, except as permitted in accordance with this Agreement or by law, nor shall the position on the salary schedule affect a certificated employee's assignment and/or promotion.
The private and personal life of any certificated employee shall not be within the concern of the Superintendent unless there is actual, probable, or potential adverse effect on the duties and responsibilities of the employee.
Section 4.2	Just Cause
Certificated employees shall not be disciplined for arbitrary or capricious reasons but only for just cause. The District agrees to follow a policy of progressive discipline. Progressive discipline includes: verbal warning, letter of reprimand, suspension without pay, or termination of employment. Warnings shall be documented in the working file. Other forms of discipline shall be placed in the employee’s personnel file. Any disciplinary action taken against a certificated employee shall be appropriate to the behavior which precipitates said action.
Section 4.3	Right to Representation
In accordance with the law, all employees have the right to Association representation at any meeting they reasonably believe could lead to disciplinary action. When an administrator reasonably expects that a meeting may lead to disciplinary action against an employee, the administrator shall advise the employee of his/her right to representation prior to discussing the matter with the employee. All employees have the right to stop any such meeting to obtain such representation. The specific grounds forming the basis for

disciplinary action shall be made available to the certificated employee and to the Association in writing if requested. In the event that an allegation of misconduct is investigated and not supported by the available evidence, such records shall be retained by the District to substantiate that a thorough investigation was conducted and concluded.
Section 4.4	Complaint Procedure
Any complaint or accusation made against a certificated employee which could result in disciplinary action or have an adverse impact on the employee's evaluation will be promptly called to the attention of the employee within 15 school days if consistent with law enforcement practices if applicable. The certificated employee will be told the substance of the complaint/accusation and the source. The possible options for handling said complaint/accusation will be discussed between the certificated employee and the administrator receiving the complaint. Normally, the certificated employee and complainant will be encouraged to attempt to resolve the complaint/accusation informally; however, there may be circumstances where such an approach would not be productive. After the certificated employee has discussed the concern with the administrator receiving the complaint, the employee shall have the right to have an Association representative present at any formal meeting held where the employee and the complainant are in attendance.
Any complaint or accusation not called to the attention of the certificated employee may not be used as the basis for any disciplinary action or adverse evaluation against the certificated employee. A complaint/accusation of which the employee has knowledge may be incorporated into an evaluation provided the reference shall be specific in nature and opportunities to resolve the complaint are verified.
Section 4.5	Administrative Leave
The district may place an employee on paid administrative leave upon receipt of a complaint or allegation of inappropriate behavior by the employee and when the employee’s continued presence in the workplace may threaten or endanger the health, safety, or well being of students or employees, disrupt the educational setting, or interfere with the investigation.
When circumstances allow, the employee shall be notified of the decision to place him/her on administrative leave in a respectful and discrete manner, preferably at the end of the employee’s work day in a private setting.
The employee shall be notified in writing of the specific complaint or allegation to be investigated as soon thereafter as possible. Investigations shall be conducted as quickly as possible. Administrative leave is not considered disciplinary.
ARTICLE 5.	STAFF PROTECTION
Section 5.1	Coverage
All certificated employees shall be covered by the District's liability insurance policy. The District shall make a reasonable effort to protect employees from bodily harm and property damage while carrying out assigned duties.
Section 5.2	Hold Harmless
Providing a certificated employee, at the time an act or omission is complained of, was acting in a reasonable and prudent manner within the scope of his/her employment and/or under the direction of the District, the District shall use the provisions of RCW 28A.320.100 to hold said certificated employee harmless and defend him/her from any financial loss, including reasonable attorney's fees, for legal actions arising from such alleged acts or omissions.

Section 5.3	Worker’s Compensation
Certificated employees covered by Worker's Compensation and State Industrial Insurance laws shall, upon loss of time due to a job-related injury or illness and after establishment of eligibility for such benefits, make a decision regarding use of accumulated regular illness, injury, or emergency leave. Provided further that if the employee has exhausted all sick leave prior to the effective date of the beginning of the Worker's Compensation eligibility, the District will provide up to three additional days of leave or whatever portion thereof is needed. Employees may choose to supplement disability payments from Puget Sound Workers’ Compensation Trust with a proportionate share of accrued leave to equal a normal day of pay, choose to receive a full day of appropriate accrued leave benefits in addition to the disability payment, or receive only disability payments from Puget Sound Workers’ Compensation Trust. The Director of Risk Management will provide an election form when notified of the job-related injury or illness.
A work related illness or injury may run concurrently with FMLA. The Human Resources department must be notified of forthcoming absences as a result of a job related illness or injury. Upon determination of an approved work injury claim, the Human Resources department will determine FMLA eligibility. Upon approval of FMLA eligibility, all related employee absences will be counted toward the employee’s annual twelve week FMLA leave entitlement.
Additionally, the District will pay the medical insurance premiums for the balance of the school year for an employee eligible for Worker's Compensation who has exhausted all sick leave.
Section 5.4	Personal Property Insurance
The District shall provide insurance as specified by State statutes protecting certificated employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment obligations to the District. When certificated employees use personal property in a school-related situation with appropriate safeguards against loss or damage, the District shall provide insurance to protect the property from loss or damage to a maximum of $1,500 total value per individual. Such insurance protection shall apply only to items for which prior approval has been given each year, in writing, by the principal or program director. Items totaling more than $1,500 need prior approval of the Superintendent or designee. Such approval must also be sought each school year and in no case extend beyond the third day after the school year ends.
Section 5.5	Vehicle Damage Insurance
Damage to a vehicle parked in the school setting shall be covered by the individual's insurance policy. All damage due to acts of God are the employee's responsibility. However, when an employee's vehicle is damaged in a school setting by vandalism, which includes a reportable hit-and-run incident, the District will reimburse the amount of the employee’s deductible to a maximum of $1,000. Employees who have vehicles which are not covered by insurance shall receive the same benefit. Damage to an employee's vehicle by the District, or as the result of a District action, will be fully covered per the District’s coverage agreement in force at the time of the incident. Vehicles need not be listed with the principal.
Section 5.6	Assault
Any case of assault arising out of an employment related situation upon a certificated employee shall be promptly reported to the District. The District shall render assistance to the certificated employee in connection with handling of the incident by law enforcement and judicial authorities. If the employee submits a worker’s compensation claim and the claim is approved, the employee may make a request to the Regional Chief Academic Officer to have the first three absence days of the claim restored, if sick leave was charged for the employee for those three days. This paragraph does not apply to civil litigation instituted by the certificated employee.

ARTICLE 6.	TEACHING OF CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES
Any democracy, if it is to remain a democracy, must expect and anticipate change politically, socially and economically. In a democracy, change should come through law and through orderly procedure rather than through revolution and use of force. There are controversial issues inherent in change, which if correct solutions are to be found, must be freely and openly discussed.
Consistent with accepted professional standards and practices, all pupils shall have an opportunity to learn and certificated employees to teach, relevant to the course content, to find facts, to collect factual materials, to organize factual materials, to interpret factual materials, to examine attitudes, to survey prejudices, to note appeals, to rethink assumptions, and to consider what ought to be as well as what is, and to generalize upon the basis of this material.
No certificated employee shall use his/her position to propagandize in the interests of any religious, social, economic, or political creed. The techniques of dealing with controversial issues are the most valuable outcomes of those classes and include an ability to collect information, to refrain from passing judgments before sufficient facts have been secured upon which to base these judgments, to organize materials, to seek relationships, and to draw inferences and conclusions. Every certificated employee shall have the right to express personal views on controversial subjects, as long as other views/perspectives are also presented. No certificated employee shall express personal views at a time or in a manner that would interfere with the achievement of these outcomes, or would condition the thinking of the pupil upon the controversial issues under consideration before that pupil has basic facts.

Section 7.3.1	Open Staffing Season
Generally no earlier than September 1st and no later than May 31st: For these postings, the principals will select the most senior applicant (using District seniority) or interview and recommend from the following qualified applicants:
A.	At least three most senior applicants (using District seniority) defined by the collective bargaining agreement.
B.	Up to three applicants identified by Human Resources as qualified involuntary transfers, unassigned new hires, or leave of absence returnees.
C.	If there are two or fewer qualified applicants from subsections A or B, the interview pool may include the temporary incumbent (the person presently in the position that was filled after the school year began). If there are no qualified applicants from subsections A or B, the interview pool may include qualified external candidates.
If the candidates are nearly equal, the candidate who has greater district seniority will be awarded the position.
Section 7.3.2	Placement Staffing Season
Placement Staffing Season shall be generally no later than June 1st through August 31st. Open positions which have not been filled by June 1st (or an earlier date mutually agreed to by the parties) will be filled by qualified involuntarily transferred employees, any employees returning from leave, and unassigned new hires.

job category have been placed, the parties may agree to close this placement process for that job category prior to August 31st.
During this season, open positions shall first be filled by qualified involuntarily transferred employees and employees returning from leave, then unassigned new hires shall be placed. Placement shall be made based on qualifications, expressed interest of the employee, and State seniority.
After all involuntary transfers and leave return employees are placed (by employment category), open positions and new positions will be filled from the employment recall pool.
Section 7.4	General Staffing Procedures
Section 7.4.1
An employee interested in transferring to an open position must complete a portion of the regular District application process. The Human Resources Department and the Association shall confer to mutually agree on a condensed application process for internal applicants. Employees may indicate their preferred grade levels, assignments, and buildings. This form will be logged in by date and time, which will be certified by the Human Resources Department.
Section 7.4.2
The Human Resources Department will notify the appropriate administrator of the names of the applicants to be interviewed in accordance with Open Staffing Season procedures. Said administrator will establish a process to review and interview the members of the interview pool and will make his or her recommendation for the person to fill the position to the Human Resources Department, however, the administrator may choose to recommend the most senior qualified applicant (using District seniority), in which case the other members of the interview pool will not be interviewed.
Section 7.4.3
The successful applicant for an open position shall have sixteen ESC business hours from receipt of notification to accept or reject the position. Except for employees assigned to positions during placement season, once an employee accepts a position, said employee may not apply for another open position effective that same school year.
Section 7.4.4
When an employee is selected for a position, the Human Resources Department, in consultation with the appropriate administrator and the employee, will establish the beginning date for the position. Positions that are opened after the 5th work day prior to the first day of school will be filled by a long-term substitute or employee on a replacement contract. During open staffing season, the position will be re-posted and filled permanently for the next contract year, unless the position is reduced within the regular staffing process.
Section 7.4.5
All employees who are interviewed for an open position will be notified by the Human Resources Department within five (5) work days after the open position has been filled.
Section 7.4.6	Opening of New Schools
When new schools are opened, the District will select a “Core/Lead Team” and building staff in advance of the reassignment and involuntary transfer process. The parties will collaboratively establish a timeline for the posting of positions and the criteria and requirements for the selection of staff for new schools and notice of involuntary transfers related thereto.

Section 7.4.7	Consensual Transfer
At any time upon agreement by and between the affected administrator(s), one or more employees, the Human Resources Department, and the Association, employees may transfer to a different position for the benefit of the employee, a program, a school, or other District needs.
Section 7.5	Involuntary Transfer
An involuntary transfer shall occur when necessitated by an elimination or reduction in program, declining student enrollment, closure of schools, changes in school boundaries, or reduction in staffing ratio. Involuntary transfer will not be made arbitrarily or capriciously but will be based on staffing, program, or student needs. Involuntary transfer may occur to provide gender diversity in secondary school health and fitness departments in order to provide locker room supervision. Building administrators and program supervisors will begin the involuntary transfer process by asking for volunteers. If the volunteering employee has an evaluation of “does not meet criterion,” the District and Association must agree that the employee may volunteer for involuntary transfer.
The District shall meet with the Association prior to an involuntary transfer. The Association and the District shall annually conduct a meeting for all involuntary transfers in order to review their rights and the process for being placed, and answer questions.
Section 7.5.1
Involuntary transferees will be identified in the following manner:
A.	The District will involuntarily transfer the person with the least State seniority within the staffing category in the building or program, unless another employee in the staffing category volunteers and is qualified to be transferred. Staffing categories are the categories identified in the layoff and recall provision, and world language (by language). Special programs shall include: Library, Elementary Health and Fitness, K-12 Music, Career-Technical Education, STARS, Options/SOS, KITE, Advance, Excel, WRAP, Preschool, Resource, Support Centers, Elementary and Secondary Title I/LAP, AVID, QUEST and PAGE.
Each secondary school may by-pass one employee per school year for involuntary transfer due to the employee’s critical assignment(s) (activities, athletics, or academics) if no other employee assigned to the building is willing and qualified to accept the critical assignment(s).
B.	No later than May 1 of each year, employees who have been identified as involuntary transferees will be notified in writing of their transfer. If the District cannot reasonably calculate its staffing because of the State Legislature's failure to act upon a K-12 budget, the parties to this Agreement will mutually agree to a reasonable extension of the involuntary notification timeline.
C.	If during the fall of the subsequent school year, a school is determined to be overstaffed, the building administrator will identify the involuntary transferee utilizing the aforementioned process. If this occurs, the involuntary transferee will be transferred to a different building or site. If overstaffing at the Kindergarten level necessitates a .5 FTE reduction, and there are no volunteers to transfer, the least senior Kindergarten teacher at the impacted school will be transferred, unless the employee, the Association, and the District arrive at a mutually agreeable alternative solution. For a period of two years following the transfer, the impacted Kindergarten teacher shall have a first right of refusal to any full time open Kindergarten, First or Second grade position available at either of the schools for which they held the split Kindergarten assignment.

D.	Employees who are involuntarily transferred shall have the right to return to their former position (an assignment in the relevant staffing category or school site from which the employee was involuntarily transferred) for a period of two school years from the involuntary transfer. If a position opens within the first 15 school days after the expiration of an employee’s right of return, the employee shall have the right to claim the position when the position is posted at the next open staffing season. It is the employee’s responsibility to monitor the District’s posted positions for which the employee may have return rights and to notify Human Resources that the employee believes he or she has return rights for a position before the position closes. If the employee does not notify Human Resources of his or her return rights or opts to not return to his/her former position the employee’s right to return shall end unless mutually agreed otherwise, due to extenuating circumstances. After such time, the employee will be considered for subsequent openings consistent with the general staffing procedures.
E.	When an involuntary transfer occurs during the school year, up to three days of release time shall be given to the affected teacher in order to complete the move and become oriented to the new building or site. Outside the school year, when an employee is involuntarily transferred from one school to another, the employees will receive up to eight hours of pay at the professional rate in order to complete the move and become oriented to the new building. The District shall provide assistance as needed in moving equipment and materials.
F.	When an employee is involuntarily transferred to a new subject area, grade level, special program or service area, appropriate observations of other employees will be arranged.
G.	In instances where teaching positions within a building are combined or where declining enrollment in separate buildings causes the combining of teaching positions, the principal and the employees involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the employees cannot agree, the employee with the greatest State seniority will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as an involuntary transferee. The aforementioned process will be followed going from the most senior to the least senior employee, until no positions remain. In the case where none of the employees involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be awarded to the employee(s) with the least length of service in the State.
Section 7.5.2
Employees may be transferred involuntarily for valid educational reasons when continuation in the assignment is detrimental to the program and/or employees due to serious conflict between employees or the employee and administration. Such valid educational reasons must be directly related to improving the learning/work environment or improving staff relationships and not for arbitrary or capricious reasons. Before the employee may be involuntarily transferred, the employee shall have been notified of those concerns by his/her immediate supervisor, and shall be provided a reasonable opportunity/time to remediate the problem. The amount of time may vary depending on the situation. (e.g. employee(s) refuses the opportunity to remediate).
Prior to providing notice to the employee of the District’s intention to implement such involuntary transfers above, the District and the Puyallup Education Association will meet and discuss the circumstances of, and necessity for, the proposed transfer.
An Association representative may make a request to the District in writing that an employee be transferred. Such written request shall include the reason(s) for the transfer. The District and the Association will meet and discuss the reasons for the request.

The Superintendent or his/her Designee shall take such action as may be required by statute to non-renew or adversely affect the employment contracts of affected employees. Employees non-renewed are eligible to join the substitute roster and shall receive priority consideration for substitute assignments.
G.	Layoff & Recall Pool.
All certificated employees who are not recommended for retention in accordance with these procedures shall be terminated from employment and placed in a pool for possible reemployment for a period of up to two years.

Individuals returning to work in a certificated position with the District shall be recalled and returned to continuing contract status.
The District may hire new employees only where there is no individual in the layoff pool who meets the certification and qualification criteria specified herein for the available position.
Individuals who obtain additional certification, qualifications, or college preparation while in the layoff pool shall be entitled to update their records with the Human Resources Department. In filling a vacancy, the most recent category eligibility and certification, qualification and college preparation information on file in the Human Resources Department shall be determinative.
An individual in the layoff pool shall have the right to reject one offer of recall. If an individual in the layoff pool rejects a second offer of recall, his/her name shall be removed from the layoff pool and shall constitute forfeiture of all recall rights.
An individual in the layoff pool shall have sixteen ESC work hours to respond following actual notice by telephone, in person, or in writing (including e-mail) of an offer of recall. If the individual fails to respond, his/her name shall be passed over for the position. If the individual fails to respond a second time to an offer of recall, his or her name shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority list for the layoff pool in the relevant categories. The individual is responsible for keeping the Human Resources Department informed of his or her most current contact information and if the individual’s address, telephone number, or e-mail address is no longer valid when the District attempts to offer recall, it shall count as a failure to respond.
ARTICLE 8.	RELEASE FROM CONTRACT
A teacher under contract shall be released from the obligations of the contract upon request under the following conditions:
A.	A letter of resignation must be submitted to the Director of Human Resources.

ARTICLE 9.	SALARY GUIDES
Section 9.1	General
The purpose of the District Salary Schedule shall be to secure new certificated employees who are personally competent and professionally well prepared, encourage the professional growth of certificated employees while in service, and retain the most competent certificated employees in the school system. The salary schedules are presented in Appendix A, and will include all monies distributed from the State Allocation Model (SAM). Stipends and rates of pay provided in this Agreement which are calculated on a factor of base salary in Appendix A shall be calculated utilizing the 2010-11 salary schedule. This provision shall remain in effect until Appendix A exceeds that of the 2010-11 salary schedule.
Section 9.2	Placement on Salary Schedule
All certificated employees will be placed on the negotiated base salary schedule (Schedule A) according to qualifying highest degree, number of credits, and experience as determined by the regulations promulgated by the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction for placement on the State allocation schedule and printed in the “S-275” instructions. ESA staff employed as of 9/1/05 who were granted experience not recognized by these regulations will be placed on Schedule A consistent with the regulations and will receive a supplemental incentive stipend for the difference between that placement and the placement they would obtain based on experience previously granted. Additional years of clinical experience will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will be granted if meeting the District established criteria.
Section 9.3	Salary Deductions and Payments
A.	Salary Deductions for Absences. In case of absence other than those for which paid leave applies, the salary deduction shall be one full day's pay in accordance with the contracted days of employment.
B.	Payment of Salaries. Payment of salaries shall be on the last business day of each month. Upon the certificated employee's appropriate written instructions, warrants/pay stubs shall be held at the Education Service Center to be picked up by the certificated employee. In the absence of such written instruction, or in the event the document being held at the Education Service Center for pickup is not so claimed within a one week period, the document shall be mailed to the certificated employee's address of record.
All employees shall be paid through direct bank deposit. Employees shall complete a direct deposit form and submit it to the Payroll Department within the first five days of hire.
C.	Early Payout. Upon application, certificated employees retiring from the teaching profession shall receive the balance of their salary payments on the June payday during the year in which they leave. The District may elect to pay off any other certificated employee(s) at the time he/she leaves the District. All deductions due for the remainder of the year for which this salary is paid shall be made at this time and appropriately transmitted by the District, along with fringe benefits due for this time period. At the request of the employee, the District shall continue to deduct insurance contributions due for the months of June, July and August, and shall make its normal contribution for those months in the normal manner. Employees should consult a tax accountant to review possible tax implications regarding this section.

D.	Errors in Contract Salaries. Following notification to the employee, errors resulting in over or underpayments shall be corrected on the next month’s payroll. If requested by the employee, the Human Resources Department and the employee will work out a repayment agreement prior to any adjustment to the employee’s pay warrant. In the event an employee is notified of an overpayment prior to receiving said payment, the District may elect to deduct the amount of overpayment from the employee’s next pay warrant.
Section 9.4	Part-Time Contracts
A certificated employee's prorated pay for less than a full year shall be figured in the following manner: use as the numerator the actual number of days that the certificated employee is employed, and as the denominator the actual number of basic contract days in the entire year. This fraction times the annual salary for said certificated employee's position on the salary schedule shall equal their pay for the part of the year employed. Partial day employment pay shall be similarly prorated.
Section 9.5	Supplemental Contracts
When supplemental contract positions are known, these contracts shall be issued to the employee to facilitate the beginning of payment by the end of the October pay period.
For Additional Assignment Schedules, see the Appendices.
Section 9.6	Mid-Contract Increase
In the event the School District receives from the State of Washington more funds for the specific purpose of increasing certificated employee’s salaries and/or benefits than the District has contracted to pay for the given school year, the District shall notify the Association and begin negotiations with the Association on the distribution of such funds for application to the salaries and/or benefits for certificated employees for said year and shall then make such adjustments, including amendments to the individual certificated employees' contracts, if necessary, as soon as practicable.
ARTICLE 10.	INSURANCE BENEFITS
Section 10.1	Benefit Allocation
For all years of this agreement, the District shall allocate the amount identified in the State Appropriations Act (for educational employees) for each full-time certificated employee for mandatory long-term disability insurance, vision, life, and dental insurance, all jointly approved by the District and the Association. Parttime employees will receive a prorated allocation based on their FTE. Job share staff will be eligible to share one benefit allocation on a pro rata basis. The District is solely responsible for paying the HCA premium for retirees.
When a portion of this contribution is applied to a combination of medical insurances, the application shall be first to the mandatory insurances in this Article, then to health insurance up to the amount of the premium.
The allocations identified in this article are dependent on the State both authorizing and providing funding to pay such benefit allocation. If the State fails to authorize and fund the District to the full extent of the allocation stated above, the District shall pass through any State funding actually received.
Section 10.2	Pooling
All unused insurance allocations from the section above shall be pooled for the benefit of bargaining unit members. Funds shall be distributed equally to all employees with out-of-pocket costs for medical

insurance on a dollar for dollar basis until all such funds are fully expended. Part-time employees shall receive a prorated allocation of these pooling dollars based on their FTE.
The pooling calculation shall be made once each year no later than December to apply to the earliest pay period practicable thereafter, and for the following 11 months. Benefit amounts published during the open enrollment period shall reflect out-of-pocket costs with zero pooling assistance.
ARTICLE 11.	TRAVEL, TIME, AND REIMBURSEMENT
Certificated employees shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses of mileage, meals, housing, and registration fees when such employees are on official business.
Section 11.1	Travel Within the District
Reimbursement for travel expenses of certificated employees shall be limited to those cases where work requires regular and frequent travel from school to school and the Director of Human Resources has approved reimbursement. When needed, adjustments will be made to provide reasonable travel time as follows:
1.	For traditionally itinerant employees (librarians, music teachers, elementary PE teachers, ELL teachers, nurses, SLPs, etc.) the first priority is to schedule their work day so that travel time can be accommodated within the work day, along with contractual planning time and lunch break.
2.	If an employee is placed in assignments at more than one site during a work day (a split assignment), and the work schedule cannot be adjusted to accommodate travel, contractual planning time and lunch break, then the addresses of the sites will be entered into the directions function of mapquest.com to establish a standard mileage and time for travel between the two sites. The employee will submit monthly mileage claims based on the number of days during the month that the employee traveled between work sites, using the mapquest.com mileage. Mileage claims shall not be submitted for days the employee was absent or otherwise did not travel between the sites.
3.	The employee will be compensated on a monthly basis, at the per diem rate for that employee, for the time determined by mapquest.com, plus ten minutes, per day that travel was required, as compensation for lost planning time. This compensation will be suspended for leaves of absence, but not for short term absences. In the event the employee is unable to complete the required travel in the time allowed on a substantial and consistent basis, the employee will document actual travel time and request an increase in the time allowed. In the event the employee encounters occasional or seasonal instances when the allotted travel time is insufficient, the employee may log those instances and request at the end of the year that the extra time be balanced against any absences when the employee was compensated for travel time any way. If the balance favors the employee by at least 30 minutes, the employee will be compensated for the difference.
4.	The Director of Human Resources shall approve and coordinate the implementation of the arrangements required by Paragraphs two and three.
5.	Any agreement to pay employees for time spent traveling does not apply to an employee accepting two separate part-time positions or requesting a split assignment. If an employee requests a split assignment, he or she may claim mileage as established by mapquest.com.

Section 11.2	Travel Outside of the District
Prior approval of the District shall be required for reimbursement of certificated employees who travel outside of the District on school business. Direct billing and/or advance payment of travel, registration fees, lodging and subsistence costs may be authorized, provided that advance approval of overnight travel has been approved by the District.
Section 11.3	Reimbursement
Mileage reimbursement shall be paid at the IRS rate. Mileage records shall conform to State Examiner requirements. On forms provided by the principal, meals and mileage shall be listed and receipts for registration fees and lodging attached.
Section 11.4	Employee Travel For Trainings and Meetings
Mileage will be reimbursed for travel between work sites when such travel is required for District directed trainings or meetings. However, if the employee is directed to report to a single, alternate work site and will not be driving between two work sites during one work day, no mileage will be reimbursed. The building administrator must approve such travel in advance. To the extent possible, staff will make efforts to carpool.
ARTICLE 12.	EVALUATION OF CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES
Section 12.1	General
All certificated employees shall be evaluated during each school year in accordance with the procedures and criteria set forth herein. The evaluation of certificated employees is intended to provide a positive attitude by all parties toward the development and improvement of the instructional staff of the District; the written evaluation report shall not be the method used to formally discipline a certificated employee; provided, however, that this is not intended to prevent discussion of disciplinable problems as these affect teaching competency. The evaluation procedure recognizes high levels of teaching performance which have a positive impact on student learning as well as encouraging improvement in specific areas identified through the evaluation of the certificated staff member. The improvement of instructional services available to students is the ultimate objective of the evaluation program and should be effected by an open discussion of strengths and weaknesses. Extenuating circumstances (including but not limited to placement in an unfamiliar content area/grade level or extreme workload/overload situations), shall be acknowledged in evaluation of employee performance.
A copy of the Evaluation Report Form and Evaluation Criteria shall be made available to, and discussed with, certificated employees at the beginning of the school year. Prior to September 30 of each school year, all certificated employees shall be notified of the name of their planned or intended evaluator for that year, provided that the planned or intended evaluator shall not be changed without good cause and that the employee shall be notified of said change within ten school days of the decision to make the change. The planned or intended evaluator shall not be changed after February 1 of each school year unless there are unusual circumstances. In the event of such unusual circumstances, the employee and the administration shall mutually agree upon another evaluator within ten school days.
Section 12.2	Responsibility for Evaluation
Within each school the principal or designee shall be responsible for the evaluation of employees assigned to that school. Within the District, program directors or their designees shall be responsible for the evaluation of employees assigned to those programs.
Certificated employees assigned to more than one school or job shall be evaluated by the principal or designee of one school or by the program director or designee. Such certificated employee may request additional evaluations at other assignments other than those evaluations provided by the District.

Each provisional certificated employee shall be observed in the performance of the work assignment for the purpose of evaluation at least twice during the first year of employment. The first observation shall be made within 90 calendar days of employment and shall be for a total observation of at least 30 minutes.
During each school year, each certificated employee shall be observed for the purpose of evaluation at least twice in the performance of the assigned duties. Both observations shall be for at least 30 minutes, and total observation time for each employee shall not be less than 60 minutes.
In addition to required observations and evaluations, supervisors may make additional observations and evaluations at any time during the school year. If such observations result in potentially negative feedback to the employee, the supervisor will conference with the employee within five working days.
At the request of either the evaluator or employee, a formal observation series shall be preceded by a conference in which observation arrangements and the goals and objectives for the observation are discussed by the employee and the planned or intended evaluator.
Following each formal observation or series of observations there shall be a post-observation conference between the planned or intended evaluator and the certificated employee. The following shall be included in the discussion, as necessary, during this conference:
A.	The goals and objectives of the observation.
B.	The observation.
C.	Specific plans for improvement and supervision, if needed.
Employees shall not be required to complete written questionnaires for a pre or post observation conference. Written lesson plans may be required.
Evaluators may interact with students to gauge their understanding in an unobtrusive and non-disruptive manner. Final conclusions and evaluation ratings shall be based on a range of evidence and the evaluator’s professional analysis of that evidence.
The results of each observation shall be provided to the employee in writing within ten school days of each observation.
Section 12.5	Evaluations
Final written evaluations should be completed 30 days prior to the end of school, particularly for certificated employees who have had significant competency problems that school year, and must be completed ten days prior to the end of the school year for all certificated employees. In any school year, after an evaluator develops concerns regarding the performance of an employee for any evaluative criterion, a conference must occur within ten school days of each required observation. Prior to the preparation of the final written evaluation, any teacher may request an evaluation conference.
All copies of the evaluation form shall be signed by the evaluator and the certificated employee. Signature of the employee does not necessarily imply agreement with the evaluation. The certificated employee may submit signed comments concerning the evaluation report within ten days of receipt of the report and such comments shall be attached to the evaluation report in the personnel file. The original of the evaluation shall be submitted to the Director of Human Resources or designee for review and filing in the personnel file. A second copy shall be provided to the certificated employee and a third copy shall be retained by the

principal or the Director of Human Resources or designee. The Evaluation Conference shall not be used as a disciplinary meeting to issue a formal warning, reprimand, or discipline, provided, however, that this is not intended to prevent discussion or disciplinable problems as these affect teaching competency.
Evaluation statements based on complaints from other data sources shall only be incorporated as per the Complaint Procedure section.
Section 12.5.1	Short Form Evaluation
Notwithstanding the above, as per RCW 28A.405.100. Minimum criteria for the evaluation of certificated employees, including administrators - Procedure - Scope - Penalty.
After an employee has four years of satisfactory evaluation under subsection (1) of this section, a school district may use a short form of evaluation. The short form of evaluation shall include either a thirty-minute observation during the school year with a written summary or a final annual written evaluation based on the criteria in subsection (1) of this section and based on at least two observation periods during the school year, totaling at least sixty minutes without a written summary of such observations being prepared. However, the evaluation process set forth in subsection (1) of this section shall be followed at least once every three years and an employee or evaluator may request that the evaluation process set forth in subsection (1) of this section be conducted in any given school year. The short form evaluation process may not be used as a basis for determining that an employee's work is unsatisfactory under subsection (1) of this section nor as probable cause for nonrenewal of an employee's contract under RCW 28A.405.210.
The above process will be available to building administrators but shall not be used if a staff member prefers the long form process. If an administrator would like to use the short form process, it is agreed that:
A.	Notice of this request will be given to the employee prior to September 30.
B.	No person being evaluated by the process will be rated less than satisfactory.
C.	The same summary form will be used as with the long form, but without narrative.
Section 12.5.2	Professional Growth Option
The District will offer the Professional Growth Option as an evaluation component (See WAC 392192), located in Appendix I.
Section 12.6	Transferred, Resigned or Terminated Employees
If a certificated employee is transferred after October 1 to another position not under the supervisor's jurisdiction, an evaluation shall be made at the time of such transfer, if possible. If an employee resigns or is terminated during the school year, a final evaluation shall be completed prior to his final date of employment, if possible.
Section 12.7	Relationship to the Grievance Procedure
Except for the procedural requirements of the evaluation and probation sections of this Agreement, the content of a certificated employee's evaluation, or of an administrator's report pursuant to the Articles regarding Probation and Personnel Files, shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure. Further, since the contracts of replacement employees expire automatically as per RCW 28A.405.900, procedural errors regarding the evaluations of these employees shall only be subject to Steps 1, 2 and 3 of the Grievance Procedure.

ARTICLE 13.	PROBATION
Section 13.1	General

Section 13.2	Advisory Conference
If the supervisor contemplates recommending that a certificated employee be placed on probation, the supervisor shall confer with the employee prior to making the recommendation and shall:
A.	Review the reasons for the contemplated probation and specify which of the evaluative criteria in Article 12 the employee is failing to demonstrate satisfactorily.
B.	Review the improvements required for the performance to be considered acceptable.
C.	Discuss the specific and reasonable program of improvement being contemplated to recommend to the Superintendent.
The advisory conference may be held at any time. At the request of the employee, Association representation may be present.
The three items above will be provided to the employee in writing prior to the advisory conference and in the same document the employee shall be notified that he/she is entitled to Association representation during the advisory conference. If the decision is still to recommend probation to the Superintendent, the supervisor shall provide to the employee a copy of the written interim evaluation and the recommendation being sent. If the employee wishes to respond to the interim evaluation, the response should be delivered to the Superintendent.
Section 13.3	Establishment of Probationary Period

Section 13.4	Evaluation, Assistance and Recommendation
During the probationary period, the evaluator shall meet with the employee at least twice monthly to supervise, observe, and make a written evaluation of the progress, if any, made by the employee.
The evaluator may authorize one additional certificated employee to evaluate the probationer and to aid the employee in improving his/her areas of deficiency. The evaluator shall discuss such appointment with the probationer. If the assigned probationary duties require absence from a teaching assignment, any necessary substitute shall be paid by the District.
At the conclusion of the probationary period, the principal or director shall complete a written evaluation for each probationary employee and recommend to the Superintendent:
A.	That the certificated employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency to justify the removal of the probationary status, or
B.	That the certificated employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency to justify removal of the probationary status if accompanied by a letter identifying areas where further improvement is required, or
C.	That the certificated employee has not demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency and action should be taken to not renew the employment contract of the certificated employee.
Should the required reports of the certificated employee's probationary progress, if any, contain information not previously made known to the certificated employee, the certificated employee may submit a written statement which shall be appended to such report.
Section 13.5	Action by Superintendent
Following a review of any report submitted pursuant to this Article, the Superintendent shall determine which of the alternative courses of action is proper and shall take appropriate action to implement such determination. Probationary employees shall be notified as soon as possible of the Superintendent's decision regarding the disposition of their probationary status. Following the probationary period and at the Superintendent’s discretion, the Superintendent may remove the employee from his or her assignment and place the employee in an alternative assignment at the same rate of pay and benefits or place the employee on paid leave for the balance of the contract term, provided that the employee’s reassignment shall not displace another employee.
ARTICLE 14.	PERSONNEL FILES
Certificated employees shall, upon reasonable notice, have the right to inspect the contents of their personnel files which would include the building working file, in addition to the personnel file maintained at the Education Service Center. The working file, which may be in print or on a computer, may include evaluation and supporting documentation.
If requested, file materials shall be reproduced for the employee as promptly as feasible, with the employee paying the expense of such reproduction. An Association representative, at the certificated employee's request, may be present in this review. No other individual personnel file will be kept without the employee's knowledge.

The certificated employee shall sign the material to indicate only that he/she has read it and shall have the right to attach their own written comments.
ARTICLE 15.	PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
Section 15.1	Professional Opportunities and Funds
Certificated employees need opportunities for the development of increased competence beyond that which they may attain through the performance of their assigned duties. In light of their impact upon the lives of students and in keeping with the breadth of experience and training which they possess, opportunities need to be especially rich and varied. These opportunities include such activities as visits to other classrooms and other schools, conferences involving other personnel from the District, county, state, region or nation; membership on committees, training in classes and workshops offered within the District; released time and leaves of absence for travel and study; and further training in institutions of higher learning. The District shall encourage such activities.
Professional Funds: Employees shall have $300 in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15, and $375 in 2015-16 and 2016-17 available for the following purpose(s):
A.	To pay for tuition costs or expenses related to attending a workshop/conference on a nonwork day, or to pay for memberships to professional organizations.
B.	For literature subscriptions and journals.
C.	To purchase instructional materials, supplies, or equipment. Said materials or equipment shall be considered property of the employee.
D.	To pay for licensing fees, certification fees, and testing fees.
Such funds shall be provided in a lump sum stipend payable to the employee on the November pay warrant. Employees hired on or after second semester shall be paid half of the professional fund amount identified above.
Section 15.2	National Board Certification
The District will provide support for staff members seeking their National Board Certification. Such support will take the form of:
A.	Payment of the sixty-five dollar ($65.00) application fee.

ARTICLE 16.	LEAVES
It is agreed that employees need to be able to access reasonable amounts of leave to maintain and restore their health and to deal with emergencies and other personally compelling events.
It is also agreed that regular attendance is important to provide students with the optimum learning experience, to balance the workload for all staff, and to enhance the operation of each school.
The District understands that employees have legitimate privacy concerns regarding some circumstances that call for the use of leave, and will work with employees to minimize the disclosure of information.
The Association recognizes that employees must collaborate with their supervisors and the Human Resources Department to ensure that leave is used properly and that District operational needs are efficiently addressed.
Section 16.1	Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave (Sick Leave) for All Certificated Employees
A full time certificated employee shall be allowed 12 days a year for the certificated employee's personal illness, injury, and emergency leave. The 12 days shall be posted to the credit of the employee effective the first day each school year, but shall be reduced proportionately for an employee who fails to complete the first quarter of the school year for any reason other than illness, injury, or emergency. Such leave shall be accumulated from year to year as allowed by law. No deduction from salaries shall be made during these days. Certificated employees working less than a full year shall be allowed sick leave as follows: number of days worked, divided by 180, multiplied by 12. An employee may choose to use such leave to care for his/her children, spouse or partner, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, or children over age 18 with disabilities with a serious health condition as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
The District may inquire regarding an employee’s use of leave under this section after three consecutive days absent from work, when the employee has demonstrated a pattern of leave usage of concern to the District, or when circumstances raise concerns. A medical practitioner’s statement or other verification of absence may be required.
The District will require a medical practitioner’s verification of an employee’s absence and fitness to return to work (with or without restrictions) after five consecutive days absent from work.
An "emergency" is defined as an unforeseen and suddenly precipitated occurrence of a serious nature beyond the control of the certificated employee which threatens the physical well-being or property of the certificated employee or his/her immediate family, and is of such nature that pre-planning is not possible or could not relieve the necessity for the certificated employee's absence. Application for emergency leave shall be made to the Human Resources Department.
Even though a substitute teacher is not called when certain personnel are absent, the regular policies of deductions and sick leave shall be used.
Sick leave shall also apply to disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth and recovery therefrom.
Eligible employees may utilize the FMLA for their own serious health condition. All the provisions of the FMLA shall be extended to employees with work assignments of seven and one half (7.5) or more hours per day and at least 180 days per year who meet all other FMLA eligibility requirements.

Non-VEBA Conversion: Certificated employees may elect an annual conversion of accumulated sick leave in accordance with letter “A” below. Employees may elect a conversion of sick leave upon retirement, separation from service or death for monetary compensation in accordance with letter “B” below. The conversion procedures are as follows:
A.	Annual Conversion: Any certificated employee who at the end of the previous calendar year
shall have accumulated in excess of 60 days of unused sick leave, may convert unused sick leave earned the previous year in excess of the said 60 days to monetary compensation at the rate of 25 percent of the employee's current full-time daily rate of compensation for each full day of eligible sick leave up to 12 days. Any such election shall be made by written notice to Human Resources during the month of January. Any such annual conversion of accumulated sick leave shall be in accordance with law.
B.	Conversion Upon Retirement, Separation from Service or Death: Any certificated employee who shall retire, separate from service or die while employed by the District may elect (personally or by a personal representative, as appropriate) to convert accumulated unused sick leave days to monetary compensation at the rate of 25 percent of the employee's fulltime daily rate of compensation at the time of retirement, separation from service or death for each full day of eligible sick leave up to a maximum of 180 days. Any such conversion of sick leave upon retirement, separation from service or death shall be in accordance with law, including RCW 28A.400.210 and RCW 28A.400.212.
VEBA Conversion: The Association will annually notify the District of its intent to participate in VEBA III. Any such conversion of sick leave annually or upon retirement, separation from service or death shall be in accordance with the law, including Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9).
Section 16.2	Bereavement Leave
The District and the Association understand the deep impact that death can have on an individual and family. Therefore, the following bereavement leave provisions are available to provide employees time off from work to plan and attend a funeral/memorial service and to deal with immediate family matters surrounding a death.
A.	Employees shall be allowed bereavement leave for the death of any relative residing in the
employee's household and/or the following family members: spouse, domestic partner, parent, step-parent, child, step-child, sibling, parent-in-law, child-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece and nephew. Upon request by an employee to the Director of Human Resources, bereavement leave for the death of any other close family member as defined by the employee will be considered on a case by case basis and will not be unreasonably withheld. The number of days of leave, not to exceed five per occasion of death shall be allowed according to the circumstances of each case as determined by the Director of Human Resources. Bereavement leave days need not be used consecutively, but shall normally be used within one month following the death, unless the Director of Employee Relations has authorized an extended usage period. Bereavement leave days are not cumulative or transferable. No deductions from salaries or sick leave shall be made during these days. Additional emergency leave days from the employee’s sick leave may be utilized upon approval from Human Resources.
B.	An employee who has a death of a student in his/her classroom shall be authorized one day of bereavement leave to attend the memorial and/or a funeral service. An employee who has a death of a colleague or a former student may be authorized a half day or one full day of bereavement leave by the District to attend the memorial and/or a funeral service. No deduction from the employee’s salary or sick leave shall be made for this day.

For the death of any individual of personal significance to the employee not listed above, the employee may use up to three days of personal leave or emergency leave if the employee does not have available personal leave or has already received approval to use his/her available personal leave, to attend a funeral/memorial service.
Section 16.3	Personal Leave
Employees shall be allowed four days of personal leave for important compelling personal matters, including family illness not otherwise covered by sick leave. This leave shall not be used for conducting income producing business and shall not be used for a strike against the Puyallup School District. Personal leave shall not be used on the following “blocked” days: State funded professional development days, Supplemental Days, snow make-up days, the WSPA career fair day, or during the first or last five days of school. Additionally, if a Principal confirms an employee’s presence is required for End of Course Exam days, High School Proficiency Exam days, or Measurement of Student Progress testing days, the employee may not use Personal Leave on such days. Personal Leave approved prior to notification of the testing schedule shall be honored. An employee may request special consideration for personal leave to be granted during the blocked days for personally compelling reasons.
The District shall grant personal leave in the order the requests are received provided the requests are made in compliance with the above conditions. On the day before or after a holiday or vacation period, only 20 personal leave requests shall be honored. On Fridays, only 20 personal leave requests shall be honored. On all other work days, a maximum of 45 personal leave requests shall be honored. Employees may request personal leave days as early as one year in advance. If an employee does not have the requested number of personal leave days to use at the time the leave is to be taken, the absence days will be denied and leave without pay will not be available.
A maximum of three personal leave days may be carried into the following school year, to a maximum accumulated of ten days. A maximum of five days, excluding family illness or bereavement days, may be used in any one school year, unless additional use is approved by the Director of Employee Relations.
Employees may receive monetary compensation at per diem for three of their unused personal leave days. A request for monetary compensation must be made by June 1 on a form provided by the Human Resources Office. Upon notice of retirement to Human Resources by March 1, an employee may cash out up to five additional days of Personal Leave at per diem.
Two days of unused personal leave may be shared with other employees at the option of the individual employee. Employee’s may not donate or receive more than two days of personal leave per school year. Employees who choose to share personal leave must complete the Personal Leave Sharing Authorization Form before transferring leave to another employee.
Section 16.4	Family and Medical Leave (FMLA)
In accordance with the FMLA, full time certificated employees (employees who work at least seven and one half (7.5) hours per day and at least 180 days per year), who have also worked for the District at least one year in the preceding year shall be entitled to 12 work weeks of unpaid FMLA leave during any 12 month period for the following:
1.	To care for a newborn or adopted child of the employee who is under the age of 18 at the time of placement for adoption, or a newly-placed foster child;

FMLA shall run concurrently with all applicable paid leave time available to the employee.
Leave taken for newborn or adopted child care shall be completed within one year after the date of birth or placement for adoption. FMLA leave authorized under this policy must be taken full time and consecutively unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Human Resources Department or where intermittent or reduced leave is medically necessary. Instructional staff may not take reduced or intermittent leave without the approval of the Director of Employee Relations. An instructional employee may be transferred to an alternative equivalent position that would accommodate reduced or intermittent leave, if such a position is available.
The District will continue to pay its portion of the employee’s medical and dental benefit during approved FMLA leave.
If both parents of a newborn or newly adopted child are employed by the school district, they shall be entitled to a total of 12 work weeks of Family Leave during any 12 month period, and leave shall be granted to only one parent at a time. There is no pooling in effect for spouses if the FMLA leave is related to a serious health condition.
The Human Resources Department shall require written verification from the employee's health care provider.
The District may obtain the opinion of a second health care provider, at District expense, concerning any information pertinent to the employee's leave request. If the opinions of the health care providers differ on any matter determinative of the employee's eligibility for FMLA leave, the two health care providers shall select a third provider, whose opinion, obtained at the employer's expense, shall be conclusive.
Return to Work. Any employee returning from an authorized FMLA leave within 12 work weeks, shall be entitled to the same position held by the employee when the leave commenced, or to a position with equivalent benefits and pay.
Reinstatement of an employee returning from FMLA leave need not occur if: a). the specific job is eliminated by a bona fide restructuring, or a reduction-in-force resulting from lack of funds or lack of work, b). an employee on leave takes a position with another employer outside the home, or c). the employee fails to provide the required notice of intent to take leave or fails to return on the established ending date of leave. If an employee fails to return from leave for a reason other than the employee’s death, the District may recover the costs of the employee's health benefits paid during the leave. Instructional staff may be required to delay their return from family leave to the beginning of the next semester under the following circumstances:
1.	The employee began leave five or more weeks before the end of the semester, the leave is for more than three weeks, and the employee would otherwise return to work within three weeks of the end of the semester.
2.	The employee began family leave (except for a personal health condition) less than five weeks before the end of the semester, the leave is for more than two weeks, and the employee would otherwise return to work within two weeks of the end of the semester.
3.	The employee began family leave (except for a personal health condition) three or fewer weeks before the end of the semester and the period of leave is more than five working days.

Section 16.5	Long-Term General Leave
Employees requesting a long-term general leave of absence for the following school year must normally do so on or before March 1. Employees requesting a long-term general leave of absence for the following semester must do so by March 1 (for first semester of the following school year) or December 1 (for second semester). The District cannot always grant a long-term leave of absence as there is no certainty of a vacancy to make room for the employee when returning. The Director of Human Resources, however, will consider such cases individually and may grant a long-term leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed one calendar year. Leave may be granted beyond one calendar year under special circumstances if approved by the District. A certificated employee granted such leave shall be guaranteed reemployment by the District at the conclusion of said leave, consistent with the contract provision regarding Layoff and Recall. The returning employee will not necessarily be assigned to the identical position occupied before the leave, but will be reinstated to a certificated position equivalent in duties and salary to that held at the time the leave of absence began. Such reinstatement is contingent upon the availability of such a position. A salary increment shall not be given for the year during which the leave of absence is taken unless the individual is engaged in a District approved teaching assignment, or has been drafted into the United States Armed Services. A long-term leave of absence shall generally not be granted to an employee until completion of three years of experience. General Leave may run concurrently with any FMLA leave taken, depending on the nature of the long-term leave. While on an approved long-term general leave, an employee’s benefits, accrual of benefits and accrual of seniority shall continue as indicated in the section titled Benefits While on Leave.
Section 16.6	Short-Term General Leaves of an Extraordinary Nature
Application for unpaid, short-term general leaves shall be made to the Director of Human Resources. Such leaves may be approved at the discretion of the Director of Human Resources, and may include, but not be limited to, personal business of an urgent nature involving possible loss of money or property, or severe hardship to self or the immediate family, or for extraordinary personal reasons after the employee’s discretionary leave has been exhausted. Short-term general leaves of absence are intended for extraordinary or unexpected situations and shall not normally exceed three months. If applicable, short-term general leaves of absence will be deducted from the employee’s accumulated sick leave. Short-term general leaves may run concurrently with any FMLA leave taken, depending on the nature of the long-term leave.
Section 16.7	Pregnancy Disability/Adoption/Parental Leave
16.7.1	Pregnancy Disability Leave
A pregnancy disability leave of absence shall be granted to a female certificated employee upon her request for the period of temporary disability and as verified in writing by her personal physician or licensed health care provider. Pregnancy disability leave shall be a leave with compensation during the temporary disability within the limitations of the sick leave provision.
The certificated employee who becomes pregnant shall notify her immediate supervisor and Human Resources of the condition by the beginning of the fifth (5th) month of pregnancy, or, if beyond the fifth (5th) month, at the earliest time the condition is confirmed by her personal physician or licensed health care provider. At that time she shall indicate in writing to her immediate supervisor and the Director of Human Resources whether she plans to:
1.	Take pregnancy disability leave only for time of temporary disability;
2.	Take FMLA leave for a period of up to 12 weeks including the period of pregnancy
disability, if eligible. The District will extend the employee’s health benefits during any period of unpaid FMLA leave;

3.	Request a combination of #1 and #2;
4.	Request a general leave to care for the child. If an employee is eligible for FMLA leave and has leave remaining, the general leave would include any leave available under the FMLA;
5.	Terminate her employment.
The pregnancy disability leave shall begin at a time determined suitable by the certificated employee and as verified in writing by her personal physician or licensed health care provider, after consultation with her immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department. The official date of leave shall not begin until the school day following the day she leaves the job. Pregnancy Disability Leave, including time taken as FMLA leave and/or general leave to care for a newborn child shall not exceed one year.
Assignment upon return from the pregnancy disability leave shall be guaranteed and shall be into the certificated employee's former position. She shall retain all rights, seniority and benefits commonly afforded certificated employees on leave, including those under the Continuing Contract Law.
Before returning in her contracted duties, the certificated employee's personal physician or licensed health care provider shall certify that the certificated employee is in good health and ready to resume her contracted duties. After receiving certification to return to work from her personal physician or licensed health care provider, the certificated employee shall return to her contracted duties at a time which she and the Director of Human Resources deem appropriate.
16.7.2	Adoption/Parental Leave
A certificated employee shall be allowed a maximum of three days leave with pay for purposes of gaining custody of an adopted child and/or transacting the legal requirements necessary in the adoption process. A maximum of two additional days at the cost to the District of a substitute being deducted from the employee's salary shall be allowed. Adoption leave without pay shall be granted pursuant to the provisions of the General Leave section for the adoption of a child. It shall run concurrently with any FMLA leave for which the certificated employee is eligible. The certificated employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department as soon as possible of his/her intention to take adoption leave and his/her planned time for adoption. Leave shall then begin on the first school day after custody of the child is obtained provided, however, that this beginning date may be extended by the District, if needed, to obtain a satisfactory replacement. All conditions pertaining to his/her return to his/her contracted duties are the same as the above provisos for pregnancy disability leave except that the certification of his/her personal physician or licensed health care provider shall not be required at any time and that the position returned to may be a comparable.
Extension of pregnancy disability or adoption leave to the beginning of the certificated employee's next normal contract year shall be mutually reviewed by the District and the certificated employee if the leave period expires after the beginning of the fourth quarter of a school year.
In addition to any other leaves, within the first year of a child’s birth to, or placement with, an employee, such employee shall be allowed three days of parental leave with pay. As well, two additional days may be taken upon agreement by the employee to reimburse the District for the cost of a substitute.
Eligible employees may utilize the FMLA leave to care for their newborn or newly adopted child. All the provisions of the FMLA shall be extended to employees with work assignments of seven and

Section 16.8	Leave Sharing
16.8.1	Receiving Shared Leave
An employee is eligible to receive donated leave if any of the following are true:
A. The employee requesting shared leave suffers from, or has a relative or household member suffering from, an extraordinary or severe illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition which has caused, or is likely to cause, the employee to:
1.	Go on leave-without-pay status; or
2.	Terminate his/her employment.
B.	The employee’s absence and the use of shared leave are justified;
C.	The employee has depleted, or will shortly deplete, his/her annual leave and sick
leave reserves;
D.	The employee has been called to service in the uniformed services;
E.	A state of emergency has been declared anywhere within the United States by the Federal or State government, and the employee’s volunteer service has been accepted by either a governmental agency or to a nonprofit organization involved in humanitarian relief in the devastated area;
F.	The employee is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking;
G.	The employee has abided by District rules regarding sick leave use; and
H.	If the employee is later found to be eligible for industrial insurance benefits, the employee agrees to and shall reimburse the District for the time loss compensation that is paid to him/her to the extent that the employee is paid time loss compensation (temporary total disability compensation or loss of earning power compensation) and shared sick leave for the same day(s). An employee shall not use shared sick leave or donated leave to supplement the difference between time loss compensation and either net or full wages. If an employee has already received shared sick leave and is later found to be eligible to receive industrial insurance benefits, the remaining difference between shared leave minus the industrial insurance benefit shall be deducted from the employee’s sick leave balance, even if it results in a negative balance.
The Director of Human Resources shall determine the amount of leave, if any, which an employee may receive under this policy. Normally an employee shall not receive more leave than the number of contracted days remaining in the current school year. However, in the event that the condition requiring the employee's absence continues beyond the current school year, the employee shall not receive a total of more than 522 days of shared leave accept as noted in RCW 41.04.665.
Section 16.8.2 Donating Shared Leave

A.	A staff member may not request a transfer that would result in an accrued sick leave balance of fewer than 176 hours of sick leave. “Sick Leave” means leave for illness, injury or emergencies of extraordinary or severe nature pursuant to RCW 28A.400.300.
B.	Employees may request interagency leave sharing in accordance with the law and on a cost-neutral basis to the District. Requests shall be made to the Superintendent for consideration on a case by case basis.
The donation of leave is totally voluntary. No employee shall be coerced, threatened, intimidated or financially induced into donating leave.
The number of leave days transferred shall not exceed the amount authorized by the donating staff member.
Leave transferred is based upon the current salary rate of the person receiving the leave. The receiving staff member will continue to be paid his/her regular rate while on shared leave. For example, if a staff member earning $20.00 an hour donates one day of leave to someone earning $10.00 an hour, the recipient would get two days of sick leave. However, if the $10.00 an hour employee donates one day to the $20.00 an hour employee, the higher paid employee would receive one-half day of leave.
Any leave transferred under this policy which remains unused shall be returned at its original value to the staff member who donated the leave.
Section 16.9	Jury Duty, Subpoena
Leave with pay shall be allowed for jury duty.
Leave with pay shall be granted a subpoenaed employee while appearing as a witness in court or in an administrative hearing in which the employee is not a party in interest, or if such appearance is related to the employee's District responsibility.
Section 16.10	Public and Military Service Leave
A.	Civic Service. Certificated employees shall be encouraged to take an active part in civic organizations. Such activity, however, should be outside of the regular school hours. Certificated employees who are called upon occasionally to take regular school time for club or community service may do so with prior approval of their immediate administrator.
B.	Political Leave. Subject to the conclusion of mutually satisfactory arrangements between the District and certificated employee, the District shall grant an unpaid leave of absence to such an employee for the purpose of serving in an elective or appointive public office or of campaigning for such an office. Upon conclusion of such public service leave, the employee shall be restored to his/her former position, or if this position is not available, to a substantially equivalent position.
C.	Military Leave. Certificated employees shall be authorized to participate in military service, and the District will allow leave for the same as provided in WAC 251-22-170.

Section 16.11	Fringe Benefits While on Leave
Certificated employees on non-compensated leave may, at said employee's option, be continued in any fringe benefit programs of the District, provided said certificated employee reimburses the cost of the programs to the District in advance by the first of each month. Certificated employees on compensated leave shall receive all fringe benefits for which they are eligible.
While on an approved leave, an employee will retain accrued sick leave, personal leave and seniority rights. However, sick leave, personal leave and seniority shall not accrue while the employee is on a leave of absence.
Section 16.12	Religious Observance
In accordance with Federal and State law, the District shall reasonably accommodate employees whose religious affiliation mandates religious obligations that prevent them from working by granting unpaid leave. Employees may also use accrued personal leave or emergency leave for such obligations.
ARTICLE 17.	CALENDAR
Section 17.1 Calendar
The parties will schedule spring break so that the State required assessments do not occur the week following spring break, if possible. In the event of a change in vacation breaks of an approved calendar, and in recognition that this change may result in some employees being unable to obtain refunds for previously planned travel, the District agrees to provide 1-5 days of substitute coverage for up to 20 employees for the previously scheduled break, on a first come, first serve basis (this provision does not apply to designated snow make-up days). The District shall provide notice of this opportunity to all certificated staff via email and bulletin boards. Employees who are absent under this agreement during the previously scheduled break must agree to work the number of days they were absent during the new break. The District will arrange activities designed to promote the Strategic Directions for these employees to work on during this time.
The normal student calendar shall be developed using the following formulas for key dates. If calendar anomalies occur in any given year, the parties will discuss alternatives. Each year, no later than October 1st, the student calendar shall be finalized for the following year.
1.	First Day of School. The first Thursday in September, or the Wednesday after Labor Day, whichever is earlier.
2.	State In-Service Day. As recognized by the State (typically the second Friday in October).
3.	Winter Break. At least ten week-days, ending after New Year’s Day. If New Year’s Day falls
or is observed on a Monday, students will return to school on the next day (Tuesday).
4.	Mid-winter Break. President’s Day and the preceding Friday.
5.	Spring Break. Five days, scheduled up on mutual agreement of the District and Association.
6.	Snow Make-up Days. At least three snow days shall be scheduled, including the Friday before
Memorial Day in May, and the first two days following the last day of school in June. Additional snow make-up days may be added in June as necessary.

8.	Supplemental Days. To be scheduled through the regular calendar setting process in labor management between the District and Association.
9.	Furlough Day. In recognition of the State’s 1.9% reduction of funding for certificated employees, beginning with the 2012-13 school year, the Additional TRI pay for all employees shall be 1.711% which reflects the value of a half-day (or equivalent for less than 1.0 FTE employees) unpaid furlough, to be observed on the day before winter break in 2012-13 and observed on the day before Thanksgiving for all other years of this agreement.
10.	State Waiver Days. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, the District and Association agree to apply for two State Waiver Days annually to be used for District-directed professional development to enhance student learning and achievement. In any year, if waiver days are not approved by the State, the District and Association shall discuss implications to the student calendar and employee work year.
11.	State Funding. Over the term of the contract, the parties agree to monitor changes in State
education funding and other available resources, in an effort to phase out the half day furlough and State waiver day requirements.
12.	Student Learning and Conference Release Days. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, students will be released 150 minutes early on the following days, used for student learning and conferencing work:
a.	October - three consecutive days for conferences
b.	November - one day for student learning
c.	January - one day for student learning
d.	March - two consecutive days for conferences, and one day for student learning

The length of the regular certificated employee work year shall be one hundred eighty (180) days plus any State provided additional days.
Section 18.2	Responsibility Contract
A.	The District and Association agree and affirm the following beliefs: 1). the success of the Puyallup School District is dependent upon hiring and retaining the highest quality teachers; 2). providing a quality education for students requires from teachers a commitment to the profession beyond the base contract, normal workday hours and school year; 3).

allows additional compensation for additional time, additional responsibilities or incentives (TRI); 4). the additional commitment required of Puyallup's teachers cannot be accurately measured in hours or days; and 5). the time necessary to fulfill any one teacher’s responsibilities will vary from that of another teacher as determined by the individual’s own professional judgment.
B.	Each employee will be issued a supplemental contract in recognition of these additional responsibilities and as an incentive to provide the additional services.
C.	The supplemental contract recognizes that employees will provide a professionally responsible level of service in the following areas which are above the basic contract:

Section 18.5.1	Purpose
For as long as the State shall fund them, in addition to the base contract year of 180 days, there shall be State Funded Professional Development Days, whose purpose it is to provide time for instructional and ESA staff to work with administrators. All employees will be required to work these days and will be paid for 7.5 hours on such days regardless of their FTE. If an employee is sick, he/she may use sick leave and must call in their absence to the Principal/program administrator and the substitute office automated attendance system. In addition, the employee shall contact the Principal/program administrator for missed content and/or assignments.
Section 18.5.2	Definitions
A State Funded Professional Development Day is a scheduled workday (or two half days) other than one of the 180 base contract days.
ARTICLE 19.	LENGTH OF WORK DAY
Section 19.1	Contracted Day
The normal contracted day shall be defined as the period from the required arrival time to the permitted departure time and shall consist of seven and one half (7.5) hours. Included in the normal contracted day are the required half hour on duty before and after the student school day for student/patron time, the Revised Code of Washington required half hour duty free lunch period, and the planning periods or release time wherever in force. In 2012-13, Elementary student/patron time at the end of the school day shall be thirty (30) minutes. Beginning in 2013-14, Elementary student/patron time at the end of the school day shall be 25 minutes. If, in future years, the District and Association have agreed to eliminate the furlough half day and State waiver days pursuant to the Calendar Article, elementary afternoon student/patron time will be restored to 30 minutes.
Section 19.2	Payment for Work Beyond Contracted Day
A.	Assigned supervision of student activities outside the 7.5 hour day not compensated on the Additional Assignment Schedule, or from activity stipends, will be compensated at the activity rate which shall be equal to half the professional hourly rate (item C below) or on a per event basis agreeable to the employee. Any such supervision shall be at the discretion of the employee and purely optional.
f)	Elementary staff who are responsible or requested to return to school for a school program will receive the full professional hourly rate.
C.	Except for the monthly staff meeting, certificated non-administrative staff will receive the professional hourly rate for building level and district level meetings they are asked to attend outside the 7.5 hour work day.
D.	The professional hourly rate to be paid per each half hour completed or each half class period "covered" will be .097% of the base salary (BA - 0 Step) of the non-administrative certificated salary schedule.

If the presentation is during the work day the employee will be paid for the preparation time only.
F.	Bargaining unit members who are paid on an hourly basis for extra contract work shall be paid the Activity, Professional or Presentation Rate. This shall not be deemed the exclusive method of payment for extra contract work. If not previously identified in the collective bargaining agreement, the employee shall be informed of the rate of pay prior to performing the work.
Section 19.3	Non-Instructional Detention
Supervision of non-instructional detention will be offered at the site, by seniority to certificated employees. If no bargaining unit members desire the work, it may be offered as the District chooses. Payment will be at the Activity Rate.

Section 20.1	Collaboration and Student Learning Time
Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, every Monday in which school is in session, all students will begin school 60 minutes later than the Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday/Friday start time. One Monday each month (except December and June) shall be designated as Student Learning time. On all other Monday’s, this time shall be used by employees for individual time or team/department collaboration and administration shall not schedule meetings during this time.
Section 20.2	Elementary Supervision Duty
In order to ensure adequate planning time for elementary teachers, teachers shall not be required to do bus duty, before or after school student supervision duty, or recess duty. However, to ensure the safety of students, teachers will walk students to the bus pick up area and may be expected to do bus duty in extenuating circumstances.
Section 20.3	Secondary Planning Time
All certificated employees teaching in grades 7-12 shall be provided the equivalent of one teaching period per day for planning. Principals will work with employees to mitigate the impact of school schedule anomalies that reduce employee planning time. A secondary teacher who regularly teaches an assigned class during his/her preparation period shall receive additional pay prorated according to the total number of teaching and planning periods in the day. Students shall not be assigned to a certificated employee during their planning period unless the employee agrees. When buying out the planning period of any staff member, qualified teachers in seniority order who have the same planning period, or where student and master schedules can be adjusted with minimal impact, will be given the first option for the buy out. Buy outs will be calculated using a multiplication factor of .2 FTE.
Section 20.3.1
It is recognized that counselors and librarians need time to do work without students. Employees shall work with their principal to schedule such time.
Section 20.3.2
All secondary librarians shall receive two additional days to be used for the opening or closing of a library. These days will be authorized through issuance of a supplemental contract and will be paid at each librarian’s per diem rate.

Section 24.2	Special Education Extra Supplemental Days
Each psychologist will receive 11 extra days at per diem. Each nurse will receive six extra days at per diem. Each SLP will receive six extra days at per diem. Each OT, PT, and Audiologist will receive three extra days at per diem, and each special education teacher will receive three and one half extra days at per diem to prepare individual education plans and/or assessment reports, or hold meetings related to such responsibilities as determined by the employee. One half (1/2) day of the three and one half days will be used for District directed professional development related to compliance and special education requirements. There will be more than one opportunity for these professional development trainings. Parttime employees (except nurses) shall receive a pro-rated number of days based on their FTE.
Each employee will have the option to convert one of his/her extra supplemental days into two days of release time to complete work on or off site. Employees who elect to work off site must inform their Principal of their selected work location and must be available by telephone. These days shall not be combined with holidays, school breaks, or personal leave days. Employees electing this conversion must notify Human Resources no later than October 1.
Payment for all extra supplemental days will be spread over the December-August pay periods in equal installments.
Section 24.3	Class Balance/Work Load/Case Load
Classes are formed taking into consideration the balance of student needs and the consequent demands on teacher/specialist time and available resources. At all times efforts will be made to ensure that the Special Services and General Education teachers work together to create balanced classrooms. It is considered best practice to look at scheduling and placement early to provide a smooth transition for each student.
The District will evaluate special services caseload and workload using student data. Caseload consideration for special education staff will include current IEPs only (does not include referrals). A staffing report for ESAs and special services staff will be provided to PEA by October 15th.
The District shall make efforts to balance caseload numbers for equitable workload.
IEP case managers will be compensated $30 for each qualifying IEP on the employee’s caseload in the current school year. Compensation will be based on the June 1st count to be paid on the employee’s July pay warrant.
An employee may request a workload impact meeting with the program administrator and a PEA representative to discuss caseloads when one of the numbers below is reached or the employee believes his/her caseload is excessive. If a mutually agreeable resolution cannot be reached, the employee and PEA representative may request a meeting with the Executive Director of Special Services to resolve the issue.

ARTICLE 25.	PARAEDUCATORS
Section 25.1
Assistants and paraeducators may be employed to aid professional school personnel wherever it is indicated that such services will provide for improvement in the school programs.
Assistants and paraeducators shall not assume professional responsibility for the guiding of instruction or the control of students for instructional purposes. These responsibilities reside with the professionally certificated employee.
Employees shall not be required to do paraeducator evaluations, however they are encouraged to provide input so a fair evaluation can be written for the paraeducator.
Section 25.2
Playground, bus, and recess supervisors shall not be considered as performing professional instructional responsibilities.
Section 25.3

Section 25.4	Staff Utilization
The safety of students at school is a shared responsibility of all the certificated and non-certificated staff. The supervision of students before school, after school, in the lunchrooms, during recesses, during passing periods, and in non-instructional settings shall therefore also be a joint responsibility. In making provision for the prudent supervision of students, it shall be the goal in each building to balance the supervisory responsibility among all staff members. However, within the limits of the staff hours allocated to each building, certificated staff shall be utilized in roles where certificated persons are required to perform the work, and non-certificated staff shall be utilized where possible to release certificated staff to perform those tasks. The assignments of the personnel allocated will vary from building to building in response to the collaborative decisions of building staff and administration. If an accord cannot be reached in a building, the administrator shall implement temporary assignments and the parties shall seek facilitation of an accord in a timely fashion.

ARTICLE 26.	BUILDING STANDARDS
Section 26.1
In order to insure that an optimum learning environment exists in a new, remodeled or rebuilt school, an advisory committee of five members including the Executive Director of Facilities shall be formed to represent the facility in question. The Central Administration shall appoint two members; the Association shall appoint two (2) certificated employees. The function of the committee shall be to:
A.	Assist the Executive Director of Facilities in determining the progress toward readiness of the facility to be opened using the Board approved educational specifications as the measure of completion.
B.	Make recommendations to the Executive Director of Facilities on what planned work is to be completed before occupancy. This planned work will be incorporated into the punch list attached to the “Certificate of Substantial Completion.”
C.	Assist the Executive Director of Facilities in selecting alternate housing options or a delayed school opening.
Said committee shall make its recommendations on readiness or alternatives at least two weeks in advance of the opening of school. If said committee finds deficiencies with respect to the Educational Specifications, it shall recommend what work needs to be completed before occupancy should occur to: 1). The Executive Director of Facilities, who will incorporate items into the “punch list” attached to the “Certificate of Substantial Completion”; 2). The Association President; and 3). The Superintendent, who will share the recommendations with the School Board as a part of his/her regular reports on the status of District facilities. If occupancy occurs before completion of the recommendations, the District shall report to the committee as to the status of the committee's recommendations and specify the date by which the work is expected to be completed.
Section 26.2
The District will continue to include telephones in each classroom as buildings are built or totally remodeled as an important means of communication.
Each existing classroom shall be equipped with a means of communicating with the Main Office. Each site will have a phone designated for faculty use for private conversations. The need for staff members to receive messages at work is recognized, and in each building this process will be collaboratively arrived at for utilizing the system and persons available. However, it is agreed that staff members will, except in emergency cases, restrict their use of phones to times that will not diminish the District from the educational process and that personal business calls should be made outside the school day.
ARTICLE 27.	STUDENT DISCIPLINE, SAFETY AND SECURITY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF
Section 27.1	No Tolerance Policy
The District and the PEA are jointly committed to providing quality educational programs in a warm, open, and supportive environment which protects the safety and security of all students and staff. Therefore, the parties agree that an optimal teaching and learning climate for staff and students requires a no tolerance policy for weapons, dangerous devices, and assaultive behavior. The parties recognize the increasing incidence of weapons, dangerous devices, and serious assaults in the society in general and in the nation's

schools, and recognize that with such serious misbehavior, experience has shown that normal sanctions less severe than expulsion have failed to preserve a safe and orderly educational environment.
Section 27.2	Prohibition of Weapons and Assaultive Behavior
To achieve the above, it is agreed that possession or use of weapons, explosives, firecrackers, illegal knives, or other items capable of producing bodily harm shall be prohibited. Consistent with student due process and other legal requirements, the normal penalty shall be expulsion for possession or use of any weapons or dangerous devices, including but not limited to any weapon listed as a deadly weapon in RCW 9A.04.110 or local ordinances. Likewise, when any item is used by the aggressor as a weapon, or which a victim reasonably believes to be a weapon, the same sanctions will apply. Further, it is agreed that the normal penalty is emergency expulsion and other appropriate sanctions for any student who commits a serious assault. Serious assaultive behaviors are defined as either physical assaultive behavior (purposeful assaultive, aggressive behavior, with intent to do serious harm), or verbal assaultive behavior (racial threat or threat to do serious bodily physical harm, either student-to-student or student-to-staff). An emergency expulsion shall continue if the Superintendent or designee has good and sufficient reason to believe the student(s) presence poses an immediate and continuing danger to employee(s), a student, other students or school personnel, or an immediate and continuing threat of substantial disruption of the class, subject, activity, or educational process of the students’ school. In making that determination, the hearing officer shall solicit input from the staff and administration of the building(s) directly affected.
Section 27.3	Assistance and Support
The District shall provide prompt assistance and support to certificated employees in connection with student discipline problems. An administrator or acting administrator, volunteering to be invested with the authority to act as such, shall be available during school hours. When the administrator is away from the building but in the District, an administrator shall be on call. When the building administrator is out-ofdistrict or absent for half the day or more, a substitute shall be provided when needed to maintain the building administrative coverage, unless a building's assistant principal is available. Administrative Interns or former Interns may be asked to accept the administrative responsibility as long as coverage is provided for their assigned classes.
In the maintenance of a sound learning environment, the certificated employee and the District shall expect and work to enforce acceptable behavior on the part of all students who attend schools in the District. Certificated employees shall operate within State law and District policy in maintaining good order and discipline in their classrooms at all times.
Without revealing specific information regarding criminal histories, medical histories, or specifically protected private information, certificated employees who work directly with the student will be notified in an appropriate manner of students who have exhibited serious assaultive behavior at least one school day prior to their admittance to classrooms, if such information is known in advance of the student’s admittance. Staff members so informed shall treat the information as confidential. A safety plan shall be developed by appropriate building staff, (which may include the Principal, counselor, security, BSST member, Special Services, etc.) and communicated to all impacted staff within three student days or less. The safety plan shall be implemented as quickly as possible.
In the event the employee experiences safety concerns in the workplace due to serious assaultive or potentially violent student behavior, the employee shall report said concerns to his/her principal or administrative supervisor who will act to remediate the concern. Remediation may include removing the student from the classroom until such time as interventions can be implemented.
All Special Education staff who work with potentially violent students will be directed to attend age appropriate training, either during the regular work day or, if the employee prefers, outside the regular work day paid at the professional rate.

All employees working directly with potentially violent students may be directed and shall have the opportunity to participate in training either during the work day or after the work day paid at the professional rate.
All other employees working with potentially violent students may have the opportunity to participate in training through professional development offerings scheduled throughout the school year.
Section 27.4	Class Exclusion
Any student who creates a disruption of the educational process in violation of the building disciplinary standards while under a teacher's immediate supervision may be excluded by the teacher from his or her individual classroom and instructional or activity area for all or any portion of the balance of the school day or until the principal or designee and teacher have conferred, whichever occurs first: provided, that except in emergency circumstances, the teacher shall have first attempted one or more alternative forms of corrective action: provided further, that in no event without the consent of the teacher shall an excluded student be returned during the balance of that class or activity period. If a student makes a serious unfounded allegation against an employee, the employee may request a meeting with the principal/supervisor to discuss options regarding the student. Further, the authority of certificated employees to use prudent disciplinary measures for the safety and well-being of students and employees as well as the authority to use standard disciplinary measures for each disabled student, except where notification to the contrary has been provided to staff, is supported by the District. In the exercise of authority by an employee to control and maintain order and discipline, the employee may use reasonable and professional judgment, including reasonable and prudent use of physical constraint, to protect harm being done to a student or to him/herself.
Section 27.5	Disciplinary Standards
On or before September 30 of each school year, each building principal and his/her teaching staff shall meet to develop and/or review building disciplinary standards and uniform enforcement of those standards. Visitor access regulations will be in the employee handbook. In addition, the special education guidelines will be reviewed.
Section 27.6	Disruptive Students
If a mainstreamed student(s) is so disruptive that the education of other students is significantly impaired, the classroom teacher may recommend removal of said student(s) from the classroom in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and the IEP of said student(s). Within three (3) days of written notification (to principal or his/her designee) of a behavior problem of a student with an IEP, an employee shall have the right to meet and confer with the principal and/or the available members of that student’s SRC (Student Review Committee).
ARTICLE 28.	SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS
Certificated employees shall not be expected to work, teach, or supervise students in an area where such work would likely result in physical or emotional harm to said employee(s) or student(s). When the staff member(s) and site administrator(s) indicate a hazardous condition exists, the concern will be acted upon within five working days. If there is a disagreement as to the hazardous condition, the matter may be referred by either party to the appropriate State or County agency for determination. If the safety concerns relates to workload, then it shall first be taken up with the principal.
All rooms in which students are required to eat lunch shall be cleaned daily, including floor, sinks, and trash removal.

The District shall advise certificated employees of any unsafe working condition(s), as determined by a State or County agency, which would pose an immediate and substantial threat to their or their students' health in the areas in which they work. A copy of the notification to the certificated employee(s) will be sent to the Association President within five working days of receipt of the same by the District. Within five working days following the District’s receipt of facility environmental testing prompted by an Association complaint, a copy of all environmental test results shall be provided to the Association President.
ARTICLE 29.	DISTRICTWIDE COMMITTEES
Section 29.1	Instructional Program
The Superintendent or his/her designee shall post the existence of regular District-wide instructional program committees in each building each school year. Criteria for membership, contractual rate of pay, if offered, if any, and the available openings on the committees, if any, shall be listed at the time of posting. Certificated employees shall have five working days after the date of posting to indicate to the appropriate administrator their desire to serve on said committee(s). Employees are not required to participate in district-wide committees outside the seven and one half hour work day. Such participation is strictly voluntary. Administration shall not coerce or intimidate employees to participate on committees, particularly employees new to the District, and/or profession. Committee work outside of the seven and one half hour work day shall be compensated at the stated professional rate of pay.
Section 29.2.	Educational Technology Committee
An ongoing educational technology committee, comprised of three certificated employee representatives (one elementary, one junior high and one high school), shall be convened on a regular basis to address concerns related to TAC, Student Plus, and other educational related technology tools/programs. The committee shall act as a clearinghouse for quick tips and work-around tactics for TAC as well as provide feedback through ITC to the software manufacturer for updates and modifications to the program. The committee shall also have the opportunity to provide input, pilot, and/or trouble shoot all new technology prior to implementation across the District.
The three committee representatives will meet with ITC at least three times per year to provide input and to address technology concerns. Committee representatives shall be paid at the professional rate for attending meetings outside the regular work day.
One employee volunteer from each work site shall be designated as the technology contact, who will work with a committee employee representative to problem solve, provide input, and disseminate information back to employees at the work site regarding technology issues. The building technology contact may be eligible for a stipend from the building stipend funds in Appendix C.
Section 29.3	Other Committees
The District may request that an employee serve on a District committee, and building level administrators may request that an employee serve on a building level committee. Each employee shall not be subject to reprisals for choosing not to serve on District or building level committees. When the District or building administrator deems appropriate, released time shall be provided for participation on said committee(s). Employees who choose to participate on District wide or building level committees outside the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day will be compensated at the professional rate.
Section 29.4	Composition
The composition of district wide task forces and committees shall be reviewed by the Association prior to a committee meeting to ensure appropriate representation of Association members.

ARTICLE 30.	STUDENT TEACHERS
The Board and Association agree that the acceptance and proper deployment of student teachers in the Puyallup School District can constitute a significant contribution to the improvement of the educational profession.
Guidelines for consideration include: 1). only one student teacher per year per supervising teacher, 2). assignment only with an experienced teacher, 3). the program is voluntary, and 4). spring preplanning is valuable in making the program effective.
ARTICLE 31.	GRADING STANDARDS
Teachers are responsible for setting permissible standards for grading students, communicating those standards, and fairly applying them. Such grades and/or comments will only be changed in accordance with the law or District policy. Prior to making any decision which alters any grade or comment or making a recommendation to alter a grade or comment, a building administrator/supervisor will study the records, ascertain the factors involved, and consult with the employee who gave the grade. If a grade or comment is altered by a District representative, the employee and parent/guardian of the impacted student shall be notified in writing. (See WAC 180-44-010 and RCW 28A.150.240)
ARTICLE 32.	ONLINE LEARNING
If the District provides on-line learning opportunities for students, the following parameters shall be in place:
1.	The parties agree to have ongoing discussions regarding the implementation, operation, and potential expansion of the District’s On-Line Academy with the goal of eventually providing on a self-sustaining basis all elements of the Academy within the District rather than utilizing outside vendors.
2.	For District-sponsored programs created and delivered by third party course providers, a minimum of one (1) non-administrative, certificated position (Online Specialist) will be maintained for every one hundred (100) full time students enrolled in the program.
3.	For all other on-line programs, non-administrative, certificated employees will be used to guide student learning, subject to all parameters of the negotiated agreement. If employees are assigned online work within the regular work day they shall be compensated as part of their FTE or buy-out of their planning period. Online extra work with students outside the contracted work day will be compensated at the professional rate.

PART IV - SUBSTITUTES
ARTICLE 33.	SUBSTITUTES
Section 33.1	Application of Agreement
The provisions of this section apply only to represented substitutes as defined in Article 1. Only the sections of this Collective Bargaining Agreement specifically referred to in this Article shall be applied to substitute employees. The sections of this Agreement applying to substitutes shall be:
1.	Student Calendar
2.	Article 1 (Administration of Agreement, Section 1.2 only)
3.	Article 2 (Payroll Deductions, Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 only)
4.	Article 3 (Grievance Procedure)
5.	Article 4 (Individual Rights, Section 4.1 only)
6.	Article 5 (Staff Protection)
7.	Article 6 (Controversial Issues)
8.	Article 27 (Student Discipline)
9.	Article 28 (Safe Working Conditions)
Section 33.2	Job Assignments
It is agreed that substitutes work on call and have no guarantee of employment on a day-to-day basis. When assigning substitutes on a daily basis the following factors will be the basis for selection: principal or supervisor request, teacher request, reports of previous placements, formal training, certification, endorsements, previous substituting experience, immediate availability, demonstrated willingness to accept assignments, length of time with the District, and administrative convenience. Substitutes are responsible for carrying out their responsibilities as outlined in the Puyallup School District Substitute Teacher Handbook, including, but not limited to, following the teacher's lesson plan. The District shall notify substitutes of the handbook and shall make this accessible.
Section 33.3	Job Exclusion
The District may elect in which buildings and classrooms to utilize a substitute. A substitute may be excluded from a particular classroom upon request by the classroom teacher. However, the substitute shall be provided with the nature of the complaint and shall have an opportunity to conference with said teacher. The conference shall be arranged through the building administrator. Before deciding not to use a specific substitute in a particular building again because of a complaint(s) regarding that substitute's work, the substitute shall be informed in writing of the nature of the complaint(s) and be given an opportunity to respond to the allegation. A substitute will only be excluded from a particular building if a problem is not remediable as determined by the principal. The Human Resources Department shall review any decision made by a building administrator to not use a specific substitute. However, only when the District decides to drop a substitute from its substitute list is that decision grievable and is grievable only to the extent there is no just cause. For this section, just cause shall include any material or significant breach of the duties of substitutes outlined in the Substitute Teacher Handbook, repeated parental complaints, exclusion from multiple schools and/or classrooms, insubordination, unprofessional conduct, or conduct which reasonable educators would consider detrimental to students or to their education.
Section 33.4	Compensation
Substitutes pay shall be .39% of the base salary for teachers. Senior substitutes shall be paid 103% of the regular substitute pay rate. A half-day shall be defined as 4 hours and paid at 54% of the regular substitute full days pay. For 2012-13, on LIC Wednesdays, substitutes shall work 4.5 hours and be paid at 60% of the regular substitute full-day’s pay. On the 20th day of work in a single continuing assignment, retroactive to the first day of the assignment, a substitute shall be paid at the per diem rate that employee would receive if paid on the salary schedule for regular employees. Further, when substitutes are placed in assignments

known from the outset to extend more than 20 days, that per diem rate shall be paid from day one. Substitutes shall not be asked to leave a long term assignment (20 days or more) in order to avoid working 20 continuous days and qualifying for the higher rate of pay. If an employee on a long term assignment is absent due to illness or emergency leave, the substitute shall continue to be paid on the salary schedule for regular employees when able to return to work the assignment. Substitutes will be compensated for all work on the next month’s regular payroll cycle.
Upon completion of the school year, substitutes shall receive one of the following incentive bonuses: $200 for working the equivalent of 50 full days, $300 for working the equivalent of 70 full days, or $400 for working the equivalent of 90 plus full days. Substitutes who work exclusively in assessment roles shall not be eligible for the incentive bonuses.
Section 33.5	Long Term Assignments
When filling a long-term assignment (anticipated to be 20 days or more), the District may: 1). elect to post the position, 2). select from its applicant pool, 3). retain in the position a substitute who can provide continuity for the program, or 4). fill the assignment from the substitute pool in the same manner as selection of daily job assignments. After working 90 days in a long-term assignment, substitutes may request that their building administrators or program supervisors complete a formal observation of their work for their files. Pre-conferences and post-conferences shall be optional. The observation form used shall be the same as that used for regular employees by that supervisor. The substitute shall have the option of having the evaluation placed in his/her file. The content and process shall not be subject to the Grievance Article.
Section 33.6	Length of Work Day
The length of the school day is 7.5 hours for substitutes. Except in the case of unusual circumstances, the substitute shall have the same planning time as the employee for which the substitute has been assigned. Substitutes expected to work beyond the 7.5 hour work day will be compensated at their extra hourly rate of pay. The hourly rate of pay will be based on a 7.5 hour work day and the individual substitute’s classification. When a substitute teacher is asked to cover for another teacher during planning periods or when asked to teach during a planning period that has been “bought out,” they shall receive additional compensation if they are working for the third day or more in a single assignment. The District shall provide a duty free lunch for substitutes traveling between buildings, within a single assignment.
Section 33.7	Information Access
Each work site shall identify a mailbox for substitutes to receive copies of general correspondence. Each substitute shall be provided a weekly bulletin, if available, and each site will determine any other appropriate means of communicating staff information to substitutes. Substitute teachers shall be provided access to district email. Substitutes may, upon request through a scheduled appointment, review the contents of the substitute personnel files kept in the Education Service Center and the reports retained at the schools. Information regarding high-risk students shall be incorporated in the substitute folder. The District shall provide substitute teachers with permanent identification badges.
Section 33.8	Required Training Support
It is agreed that FBI and WSP fingerprint reports, HIV/Hepatitis B training, and successful completion of the District’s mandatory online annual training classes are conditions of employment, and costs are to be assumed by any person seeking employment in the District. However, employees who retire from the District shall be automatically accepted into the substitute pool upon request without application, interview, and FBI/WSP fingerprinting as long as there has been no break in service from the time the employee retires to the time he/she joins the substitute pool. If the District requires additional training of represented substitutes for specific assignments, the District agrees to pay a pro rata of the daily substitute rate for attending such training.

Section 33.9	Senior Substitutes
Substitutes who have been active on the District’s substitute list more than three school years, employees who have retired from teaching after at least one year of teaching in this District, or employees in the layoff pool may request “senior substitute status.” Senior substitutes will be called in the order of seniority for substitute assignments for other than “same day work” when:
1.	There has been no other substitute specifically requested by a supervisor or teacher;
2.	The substitute has the necessary background and training;
3.	The substitute has demonstrated competence by previous work in the area of the assignment;
4.	The substitute is available when called; and
5.	The substitute has not already been placed in an assignment for that time period.
A person requesting “senior substitute status” must accept the assignment when offered unless:
1.	The substitute is ill or caring for a dependent family member;
2.	The substitute has not requested placement at this grade level (K-3, 4-6, 7-12) or in the
subject area of the assignment; or
3.	The substitute has not requested one week in advance to be excused from assignments during the period of the assignment.
The Director of Employee Relations may revoke the “senior substitute status” of a substitute who has been excluded from multiple schools, per section 33.3. The substitute may make a request to the Director of Employee Relations for his/her “senior substitute status” to be reinstated after successfully completing one school year without exclusion from any additional school/department.
PART V - MISCELLANEOUS
ARTICLE 34.	SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING
Section 34.1
The parties affirm a principle of modern management that recognizes some kinds of decisions in the operation of an organization are best made by the individuals who actually provide a service. A site based decision-making philosophy is comprised of three main elements: a) the decentralization and democratization of appropriate building level decisions; b) delegation of authority to the building principal, the site staff and, where appropriate, parents and community members at that school to make identified changes in the instructional programs of the school which will improve the education being provided for the students; and c) development of responsibility among site staff for the determination, execution, and evaluation of the revised instructional program. Site-based decision making shall involve those who are affected by the decision. Participation shall be direct or through representation of their choosing.
Section 34.2
Site-based decision making shall only address topics and actions that affect the instructional delivery system of a specific school site and may include such items as staff development (building inservice), student discipline, staff utilization, early release days, school goals, programs and priorities, and other building

instructional concerns, but excluding hiring decisions. Staff may at times be asked for their participation in hiring processes, and their input and reactions to candidates may be solicited.
Section 34.3
Site-based decisions shall not violate Board policies, State law, or this Agreement.
Section 34.4
Special Services staff members who have no school site to which they are attached per se, and/or no building staff with whom they need to be involved regarding a particular site decision, shall for the purposes of this Article be considered part of a site-based team assigned to the Special Services Office.
ARTICLE 35. TEACHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
If funded, the District will follow the listed criteria and processes in implementation of the Teacher Assistance Program in accordance with (WAC 392-196) and the criteria specified.
1.	Selection of Mentor and Beginning Teachers
It is recognized that funding may limit the participation of eligible teachers as per WAC 392-196. Thus selection of beginning teacher participants shall be based on their hiring seniority and willingness to participate. In the event a beginning teacher is unable to participate, the next eligible beginning teacher will be contacted by the building principal for participation.
Mentor teachers must meet the criteria specified in the legislation and participation will be on a voluntary basis. Mentor teacher selection will be based on: a). similarity of assignment to the beginning teacher (i.e. same grade level and subject area) and b). a willingness to fully participate in program seminars and related activities.
2.	Funding and Compensation
The program will be funded through an allocation provided by the State. Compensation will be based on 75% of the remaining funds to the mentor and 25% to the beginning teacher.

Memorandums of Agreement
Puyallup School District and the Puyallup Education Association (PEA)
Advisory
The staff of any school implementing a bell schedule that includes advisory (including homeroom, JAG time, etc.) shall on an annual basis, discuss the effectiveness, viability, and parameters of using instructional time in this manner. The discussion shall include the designated amount of time, placement of time in the schedule, content addressed, and compensation for workload impact. The schedule shall be determined by an effective building staff decision making model.
Allocation of Elementary Planning Time
For the 2012-13 school year only, to comply with State program requirements regarding hours of instruction for students, the elementary student day has been expanded by six minutes per day, resulting in a loss of 5 minutes of planning time, per Section 20.3, Elementary Planning Time. In order to make up for this loss of planning time, the Parties agree as follows:
1.	The Parties agree that the elementary Learning Improvement Calendar (LIC) work schedule on Wednesday afternoons at elementary schools (not including individual planning or evaluation & conference LIC days) will be as follows:
Activity	Early Schools	Late Schools
Student Dismissal	11:51 a.m.	12:21 p.m.
Student & Patron (WAC) Time (15 min.)	11:51 a.m. to 12:06 p.m.	12:21 to 12:36 p.m.
Duty Free Lunch (30 min.)	12:06 to 12:36 p.m.	12:36 to 1:06 p.m.
Make-up Planning Time (45 min.)	12:36 to 1:21 p.m.	1:06 to 1:51 p.m.
LIC Time (90 min.)	1:21 to 2:51 p.m.	1:51 to 3:21 p.m.
Student & Patron (WAC) Time (15 min.)	2:51 to 3:06 p.m.	3:21 to 3:36 p.m.
2.	Through individual building collaborative decision-making processes, the schedule listed in the above chart may be rearranged or flexed from one Wednesday to the next on either a permanent or case-by-case basis, as long as the appropriate number of minutes for each activity are met. Those minute allocations are: A total of thirty minutes of Student & Patron (WAC) time, thirty minutes duty free lunch, 45 minutes of make-up planning time, and ninety minutes of LIC time.
3.	Elementary teachers will be released from school thirty minutes after students on the early dismissal student days of the day before Thanksgiving and the last day of school. Schools that traditionally trade time on the day before Thanksgiving for work done at evening conferences, shall instead trade the time on the December or January Evaluation & Conference LIC days.
Evaluation Committee
The parties agree to establish a joint task force with co-chairs, consisting of no more than seven (7) participants each, to recommend amendments to Article 12, Evaluation of Certificated Employees, and Article 13 Probation to align with State requirements.
The task force work will commence no later than May 21, 2012 and will provide opportunities for employees and administrators to pilot the new evaluation system beginning with the 2012-2013 school year.

Employees shall be paid a $1,000 stipend for the 2011-2012 school year and a $1,500 stipend for the 20122013 school year for assigned committee work and committee meetings. The District shall pay for the cost of the necessary substitutes for members of the task force if meetings are held during the work day.
The District and Association agree that the joint committee may begin its work once both parties have signed the MOU.
District Improvement Specialists
The District hopes to fill District Improvement Specialist positions as certificated, Association-represented positions, to provide extra support in targeted curriculum areas in furtherance of the District’s improvement plan. The positions require demonstrated excellence in curriculum and instruction. Experienced, qualified teachers in the District are concerned about taking such positions without some certainty of their positions in subsequent years.

Learning Improvement Calendar (LIC) Days
For the 2012-13 school year only, the following LIC language (previously Article 23) shall be in effect:
Overview. The intent for the use of LIC days is for administration and certificated staff to work together to improve student learning and achievement. Professional development and communications are necessary for the improvement of student learning. This can only occur in an environment where people collaborate, compromise, examine things from the other person’s point of view, treat each other with courtesy and respect and focus on what is in the best interest of the students. The following concepts are the foundation of the LIC Days:
1.	The principal is the educational leader in a school and is therefore responsible to work continuously with staff to bring about the improvement of instruction and student learning. Principals are obligated to bring legislative mandates, legal requirements, School Board and administrative initiatives, and school issues to the staff.
2.	The Comprehensive School Improvement Planning (CSIP) Team will use data and applicable information to determine student improvement needs and professional development opportunities. The team will design the annual plan which includes the work to be accomplished and the time lines for implementation. Team members will ensure that other staff members have been given an opportunity to give input. Following this input, the building administrator, as the instructional leader, will direct and facilitate the work to be accomplished.
Prior to the end of each school year, building staff will choose grade level/department representation to reflect a cross-section of the diversity within the school and community. One (1) team member may be designated as the representative for more than one grade level or department. Membership is to include at a minimum: the building Principal, teachers, other support staff, a parent (if available) and when appropriate, a student. The CSIP committee meetings and assigned work which extends beyond the 7.5 hour workday shall be compensated at the professional hourly rate. The CSIP team will regularly communicate with and solicit input from the staff to ensure maximum staff participation in school-wide learning improvement efforts.
3.	The concept of collaboration is that administrators and certificated staff work together; however work on the Collaboration Wednesdays does not always have to be done with other people. For example, if the CSIP team has been involved in a process to identify strategies for improving achievement scores, the employees might meet in grade level, subject area or job-alike groups to discuss the work to be done, develop individual assignments and meet again when appropriate.
4.	Early release (elementary) and late arrival (secondary) days on Wednesdays have been negotiated to provide principals, and certificated staff time to work together. If there is no CSIP work or meeting scheduled, other collaborative work may be completed by individual team members. Employees will be treated as professionals and will be allowed to make collaborative decisions with the principal regarding the use of this time and will be entrusted with responsibility to use the time appropriately. It is understood and expected that work to improve student learning will be accomplished by both parties.
5.	It is important that LIC activities be appropriate and related to an employee’s assignment. In the event an employee believes a scheduled LIC activity is not relevant to his/her work assignment, the employee shall discuss the matter with his/her supervisor. The employee and

supervisor shall mutually agree on an alternate activity for the employee aimed at improving student learning.
Part Time Employees LIC
Part time employees will participate in Learning Improvement work if they are assigned to work on the Learning Improvement day and they are scheduled to work in the afternoon. On a case-by-case basis, part time certificated employees may request or be requested by the building administrator to participate on a Wednesday and be paid at the employee’s per diem rate of pay.
LIC Parameters
The LIC chart shall identify the type of LIC work that is to be performed on specific LIC days. For any given month, the principal, building staff and District program supervisor may have the flexibility to change the order of the days, except those days designated for Special Service job-alike training. Any changes to the LIC must be communicated to the appropriate District supervisor and shall preserve the amount of time in each respective category.
Specific Requirements
1.	Non-emergency mandatory building meetings will not be called during individual planning time.
2.	Any and all Learning Improvement staff development or meetings shall end on or before the end of the regular employee workday.
3.	Employees assigned to work at more than one site (split schedule) who are not traditionally
itinerant staff shall adhere to the building LIC schedule that comprises the majority of their FTE. Any schedule conflicts that arise shall be resolved upon mutually agreement of the employee and the site administrators.
4.	Walker High School will not participate in the LIC in order to accommodate their unique needs.
Elementary Level LIC
There will be a two and three quarter hour early release at the elementary level, and one and one half (1.5) hours for LIC time. Learning Improvement Calendar Days shall be used as follows:

APPENDIX G: YEARS OF EXPERIENCE PUYALLUP SCHOOL DISTRICT
Years of experience means the number of years of full-time and part-time professional education employment as of August 31 prior to the current "snapshot" date.
Professional education experience is limited to the following [WAC 392-121-245]:
1.	Employment in public or private preschools or elementary and secondary schools in positions which require certification;
2.	Employment in public or private vocational-technical schools, community/junior colleges, colleges, and universities in positions comparable to those which require certification in the common schools;
3.	Employment in educational institutions in any professional position, including but not limited to, C.P.A., architect, business manager, physician, if employment is in an education agency or institution such as an ESD, OSPI, or the United States Department of Education;
Educational agency or institution, as interpreted for this purpose, means a governmental agency administratively responsible for providing public elementary and/or secondary instruction or educational support services. This does not include school districts nor is it likely to include any agency below the level of a regional education agency such as an ESD.
4.	Experience in the following areas if recognized by the district for placement on the district salary schedule:
a)	Military, Peace Corps, or Vista service which interrupted professional employment;
b)	Sabbatical leave; and
c)	For vocational instructors who hold no degree, up to a maximum of six years of management experience acquired after the instructor meets the minimum vocational certification requirements.
NOTES:
•	Employment may be in Washington, out-of-state, or in a foreign country.
•	Document years of experience in the employee's file on a letter or any other document that provides
evidence of employment, including dates of employment [WAC 392-121-280(3)].
•	Report all years of experience including those beyond the experience limit of the district's salary schedule [WAC 392-121-245].
•	The traditional nine-month academic year is considered as one school year. Count no more than one year of experience for any twelve-month period [WAC 392-121-245].
•	Accumulate full- and part-time employment to three decimals and report in tenths of school years [WAC 392-121-215] and [WAC 392-121-245].
•	Report substitute days as part-time professional education employment. Calculate years of experience for substitute days, summer school and extended school year days by dividing the accumulated number of full-time days by 180 and rounding to the nearest tenth. Report partial substitute days as part-time professional education employment by dividing the part of the day worked by the full day as determined by the district and rounded to the nearest tenth of a day [WAC 392-121-245].
EXAMPLE
A person worked 87 days full-time one year, 180 days half-time the second year, and 100 days fulltime the third year. A full year in the District is 180 days. District files record this experience as .483 FTE + .500 FTE + .556 FTE = 1.539 FTE. Report 1.5 years of experience.
93
APPENDIX H: JOB SHARE GUIDELINES PUYALLUP SCHOOL DISTRICT
1. What is the difference between a part-time position, a part-year position and a job share position?	A part-time position is funded as a fraction of a full-time single position, for example, a .5 FTE. A part-year position is a position that is for less than 180 days and, therefore, is reported as a fraction of an FTE, i.e., 160 divided by 180 would be a .89 FTE. A job share exists when two people share the responsibilities of one full-time position at their request.
2. What is the difference in benefits between job share and part-time positions?	Part-time employees will receive a prorated allocation as agreed upon by the District and the bargaining unit. Job share staff will be eligible to share 1 benefit allocation on a prorated basis. Full-year employees at .5 FTE or above are eligible for full TRI, except where staff members are job sharing. In job sharing situations, the two staff members will each receive their respective FTE times the amount for which they would qualify in a full-time position. Part-time staff members and staff members who are less than .5 FTE will be eligible for a pro rata share of TRI based on their FTE.
3. What about planning/release, the 181st Day and staff meetings?	Planning and release days are prorated based on the job share FTE. Job share partners shall attend all State Funded Professional Development Days and Supplemental Days. One member of the team must attend building planning days and staff meetings. Both members are responsible for keeping abreast of building discussions, issues and concerns.
4. Is the District obligated to share a position?	The District is obligated to consider job sharing when there is an open position.
5. How does one get permission to job share?	Job Share Application forms are available in Personnel. One application is to be completed by each team. All applications for reassignment in a building must be submitted in time to be approved no later than May 1 of the preceding school year, provided however, applications that cause no “domino effect” may be submitted any time before the first student day. Applications for open positions will follow the same timelines required for transfers outlined in the Staffing Article of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
6. What must be done before a job share request is approved?	a)	Individuals interested in being reassigned to a job sharing position must identify a job share partner within the current ranks of provisional and continuing District staff who is acceptable to the building principal. If no job share partner is found in the ranks of current employees, the job share is posted. b)	The potential job share team must then identify the position they wish to share. c)	The Job Share Application form must be completed by the team requesting the job share, approved or disapproved by the principal and returned to the Personnel Office for review.
94
7. Can a job share team work alternating weeks?	Alternating weeks if approved by a Principal and District designee.
8. Who authorizes a job share?	The Director of Human Resources will authorize a job share after reviewing the recommendation of the building principal.
9. What will be the basis for consideration of job share requests?	The consideration will be based on administrative and program needs. The District will maintain a limited number of job share opportunities per building depending on the number of administrators, staff and special programs. If a job share application is rejected, a written rationale for the denial will be provided if requested.
10. What happens to an individuals contract when job sharing?	The individual retains the present year FTE and will be placed on leave for the portion of the FTE being shared, e.g., 1.0 FTE equals .5 leave and .5 assigned.
11. How long is a position job shared?	One school year. Job share teams will have the opportunity to reapply in the following spring.
12. Can a job share be started mid-year?	The creation of job shares mid-year would be most unusual. All requests to be reassigned to a job share must be submitted pursuant to guideline #5.
13. Can job shared team s trade scheduled days?	Yes, with prior approval of the building administrator.
14. Can one team member substitute for another team member?	Yes. The request must be made through the Substitute Office and the pay for substituting will be at the regular substitute rate.
15. To whom is the j ob share position assigned?	a)	Where a position already belongs to one team member, it remains that member’s position when the job share team dissolves. b)	Where a position is “open,” it shall be assigned to the senior member of the team (by building and then by District seniority).
16. What happens when both members want to end the job share?	The person whose position was shared retains the position unless staff reduction provisions of the contract have been implemented. The other member may remain in the building if there is a position available; otherwise, that member must transfer. If one or both members of a team wish to job share with new partners, the application process must start over again.
17. Is special consideration for continued job sharing given to anyone?	Yes. Special consideration is given to job share teams that were in existence prior to the 1993-94 school year because at the time of the creation of those teams, the guidelines were not in place.
