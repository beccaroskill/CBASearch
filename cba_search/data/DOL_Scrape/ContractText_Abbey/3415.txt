ARTICLE 2	- RECOGNITION AND REPRESENTATION
Section 2.1.	Recognition.
The City recognizes CMAGE/CWA as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the unit consisting of all regular full-time and part-time employees in classifications listed in Attachments A and B of the State Employment Relations Board (SERB) certification of Election Results and of Exclusive Representative dated February 17, 1994 in SERB Case No. 93-REP-07-0139. Excluded from the unit are all other employees, including, but not limited to, all Health Department employees, elected officials, Directors, Deputy Directors, Administrators, Superintendents, Assistant Administrators, Assistant Superintendents, all employees of the Mayor's Office and City Council, and select persons in classifications which deal directly with collective bargaining issues (the specific classifications and select persons so excluded from the unit as of November, 1993 are listed in Attachment C of the SERB Certification dated February 17, 1994 in SERB Case No. 93-REP-07-0139); short-term employees (i.e., those employed on a temporary or seasonal basis); part-time employees not regularly employed for at least twenty (20) hours per week; student interns; all employees represented for purposes of collective bargaining in other bargaining units (IAFF, Local #67; FOP, Capital City Lodge No. 9; FOP/Ohio Labor Council; AFSCME, Local 1632; AFSCME, Local 2191); and any supervisory, managerial, administrative, or confidential positions the same as or similar to those listed in Attachment C of the SERB Certification dated February 17, 1994 in SERB Case No. 93-REP-07-0139.
Section 2.2.	Classifications Not Guaranteed.
The classifications or job titles used by the City are for descriptive purposes only. Their use is neither an indication nor a guarantee that these classifications or titles will continue to be utilized by the City.
Section 2.3.	New Classifications and Pay Grade Assignment.
(A)	Notification to CMAGE/CWA. The City shall promptly notify CMAGE/CWA of its decision to create any new classifications pertaining to work of a nature performed by employees in the bargaining unit. The City, through the Civil Service Commission (CSC), may create, modify, or merge classifications and place abolished classifications in moratorium. The CSC will provide CMAGE/CWA with copies of proposed classification specifications, whether newly created, merged or modified at least fourteen (14) days before the Commission meeting where the proposed classification specifications will be on the Commission agenda.
(B)	Successor Classification Titles. If the new classification is a successor title to a classification covered by the Agreement and the job duties are not significantly altered or changed, the new classification shall automatically become a part of this Agreement.
5
(C)	Bargaining Unit Determination. If the new classification consists in significant part of the work now being done by any of the classifications covered by this Agreement, or its functions are similar to those of employees in this bargaining unit, and CMAGE/CWA notifies the City of a desire to meet within fourteen (14) calendar days of its receipt of the City's notice, the parties will then meet to review the proposed classification, and if unable to reach agreement as to its inclusion or exclusion from the unit, the City shall be free to implement its decision and CMAGE/CWA shall be free to challenge that decision through the SERB's unit clarification procedure. CMAGE/CWA shall not be bound by such fourteen (14) day limit in any case where the City fails to notify CMAGE/CWA of a new classification as provided in Paragraph (A) of this Section 2.3.
(D)	Pay Grade Assignment. If the inclusion of the new classification is agreed to by the parties or found appropriate by SERB, the parties shall then negotiate as to the proper pay grade for the classification. The Department of Human Resources will determine a proposed pay grade for the affected classifications and shall notify the Union. Should the Union dispute the proposed pay recommendation of the City, it shall request to bargain. Negotiations shall not exceed thirty (30) days. If the parties are unable to resolve their differences through negotiations, they shall submit unresolved issues through arbitration pursuant to Section 8.2, Step 3, of this Agreement, except that the parties shall share the expenses equally. The matter shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon arbitrator knowledgeable in classification and compensation matters.
(E)	Reallocations. In the event the City reallocates a position to a different but existing bargaining unit classification, the procedure set forth in Subsection 2.3(D) above shall apply and be followed with respect to negotiating the appropriate pay grade for the affected job classification to which the position has been reallocated.
Section 2.4.	Exempted Classifications.
The parties agree to add to the list of limited exempt classifications in which certain individuals are excluded by name from the bargaining unit (noted in the Agreement by an asterisk) and as listed in Appendix C; those positions that serve as secretaries of Deputy Directors involved in collective bargaining or human resources matters of a confidential nature; and employees in the human resources sections of each department/division who are verifiably involved in collective bargaining the vast majority of their time.
6
ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY AND RIGHTS
Section 3.1.	Payroll Deduction.
The City will deduct from each employee's pay in the second pay period of each month the regular monthly Union dues for each employee in the bargaining unit who has filed with the City a payroll deduction authorization in the form attached hereto as Appendix F. The City will honor all executed payroll deduction authorization forms received not later than fifteen (15) working days (i.e., days the City's administrative offices are open) prior to the next deduction date.
Total deductions collected for each calendar month shall be remitted by the City to the Treasurer of CMAGE/CWA together with a list of employees for whom deductions have been made not later than the tenth (10th) of the following month. The City will also provide to the CMAGE/CWA Treasurer, in spreadsheet format, a copy of the list of deductions for the current month. The spreadsheet copy shall include: name, pay rate, pay grade, department/division, classification, and social security number. CMAGE/CWA agrees to refund to the employee any amounts paid to the Union in error on account of this dues deduction provision.
Dues shall be withheld and remitted to the Treasurer of the Union unless or until such time as the City receives a notice of an employee's death, transfer from covered employment, termination of covered employment, or when there are insufficient funds available in the employee's earnings after withholding all other legal and required deductions.
Information concerning dues not properly deducted under this Section 3.1 shall be forwarded to the Treasurer of the Union, and this action will discharge the City’s only responsibility with regard to such cases; there will be no retroactive deduction of such dues from future earnings. Deductions shall cease at such time as a strike or work stoppage occurs in violation of Article 9 (No Strike-No Lockout).
The actual percentage dues to be deducted shall be certified to the City Auditor by the Treasurer of the Union. The Union will give the City a forty-five (45) day notice of any change in the percentage of dues to be deducted.
CMAGE/CWA agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders, or judgments for monetary damages brought or issued against the City as a result of any action properly taken or not taken by the City under the provisions of this Section 3.1.
Section 3.2.	Maintenance of Membership.
Each employee who, on the effective date of this Agreement, is a member of CMAGE/CWA, and employees who become a member after the date, shall maintain membership in the Union provided that such employee may resign from the Union during the thirty (30) day period prior to the expiration of this Agreement or after the stated expiration of this Agreement (without regard to extensions) and prior to the
7
commencement of a new Agreement by giving written notification to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee and the Union twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of the revocation. Upon resignation from the Union a bargaining unit member shall immediately pay the fair share fee as provided in Section 3.3. The payment of dues and assessment is uniformly required of the membership for the duration of this Agreement.
Section 3.3.	Fair Share Fee.
Any present employee who is not a member of the Union and all employees hired or entering the bargaining unit, after the effective date of this Agreement and who have not made application for membership shall, commencing sixty-one (61) days after appointment to a classification in the bargaining unit or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, so long as they remain non-members of the Union, pay to the Union each month their fair share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and Agreement administration measured by the amount of dues and other financial obligations uniformly required by members of the Union. Such fair share payments shall be deducted by the City from the earnings of such non-member employee(s) once each month, and paid to the Union in accordance with Section 3.1. The Treasurer of the Union shall certify to the City the amount that constitutes said fair share that shall not exceed the dues and financial obligations uniformly required by members of the Union.
The Union agrees to comply with its legal obligations to fair share fee payers. Further, it is agreed that any dispute concerning the amount of the fair share fee and/or the responsibilities of the Union with respect to fair share fee payers shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement.
Section 3.4.	Union Communications.
The City recognizes that CMAGE/CWA has a responsibility to communicate with bargaining unit members. To facilitate this purpose, it is agreed that CMAGE/CWA may make reasonable use of e-mail, telephone, inter-office mail and fax machines to communicate with individual members (no mass communications), so long as the use does not unduly interfere with City work. The City will continue to permit CMAGE/CWA to use bulletin board space in appropriate and accessible locations approved by the Appointing Authority and will consider requests for changes or additions to such locations where appropriate. The Union will limit the posting of Union notices to such bulletin boards.
Appropriate items for communications under this section shall be:
(A)	Notices of Union elections;
(B)	Notices of Union meetings;
(C)	Notices of Union appointments and results of elections;
(D)	Notices of Union recreational and social affairs;
8
(E)	Newsletters of the Union (newsletters may be distributed at a central location for different sections, from a CMAGE/CWA member at their work site);
(F)	Matters of Agreement interpretation;
(G)	Matters of Agreement enforcement; and
(H)	Such other notices as may be approved by the Appointing Authority or the Director of Human Resources or designee.
Items specifically prohibited from this process include those that are derogatory, inflammatory, or disrespectful of individuals or organizations.
Items that are neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited may be submitted to the Appointing Authority or designee for prior approval.
Citywide items or items not approved by the Appointing Authority may be submitted to the Director of Human Resources or designee for review. Problems arising under this Section shall be discussed between the Director of Human Resources or designee and the Union.
ARTICLE 4	- UNION REPRESENTATIVES
Section 4.1.	President’s Authority.
The President of CMAGE/CWA may appoint one (1) primary representative per department as listed below for the purpose of representing bargaining unit members at investigatory interviews to provide advice, provided that the representation is limited to the work location. All other representation will be scheduled through the President or Vice President, when acting in the place of the President. This will not preclude the ability of a representative to be contacted by a bargaining unit member for information or for a representative to contact management in order to attempt to resolve issues.
The President may also appoint one (1) alternate to the primary representative whose duties will be as outlined above. The alternate may replace the primary representative when the primary is on leave for five (5) or more workdays.
Section 4.2.	Representatives Authority.
These representatives will not have the authority to deliver or file a grievance. Only the President or Vice President may actually file, deliver, or process a grievance or represent bargaining unit member(s) at a grievance or disciplinary hearing. In their absence the President or Vice President may specifically designate another elected Union official to attend meetings when requested by the City. Ordinarily the President or Vice President will represent bargaining unit members at disciplinary or grievance hearings, except both may attend, subject to the approval of the Director of Human Resources or designee, after CMAGE/CWA offers reasons for having both present at
9
such hearings. The performance of these duties shall not interfere with the normal work responsibilities of the representative, other than the President and Vice President.
Section 4.3.	List of Designated Representatives.
CMAGE/CWA will provide to the City a list of designated representatives by Department. The Departments for which representatives will be provided include:

12
Section 5.3.	Central Work Rules and Personnel Policies.
The City will establish and, from time-to-time, revise Central Work Rules and personnel policies; such rules shall not be in conflict with this Agreement.

Section 5.4.	Notification.
Prior to the adoption, modification or deletion of any work rule or policy affecting CMAGE/CWA employees, the City shall submit the work rule or policy to CMAGE/CWA with fifteen (15) days notice for comment and input. The Union may request additional time for comment and input. Such request will not be unreasonably denied. In an emergency situation, the Union will be given immediate notice of any affected changes; otherwise, new or revised rules or policies shall be communicated to affected bargaining unit members at least seven (7) days prior to the effective date.
ARTICLE 6	- JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES

ARTICLE 7	- DISCIPLINE
Section 7.1.	Investigation.
(A)	When an Appointing Authority or designee acquires knowledge that may lead to disciplinary action against an employee or employees, the Appointing Authority or designee shall begin an investigation as soon as possible. The Appointing Authority or designee shall investigate all complaints against employees, whether the complainant is identified or anonymous.
(B)	The investigation shall be thorough and complete, and may include, but is not limited to, interviewing possible witnesses, including other bargaining unit members, and locating and researching any relevant documents. Any employee who may be a focus of the investigation may be interviewed as part of the investigatory process, in which event he/she may, upon request, have a Union representative present during that interview. If the employee declines Union representation, a waiver form, agreed upon by both parties, shall be signed by the employee and forwarded to the Union. If a Union representative is not available, and the employee desires a Union representative be present, the interview will be rescheduled within a reasonable period of time to permit the Union to be present.
(C)	The investigation must be concluded within a reasonable length of time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, from the date the Appointing Authority acquires knowledge that may lead to disciplinary action except for those situations set forth in Section 7.8.
Section 7.2.	Notice to Union after Completion of Investigation.
After the investigation has been completed, the Appointing Authority or designee will notify the Union of the results of the investigation. This notice shall be provided on a form agreed upon by the parties, notifying the Union of one of the following results:
14
(A)	Counseling, which may be oral or written, is not considered disciplinary action; or
(B)	Issuance of an oral reprimand; or
(C)	Issuance of a written reprimand; or
(D)	Notice that the Appointing Authority intends to bring disciplinary charges against the affected employee(s); or
(E)	Notice that the Appointing Authority intends to end the investigation with no further action.
Said notice shall be provided to the Union as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days after the Appointing Authority or designee gained knowledge of alleged misconduct by any employee, or at the conclusion of a criminal investigation or investigation of other allegations that local, state, or federal laws or executive orders of the Mayor, have been violated, or at the conclusion of criminal proceedings if criminal charges are filed against the employee.
Section 7.3.	Service of Disciplinary Actions.
(A)	If disciplinary charges are brought against any employee after the investigation has been completed, they shall be furnished to the employee in writing on a form agreed upon by the City and the Union and signed by the Appointing Authority or designee within ten (10) days after notice to the Union that the investigation has been completed. A copy of such form shall be made available to the CMAGE/CWA President. The Union shall be notified of the time and location of the hearing on the disciplinary charges and shall have the right to attend said hearing for the purpose of representing the employee and/or to protect the integrity of this Agreement.
(B)	Oral and written reprimands, signed by the Appointing Authority or designee, shall be furnished to the employee in writing on a form agreed upon by the City and the Union within ten (10) days after notice to the Union that the investigation has been completed.
(C)	When reasonable, the Appointing Authority or designee will serve disciplinary charges to the employee by personal service. If the employee cannot reasonably be served in person, the Appointing Authority or designee may serve disciplinary charges by regular U.S. mail and certified mail to the last home address furnished by the employee(s) to the Appointing Authority or designee.
(D)	Mail service shall be deemed complete three (3) days after mailing the disciplinary charges or reprimand to the employee’s home address.
15
(E)	The City shall provide, upon the Union’s request, access to the department/division’s evidence that is available at the time of the Union’s request.
Section 7.4.	Hearing on Disciplinary Charges.
(A)	A hearing on the merits of the disciplinary charges shall be conducted by the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee within thirty (30) days from the delivery of the charges to the employee. All hearings will be conducted in a fair manner, and the designated hearing officer will not assume the role of prosecutor in disciplinary hearings. When an Appointing Authority determines that an unclassified employee shall be terminated no hearing will be conducted.
(B)	If an Appointing Authority or designee brings disciplinary charges against an employee as a result of an investigation prompted by a complaint, the complainant will be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably possible, unless there is sufficient independent evidence to prove the charges by a preponderance.
(C)	The results of said hearing shall be in writing and given to the employee, with a copy sent to the CMAGE/CWA President, within twenty (20) days of the hearing.
(D)	For purposes of Article 7, disciplinary action which may be taken as a result of a disciplinary hearing may be an oral reprimand, a written reprimand, suspension and/or demotion or termination. Discipline shall be commensurate and progressive. Progressive discipline shall be governed by the seven (7) tests of just cause as recorded in the Enterprise Wire case. When an Appointing Authority determines that an unclassified employee shall be terminated, the just cause standard shall not apply to such termination.
(E)	The City and the Union shall each be granted one (1) continuance of the scheduled disciplinary hearing. Additional continuances may be granted by mutual consent between the Director of Human Resources or designee and the Union President or designee in writing. Continuances shall not be unreasonably withheld. Thereafter, the City may order an employee to attend a disciplinary hearing, and if the employee refuses, the City may hold the hearing in the employee’s absence.
16
Section 7.5.	Disciplinary Grievances.
If the Union is not satisfied with the results of the hearing, the Union may appeal this determination to Step 2 of the grievance procedure, together with any alleged violations of administrative procedures and time limits set forth in this Article. It is not the purpose of the Step 2 grievance meeting in discipline cases to conduct a de novo review of the evidence and testimony, but rather to review the case based on information and evidence developed through the disciplinary hearing conducted pursuant to Section 7.4.
Section 7.6.	Leave Forfeiture In Lieu of Suspension.
(A)	The designated hearing officer, after having found an employee guilty of one or more of the disciplinary charges, may make a recommendation as to the appropriate level of discipline.
(B)	Leave Forfeiture. Should this recommendation be a suspension, the Hearing Officer may make a written offer to the employee that the employee forfeit up to one hundred twenty (120) hours of accrued vacation or compensatory time, provided the employee has sufficient vacation and/or compensatory time balances at the time the offer is made. If the employee agrees to forfeit such accrued leave the forfeiture shall be one (1) hour of accrued leave for each one (1) hour of the proposed suspension. The type of leave (vacation or compensatory time) shall be the employee’s choice. The forfeiture of the leave shall constitute corrective/disciplinary action of record, shall be accordingly noted in the employee’s personnel file, and shall constitute the final resolution of the departmental charges, which resolution shall not later be subject to challenge by the employee or the Union under the grievance procedure or in any other forum. If the employee chooses to accept the Hearing Officer's written offer, the Hearing Officer shall acknowledge the employee's acceptance of the offer in writing. Should the Hearing Officer choose not to offer this option or should the employee reject the offer, appropriate disciplinary action shall be imposed.
Section 7.7.	Length of Time Prior Discipline May Be Considered.
Oral and written reprimands may be considered in connection with subsequent disciplinary action for a period of two (2) years, unless there has been further discipline during that time period. Any other form of disciplinary action may be considered in connection with subsequent disciplinary action for a period of three (3) years, unless there has been further discipline during that time period. City and Union representatives may agree to a shorter period of time as referenced herein by settlement of the parties. After the expiration of the periods specified above, such disciplinary action shall not be used as a basis for any further disciplinary action.
Section 7.8.	Exceptions/Extensions to Time Deadlines.
(A)	If an investigation requires more time to complete, the parties may agree to extend the time period. Such extensions shall not be unreasonably withheld by the Union.
17
(B)	The time constraint provisions of this Article shall not be applicable when actions of a criminal or conspiracy nature or when alleged violations of other local, state or federal laws, or Mayor’s executive orders, warrants extensive investigation, or upon mutual consent of the parties.
(C)	If an employee is off duty on approved or unapproved leave, the time limits for investigation, delivery of charges, hearing, and delivery of the results of hearing shall automatically be tolled. The parties may agree to extend any of the time lines in Article 7. All extensions of time lines must be reduced to writing and mutually agreed to between the parties.
ARTICLE 8	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 8.1.	Definition.
A grievance shall mean a complaint against the City arising under and during the term of this Agreement by an employee or CMAGE/CWA that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific terms of this Agreement, except that any dispute or difference of opinion concerning a matter or issue addressed by the Columbus Civil Service Commission's rules or which could be heard before the Columbus Civil Service Commission, except for disciplinary actions, shall not be considered a grievance under this Agreement.
Discipline involving suspensions, demotions and terminations pursuant to Article 7 of this Agreement may only be grieved according to this Article. Grievances regarding written reprimands may be filed at Step 1 and advanced to Step 2, but may not be referred to arbitration. The right of any bargaining unit employee to file an appeal from disciplinary action with the Civil Service Commission under Section 149-1 of the Columbus City Charter and/or the Civil Service Rules is specifically waived by this Agreement. Termination of probationary or unclassified employees shall not be grieved.
Section 8.2.	Procedure.
The parties are encouraged to resolve through informal discussions any grievances as defined herein. When specifically requested by the employee, a CMAGE/CWA representative may accompany the employee to assist in the informal resolution of the grievance. Such informal discussions are not to be construed as a part of the grievance procedure.
If such informal discussions do not lead to a satisfactory resolution of a grievance as defined herein, the grievance shall be processed according to the following procedure.
18
First Step:
(1)	If the employee or CMAGE/CWA is unable to resolve a grievance informally, a written statement of the grievance shall be prepared, signed by the Grievant and delivered to the aggrieved employee's Appointing Authority or designee within fourteen (14) days after the first event giving rise to the grievance or within fourteen (14) days after the employee or CMAGE/CWA, through the use of reasonable diligence, could have obtained knowledge of the first event giving rise to the grievance. An employee grievant shall deliver a copy of the written grievance to the CMAGE/CWA President. Grievants shall make every effort to specify the section or sections of this Agreement that are allegedly violated, misinterpreted, or misapplied, the full facts on which the grievance is based and the specific relief requested.
(2)	After the written grievance is submitted, the Appointing Authority or designee shall meet with the grievant within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. A CMAGE/CWA representative will be allowed to attend the First Step hearing. By mutual agreement of the Department representative and the Union, two CMAGE/CWA representatives may be allowed to attend the First Step hearing. The Appointing Authority or designee shall give a written answer to the President of the Union within ten (10) days after the hearing.
Second Step:
If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved at the First Step, the grievant and/or the Union may submit the grievance in writing to the Director of Human Resources or designee, within ten (10) days after receipt of the City's First Step answer, or within ten (10) days of when the First Step answer was due, whichever occurs first.
Hearings for Non-Disciplinary Grievances
The Director of Human Resources or designee shall meet with the grievant and the Union President or the Vice-President, and/or a representative of CWA within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. The Director of Human Resources or designee, after consultation with the grievant's Appointing Authority or designee, shall give a written answer to the President of the Union within ten (10) days after the hearing.
Meetings for Disciplinary Grievances
The Director of Human Resources or designee and appropriate representatives of the grievant’s department shall hold a meeting with the employee and the Union President or the Vice-President, and/or a representative of CWA within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. The hearing officer conducting the Step 2 disciplinary grievance meeting
19
shall not be the same hearing officer who conducted the disciplinary hearing pursuant to Section 7.4. The review of disciplinary cases at Step 2 shall be a meeting to review the case, not a hearing. Only evidence and/or information that was not available at the time of the disciplinary hearing will be independently reviewed. The Director of Human Resources or designee, after consultation with the grievant’s Appointing Authority, shall give a written answer to the President of the Union within ten (10) days after the meeting.
Third Step:
(1)	If CMAGE/CWA is not satisfied with the resolution at the Second Step, CMAGE/CWA may, through its President or his/her designee, refer the grievance to arbitration by written notice to the Director of Human Resources or designee within thirty (30) days after the decision is provided at the Second Step, or within thirty (30) days of when the answer in the Second Step was due, whichever occurs first.
(2)	A permanent panel of seven (7) arbitrators will be selected by the parties. An arbitrator shall be selected from the panel to hear grievances through random drawing. Once selected, the arbitrator’s name will no longer be available for selection until all remaining arbitrators on the panel have been selected. After all arbitrators on the panel have been selected once, the above process regarding random drawing will be repeated. The parties may mutually agree to remove an arbitrator from the panel after he/she has issued at least one (1) decision. This process shall be coordinated by the Union with the City at each step. Except in extraordinary circumstances, the arbitration hearing shall be conducted within sixty (60) days of the CMAGE/CWA notice to arbitrate. A request for an extension of time beyond sixty (60) days by either party shall not be unreasonably denied.
(3)	The arbitrator shall be notified of his/her selection and shall be requested to set a time and place for the hearing, subject to the availability of CMAGE/CWA and City representatives. If the selected arbitrator is unable to schedule the hearing within thirty (30) days and refuses/cancels twice for the same hearing, the parties may select another arbitrator.
(4)	The arbitrator shall submit his/her decision in writing within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later.
(5)	More than one grievance may be submitted to the same arbitrator if both parties mutually agree in writing.
20
(6)	The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne by the losing party of such arbitration. The arbitrator shall identify the losing party in his/her written decision. The parties will share other expenses only if agreed upon in advance of the hearing, unless the arbitrator requests a written transcript, in which case the court reporter fees and the cost of the arbitrator’s copy of the transcript shall be shared equally. If only one party requests a transcript, it shall pay for the entire cost of the transcript, and such transcript shall be the official record, which shall be unavailable to the other party unless it pays for one-half of the cost of the transcript.
(7)	The City and/or the Union shall supply adequate hearing room facilities for the arbitration hearing and shall excuse CMAGE/CWA representatives and witnesses from work with pay for purposes of participation at the hearing. Each party shall be responsible for otherwise compensating its own representatives and witnesses, and for any other expenses incurred by that party.
Section 8.3.	Limitation on Authority of Arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the question of whether there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific provisions of this Agreement based on the specific issue(s) submitted to the arbitrator by the parties in writing. If no joint written stipulation of the issue(s) is/are agreed to by CMAGE/CWA and the City, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine and decide the issue(s) raised by the grievance as submitted in writing at the First Step. The arbitrator shall be without power to make recommendations contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable laws or rules and regulations of administrative bodies that has the force and effect of law. The arbitrator shall not in any way limit or interfere with the powers, duties and responsibilities of the City under law and applicable court decisions. The decision of the arbitrator, if made in accordance with the jurisdiction and authority granted to the arbitrator pursuant to this Agreement, will be accepted as final by the City, CMAGE/CWA and the employee(s), and all parties will abide by the decision.
Section 8.4.	Mediation.
Prior to arbitration, the City and the Union may discuss any grievance pending arbitration for possible resolution. Upon joint agreement, the City and the Union may agree to submit any grievance for mediation. The Union shall be responsible for contacting a mediator and
arranging a mutually agreeable date for a mediation meeting.
Section 8.5.	Time Limits.
No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is submitted within fourteen (14) days after the first event giving rise to the grievance or within fourteen (14) days after the employee or CMAGE/CWA, through the use of reasonable diligence, could have obtained knowledge of the first event giving rise to the grievance. If a grievance is not presented within this time limit, it shall be considered "waived." If a grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limit or an agreed written extension
21
thereof, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the First Step Answer. Failure at any step of this procedure to hold a meeting or communicate a decision in a grievance within the specified time limits shall permit the aggrieved party to treat the grievance as denied and to proceed immediately to the next step. The parties may, by mutual agreement, extend in writing any of the time limits set forth in this Article.
Section 8.6.	Release Time for Grievance Meetings.
A grievant and CMAGE/CWA representatives, when applicable, shall be given paid time off to participate in informal discussions, First Step grievance hearings and Second Step grievance hearings/meetings as provided in Section 8.2, if the hearings are held at the request or consent of the City during the employee's working time. No other time spent on grievance matters shall be considered time worked for compensation purposes. The grievant shall use vacation, compensatory time, or unpaid leave for work time used for any other activities related to the investigation of, preparation for, or processing of a grievance, provided the employee's Appointing Authority or designee determines that time spent on such activities will not interfere with normal work activity.
ARTICLE 9	- NO STRIKE-NO LOCKOUT
Section 9.1.	No Strike.
During the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor any officers, agents or employees will instigate, promote, sponsor, engage in, or condone any strike, sympathy strike, secondary boycott, residential picketing, slowdown, sit-down, concerted stoppage of work, concerted refusal to perform overtime, mass absenteeism, mass resignations, or any other intentional interruption or disruption of the operations of the City at any location, regardless of the reason for so doing.
Each employee who holds a position of officer of the Union occupies a position of special trust and responsibility in maintaining and bringing about compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.1. Accordingly, the Union agrees to notify all Union officers and representatives of their obligations and responsibility for maintaining compliance with this Article, including their responsibility to abide by the provisions of this Article by remaining at work during any interruption as outlined above. In addition, in the event of a violation of this Section of this Article, the Union agrees to inform its members of their obligations under this Agreement and to encourage and direct them to work by all means available under its Constitution, Bylaws, or otherwise.
Section 9.2.	No Lockout.
The City will not lock out any employees during the term of this Agreement as a result of a labor dispute with the Union so long as there is good faith compliance with this Article, unless the City cannot efficiently operate in whole or in part due to a breach of Section 9.1.
22
Section 9.3.	Penalty.
The only matter which may be made the subject of any proceeding concerning disciplinary action imposed for an alleged violation of Section 9.1 is whether the employee actually engaged in such prohibited conduct. The failure to confer a penalty in any instance is not a waiver of such right in any other instance nor is it a precedent.
Section 9.4.	Judicial Relief.
Nothing contained herein shall preclude the City from obtaining a temporary restraining order, damages and other judicial relief in the event CMAGE/CWA or any employees covered by this Agreement violate this Article.
ARTICLE 10	- PERSONAL BUSINESS DAY
Each full-time bargaining unit member shall receive one (1) eight (8) hour Personal Business Day per vacation year to conduct personal business that cannot be conducted outside of the regular workday. The day shall not accumulate. If notice is given at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance, no reason needs to be stated, and no documentation will be required. If notice of less than forty-eight (48) hours is given, the leave may be approved at the discretion of the Appointing Authority or designee. The day shall have no cash-out value. The Personal Business Day cannot be used the day before or the day after a holiday. The use of this Personal Business Day is subject to the usual operational need requirement.

25 or more years	480 hours (60 days)
(C)	At the end of the vacation year, employees may be paid for vacation balances in excess of the maximums fixed by this Section 11.2 at the sole discretion of the Appointing Authority and upon certification by the Appointing Authority to the City Auditor, that due to exigent work requirements it is not in the best interest of the City to permit the employee to take vacation leave which would otherwise be forfeited as provided in this Section 11.2. The Appointing Authority must receive the approval of the Mayor’s Chief of Staff or designee, based upon guidelines prepared by the Departments of Human Resources and Finance. The amount of vacation time paid shall not exceed forty (40) hours in a given year, and ordinarily will not be considered unless the employee has made an effort to take vacation time at points in the year when the work load of the Department or Division can best afford for the employee to be absent from work.
(D)	Vacation accrual rates are based on total full-time City service for all employees, including prior full-time service with the City of Columbus. In addition, for employees hired prior to July 5, 1987, vacation accrual rates shall be based on the total of all periods of full-time employment with the City, the State of Ohio and any political subdivision of the State.
24
However, any employee who has retired from the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions, including the City of Columbus, and is or was reemployed or hired by the City of Columbus before, on or after July 5, 1987, shall not have prior full-time service with the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions, including the City of Columbus, recognized for purposes of determining the vacation accrual rate.
For employees who have not previously retired from City of Columbus employment, requests for recognition of periods of full-time service with the City of Columbus for accrual rate purposes shall be made in writing and forwarded to the City Auditor through the Appointing Authority before adjustments can be made to the vacation accrual rate. Adjustments to vacation accrual rates, based on previous full-time employment with the City of Columbus, as specified herein, shall be applied prospectively to be effective the first full pay period following the verification by the Appointing Authority to the City Auditor.
(E)	Any periods of interruption of service (including but not limited to resignation, layoff, or discharge for cause) as well as any periods of time in unpaid status of more than eight (8) hours (except for military leave without pay) will not be included in the computation of City service for the purpose of this Section 11.2.
(F)	The provisions of this paragraph shall be in lieu of any prospective or retrospective application of Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code. For all purposes herein, the parties agree that Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code does not apply to this Agreement or to any employees in the bargaining unit.
Section 11.3.	Eligibility.
No vacation credit shall be allowed for any 80-hour pay period in which a full-time employee does not receive compensation for at least forty (40) "hours of work”; the term "hours of work" for this purpose means actual work time plus paid holidays, vacations, sick leave, injury leave, military leave as provided in Section 14.1, CMAGE/CWA release time as provided in Section 4.6, jury duty and compensatory time off (no other paid or unpaid absences from duty shall be counted as "hours of work").
Section 11.4.	Approval by Appointing Authority.
All vacation leaves shall be taken at such time as may be approved by the Appointing Authority or designee. Vacation leave may be taken in increments as small as one-tenth (1/10th) of an hour with the approval of the Appointing Authority. Any employee having unused vacation leave prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall be credited with such unused vacation leave for the purpose of this Agreement within the maximum limits indicated in Section 11.2.
25
For annual vacation requests, if two (2) or more employees in the same classification in a section or reporting location request the same period of time during the vacation scheduling period for that section or reporting location, if any, classification seniority will determine preference. All other vacation requests will be considered on a first-come/first-serve basis.
Section 11.5.	Payment upon Separation from City Service.
An employee with vacation accrual who is about to be separated from City service through resignation, discharge, retirement, or layoff and who has unused vacation leave to his/her credit, shall be paid at the employee's hourly rate of pay at the time of separation in a lump sum or, at the employee's option, subject to approval by the Auditor's Office, the employee may elect in writing (at a time specified by the Auditor's Office for processing terminal leave pay) to receive three (3) equal installments - one-third (1/3) at the time of separation, one-third (1/3) one year later, and the final one-third (1/3) two years after separation (less applicable withholding) for each hour of unused vacation leave, less any amounts owed by the employee to the City, provided, however, that such payment shall not exceed the maximum number of vacation hours outlined in Section 11.2.
However, an employee who is involved in a layoff or certification termination and who has unused vacation leave to his/her credit at the time the layoff is effective, may choose, in lieu of a lump sum cash payment for such unused vacation credit, to leave such vacation credit on account to be restored to his/her credit upon reemployment, provided such reemployment occurs within thirty-five (35) calendar days. If the reemployment does not occur within thirty-five (35) calendar days, then any unused vacation leave left on account will be paid in lump sum to the employee, as provided for in this Section 11.5.
Section 11.6.	Payment upon Death.
When an employee dies, any and all accrued, unused vacation leave to his/her credit shall be paid to the surviving spouse. In the event that the employee has no surviving spouse, said unused vacation leave shall be paid to the employee's estate. Such payment shall be paid at the employee's hourly rate of pay at time of death in a lump sum (less applicable withholding), less any amounts owed by the employee to the City.
ARTICLE 12	- HOLIDAYS
Section 12.1.	Holidays Observed.
The legal holidays observed by the City and for which full-time non-seasonal employees are to be compensated shall be as follows:
26
(1)	New Year's Day, January 1
(2)	Martin Luther King's Birthday, the third Monday in January
(3)	President's Day, the third Monday in February
(4)	Memorial Day, the last Monday in May.
(5)	Independence Day, July 4
(6)	Labor Day, the first Monday in September
(7)	Columbus Day, the second Monday in October
(8)	Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November
(9)	Christmas Day, December 25
(10)	Any other holidays proclaimed by the Mayor
(11)	Employee's Birthday - If the employee's birthday falls on an above-named holiday, the employee shall be granted and compensated for one additional holiday. The Appointing Authority will allow the employee to take his/her birthday holiday within a year (365 days) from when the employee's birthday occurs, upon appropriate request by the employee, with approval of the Appointing Authority or designee. If the employee's birthday falls on February 29, the holiday for the purpose of this Section shall be considered as February 28 unless otherwise authorized by the Appointing Authority.
Section 12.2.	Eligibility and Pay.
(A)	When a holiday falls on the first day of an employee's regularly scheduled days off, it shall be celebrated on the previous day and when a holiday falls on the second day of an employee's regularly scheduled day off, it shall be celebrated on the following day, except that at the time of a shift change which necessitates more than a two-day weekend, a holiday which falls on either of the first two days shall be celebrated on the last previous workday, and a holiday which falls on any other day of such weekend shall be celebrated on the next subsequent workday.
(B)	For each holiday observed (including the employee's birthday), a full-time non-seasonal employee shall be excused from work for eight (8) hours on such day at the discretion of the Appointing Authority or designee. If a fulltime non-seasonal employee is working a flexible or alternative work schedule (i.e., anything other than eight (8) hours per day), his/her work schedule for the week shall be adjusted so that the time off on the holiday is equal to eight (8) hours. If one of the holidays mentioned in Section 12.1 occurs while an employee is on vacation leave, such day shall not be charged against vacation leave. Part-time and seasonal employees will only be compensated for time actually worked on holidays.
(C)	When a full-time non-seasonal overtime (D-level) eligible employee works on a day celebrated as a holiday (in accordance with Section 12.2(A) above), other than the employee's birthday, he/she shall be paid eight (8) hours at straight-time rates as holiday pay. An eligible employee who works on a holiday shall be paid at a rate of time and one-half (1%) for all hours actually worked on the employee’s regularly scheduled shift, which is considered premium pay.
27
For purposes of determining overtime eligibility, holiday pay as provided above shall count towards the forty (40) hour workweek. The hours worked on the holiday during the regularly scheduled shift do not count toward the forty (40) hour workweek. Any hours worked beyond the employee’s regularly scheduled shift on a holiday shall be counted toward the forty (40) hour workweek, if any.
(D)	To be eligible for holiday pay an employee must have worked the full workday before and the full workday after the holiday, in addition to the full holiday when scheduled as part of the employee's normal work schedule, unless the employee was on an approved vacation leave, jury duty, military leave as defined in Section 14.1 or compensatory time off, or unless otherwise approved by the Appointing Authority or designee with appropriate emergency medical documentation. The "workday before" refers to the employee's last regularly scheduled workday before the day on which the holiday is celebrated. The "workday after" refers to the first regularly scheduled workday following the day on which the holiday is celebrated. If an employee takes sick leave for all or part of either the work day before or the work day after a holiday, his/her absence from work on the holiday shall be presumed to be due to illness or other circumstance qualifying as sick leave under Section 13.7, and will, therefore, be paid for the holiday from his/her sick leave bank instead of holiday pay. If the sick leave is used as part of a disability waiting period the employee will receive holiday pay. If the sick leave is used for an extended illness as defined in Section 13.8, and the employee provides physician verification of the illness, the employee will receive holiday pay. If a D-level employee has no sick leave available under these circumstances, he/she shall be in unpaid status for the holiday.
(E)	For the purposes of administering the provisions of this Article 12, holiday time shall apply to the shift beginning on the day that is celebrated as a holiday.
ARTICLE 13	- SICK LEAVE
Section 13.1.	Computation of Sick Leave Bank for Full-Time Employees.
(A)	Sick leave banks for full-time employees shall consist of current annual entitlements under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, plus any hours carried over from previous years, transfers from other political subdivisions and hours carried over from other City employment outside the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit under the terms of this Agreement, less any appropriate reductions or deductions as outlined below. For purposes of carrying sick leave from year to year, the sick leave bank may be no more than four hundred (400) hours, less the annual sick leave entitlement.
28
(B)	On the first pay period of each calendar year, each full-time employee employed on that date shall receive seventy-two (72) hours of sick leave with pay for the remainder of that calendar year.
(C)	Each full-time employee hired on or after the first pay period of each year shall, on the date of hire receive his/her sick leave with pay for the remainder of that calendar year computed, as follows: six (6.0) hours for each calendar month in the calendar year of hire, commencing with the month following the month in which the employee was hired.
(D)	If an employee is in unpaid status for forty (40) hours or more in a calendar month, six (6.0) hours shall be deducted from the employee’s paid sick leave entitlement. For purposes of this Article, hours in unpaid status do not include military leave without pay or unpaid FMLA hours. No other unpaid absences shall be counted as hours of work.
When an employee is required to report to work and does so report but is denied work because of circumstances beyond his/her control, absence from work under these circumstances shall not be considered as unpaid work status for purposes of this paragraph, except if the employee is laid off as provided in this Contract.
(E)	If an employee changes from full-time non-seasonal status to part-time or seasonal status during a calendar year in which he/she was eligible for sick leave, six (6.0) hours shall be deducted from his/her paid sick leave account for each full calendar month in which the employee is in part-time or seasonal status.
(F)	Effective on or after January 1, 2006, employees entering the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit from any other City employment may carry over up to four hundred (400) hours of their sick leave entitlement, which will become part of the employee’s sick leave bank. Any hours in excess of four hundred (400) hours will be forfeited without compensation. Employees entering the bargaining unit will not be subject to sick leave conversion as was provided in previous Agreements between the Union and the City.
(G)	Employees who entered the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit prior to the effective date of this Agreement, who were subject to sick leave conversion under the terms of the prior CMAGE/CWA Agreement, may elect to continue to receive payment on their remaining balance, or to add the remaining hours to their sick leave bank. If the employee elects to add the hours to his/her sick leave bank, those sick leave banks may not exceed 400 (four hundred) hours. Any hours in excess of four hundred (400) hours shall be paid at the employee’s straight-time regular hourly rate at the time of payment. Employees must make that election on or before February 1, 2006.
29
(H)	Employees entering the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit from outside the City, who have accrued sick leave from another political subdivision of the State of Ohio may transfer that sick leave upon their employment by the City. Any hours transferred from another political subdivision of the State of Ohio, after March 31, 1987, shall not be subject to payment upon termination or separation from the City for whatever reason. Such hours will not count toward the sick leave bank with the City.
(I)	Under no circumstances will an employee's CMAGE/CWA Sick Leave Bank be allowed to accumulate over four hundred (400) hours of sick leave. If an employee has more than four hundred (400) hours of sick leave, following any payment of sick leave reciprocity, those hours will be paid at the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate at the time of payment. No interest shall be paid by the City on this account.
Section 13.2.	Eligible Uses of Sick Leave with Pay; Procedures.
(A)	Sick leave with pay will be at an employee's regular straight-time hourly rate and shall be allowed to full-time employees in one-tenth (1/10th) of an hour increments for the following purposes:
(1)	Illness of, or injury to, the employee, whether at work or non-work related.
(2)	Physical, dental, or mental consultation or treatment of the employee by professional medical or dental personnel, whether work or non-work related.
(3)	Sickness of a spouse, child, stepchild, and upon prior approval of the Appointing Authority, a family member who is dependent upon the employee for his/her health and well being.
(4)	Quarantine because of contagious disease. The Appointing Authority or designee shall require a certificate of the attending physician before allowing any paid sick leave under this subsection.
(5)	Death in the employee's immediate family, as that term is defined in Article 1, Definitions, of this Agreement.
(6)	Maternity, paternity and adoption leave.
(B)	Any leave which is granted under this Section for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave as provided in Section 14.9 shall be charged as an FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve-week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
(C)	To the extent that it is possible to do so, employees shall submit sick leave requests in advance for medical appointments and scheduled treatments. Employees calling off sick shall complete and submit sick leave requests to their supervisors promptly upon their return to work.
30
(D)	In cases of extended illness (defined as three (3) or more consecutive work days or frequent intermittent use of sick leave) or suspected abuse, as determined by the Appointing Authority or designee, the Appointing Authority or designee may require evidence as to the adequacy of the reason(s) for an employee's absence during the time for which sick leave is requested.
(E)	Such evidence documenting the reasons for an employee's absence (both for illness of the employee, or his/her immediate family) is defined as a certificate acceptable to the Appointing Authority or designee stating date(s) of treatment and the diagnosis, prognosis and expected return to work date from a licensed physician or other appropriate medical professional; provided, however, that falsification of either a written signed statement of the employee or a physician's certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal, as well as grounds for denial of sick leave.
(F)	Any sick leave that is determined after investigation as improperly used by the employee shall be repaid to the City.
(G)	If the Appointing Authority or designee has reason to question the ability of an employee to return to work, the Appointing Authority or designee may also require a certification that the employee is able to return to duty at the conclusion of a sick leave. If that certification from the employee’s treating physician is not forthcoming or satisfactory, the Appointing Authority or designee may require the employee to be examined by a licensed physician or other appropriate medical professional identified by the Appointing Authority or designee. Failure to submit to the examination shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action as well as grounds for denial of sick leave.
Section 13.3.	Advances on Sick Leave by City Council.
Except as provided by discretionary action of the City Council, sick leave cannot be taken before it is credited to an employee's sick leave account. In appropriate circumstances and within the discretion of City Council, employees may receive sick leave in advance upon passage of an ordinance by City Council authorizing such an advance. Any employee who has been advanced additional sick leave time by action of City Council must agree as a condition of the advance to have amounts deducted from his/her sick leave account, during the first pay period of each year, not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours, until the advance is repaid. Under no circumstances shall an employee's annual sick leave entitlement be reduced by more hours than the aggregate yearly amount as set forth in the ordinance authorizing said advancement. Except as herein written, all provisions of the original ordinance advancing sick leave shall remain in effect.
31
Section 13.4.	Annual Sick Leave Reciprocity Payment.
(A)	During November of each year, each employee shall elect one of the following:
(1)	To be paid, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time, for any unused sick leave hours awarded during the preceding calendar year, up to a maximum of seventy-two (72) hours, on a one-for-one basis; or
(2)	To carry over all unused sick leave hours to the next year as part of the employee's sick leave bank; or
(3)	To split on a 50/50 basis (rounded to the nearest 1/10 of an hour) the remaining annual entitlement with one-half (1/2) going to the employee’s CMAGE/CWA sick leave bank and one-half (1/2) being paid out in sick leave reciprocity.
(B)	Any hours of sick leave taken during the payroll year shall be deducted from the maximum amount of annual sick leave reciprocity (i.e., 72 hours) prior to calculating the annual sick leave reciprocity payment.
(C)	If an employee uses five (5) days or less of injury leave (regardless of the number of claims) during the year, this leave shall not be considered sick leave taken for computing sick leave reciprocity. If an employee uses more than five (5) days of injury leave, all injury leave used during the year will be considered hours of sick leave taken in computing sick leave reciprocity.
(D)	Employees who fail to sign the payroll register making an election to carry over, receive payment, or split their sick leave as outlined above shall maintain the same option as they elected the prior year.
(E)	Employees cannot carry over their sick leave if by doing so they will exceed a total of four hundred (400) hours in their sick leave bank. Any hours in excess of four hundred (400) hours will be paid at the employee’s straight-time hourly rate in effect at the time of payment.
Section 13.5.	Disposition of Sick Leave Balances upon Separation from City Employment.
(A)	Annual Sick Leave Entitlement. When an employee separates from City service through resignation, retirement or layoff on or before December 31, the employee shall receive payment for his/her annual sick leave entitlement as defined in Section 13.1 as follows:
(1)	The annual sick leave entitlement which that employee has to his/her credit at the time of separation shall be reduced by six (6.0) hours for each calendar month remaining in the calendar year following the month of separation.
32
(2)	If, after such calculation, the employee has any unused sick leave for
that year, the employee shall be paid, at the time of separation, for such unused sick leave hours, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time, less applicable withholding and any amounts owed by the employee to the City.
(3)	If, after such calculation, the employee has used more sick leave hours than that to which he/she was entitled, an amount shall be deducted from his/her final paycheck for such hours, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time.
(B)	Sick Leave Bank. All sick leave in the employee’s sick leave bank may be paid to the employee who is separating from City service as follows: The number of accumulated unused hours up to three hundred twenty (320) hours shall be divided by two (2) and multiplied by the employee's hourly rate of pay at time of separation. All such lump sum payments are subject to applicable withholding and deduction for any sums owed by the employee to the City.
(C)	Transferring Sick Leave to Other Political Subdivisions. Employees who are leaving City service to accept employment with another political subdivision of the State of Ohio may elect to transfer sick leave to that political subdivision, if it will accept such a transfer. Employees must elect to be paid or transfer sick leave balances to another political subdivision in writing prior to termination and at a time specified by the Auditor's Office for processing terminal leave pay.
(D)	Separation Pay for Sick Leave Transferred from Other Political Subdivisions. Any sick leave transferred to the City prior to March 31, 1987 shall be paid upon separation at the straight-time hourly rate in effect on March 31, 1987 using the payment formula of the transferring agency.
(E)	Payment Upon Death. If an employee dies during employment with the City, his/her unused sick leave account balances as defined herein shall be paid to a surviving spouse. In the event that the employee has no surviving spouse, said balance shall be paid to the employee's estate. The employee's sick leave balances shall be valued at the time of death in accordance with the applicable Sections of this Article.
33
Section 13.6.	Sick Leave Disposition When Moving from Full-Time to Part-Time Status.
For any employee who moves from full-time status to part-time status on or before December 31 of any calendar year and who has used more sick leave hours than that to which the employee was entitled, the value of such hours shall first be deducted from the employee's sick leave bank. If the employee has insufficient hours in his/her bank, such hours will be deducted from earned and unused vacation accruals to the employee's credit. If the employee does not have sufficient sick leave and vacation leave to cover the additional sick leave hours credited, the City shall develop a schedule to recover the funds out of any subsequent bi-weekly pay checks.
ARTICLE 14	- OTHER LEAVES OF ABSENCE

(A)	Full-time non-seasonal employees who are members of the Ohio National Guard, U.S. Air Force Reserve, U.S. Army Reserve, U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, U.S. Naval Reserve or U.S. Coast Guard Reserve shall be granted military leave of absence with pay when ordered to temporary active duty (e.g., active duty for training or annual training) for a maximum of twenty-two (22) eight (8) hour work days (176 hours), days, whether or not consecutive, during each calendar year. Active duty does not include inactive duty training (e.g., unit training assemblies). In the event that the Chief Executive Officer of the State of Ohio, or the Chief Executive Officer of the United States declares that a state of emergency exists, the employee, if ordered to active duty for purposes of that emergency, shall be paid pursuant to this Section 14.1 for a maximum of an additional twenty-two (22) eight (8) hour work days (176 hours), whether or not consecutive, during each calendar year.
(B)	An employee shall be paid his/her regular salary for each scheduled workday such employee is absent during military leave of absence with pay authorized by this Section 14.1.

Time so served upon a jury shall be deemed active service with the City for all purposes. The employee is required to obtain a signed record from the courts to document the time spent on jury duty. Upon receipt of payment for jury service during regular working
34
hours, the employee shall deposit such funds with the City Treasurer. An employee on jury duty leave who is normally assigned to the second or third shift in a twenty-four (24) hour continuous operation shall be assigned to the first shift, Monday through Friday, for the duration of his/her jury duty.
(B)	When an employee receives notice for jury duty in any court of record of Franklin County, Ohio, or in any adjoining county, he/she shall present such notice to his/her immediate supervisor. A copy will be made of the notice and filed and recorded in the employee's personnel file.
(1)	When notified by the court to report for jury duty on a day certain, a time report shall be completed and signed by the assignment commissioner or appropriate court official for each day during jury service setting forth the time of arrival and departure from the court. Such record shall be presented by the employee to his/her supervisor upon return to work.
(2)	When an employee is not required to be in court for jury duty for two (2) or more hours of his/her regular shift, he/she shall report to work for such time at the beginning of his/her work shift before being required to report to jury duty and/or after being released from jury duty two (2) or more hours before the end of his/her work shift. The supervisor in each individual case shall determine the time the employee shall be released from work to report to jury duty or return to work after being released from jury duty.

The provisions of Section 14.2(B)(2) above shall apply to all leaves granted under this Section 14.4.
35
Section 14.5.	Disaster Leave.
Time off with pay shall be allowed to a fully qualified employee for service in specialized disaster relief service for the American Red Cross. Said leave shall be granted only after the requisition of the individual serving in such capacity by the American Red Cross. Eligibility of any employee for such service shall be established prior to the granting of leave and is subject to the approval of the Appointing Authority for the individual involved.
Section 14.6.	Personal Leave.
Employees who have completed their probationary period may be granted personal leave of absence without pay by the Appointing Authority for good cause but employment other than with the City will not be considered grounds for such leave. Such leave may not exceed sixty (60) calendar days; however, extensions may be granted under the Civil Service Rules, if such need arises. Any such leave which is granted for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave as provided in Section 14.9 shall be charged as an FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve-week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
Section 14.7.	Educational Leave.
Employees may be granted a leave of absence without pay by the Appointing Authority for educational purposes. Such leave shall initially be limited to sixty (60) calendar days with possible extensions up to one (1) year provided such further educational pursuits are related to the operations of the City. Tuition reimbursement, as outlined in Section 23.1 of this Agreement, will not apply towards such leave.
Section 14.8.	Injury Leave.
(A)	On-The-Job Injuries. All employees shall be allowed injury leave with pay up to a maximum of sixty (60) workdays per calendar year for on-the-job injuries, not to exceed a total of one hundred twenty (120) workdays per injury.

Any injury leave which is granted for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave as provided in Section 14.9 shall be charged as an FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
Injuries must be reported to the employee's immediate supervisor no more than two (2) working days after such injury is known. If an employee who has been granted injury leave does not begin receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation by the time the injury leave has been exhausted, and the employee has a claim filed under the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation laws for such payment, then the City shall continue to pay the employee seventy-two percent (72%) or sixty-six and 2/3 percent (66 2/3%), whichever is applicable, of his/her wages until such time as payments from the Bureau are received or the claim is denied by the Industrial Commission of Ohio. In any instance of double payment by both the City and the Bureau for the same day or days, the employee shall provide full reimbursement to the City in a prompt manner.
36
(B)	Determination by the Department of Human Resources.
(1)	Report of Injury. All then available medical documentation, supporting documentation, and a report of the cause of all injuries, both original or recurrent, must be submitted by the employee to the employee’s immediate supervisor within fourteen (14) days from the date the injury is known. Signatures of the employee’s immediate supervisor, the Division Administrator, and the Appointing Authority are required thereafter. Claims must be submitted through the Department or Division Human Resources representative, to the Human Resources Department within a total of twenty-eight (28) days from the date the injury is known (provided, however, that an employee’s eligibility for injury leave shall not be prejudiced by a delay in filing caused by supervisors if the employee has complied with his/her fourteen (14) day filing deadline). Except that the Director of Human Resources or designee, may grant additional time if the doctor fails to provide additional information that has been timely requested.
(2)	Actual Performance of Duties. Injury leave with pay shall be granted to an employee only for original or recurrent injuries determined by the Director of Human Resources or designee as caused by the performance of the actual duties of his/her position. Whenever an employee is required to stop working because of an injury or other service connected disability, he/she shall be paid for the remaining hours of that day or shift at his/her regular rate, and such time shall not be charged to leave of any kind. The City may require an independent medical examination for any employee requesting injury leave, at the City's expense.
(3)	Written Authorization and Return to Work. No employee shall be granted injury leave with pay unless the Appointing Authority has in his/her possession written authorization signed by the Director of Human Resources or designee indicating the approximate length of the leave. No employee on injury leave shall be returned to work without the written approval of an attending physician. If there is a recurrence of a previous injury, the Appointing Authority must request approval of injury leave for each recurrence. If, in the judgment of the Director of Human Resources or designee, the injury is such that the employee is capable of performing his/her regular duties or light duties during the period of convalescence, he/she shall so notify the Appointing Authority in writing and deny injury leave with pay.

(4)	Continued Contact with Division and Return to Work Notification. An employee on injury leave shall maintain oral biweekly contact with the division personnel officer or designee during the period of time he/she is injured.

(6)	Outside Employment. No injury leave payments shall be made to any employee who is working for another employer: (1) during the employee's regular City shift, or (2) where such work involves or requires the performance of the same or similar duties as those regularly performed by the employee for the City, or (3) where such job involves duties and/or physical demands the performance of which would conflict with the injury/medical condition allowed.

Fraudulent actions are subject to disciplinary action where appropriate.
(9)	Leave Pending Decision. Pending a decision by the Director of Human Resources or designee, an employee applying for injury leave may be carried on sick leave or vacation leave with pay, in that order, which shall be restored to his/her credit upon certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. However, when an employee is applying for injury leave, exclusive of apparent heart attack cases, and the Division Administrator can establish that the injury occurred during the employee's hours of work for the City, then the employee may be carried on injury leave with pay pending certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. In no case may the employee be carried on injury leave for a period of time in excess of the employee's amount of accumulated sick leave and vacation leave prior to certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has

(10)	Appeal to Board of Industrial Relations. Any injured employee may appeal the decision of the Director of Human Resources or designee by written notice to the Board of Industrial Relations within ten (10) days of notification that injury leave has been denied.

(C)	Time Off for Examination and Treatment. Pursuant to rules established by the Director of Human Resources or designee, time off for the purpose of medical examination, including examinations by the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, and/or treatments resulting from injury occurring during any period of time an employee was in paid status and performed services for the City required by his/her employment shall be charged to injury leave. Actual time spent, not to exceed four (4) hours of injury leave shall be allowed per scheduled physician's appointment and/or treatment resulting from an on-the-job injury (including travel time). The Director of Human Resources or designee may approve an employee's request for injury leave of greater than four (4) hours for a scheduled physician's appointment or for treatment resulting from an on-the-job injury if the Director of Human Resources or designee determines that such request is supported by medical documentation. However, such medical documentation must be submitted to and in a form acceptable to the Director of Human Resources or designee by the employee prior to such appointment and/or treatment in order to be considered.

While an employee is on approved injury leave with pay, PERS contributions and all employee benefits (except sick leave, vacation and holidays, as provided elsewhere in this Agreement shall continue uninterrupted and the City shall maintain applicable insurance benefits for the employee until such time as the employee returns to duty or is terminated from employment. Upon proof that an employee is receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, applicable insurance benefits shall continue uninterrupted until the employee returns to duty or is terminated from employment. In all cases where insurance benefits are continued, the employee must make arrangements to pay their share of insurance premiums monthly in advance.

(6)	Prenatal care by a health care provider.
41
(D)	Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only when medically necessary to treat serious health conditions, or the serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child or parent.

(E)	Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee shall be returned to the position held prior to the leave or an equivalent position.
(F)	The City shall maintain insurance benefits for the duration of FMLA leave at the level and under the same conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in active work status for the duration of the leave.
(G)	During an unpaid FMLA leave, employees shall not continue to accrue seniority or continuous service and shall not accrue any employment benefits for the period of the leave, except for continuation of insurance benefits as provided in Paragraph (F) immediately above and in Section 18.4 of this Agreement.
(H)	All accrued sick leave benefits, and disability leave benefits when applicable, must be utilized for any FMLA leave taken for any FMLA-qualifying reason. All accrued vacation leave benefits must be substituted for all or part of any unpaid FMLA leave taken for any reason after sick leave benefits have first been exhausted except the employee may at the employee’s request, retain a vacation balance not to exceed forty (40) hours when exhausting family medical leave, sick leave and vacation.
(I)	The following notice and scheduling requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Employees must give thirty (30) days notice to the City before taking FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must notify the City as soon as is practicable (normally no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the need for the leave becomes known).
(2)	If an employee has actual notice of the notice requirement stated in 14.9(I)(1) above, (this requirement of actual notice is fulfilled by posting a notice at the work-site), and fails to provide the City with thirty (30) days notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the City may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the employee provides notice.
42
(3)	Employees shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the City aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The City may inquire further of the employee if it is necessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is to be taken.
(4)	If an employee takes leave based on the serious health condition of the employee or to care for a family member, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as to not unduly disrupt the City's operation.
(J)	The following medical certification requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Employees who request leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member shall be required to provide a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee's family member on a form acceptable to the Human Resources Director or designee. For theemployee's own medical leave, the certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee's position and a statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for the condition by the health care provider (including estimated number of visits, nature, frequency and duration of treatment). For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include a statement that the patient requires assistance for basic medical, hygiene, nutritional needs, safety or transportation, or that the employee's presence or assistance would be beneficial or desirable for the care of the family member, and an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to provide care.
(2)	The City shall give employees requesting FMLA leave written notice of the requirement for medical certification.
(3)	In its discretion, the City may require a second medical opinion at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the City, at its own expense, may obtain the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the employee and the City.
(4)	Employees must provide the requested certification to the City within the time frame requested by the City, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The City must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the City's request for certification.
43
(5)	In most cases, the City shall request that an employee furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the employee requests leave or soon after the leave is requested, or in the case of unforeseen leave, soon after the leave commences. The City may request certification or re-certification at some later date if the City has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.
(6)	Certification shall be submitted using a form approved by the Human Resources Director for use by employees consistent with the FMLA.
(7)	All employees who take FMLA leave because of their own serious health condition shall be required to provide medical certification of their fitness to report back to work. The City may seek fitness for duty certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave.
(K)	The City may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work. A FMLA leave will not be granted to permit an employee to accept gainful employment elsewhere, including self-employment. If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return, the City's obligations under FMLA to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee cease.
(L)	Leaves that are granted under any other provision of this Agreement, whether paid or unpaid, for purposes which are covered under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall be charged as FMLA Leave and shall be subject to the twelve-week per year limitation for the length of a FMLA leave.

This Section 14.10 is not to be construed as requiring the assignment of transitional return to work in any case, but only that reasonable efforts to do so will be made. This will be done in accordance with the following:
(A)	During the time an employee is in a transitional return to work program, the employee will be assigned duties which the employee is capable of performing based upon the recommendation of the employee’s attending physician. Such assignment shall not exceed ninety (90) days. Duties will be reviewed bi-weekly and may be discontinued at any time.
44
(B) Upon request of the City, employees must participate in the transitional
return to work program unless precluded from participation by their
attending physician.
(C)	A transitional return to work assignment may be to a classification in a lower pay range and the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay will not be reduced
(D)	The terms of the transitional return to work arrangements shall be reduced to writing including the instructions of the employee’s attending physician.

A full-time employee in active service is eligible to receive regular pay for up to fifty-six (56) hours of leave per year for the employee’s donation of adult bone marrow.
Such leave shall be charged as Family Medical Leave (FMLA) as provided in Section 14.9 and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave provided the employee qualifies as provided in Section 14.9(A).
Paid time off pursuant to this Section is subject to review of appropriate medical documentation by the Director of Human Resources or designee.
Section 14.13.	Bereavement Observed.
A bargaining unit member may be granted up to five (5) days of available leave (i.e., sick leave, vacation leave, or compensatory time in accordance with Articles 11, 13, and 15) to be paid as chosen by the employee for the death of a member of the employee’s immediate family. In the event of no available leave balances, the employee may be granted leave without pay in accordance with Section 14.6 of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 15	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 15.1.	Application of Article.
This Article is intended only as a basis for calculating overtime payments for overtime eligible (i.e., only D-level) employees and to generally describe the parameters for employees' work schedules, and nothing in this Article or Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per shift, per week, or any other period.
Section 15.2.	Normal Work Period and Workday.
Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the current normal work period for employees shall be seven (7) days. The normal workday shall be eight (8) hours of work, plus an unpaid lunch period scheduled near the middle of an employee's shift, subject to operating requirements. The current normal work schedule consists of five (5) eight (8) hour workdays in a seven (7) day work period. The City reserves the right, however, to establish or approve alternate work schedules in its discretion, and to determine the beginning and ending of the seven (7) day work period, scheduled days off and the beginning and ending time of all work shifts in a day.
Section 15.3.	Changes In Normal Work Schedule, Work Period and Workday.
Should it be necessary in the interest of efficient operations to establish schedules departing from the normal or established work schedule, work period, workday or shifts, the Appointing Authority or his/her designee will give at least forty-eight (48) hours notice where practicable of such change to the individuals affected by such change.
Section 15.4.	Overtime Pay.
(A)	Employee Eligibility. Employees whose job classifications are listed in Appendix B, E-level classifications, of this Agreement are not eligible to receive compensation for overtime worked. Employees whose job classifications are listed in Appendix B, D-level classifications, of this Agreement are eligible to receive payment in cash or compensatory time off for overtime worked as provided in this Section 15.4.
(B)	Overtime Eligibility and Pay. When any D-level employee works between forty (40) and forty-eight (48) hours in a seven (7) day work period, he/she shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for each overtime hour worked. Overtime worked beyond forty-eight (48) hours in a seven (7) day work period shall be paid at double time his/her regular straight time hourly rate. Overtime pay shall be received in one-tenth (1/10th) of an hour segments. For purposes of this Article, time worked shall include only that time spent on duty as provided by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), plus time compensated but not actually worked for jury duty and holidays, but shall not include any other uncompensated periods or time which is compensated but not actually worked, including but not limited to
46
vacations, sick leave, injury leave, compensatory time-off, or any other paid or unpaid leave of absence. All overtime shall be paid on the basis of a regular straight-time hourly rate calculated by dividing an employee's annual salary by 2080.
(C)	Authorization of Overtime. It shall be the policy of the City to avoid overtime work except in emergency conditions as determined by the Appointing Authority or designee. Overtime work may only be performed on the authorization of the Appointing Authority or designee. Employees who are requested to work emergency overtime shall be informed prior to the overtime work as to whether the overtime has been expressly approved. The City reserves the right to require overtime work.
(D)	Overtime Distribution. Employees shall be canvassed annually to determine if they want to be offered overtime opportunities outside of their regular hours of work. Overtime eligibility list shall be established based on seniority and the initial opportunities shall be offered based upon seniority. Thereafter, insofar as practicable, overtime shall be equitably distributed on a rotating basis by overtime hours worked among those who normally perform the work. Specific arrangements for implementation of these overtime provisions shall be worked out at the department level. Overtime roster shall be purged at least every twelve (12) months. Such arrangements shall recognize that in the event the City has determined the need for overtime, and if a sufficient number of employees is not secured through the above provisions, the City shall have the right to require the least senior employee(s) on a rotating basis who normally performs the work to perform said overtime. The overtime distribution policy shall not apply to overtime work which is specific to a particular employee's work load or specialized work assignment or when the incumbent is required to finish a work assignment. An employee who is offered but refuses an overtime assignment shall be credited on the roster with the amount of overtime worked by the employee who accepted the overtime opportunity. An employee who agrees to work overtime and then fails to report for said overtime shall be credited with the amount of overtime hours accepted and the employee shall be considered absent without approved leave, unless the employee can prove that extenuating circumstances prevented the employee from reporting. In such cases the employee will be credited as if the overtime opportunity was refused. In the event of an emergency as determined by the City, the Appointing Authority or designee may assign someone to temporarily meet the emergency requirements, regardless of the overtime distribution roster.
Section 15.5.	Compensatory Time.
(A)	Eligibility. A compensatory time account may be established for hourly full-time non-seasonal employees whose job classifications are listed in Appendix B, D-level classifications, of this Agreement.
47
(B)	Compensatory Time Calculation. Compensatory time may only be earned at the applicable rate as established in Section 15.4(B) in lieu of cash payment for authorized time worked on an overtime basis. By mutual agreement of the employee and the Appointing Authority or his/her designee, an employee shall receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime payment at the applicable rate for time worked on an overtime basis. Compensatory time account balances shall be maintained in units of hours.
(C)	Conditions Governing Use and Accumulation. Compensatory time off shall be taken by the employee at such time or times as may be approved or established by the Appointing Authority. Any compensatory time account balance above eighty (80) hours shall be paid off at the employee's hourly rate as of the end of a pay period established by the Appointing Authority for each Division within the Appointing Authority's jurisdiction. The cut-off time established pursuant to this section shall be set no less than six (6) months in advance of the pay period selected. Notice of the date of the end of the selected pay period shall be posted within the Division and shall be sent to the City Auditor. No interest is to be paid by the City on any compensatory time account. Except for employees engaged in a public safety activity, emergency response activity or seasonal activity, employees who have accrued two hundred forty (240) hours of compensatory time, shall be paid for any additional overtime hours of work over two hundred forty (240). For employees working in a public safety activity, emergency response activity or seasonal activity, who have accrued four hundred eighty (480) hours of compensatory time shall be paid for any additional overtime hours of work over four hundred eighty (480).
(D)	Payment upon Separation from City Service or Death. An employee separated from City service for any reason or who dies while still employed shall be paid for any unused compensatory time account balance to his/her credit upon separation or death (less applicable withholding), less any amounts owed by the employee to the City. In the event of death, the payment shall be made to the employee's surviving spouse or to the employee's estate in the event there is no surviving spouse. Such payment shall be calculated by multiplying the employee's regular hourly straight time wage rate at the time of separation or death by the number of hours in his/her compensatory time account balance.
Section 15.6.	Call-Back Pay.
Callback pay applies only to full-time non-seasonal employees in a D-level classification as provided in Appendix B. A call-back is defined as an unscheduled work assignment that does not immediately precede or follow an employee's scheduled work hours. When an eligible employee is called back by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee to report to work after he/she has been relieved of duty upon the completion of his/her regular schedule and he/she does so report, he/she shall be paid for a minimum of four (4) hours or the actual hours worked, whichever is greater, at one and one half (1
48
% ) the employees straight time rate, or if applicable double (2) time rates as provided in Section 15.4(B), unless the time extends to his/her regular work shift or unless the individual is called back to rectify his/her own error (in these latter two situations, the four (4) hour minimum shall not apply, but the employee shall be paid for actual time worked at applicable rates. If an employee is called back to work he/she will be paid from the time he/she leaves his/her home until the time they report in up to one (1) hour. This Section 15.6 does not apply in cases of overtime authorized as an extension of a regular shift.
Section 15.7.	Report-In Pay.
Report-in pay applies only to a full-time non-seasonal employee in a D-level classification as provided in Appendix B. When an employee eligible for report-in pay reports for work on his/her assigned shift and has not received written notification from the Appointing Authority or his/her designee by the previous workday not to report, he/she shall be assigned at least three (3) hours of work at any available job, or in the event that no work is available, he/she shall be paid three (3) hours straight-time at his/her regular hourly rate and released from duty no more than thirty (30) minutes after the report-in time. All written notices not to report shall be countersigned by the employee affected. This Section shall not apply in hazardous weather conditions, power failure, equipment failure, work stoppages or other conditions beyond the immediate control of the City.
Section 15.8.	Late Reporting Procedure.
In the absence of a reasonable excuse as determined by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee, the failure of any employee to report to or cause himself to be reported
late or off duty in any City operation with two or three shifts at least one (1) hour before his/her scheduled starting time shall constitute and be reported as an absence without leave for all scheduled hours which were not worked. All other employees shall report or cause themselves to be reported late or off duty thirty (30) minutes prior to their regularly scheduled starting time, or at their regularly scheduled starting time, depending upon the reporting procedures established at their work location. Failure to report or to be reported in at the specified time above shall constitute and be reported as an absence without leave for all scheduled hours which were not worked.
The above provisions will not apply where it is impossible for the employee to comply due to circumstances beyond the employee's control, provided that the employee will then report or cause himself to be reported at the earliest opportunity followed by an acceptable written explanation of the circumstances that caused him/her not to report as directed.
Section 15.9.	No Pyramiding.
Compensation shall not be paid (nor compensatory time taken) more than once for the same hours under any provision of this Article or Agreement.

(A)	As the result of a labor/management partnership, the parties developed a new pay plan effective December 5, 2004. The CMAGE/CWA pay plan is based on the pay structure and classification assignments to pay grades as set forth in Appendices A and B.
(1)	A two percent (2%) percentage base increase (PBI) will be effective at the beginning of the pay period which includes August 23, 2005. A three percent (3%) percentage base increase (PBI) will be effective at the beginning of the pay period which includes August 23, 2006. A four percent (4%) percentage base increase (PBI) will be effective at the beginning of the pay period which includes August 23, 2007.
(2)	The parties agree that the pay structure will increase one percent (1%) less than the annual PBI to ensure overall competitiveness. Factors necessary to be considered include, but are not be limited to:
(a)	Economic indicators, i.e., inflation, cost of labor, etc.
(b)	Impact to Pay Plan, i.e., compression with other City pay plans, impact to employees at pay grade minimum and maximum.
(B)	Step X is a compensation mechanism used to accommodate a specific set of circumstances in which an employee’s pay rate may exceed the pay grade maximum for his/her classification. It authorizes the employee’s current base pay rate to be continued when it exceeds the maximum of the pay grade until the point in time that the pay grade increases enough to include the employee’s base pay rate. Those circumstances may include:
52
(1)	The pay grade assignment for a classification is changed as a result of market analysis conducted by the Department of Human Resources, and in negotiation with the Union, and the employee’s pay rate exceeds the new pay grade maximum; or
(2)	Any Civil Service Commission action which creates a reallocation to different classifications that results in the incumbent(s)’ current pay rate(s) exceeding the new pay grade maximum.
(3)	While in Step X, the employee continues to be eligible for PBIs and merit increases consistent with 17.1(G) as provided by this Agreement, but the increase must be in the form of a lump sum payment as provided for in Section 17.1(C)(3), and may not be added to the base pay.
(C)	Under no circumstances may an employee's base pay be adjusted above the pay grade maximum, nor below the pay grade minimum, in the employee's pay grade as set forth in Appendix A.
(1)	Employees who are currently in Step X will continue to be eligible for PBIs and merit increases in the form of a lump sum payment and may not be added to the base pay.
(2)	Employees who are at or near pay grade maximum are eligible for PBIs and merit increases, but their base increases will be limited to the amount that moves their pay to pay grade maximum. The remainder of the percentage increase will be paid in the form of a lump sum payment as provided in (3) below.
(3)	The above-referenced lump sum payments will be calculated as follows: Such lump sum payment will be based on the employee’s hourly rate multiplied by 2,080 hours (1,040 hours for part-time employees), plus any overtime hours worked in the previous 26 pay periods, valued at time and one-half (1.5), multiplied by the remaining PBI or merit increase.
(D)	Retroactive pay adjustments, for PBIs referenced in Section 17.1(A), shall be limited to straight-time (any time paid by the City, i.e., vacation, sick, injury, holiday, compensatory time, and time worked out-of-class); overtime; and reciprocity hours only. The retroactive pay increase shall be limited to those employees in the bargaining unit as of the effective date of the PBI who continue to be employed by the City upon passage of this Agreement by City Council. Those employees entering the bargaining unit after the effective date of the PBI shall be eligible for retroactive pay from the date that the employee entered the bargaining unit if an employee’s pay rate falls below the new minimum for his/her assigned pay grade.
53
(E)	The Appointing Authority will designate the rate within the pay grade at which a newly hired employee shall be paid, consistent with Appendices A and B.
(F)	The pay grades and hourly rates of pay as well as any annual salaries established in Appendix A shall be based upon a forty (40) hour workweek. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per shift, per day, per week or any other period.
(G)	The City will continue the merit pay review system for bargaining unit employees. Each employee shall be evaluated once every two years (beginning in 1998) based on the employee's classification seniority date. If an employee is denied a merit pay increase, the employee shall be provided the reasons(s) for such denial in writing.
(H)	For those employees whose classification seniority date falls on or after January 1, 2006, a merit increase must be given no later than the first day of the first pay period following the 90th day after the employee’s classification seniority date. Any merit increase processed after that date will be retroactive to said date.
Section 17.2.	Employee's Contribution to PERS.
For full-time non-seasonal employees, that portion of an employee's contribution made to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System equal to 8.5% of the employee's earned compensation shall be picked up (assumed and paid) on behalf of the employee, and in lieu of payment by the employee, by the City of Columbus. The eight and one-half percent (8%%) rate will increase to nine percent (9%) effective January 1, 2006; to nine and one-half percent (972%) effective January 1, 2007; and to ten percent (10%) effective January 1, 2008, provided such increases are implemented by the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System as scheduled. The provisions of this Section shall apply uniformly to full-time employees and no such employee shall have the option to elect a wage increase or other benefit in lieu of the payment provided for herein.
For part-time employees, that portion of an employee's contribution made to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System equal to 6% of the employee's earned compensation shall be picked up (assumed and paid) on behalf of the employee, and in lieu of payment by the employee, by the City of Columbus. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply uniformly to part-time employees and no such employee shall have the option to elect a wage increase or other benefit in lieu of the payment provided for herein.
The term "earned compensation" shall mean any and all monies earned by an employee from the City of Columbus, for which there is a pension contribution required by State law.
54
The City shall, in reporting and making remittances to the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System, report that each employee's contribution has been made as provided by Statute.
The sum paid hereunder by the City on behalf of an employee is not to be considered additional salary or wages and shall not be treated as increased compensation. For purposes of computing the employee's earnings or basis of his/her contribution to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, the amount paid by the City on behalf of an employee as a portion of his/her statutory obligation is intended to be and shall be considered as having been paid by the employee in fulfillment of his/her statutory obligation.
Section 17.3.	Salary Deductions.
Salaried employees (E-level classifications) who are permanently assigned to full-time job classifications are paid on a bi-weekly salary basis. Salaried employees are paid a bi-weekly salary based on a minimum of two (2) forty (40) hour workweeks. The bi-weekly salary received by salaried employees will not be reduced regardless of the number of hours the salaried employee actually works in any week in which the salaried employee performs any work except for the following deductions:
(A)	Deductions from a salaried employee's salary may be made for any workweek in which the salaried employee performs no work.
(B)	Deductions from a salaried employee's salary may be made when the employee absents himself from work for a full day or days for personal reasons, other than sickness or accident. This provision shall not prevent appropriate deductions from being made from any employee's vacation leave balance pursuant to Article 11 of this Agreement for absences of less than a day for personal reasons, other than sickness or accident.
(C)	Deductions from an employee's salary may be made when a salaried employee absents himself from work for a day (or days) for sickness or accident disability in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of this Agreement.
(D)	Deduction in a salaried employee's salary may be made for the initial or terminal week of the salaried employee if the salaried employee fails to work the entire workweek.
(E)	Disciplinary suspensions. Disciplinary suspensions may be imposed in increments of one (1) day.
(F)	Deductions may not be made from an employee's salary for absences caused by jury duty, paid military leave, or attendance as a witness pursuant to Section 14.4. However, deductions may be made from the employee's salary for any amounts received by the employee for such jury duty, military leave or attendance as a witness.
55
The provisions of this Section 17.3 shall be construed and applied at all times in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and applicable rules and regulations there under.
Section 17.4.	Working Out of Classification.
Employees in full-time non-seasonal D-level job classifications as listed in Appendix B who are temporarily assigned the duties of a classification assigned a higher wage rate, will be paid four percent (4%) above the employee's current rate for each hour worked in the higher class upon completing at least one (1) full workday in the higher class. Working out of class assignments are not to be used in lieu of seeking approval for filling a vacant position, nor shall it be used for the sole purpose of paying an employee at a higher class in circumvention of the requirements set forth by the Civil Service Commission.
Section 17.5.	Shift Differential.
The Appointing Authority at the time of hire shall designate or assign the applicable shift for each new hire. The shift designation shall determine the shift differential for the entire shift. Only full-time, non-seasonal D-Level employees are eligible for shift differential pay. Effective with the pay period beginning December 4, 2005, shift differential shall be paid to full-time, non-seasonal E-Level employees who are assigned by the Appointing Authority to a second, third, or rotating shift.
(A)	The early morning shift shall be known as the First Shift, the late afternoon shift shall be known as the Second Shift (i.e., a shift where a majority of the hours occur between 3:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.); and the late evening shift shall be known as the Third Shift (i.e., a shift where a majority of the hours occur between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.).

(C)	Those employees whose regularly assigned shift is a rotating shift shall be paid a shift differential of sixty cents ($.60) per hour over the regular hourly rate for all hours worked regardless of shift. For purposes of this provision, a rotating shift is a permanent shift that is comprised of a regularly scheduled assignment on First, Second and Third shifts or any variation thereof.
(D)	For purposes of computing leave with pay except for compensatory time, shift differential shall not be paid in addition to regular pay.
(E)	In those divisions, departments, and offices where only one (1) shift prevails, no differential shall be paid regardless of the hours of the day that are worked.
56
(F)	Shift differential pay shall be added to the base hourly rate prior to computing the overtime rate.
(G)	Any employee who participates in a flextime program shall not qualify for shift differential pay.
Section 17.6.	Service Credit.
A service credit payment shall be paid during December of each year to full-time non-seasonal employees who are in paid status or authorized leave without pay as of November 30 of each calendar year in accordance with the schedules below. The computation shall be based on years of continuous service as set forth in the following schedule and shall be based upon paid status as a full-time employee as of November 30 of the appropriate calendar year.

Section 17.9	Wage Rate Adjustment.
The City may adjust wage rates for bargaining unit employees whose rates of pay may be less than those of other employees in the same job classification due to market or operational driven reasons (e.g., reorganization, restructuring, increase in responsibilities); internal or external relevant experience; internal equity; relevant licensure, education, or certification beyond the minimum qualifications of the classification, if deemed desirable by the City; and other adjustments as deemed appropriate by the City.
58

Beginning no later than February 1,2007, a total of twenty-five (25) bargaining unit classifications will be selected by the Union to be reviewed to ensure that the pay plan is properly calibrated with the market and internal goals and objectives of the City. The City may survey additional classifications as part of the review at its discretion. The review will be completed by January 31, 2008. Any resulting change to pay grade assignment will be negotiated with the Union, and any unresolved issues will be resolved through interest arbitration following the procedures set forth in Section 8.2, starting with (2) under the Third Step.

64
Section 18.4.	Continuation of Benefits while on Unpaid Leave.
Providing the employee continues monthly premium coverage payments set forth in Section 18.2 above, insurance coverage for which the employee is eligible will be extended ninety (90) days beyond the end of the month during which an employee's approved leave without pay or leave of absence status became effective. The employee's insurance will then be terminated with an option to participate in the City's insurance continuation program, COBRA, at the employee's expense. If any monthly premiums coverage payments are not paid as specified herein, the City is authorized to pursue collection of monies due by either deducting the monies directly from the employee’s regular paycheck, if any, or final paycheck from the City.
Section 18.5.	Terms of Insurance Policies to Govern.
The extent of coverage under the insurance policies (including self-insured plans) referred to in this Agreement shall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in said policies or plans. Any questions or disputes concerning an employee's claim for benefits under said insurance policies or plans shall be resolved in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in said policies or plans, including the claims appeal process available through the insurance company or third party administrator, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement unless in the context of a self-insured plan, the City either (1) assumes the role of directly administering the terms of the plan without a third-party administrator or (2) overrides the decision of the City's third-party administrator inconsistent with the terms of the plan regarding specific claims for coverage. The failure of any insurance carrier(s) or plan administrator(s) to provide any benefit for which it has contracted or is obligated shall result in no liability to the City, nor shall such failure be considered a breach by the City of any obligation undertaken under this or any other Agreement. However, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to relieve any insurance carrier(s) or plan administrator(s) from any liability it may have to the City, employee or beneficiary of any employee.
Section 18.6.	IRC Section 125 Plan.
The City will continue to maintain an IRC Section 125 Plan whereby employees will be able to pay for their share of health and hospitalization insurance premiums with pre-tax earnings. This plan will remain in effect so long as it continues to be permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.

(A)	Disability Program Eligibility. The City will provide, at no cost to employees a disability program covering full-time employees for non-work related illnesses
and injuries. Disability forms must be returned to the City, through the designated department/division human resources representative, no later than forty-five (45) days from the commencement of disability; failure to comply will result in a denial of disability benefits. The disability benefit shall be eighty-one percent (81%) of the employee's regular straight-time
65
biweekly gross pay (in no event more than eighty (80) hours of pay at straight-time rates), less applicable withholding. The employee may, if he/she so desires, elect to use all, or part of, his/her accumulated but unused sick leave in order to make up any difference between one hundred percent (100%) of his/her gross wages and the amount which he/she receives under the disability program, provided that all new (current year) sick leave accruals are exhausted before an employee may use the available balance in his/her Old Sick Leave Bank. If an employee exhausts all sick leave benefits, other approved leave may be granted by the Appointing Authority. During the period in which an employee receives such payments, he/she shall suffer no reduction in his/her paid sick leave entitlement set forth in Article 13 of this Agreement, as applicable. If, while receiving such payments, the employee performs work for the City or another employer, the amount of payment under the disability program shall be reduced by the compensation which he/she receives during that time period.
(B)	While an employee is paid disability benefits pursuant to this Section, vacation accruals shall cease. Holidays shall be paid at the disability benefit rate as set forth in Paragraph (A) of this Section.
(C)	The disability waiting period for employees shall provide for payment to employees from the twelfth (12) day of accident or illness for a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks, per disability per calendar year.
(D)	Employees must complete one (1) year of continuous City service before qualifying for disability; such benefits will become available at the first of the month following the month in which they complete one (1) year of continuous service.
(E)	An employee on disability leave shall maintain bi-weekly contact with the designated department/division human resources representative during the period of time they are disabled. This requirement may be modified in writing by the designated department/division human resources representative for extended leaves. An employee shall notify the designated department/division human resources representative at least seven (7) days before his/her expected return to work date to reconfirm that date.
(F)	No disability payments shall be made to any employee who is working for another employer or receiving temporary total benefits. Fraudulent actions automatically preclude employees from receiving any disability benefits. If a payment is made pursuant to a fraudulent claim, the employee shall repay the City immediately.
66
(G)	Any disability leave, which is granted for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave, shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
ARTICLE 19	- GENERAL PROVISIONS

67
Section 19.8.	Job Vacancies and Transfers.
The Civil Service process shall continue to be used for filling of positions.

Section 20.1.	Changes in Conditions of Employment Which Are Not Specifically Established by the Agreement.
Any term and/or conditions of employment not specifically established by this Agreement shall remain within the discretion of the City to modify, establish or eliminate; provided, however, that no such determination shall be implemented prior to consultation with the Union, as provided below in Subsections (A) and (B):
(A)	Changes in Mandatory Subjects Not Specifically Established by the Agreement. The parties agree the City may implement changes in terms and conditions of employment during the term of the Agreement where the subject matter of the change is a mandatory subject of bargaining under Ohio Revised Code (ORC), Chapter 4117, and where the Agreement does not expressly address the subject matter of the change after giving the Union notice of the proposed change and a reasonable opportunity to bargain about it. In the event the parties do not reach an agreement about the proposed change, parties agree that the Union may choose to grieve the matter to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions of Section 8.2, Step 3 except that the parties shall share the expenses equally. The City will not implement its proposed change until the arbitrator issues an award, unless the Union chooses not to grieve in which case the City may implement its final proposal.
68
(B)	Changes in Permissive Subjects Not Specifically Established by the Agreement. It is further agreed that this bargaining obligation referenced in Subsection (A) above does not apply to any change which does not constitute a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORC Chapter 4117. If the City intends to modify, establish or eliminate any term or condition of employment which is not expressly addressed in the parties' Agreement, and which is not a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORC Chapter 4117, the City may do so after consultation with the Union. The City also shall comply with the posting and notification requirements set forth in Section 5.3 of the Agreement, when applicable. If the Union disagrees with the change in terms and conditions of employment after the City implements it, the Union may choose to grieve the reasonableness of the implemented term or condition of employment under the grievance procedure of the Agreement.
Section 20.2.	Changes in Conditions of Employment Which Are Specifically Established by the Agreement.
The parties may, by mutual agreement, reopen negotiations to expand, clarify, modify or amend provisions of this Agreement.

Except as stated in other sections of this Agreement, neither party shall be obligated to agree to reopen the Agreement.
In addition to reopening this Agreement for the purpose of amendment, the parties may enter into written memoranda of understanding that define, clarify, interpret or construe the meaning of specific Agreement sections. Such memoranda of understanding shall not be valid until signed by the Director of Human Resources or designee and appropriate Union officials. Such memoranda of understanding cease to exist at the date stated therein or the expiration of the current Agreement (whichever is less) unless the parties specifically incorporate them by reference into the successor Agreement. Any action taken by the Civil Service Commission which would change Appendix B of this Agreement shall be accomplished by a memorandum of understanding.
ARTICLE 21	- SAVINGS
If any provision of this Agreement is or shall at any time be contrary to or unauthorized by law, then such provision shall not be applicable or performed or enforced, except to the extent permitted or authorized by law; provided that in such event all other provisions of this Agreement shall continue in effect.
69

ARTICLE 24	- TRIAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES
Section 24.1.	Statement of Principle.
The City and the Union are mutually committed to a trial for the life of this Agreement to promote continual improvement of quality City provided services through a joint partnership involving union leaders and staff and the bargaining unit members they represent, City directors, and their management staff at all levels of their organization. This partnership of union and management shall be known as the Continuing Quality Improvement Process CQIP (CQIP). The principles of the Article shall apply in all quality improvement processes utilized in the City with CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit employees. CQIP will be jointly developed, implemented, and monitored. It is recognized by the parties that CQIP is a separate process from the normal collective bargaining and agreement administration procedures.
The purpose of CQIP will be to establish a quality work culture and environment which allows for a collaboration of management and bargaining unit talents through use of the quality processes and procedures to develop and deliver quality services through union and management teamwork and employee involvement and empowerment. As a result of their mutual commitment to improving quality services, the parties agree that quality outcomes and improvements resulting from CQIP will not be used as the basis or rationale for layoffs.
Section 24.2.	Scope of Activities.
No strategic operations team or problem solving team will have the authority to discuss, change, modify or infringe upon issues, which are related to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment. Whenever a matter covered by a collective bargaining agreement is raised in a strategic operations team, or problem solving process team, the matter shall be suspended until the members of the Citywide Labor Management Committee have expressly agreed to continued involvement by the strategic operations team or the labor management team.
73
The following represent general examples of items or issues, which may or may not be worked on by the strategic operations team:
Off Limit Activities
Acceptable Activities
Wages
Grievances
Union Agreement Interpretations
Benefits
City Policy and Working Conditions
Classification
Discipline
Working Hours
City Quality Service or City Product Work Environment Safety
Reduction in Paperwork
Savings in Time, Effort or the Handling of Materials
Improvement in Process, Methods or
Systems
Improvements in Facilities, Tools or
Equipment
Elimination of Waste of Materials and
Supplies
Reductions in Hazards to People or Property
Whenever there is a discussion over off-limit activities as stated above, or other matters which are normally reserved to the collective bargaining process, no final decision or action shall be taken except through the grievance or collective bargaining process agreed to by the parties.
Section 24.3.	Strategic Operations Team (SOT).
CQIP will be directed by a Joint City/Union Strategic Operations Team (SOT) composed of an equal number of management appointees and representatives of each union representing City employees, which choose to participate. The parties may mutually agree to add members to the committee. Each shall also have a Joint City/Union SOT. All CMAGE/CWA representatives shall be selected by the CMAGE/CWA president.
Time spent on authorized CQIP matters shall be considered time worked. Whenever possible, SOT meetings will be held during working hours of the employer. Employees may have their regular schedule adjusted to coincide with such meetings.
SOT at each level will have the responsibility for the development of plans and activities for the implementation of principles and processes described in Section 2, as well as the review of plans developed by subordinate SOT’s and the oversight of CQIP activities within their jurisdiction. CQIP issues and matters, which are not resolved at the SOT level, may be referred to the next higher SOT level for assistance and advice.
Section 24.4.	Training.
Training for all managers, supervisors, employees and Union leaders and staff in the concepts, skills and techniques of the CQIP will be conducted at the City’s expense. It is the intent of this Agreement that insofar as it is practical, bargaining unit leadership and their exempt counterparts (e.g., local Union President, Officers, City Directors, Assistant and Deputy Directors) will attend the same training. Whenever possible, the training in CQIP matters will be presented by a joint union/management team, members of which
74
will be designated by each party. The training will consist of the training offered or authorized through the City Office of Quality, as authorized by the Joint Labor/Management Committee.
Section 24.5.	Employment Security Assurances.
Quality outcomes and improvements resulting from CQIP will not be used as the basis or rationale for layoffs. If, as the result of the CQIP actions or recommendations, CMAGE/CWA classifications are changed or altered, jobs are abolished, or positions eliminated, management shall attempt to find other suitable employment with the CMAGE/CWA employee’s job family. If that position is at a pay level less than the employee is presently receiving, the employee’s salary shall be frozen until such time as the new employee’s new pay schedule catches up to the frozen salary. CMAGE/CWA employees shall not be subjected to loss of pay or layoff pending suitable placement under this Section.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the City from exercising its rights provided in this Agreement or in law to layoff bargaining unit employees or abolish bargaining unit positions for reasons other than outcomes and improvements resulting from CQIP.
ARTICLE 25	- TIME DONATION PROGRAM
Section 25.1.	Purpose.
A time donation program has been established to assist full-time employees, eligible to earn accruals, who have exhausted all accumulated paid leave and all disability leave benefits available as a result of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related. This program neither supersedes nor replaces other disability programs covered by this Agreement.
Section 25.2.	Conditions.
An employee may utilize the time donation program only if all of the following conditions are met:
(A)	Prior to requesting approval for donation of vacation leave, the employee must have exhausted all paid leave and disability leave benefits available to him/her; and
(B)	The employee shall submit an application requesting donation of vacation leave from other bargaining unit employees in the same division to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. The application shall include acceptable medical documentation of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related, including diagnosis and prognosis. The injury or long-term illness must require the employee to be away from work for at least one (1) full pay period. This application shall be on a form mutually agreed to by the City and the Union; and
75
(C)	The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee shall determine that the injury or long-term illness is catastrophic in nature and that the employee is eligible to receive vacation leave donations from other bargaining unit employees in the same division; and
(D)	The approved application shall be forwarded to CMAGE/CWA. The Union shall post a notice on the Union bulletin boards to other bargaining unit employees in the same division that the eligible employee may receive donations of vacation leave; and
(E)	If the eligible employee is in a probationary period, the probation will be extended by the number of days the employee is off duty receiving leave donations. The Civil Service Commission must be notified of an extension of any probationary period; and
(F)	Donated leave shall be considered sick leave but shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
Section 25.3.	Employees Donating Vacation Time.
(A)	An employee desiring to donate vacation leave shall submit a completed time donation form to the Division payroll office.
(B)	It is understood that all vacation leave donations are voluntary and once vacation leave is donated, it will not be returned to the donating employee.
(C)	All donated vacation leave shall be paid at the regular hourly rate of the employee receiving and using the donated leave, not at the regular hourly rate of the employee donating the leave.
(D)	Vacation leave may be donated in increments of at least four (4) hours.
This is a completely voluntary program. A decision made by the City regarding implementation, acceptance or rejection of an application for donations shall be final and the same shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
76
ARTICLE 26	- ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement supersedes all prior practices and agreements, whether written or oral, unless expressly stated to the contrary herein, and constitutes the complete and entire agreement between the parties, and concludes collective bargaining for its term.
The parties acknowledge that, during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter within the scope of bargaining as defined by State law, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, except as specifically provided in Section 2.3 and Article 20, the City and CMAGE/CWA, for the duration of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter, whether or not referred to or covered in this Agreement, including the impact or effects of the City's exercise of its rights as set forth herein on salaries, fringe benefits or terms and conditions of employment, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Agreement. It is expressly agreed that the City may unilaterally make and implement decisions consistent with the City's rights as set forth in Article 5, even though the exercise of such rights may involve subjects or matters not referred to or covered in this Agreement; provided only that the City's exercise of its management rights shall be subject to employees' individual rights (i.e., those derived from sources other than this Agreement and the collective bargaining relationship which produced it) as provided in Section 5.1 and Article 20.
77
ARTICLE 27	- DURATION OF AGREEMENT
This Agreement shall be effective when executed by authorized representatives of both parties and shall remain in full force and effect until 11:59 p.m. on August 23, 2008. It shall automatically be renewed from year to year thereafter unless either party shall notify the other in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the August 24 anniversary date that it desires to modify this Agreement. In the event such notice is given, negotiations shall begin no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the anniversary date.
In the event either party desires to terminate this Agreement, written notice must be given to the other party no less than ten (10) days prior to the desired termination date which shall not be before the anniversary date set forth in the preceding paragraph.

Re: 2005 - 2008 City of Columbus CMAGE/CWA Local 4502 Agreements (Check-off for CMAGE/CWA-Sponsored Voluntary Legal Insurance Plan)
Dear Bill:
This letter will confirm and document certain understandings and representations of the parties in connection with the settlement of the 1994-97 collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”) between the City of Columbus, Ohio and the Columbus Municipal Association of Government Employees/Communications Workers Of America Local 4502 (CMAGE/CWA). Specifically, CMAGE/CWA is desirous of providing a voluntary group legal services plan to full-time members of the City bargaining units with the premiums to be paid entirely by participating members of those bargaining units and, to that end, has requested that the City grant it one payroll deduction slot for the voluntary deduction of monthly premiums from participating bargaining unit members’ wages. As part of the resolution of the parties’ Agreement, the City has agreed to provide CMAGE/CWA with a payroll deduction slot for this purpose, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
1.	The group legal services plan sponsored by CMAGE/CWA will be the complete and sole responsibility of CMAGE/CWA to process, administer and monitor.
2.	The City will provide CMAGE/CWA access to an available payroll deduction slot (one deduction slot for use by the CMAGE/CWA City bargaining units) and will facilitate enrollment by eligible bargaining unit members of CMAGE/CWA in individual City departments by agreeing to have payroll clerks process the payroll deduction authorizations for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan.
114
William H. Bain
Voluntary Legal Insurance Plan
Page Two
3.	All monies deducted monthly for participation in the group legal services plan will be forwarded to the Treasurer of CMAGE/CWA in one aggregate amount by a warrant separate and apart from the warrant provided to CMAGE/CWA for dues deducted under Section 3.1 of the Agreement. All funds transmitted to CMAGE/CWA pursuant to the payroll deduction authorization for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan shall be the sole responsibility of CMAGE/CWA to administer and disperse.
4.	The actual amount to be deducted each month for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan shall be certified to the City Auditor by the Treasurer of the Union, and shall be based on a uniform amount for each employee in order to ease the City’s burden of administering this agreement. This amount will not be changed more than once each fiscal year during the life of this agreement. The Union will give the City a forty-five (45) day notice of any such change in the monthly amount to be deducted.
5.	Deductions shall be made during one (1) pay period each month; if any participation bargaining unit member’s pay for the period is insufficient to cover the deduction for the plan after withholding all other legal and required deductions (including CMAGE/CWA dues, if any), no deduction will be made for such employee for that month. Information concerning amounts properly not deducted under this paragraph shall be forwarded to the Treasurer of the Union, and this action will discharge the City’s only responsibility with regard to such cases; there will be no retroactive deduction of such amounts from future earnings. Deductions shall cease at such time as a strike or work stoppage occurs in violation of Article 9 (No Strike-No Lockout).
6.	Total deductions collected for each calendar month shall be remitted by the City to the Treasurer of CMAGE/CWA together with a list of employees for whom deductions have been made not later than the tenth (10th) of the following month. CMAGE/CWA agrees to refund to the employee any amounts paid to the Union in error on account of this dues deduction provision.
7.	It shall be CMAGE/CWA’s sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the group legal services plan, including solicitation and distribution off information related to enrollment or participation in the plan. The City’s role will be solely clerical in nature, that is, to process the amount of the payroll deduction for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan and to transmit the monies deducted from the payroll to CMAGE/CWA
115
William H. Bain
Voluntary Legal Insurance Plan
Page Three
8.	Only full-time bargaining unit members who have properly executed the required payroll deduction authorization card for the group legal services plan (a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix F) shall be eligible to participate in the payroll deduction plan for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan.
9.	An annual enrollment period during the month of February each year is hereby establish, during which interested eligible bargaining unit members may sign a payroll deduction card for the plan. Payroll deduction authorization cards received by the City on or after March 1 of each year shall be deemed invalid. In any event, the City shall not be obligated in any way to honor the payroll deduction authorization cards for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan until such time as CMAGE/CWA presents to the City, in a timely manner (i.e., during the month of February) a minimum of 50 properly executed payroll deduction authorization cards evidencing the desire of at least 50 eligible bargaining unit members to participate in the payroll deduction program for the CMAGE/CWA sponsored legal services plan.
10.	The City shall continue to make the appropriate monthly deduction from the pay of a participating bargaining unit member until such time as the City receives a written revocation of the authorization for payroll deduction during the month of February signed by the participating member, or notice of an employee’s death, transfer out of the bargaining unit, or termination of City employment. To be valid and effective a written revocation of the authorization for payroll deduction must be submitted and received by the City during the month of February.
11.	In the event fewer than 50 eligible members of the bargaining units participate in the program at any time, the City’s obligation to withhold shall automatically terminate and the Office of the City Auditor shall inform CMAGE/CWA of the termination of this deduction. In such event, it shall be the sole responsibility of CMAGE/CWA to notify participating bargaining unit members of the termination of the payroll deduction.
12.	No solicitation or enrollment activity for the CMAGE/CWA sponsored legal services plan shall take place during working hours or on City property.
13.	CMAGE/CWA agrees that it will indemnify and hold the City harmless from any claims, actions, or proceedings commenced by any person or employee(s) against the City arising out of the terms of this side letter of agreement or its implementation.

Re: 1994-97 City of Columbus CMAGE/CWA Agreement (Separate Supplemental
Agreements Regarding Golf Professionals and Golf Program Managers)
Dear Bill:
This letter will confirm and document certain understandings and representations of the parties in connection with the settlement of the 1994-97 collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”) between the City of Columbus, Ohio and the Columbus Municipal Association of Government Employees (CMAGE/CWA). Specifically, negotiators for the parties have become aware of the fact that certain terms and conditions of employment for Golf Professionals and Golf Program Managers exist which are not reflected in the parties’ Agreement, and that such conditions of employment historically have been worked out directly between the City and the individuals involved. These conditions of employment include such things as arrangements for the operation of golf pro shops, individual and group lessons and the rental of equipment. The parties agree that the Agreement does not alter or affect these pre-existing arrangements, and that such conditions of employment for these individual employees shall continue to be established by individual agreements with the employees involved, which agreements will not require the ratification or approval of CMAGE/CWA. Such individual agreements shall not reduce any benefit set forth in the Agreement.
Please sign this letter in the space provided below if the foregoing accurately reflects the understandings of the parties.
Very truly yours,
Agreed and accepted on Behalf of CMAGE/CWA
