ARTICLE FOUR Agent’s Agreement
1.	Agent’s Agreement.
A.	It is agreed that the Company will rewrite Agent's Agreement Form 83, so as to conform to the terms and provisions of this Contract.
B.	The Agents shall be compensated only to the extent and in accordance with the Agent's Agreement Form 83 as revised to conform to the terms and provisions of this Contract.
C.	Any reference made to Agent's Agreement Form 83 shall mean Agent's Agreement Form 83 as revised to conform to the terms and provisions of this Contract.
D.	Each new Agent shall be on a 'trial basis' for the initial one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of employment. Upon completion of this trial period, the employee will become a regular Agent of the Company.
E.	Each Agent will be required to properly execute a "Disclosure to Consumer and Consumer's Authorization for Procurement of Consumer Report" form as required by the 1997 Fair Credit Reporting Act.
2.	Duties. An Agent's duties in fulfilling this Contract will be as follows:
A.	Perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation, as described in the company's "Job Description for Career Sales and Service Agent" as last revised and as may be revised from time to time hereafter, the same being incorporated herein by reference as though set out verbatim.
B.	To assist policyholders and prospects in meeting their insurance needs or financial objectives by canvassing for and procuring applications for insurance and annuities of the kinds and classes of risks and on the plans designated by the Company; to use the appropriate forms as provided by the Company and approved for compliance by Corporate Affairs; to deliver in accordance with the Company's rules all policies issued by the Company on such applications; to collect the premiums payable upon delivery and such other premiums and such other monies as he/she may be authorized to receive; to account for and to pay over to the Company all monies paid to him/her as the Company's Agent, no later than the next regular reporting day after such receipt of such monies; to service and conserve the Company's business; to assist the holders of the Company's policies to realize the benefits provided by their policies; and to accept in full satisfaction for all services the salary, commissions and bonuses as provided and limited by this Contract.
C.	Further, an Agent will perform these duties in a manner that will result in premium increase on the Agency to which he/she is assigned. An Agent shall be available to perform the duties described above between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday of each week, which shall be the normal workweek for the purpose of this agreement. Provided, however, on reporting days, Agents must report by 8:30 a.m. No Agent shall be required to spend more than eight (8) hours in any one (1) day, five (5) hours on Friday. The 8 hr. / 5 hr. requirement mentioned previously will include time spent by the Agent working in the field and/or in the office preparing sales illustrations and/or proposals. If an Agent's outside activities are such that they interfere with his/her obligations to the Company and its clients, he/she will discontinue such activities.
2
D.	Whenever an Agent is scheduled for joint field work with management, the Agent may be required to work for a maximum of eight (8) hours in any one (1) day, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. The actual hours worked will be at the discretion of management.
If an Agent has not been scheduled to work with management on any particular day, he/she may choose the hours worked, but must spend at least 8 hours between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. performing the duties previously described.
If an Agent is scheduled to work with management, then management will set the schedule and may require the Agent to work anytime between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., with an 8-hour cap.
Agents scheduled to work with management are expected to drive their own vehicle. Management will accompany the Agent in the Agent’s personal vehicle, unless management chooses another form of transportation. Refusal of an Agent to accompany management on joint field work and/or refusal to work the hours stipulated by Management (up to the maximums described herein) will be considered insubordination, and will subject an Agent to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
3.	Liability Insurance. Each Agent shall be required to obtain and maintain liability insurance coverage as a condition of employment in the minimum amounts required by law in the State(s) where the Agent works.
4.	Drivers License. Each Agent shall maintain as a condition of employment a current operator's (driver's) license issued by the state in which he/she resides. Any Agent whose license is suspended shall remain responsible for working his/her Agency. However, any Agent driving a vehicle performing Company business while his/her license is suspended may be subject to immediate termination.
5.	Driving Record Standards. Agents shall be required to maintain the same minimum standards currently in effect for new hires of the Company unless in the opinion of the Company, the overall driving record is unsatisfactory. Failure to do so may result in discipline up to and including discharge.
6.	Full-Time Employment. It shall be the obligation of each Agent to devote his/her full time and effort to this Company's business. An Agent will not be permitted to be appointed by or under contract to any other insurance company. If an Agent has appointments with other insurance companies at the time he/she is employed by American National, such appointment(s) must be canceled immediately by the Agent. Any Agent who becomes appointed by other insurance companies following the date of his/her employment by the Company will be discharged immediately from the Company, on the first offense and without warning.
7.	Direct Deposit. An Agent shall be paid by direct deposit to a financial institution of their choice by the regular account settlement day (Friday, unless otherwise designated by the Company). Whenever Friday is a holiday, Agents’ paychecks for the week will be deposited on or before the last work day of the week.
8.	Arbitration of Claims. Each Agent wishing to pursue a claim of any kind, legal, equitable, statutory, common law, state, federal or municipal against the Company, its officers and/or representatives, before, during or after employment, is required to do so pursuant to the provisions of Article Forty-One and Forty-Two of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the UFCW.
3
9.	Agent’s Covenant.
A.	Upon an Agent's termination, resignation, or retirement, he/she shall not directly or indirectly engage in the following or aid or abet others in doing so:
i.	Retain in his/her possession any original, photocopy or otherwise duplicated or reproduced company record, file, manual, supply or form.
ii.	For a period of two (2) years following such termination, induce or attempt to induce any Company Agent, sales manager, district manager, regional representative, or clerical force to terminate his/her employment with the Company.
iii.	For a period of two (2) years following termination, resignation or retirement, an Agent will not directly or indirectly, or through another person, solicit a company's policy holder with whom the Agent had a policy during his/her term of his/her employment with ANICO for the purposes of replacing, or attempting to replace, the policy of insurance that was in force with that customer.
iv.	Upon learning that an Agent has replaced or attempted to replace one or more policies of an insured of the Company, the Agent agrees that the Company may, without liability, make a written report of the replacement activity to the appropriate State Insurance Department and to the company or companies involved in the replacement and/or attempted replacement.

ARTICLE NINE
First-Year Sales Commission Account
1.	Beginning with an Agent's fourth Agency week and continuing for each successive week that the Agency is actively conducted under the Agent's Agreement, there will be credited to that Agent's sales account through that Agent's Lapse Outstanding Account the net annualized Monthly Debit Ordinary and Regular Ordinary first-year commissions described in Agent's Agreement Form 83, pursuant to this Contract and as established by the Company's records.
2.	Whenever the Lapse Outstanding Account shall have a positive balance, that balance will be applied to the Agent's First-Year Sales Commission Account balance.
3.	Beginning with the Agent's sixteenth (16th) Agency week or earlier as provided in Article Five, and continuing for each week thereafter, an Agent, if licensed, either permanent or temporary, (temporary license availability limited by law) will be paid Ten Percent (10%) of the remaining First-Year Sales Commission Account balance. However, in no case shall a payment be made from the Sales Account that will reduce the net of the Sales Account and Lapse Outstanding Account to an amount less than zero (0).
If the sales account is Fifteen Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) or more and there is no lapse outstanding account balance, the Agent shall be paid Twenty Percent (20%) of the remaining first-year sales commission account balance. If the Sales Account is between One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) and Fourteen Hundred Ninety-nine Dollars ($1,499.99) and there is no lapse outstanding account balance, the Agent shall be paid Fifteen Percent (15%) of the remaining first-year sales commission account balance. Otherwise, the Agent shall be paid Ten Percent (10%) of the remaining first-year sales commission account balance.
8
The Agent's First-Year Sales Commission Account balance will be reduced by such payment that same week with such reduced balance to be carried forward to the next following week, in accordance with established Company rules and practices.
4.	If, at the time the initial premium is reported paid on the annual premium basis on a Regular Ordinary policy, and if the writing Agent requests the full first-year commission, and if the Company pays such commission to the Agent in a single payment, no amount of first-year Regular Ordinary commission will be added to the Lapse Outstanding Account with respect to such policy.
5.	If the annualized first-year commission on a Regular Ordinary policy issued to the credit of an Agent exceeds Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00), only the first Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000.00) of the annualized commission on such policy will be placed in the Agent's Lapse Outstanding Account. The remaining first-year commission on such Regular Ordinary policy will be paid to the Agent in accordance with Agent's Agreement Form 83, as the first-year premiums are paid in cash to the Company.
6.	Upon termination of an Agent's Agency Agreement, no further first-year commission will be payable from the First-Year Sales Commission Account except in the following circumstances:
A.	Upon retirement of an Agent while in active service under the Company's pension plan or, if not under the Company's pension plan, termination either on or after age 55 with 20 years service or upon retirement, the retired Agent will be eligible to receive the balance in the Sales Account, less all first-year commission charge-back. The net amount shall be paid in a lump sum three (3) months after the date of such retirement. Should the Agent die before the expiration of the three (3) months, the net amount shall be paid to the deceased Agent's estate or, at the option of the Company, to any relative of the Agent.
B.	Upon the death of an Agent while in active service, the Agent's Sales Account balance, less all first-year commission charge-back, shall be paid to the deceased Agent's estate or, at the option of the Company, to any relative of the Agent. The net amount shall be paid in a lump sum three (3) months after the death of the Agent.
C.	Any Agent who becomes eligible for the Company's Long-Term Disability benefits, and remains disabled for a continuous period of six (6) months, shall be eligible to receive the balance of the Sales Account, less all first-year commission charge-back. This net amount shall be paid in a lump sum six (6) months after the date of disablement of the Agent. Should the Agent die before the expiration of the six (6) month period, the net amount shall be paid to the deceased Agent's estate or, at the option of the Company, to any relative of the Agent.

The amount of Sales Performance commission on Monthly Debit Ordinary and Regular Ordinary Life Sales will be determined quarterly, on the basis of the previous twenty-six (26)-week lapse experience, in accordance with the table in this Article and will be payable each week of the succeeding quarter.
A.	First-year MDO lapse rate will be the Agent's net MDO first-year lapse during each quarter per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of cumulative MDO issue during the same quarter. The rate will be calculated weekly and accumulated each quarter. The lapse rate applicable to the tables will be the aggregate of the Agent's lapse experience for the last two (2) completed quarters.
9
B.	First-year Regular Ordinary Life lapse rate will be the Agent’s net Regular first-year lapse during each quarter per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of cumulative Regular Ordinary Life issue during the same quarter. The rate will be calculated weekly and accumulated each quarter. The lapse rate applicable to the tables will be the aggregate of the Agent’s lapse experience for the last two (2) completed quarters.
C.	The combined MDO first year lapse rate and regular ordinary first year lapse rate is calculated as follows:
The Ordinary Life first year net lapse is added to the MDO first year net lapse. The Ordinary Life issue is added to the MDO issue. The new lapse rate is then the newly calculated lapse divided by the newly calculated issue.
D.	Sales Commissions applicable to the table will be the weekly average of the net first-year MDO and Regular Ordinary Life commissions credited on the Agent’s life register during the most recently completed quarter, except for commissions on those policies that do not go through the chart as indicated in the “Schedule of Commissions and Renewals” in Article Six.
E.	If the average weekly amount of sales commissions is less than the chart minimum or is negative at the end of any quarter, no payment shall be made during the succeeding quarter under this Article; and the total will be carried forward and combined with the commission used to calculate the weekly average for the next following quarter. However, if the first-year combined MDO and Regular Ordinary Life lapse rate is greater than the chart maximum, no payment shall be made and no totals will be carried forward to the next following quarter except as provided in (F) below.
F.	If the average weekly amount of sales commission for any quarter is greater than the chart maximum, such excess shall be carried forward and added to the weekly average credited during the next following quarter.

ARTICLE ELEVEN Collection and Service Commissions
1.	At the time of hire, an agent is assigned a book of business. The parties agree the value of this book of business is substantial and that the agent made no contribution to said value. In exchange for the assignment of such valuable asset, the agent will accept a collection and service commission, as outlined below, in lieu of any reimbursement for expenses incurred by the agent in collecting premiums on the accounts assigned to his/her agency. Such expenses would include, but not be limited to: mileage, gasoline, automobile repairs and maintenance (including depreciation), telephone, cell phone and postage expense.
A.	A weekly service commission for Regular Ordinary Life business of three percent (3%) of the annualized premium assigned to the Agency, reduced to a weekly basis, as provided in Agent's Agreement Form 83.
The service commissions on debitized Regular Ordinary Life business paid each week shall be based upon the actual amount of the premiums in force in the Agency two (2) weeks prior to the current week.
B.	A weekly collection commission for Monthly Debit Ordinary and Intermediate business, reduced to a weekly equivalent, of ten percent (10%), as provided in the Agent's Agreement Form 83.
Actual collections will be accumulated for the three (3) months of each calendar quarter (with a one-month setback) and will be paid out weekly during the next calendar quarter.
EXAMPLE - On a $10,000 MDO agency, assume the following:
June collections	$10,500
July collections	$ 9,950
August collections	$10,100
Total	$30,550
$30,550 X .10 = $3,055 divided by 13 weeks = $235 per week
Under this example, the agent would receive a collection commission of $235 per week for thirteen weeks beginning with the second pay period in October.
Collections for the months of September, October, and November would be accumulated and paid out in a similar manner during the first calendar quarter of the following year.
All collections credited to an agency, regardless of the source, will be used to calculate collection commissions, which will be paid to the Agent currently assigned to the agency.
MDO Collection Commission will be based on actual collections, not on MDO Premium in force on agency.
C.	Agents who maintain an average Net Advance for the three (3) months prior to the final month of the preceding calendar quarter will be paid a bonus collection commission in accordance with the following table:
Net Advance	Bonus Commission
$1.00 to 24.99%	1.0%
25% to 49.99%	1.5%
50% and over	2.0%
The Agent in example B. maintained an average net advance for the months of June, July, and August, and would be paid an additional 1% on the amount of the average net advance of the $30,550 total collections.
2.	The monthly closing date will be the first Friday after the 1st of each calendar month.
11
ARTICLE TWELVE Service Performance Commissions
1.	Service Performance Commissions shall be payable to an Agent beginning with the sixteenth (16th) Agency week completed by the Agent.
2.	The amount of Service Performance Commission on Monthly Debit Ordinary Sales will be determined quarterly on the basis of the previous twenty-six (26)-week-lapse experience, in accordance with the following tables, and be payable each week of the succeeding fiscal quarter.
A.	MDO renewal lapse rate will be the Agent's net MDO renewal premium lapse per One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) of cumulative premium in force. The rate will be calculated weekly and accumulated each quarter. The rate applicable to the tables will be the average lapse experience for the last two (2) completed quarters.
B.	MDO Agency size applicable to the tables will be based on the amount of MDO premium in force in the Agency at the end of the preceding quarter.

If a week of Annual Leave is designated the last Monday date prior to the Agent's anniversary date and extends into the next service year, and if, the Agent is not employed by the Company during that next service year for any period of time in addition to such Annual Leave, then the Agent is not eligible for additional Annual Leave in the next service year by virtue of the Agent having been employed, but on Annual Leave, during that year.

ARTICLE TWENTY-ONE
Leaves of Absence
1.	General.
A.	If an Agent is required to be absent from work for ten (10) consecutive work days or more for medical/disability reasons occurring as a result of both on and/or off-the-job injuries, illnesses, and/or activities, and/or for personal reasons acceptable to the Company and/or for jury duty or other reasons acceptable to the Company, a leave of absence shall be granted. The leave may be with certain benefits, depending upon the circumstances. In order for a leave to be granted, the Agent makes his/her request in writing on the "Request for Leave of Absence" form at least ten (10) days prior to the requested absence, except in emergency situations. The leave of absence requested must be approved by the Home Office. In the event of an emergency, the request for leave form will be completed by the district manager. The Agent will be asked to sign it as soon as possible and a copy will be provided to the Agent.
B.	All leaves of absence granted by the Company shall be without loss of seniority, but an Agent's seniority shall not continue to accumulate during a leave of absence more than ten (10) weeks. Thus, a leave of absence interrupts the timetable for accumulating any employee benefits. This timetable resumes when the Agent returns to work.
16
C.	An Agent who does not return to work on the first regular working day following the end of the period provided in the leave of absence shall be terminated unless an extension is requested in writing by the Agent and granted by the district manager before the expiration of the originally approved leave.
D.	Leaves provided for herein are intended to and shall comply with all requirements of various state laws and regulations and applicable federal regulations, including but not limited to the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In that regard, regardless of the specific provisions of this Article as to the length of a particular leave or the Agent's entitlement to the leave or to reinstatement to his/her former position at the end of the leave, such provisions shall be modified as required by law. Accordingly, a person suffering a qualified disability as defined by the ADA may be entitled to additional leave over and above what is granted in specific provisions of this Article. Likewise, Agents qualified for FMLA leave or for pregnancy leave under California law will be eligible for reinstatement to their former position, including the location of their agency when taking a leave qualifying under either of these statutes. It should be noted that in accommodating the disabled Agent and/or in complying with statutorily mandated leave provisions, the circumstances surrounding an individual Agent's request for leave and the granting thereof shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.
E.	An Agent who is absent from work for three (3) or more scheduled work days, and who fails to inform his/her manager during those days (unless the employee has proof of a valid reason for such failure to notify his/her manager and such proof is in writing) will be considered as having voluntarily resigned his/her employment with the company.
F.	No leave, with or without pay, will be granted to an Agent who has indicated, either verbally or in writing, of his/her plans to resign or otherwise leave the company's employ. Further, no leave, paid or unpaid will be granted to an Agent who has been informed of his/her termination from employment, but who is accompanying management, or is to accompany management, on a final inspection of his/her agency.
2.	Disability Leave.
A.	An Agent on disability leave of absence is required to keep the Company informed at least once every two weeks as to his/her status and condition. Additionally, the Agent, if requested, must provide the Company with documents from an attending physician and/or a Company-designated physician as to the medical condition, its seriousness, recommended future treatment, and anticipated dates of recovery, either partial or complete.
B.	Pregnant employees residing in states providing for pregnancy leave above and beyond that required by federal law may be entitled to additional time in the form of an unpaid leave over and above those granted by this Article. Agents may call the Home Office to determine whether or not they are eligible for this additional leave time as a result of laws within their respective jurisdictions.
C.	For Agents with a period of continuous active service of three (3) months or more, the first ten (10) days of any Agent's leave in any calendar year will be compensated for by the Company. Taking an excessive number of sick days on regular reporting days may subject the Agent to disciplinary action.
D.	If an Agent shall remain ill or disabled for a continuous period beyond the ten (10) days in a calendar-year period as provided above, then the Company will grant to such Agent the following additional leave of absence without pay; provided, however, that the disability or illness is certified by a licensed physician and concludes that the Agent is unable to perform the essential functions of the Agent's job due to the illness or disability:
17
i.	Agents (unless pregnant and working in states providing for pregnancy leave above and beyond that required by federal law) with less than three (3) months of service--zero (0) weeks;
ii.	Agents with at least three (3) months of service but less than five (5) years of service-twenty-six (26) weeks;
iii.	Agents with five (5) years or more of service--fifty two (52) weeks.
E.	A disability leave of absence provided for in this Article shall continue only during such period of time as the Agent shall in fact remain ill or disabled to the extent that the Agent shall be continuously unable to perform the essential functions of his/her job and shall furnish to the Company written medical evidence of such fact upon request. Any medical examination made of such Agent, with the exception of the first examination, shall be at the Company's expense.
F.	An Agent shall not be granted nor entitled to any leave of absence under this Article for the purposes of engaging in any other occupation while disabled or ill and upon the Company's discovery of such fact, leave will automatically be cancelled and the Agent's employment terminated.
G.	The disability leave of absence without pay provided in D. above represents the maximum amount of leave of absence without pay which will be approved by the Company except:
i.	In the event an ill or disabled Agent with three (3) months or more of continuous service returns to work within the time period provided in D above, and then again becomes ill or disabled in less than one (1) full year from the beginning date of the leave of absence without pay, the Agent will be granted a continuation of that leave of absence without pay, if necessary, up to but not exceeding the full remaining amount of time allowed in D above. One (1) week of leave of absence without pay will be restored for each week worked between the time returned to work and the time the Agent again becomes ill or disabled, but in no event shall that continuation leave of absence exceed the full amount allowed in D. above.
ii.	In the event a disabled Agent returns to work within the time limits specified above and works continuously for at least one (1) full year and then again becomes ill or disabled, the full period of disability leave of absence without pay will be granted in accordance with the schedule provided in D above, without regard to the previous periods of leave of absence granted to the Agent.
iii.	An Agent returning from disability with two (2) years or more of continuous service as herein provided shall have the privilege of being placed on the Agent's old Agency if it is open at the time of return. If not open, priority shall be given in placement on the Agent's old Agency when it next comes open, provided written request is made by the Agent within the posting period of the open Agency pursuant to this Agreement.
Period of Continuous Service When Disability Absence Begins	Number of Weeks Agency Will Be Reserved During a Calendar Year
2 years or more (Unless pregnant and working in states providing for pregnancy leave above and beyond that required by federal law)	13 weeks from beginning of disability
18
H.	When the request of an ill or disabled Agent to return to work is not approved by the Company on the grounds that the Agent is not able to resume agency duties, the Agent shall be examined by a Company-designated physician (at the Company’s expense). The report of this physician shall be provided to the Agent and the Company. If it supports the Company’s decision and the Agent and/or the Union disagree with such decision, then, the Agent shall be examined by a physician selected jointly by the Company and Union. This third physician will be supplied all prior relevant medical records from the Agent’s physician and the Company’s designated physician in order to render an opinion and decision of which physician is correct as to the Agent’s ability to resume agency duties. The decision of this third physician shall be binding upon all parties.
If the Company and the Union are unable within ten (10) days to agree upon a physician to make such examination, then and in that event such examining physician shall be appointed by the president of the county or local medical society nearest the place of residence of such Agent, whose decision shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties and not subject to arbitration.
I.	Except as provided above, an Agent shall not be entitled to additional disability leave of absence with or without pay. And, upon the expiration of such disability leave of absence, employment with the Company shall terminate.
J.	An Agent who is granted a disability leave of absence without pay shall, upon returning to work from disability, be placed on an Agency, picking up from the week last worked by the Agent under the agreement and being compensated accordingly. Provided, however, that where "extenuating circumstances" exist, the Company, at its sole discretion, may increase the compensation to be paid the Agent.

No representative or member of the Union shall conduct union business or solicit union membership within the confines of the District Office or in any place where the Company is conducting a special meeting.
2.	However, Union local or Union members in a District may hold Union meetings once a month on any day. On a regular reporting day, or on a day of special meeting called by Home Office officials pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the meeting may not be held until completion of the office activities for that day. If the meeting is to be held on the first reporting day of a week (Tuesday), notice of intention to hold the meeting shall be given the Manager of the District in advance.
3.	A special Union meeting may be held locally at any time if called by the International President of the Union, or his/her designee, provided the meeting will not conflict with the time the Agents are required to report to their District Offices and the consent of the Home Office executive or a Career Sales and Service Division Officer is first obtained upon being notified in advance of the time and purpose of the meeting.
4.	The District Manager will provide the Union District Office Chairman (in districts where there is one) with the name, address, and telephone number of any new Agent in the first two (2) weeks of the new Agent's employment.

ARTICLE THIRTY-SIX Discrimination
1.	Neither the Company nor the Union shall discriminate against a person because of that person having filed a claim for benefits due to an on-the-job injury and/or illness or because of that person's race, religion, color, national origin, sex (including sexual or other forms of actionable harassment); age (if over 40); disability/handicap, (if otherwise qualified); veteran status; or union membership or non-membership in the union. As indicated, the above described anti-harassment policy not only specifically addresses sexual harassment but also prohibits harassment of employees, members of management, job applicants, suppliers, visitors and/or customers that is in any way related to the individual’s race, sex, religion, national origin, citizenship status, age (if over 40), disability or any other legally protected status or classification. Any discrimination grievance must be based on one of these factors or because of sexual preference in those jurisdictions mandating non-discrimination on this basis by ordinance or otherwise.
2.	Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature (e.g. verbal abuse, leering, touching). Sexual harassment violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 whenever:
A.	Submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an individual's employment;
B.	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or,
C.	Whenever such conduct creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile working environment.
Sexual harassment is strictly prohibited at American National and will not be tolerated. Any employee who believes that he or she has been subjected to sexual harassment should report the matter to his or her district manager, or if that person may be involved in the allegations, directly to the Home Office in Galveston, Texas to the Vice President, Career Sales and Service Division Administration, One Moody Plaza, Galveston, Texas 77550 (409) 766-6519 (Phone); (409) 6213938 (Fax) immediately after the offensive conduct occurs. All complaints will be promptly investigated. Persons who engage in acts of sexual harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Further, no employee who, in good faith, reports conduct in violation of this policy or who otherwise participates in any investigation of harassment will be subject to retaliation.
3.	In undertaking and recognizing its obligations to disabled persons under the mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Company reserves the right, power and authority to make whatever reasonable accommodation is necessary to a disabled individual, whether or not the providing of such accommodation violates the express and/or implied terms of this Contract. The Company will provide the Union with written notification of any accommodation made for a bargaining unit employee as a result of the provisions of this section.
4.	The Company agrees to fully comply with all applicable laws relating to reemployment of Agents now or hereafter serving in the Armed Forces of this Nation.
5.	Where the words he, his, him, man or any other words are used in this Contract, such usage is not intended to designate gender; rather, these words are intended to refer to any person regardless of sex.
6.	Both parties to this Contract agree that they will cooperate with one another in complying with the provisions of this Article of this Contract.
7.	Any complaint alleging discrimination as defined in Paragraph 1 above shall be processed through the grievance and, if necessary, arbitration articles of this Agreement.
31
ARTICLE THIRTY-SEVEN Bulletin Board
The Company agrees that the Union may have the privilege of installing its own bulletin board in each of the District and Detached Offices of the Company in a suitable place, but at its expense, and subject to all rules and regulations of the building in which such offices are located, to be used for posting announcements of Union activities affecting Career Sales and Service Agents of the Company and restricted to notices of:
1.	Union recreational and social affairs.
2.	Union elections.
3.	Union appointments and results of Union elections.
4.	Union meetings and activities.
5.	Copy of the current contract with the Agents' Union.
A service representative of the Union will be allowed to service Union bulletin boards in the presence of the District Manager, a Sales Manager, or district office clerk, on any regular business day at times other than Company meetings and/or reporting times.
ARTICLE THIRTY-EIGHT Absences for Union Purposes
1.	The Company agrees to give time off to any Agent, without deduction from compensation, for the purpose of attending any convention or conference of the Union or collective bargaining negotiations between the Union and the Company, subject, however, to the following conditions:
A.	No more than two (2) such Agents or ten percent (10%) of the bargaining unit employees employed within the district, whichever number is lower, from a district shall be given time off without deduction from compensation to attend any such convention or conference, except that where an Agent from a district is an officer of the union other than the local union, three (3) Agents at a time or not more than fifteen percent (15%) of the number of employees in the district, whichever number is lower, shall be given such time off.
B.	No more than one (1) Agent from a manager’s staff shall be given time off, without deduction from compensation, to attend collective bargaining negotiations between the Union and the Company. Subject to the foregoing, the Union may designate up to five (5) total Agents to attend such negotiations.
C.	Such Agents shall be given such time off only upon written request of the Union addressed to the Company at its Home Office in Galveston, Texas, made no later than fourteen (14) days in advance of the period during which it is desired that they be given time off for convention, conference or collective bargaining negotiations.
2.	The Company agrees to grant a leave of absence to an Agent who terminates service with the Company to take a full-time position with the United Food and Commercial Workers Union and to re-employ the Agent in an Agency, provided that:
A.	The Agent is not subject to dismissal for violation of a Company rule.
B.	The Agent has at least five (5) years of current continuous service with the Company and has been actively employed as an Agent for at least the last two (2) years preceding termination of service with the Company.
C.	The Union and the Agent, before terminating service with the Company, notify the Company in writing of the Agent's intention to terminate service under the provision of this Article.
D.	The Agent commences employment with the Union within ten (10) days after termination of service with the Company.
32
E.	The period of the Agent's employment with the Union does not exceed one (1) year, unless the period is extended by mutual agreement of the Company, the Union, and the Agent.
F.	The Agent applies in writing to the Company for reemployment under the provision of this Article within ten (10) days after being informed by the Union of the termination of employment with the Union.
G.	The Agent, from the date of termination of service with the Company, has not engaged in any pursuit or calling other than in full-time Union business from which financial remuneration was received.
H.	The Agent is physically and mentally capable of performing all the duties of an Agent. However, it is understood and agreed that:
i.	The Agent will not be entitled to any commissions following the last week of active service with the Company, which a continuance of the Agent's Agreement would have secured to the Agent. Any indebtedness of the Agent to the Company will be a prior lien on any amounts due until the amount of indebtedness is fully paid.
ii.	The period of the Agent's employment with the Union will not be included in calculating the Agent's length of continuous service; and, during such Union employment, neither the Agent nor dependents of the Agent will be entitled to any employee or dependent benefits.
iii.	Upon reemployment, the Agent will be granted credit for continuous service covering only the period commencing with the Agent's continuous service date with the Company and ending with the last day of active service with the Company immediately prior to the Agent's employment with the Union.
iv.	From the date of reemployment of the Agent under the provisions of this Article, the Company will reinstate the Agent's Agreement, resume the fiscal week count, and pay the Agent commissions in accordance with the terms of the Agent's Agreement as herein modified.
v.	At no time shall more than one (1) Agent be absent and entitled to reemployment under the provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE THIRTY-NINE Lockouts, Strikes and Stoppages
1.	During the period of this Contract, the Company will not lock out any Agents.
2.	During the period of this Contract, the Union will not cause or permit its members to cause, nor will any member of the Union take part in any sit-down or stay-in, in any of the Company's offices.
3.	During the period of this Contract, the Union will not cause or permit its members to cause, nor will any member of the Union take part in any strike, stoppage, mass late reporting, mass blank production weeks, or slow down of duties or production, or picket any of the Company's offices, for any reasons whatsoever; nor will the Union or its members engage or participate in any demonstration, display, publication, or advertisement, tending to incite sympathy or protests concerning the relations between the Company and its employees. The term "strike" shall include a strike of any nature, including such as are termed "sympathetic," as well as any cessation or reduction of normal business activities, or efforts by a group of Agents for the purpose of coercing the Company.
33
ARTICLE FORTY
American National Insurance Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy for Career Sales and Service Agents
As a condition of employment, all employees covered by this Bargaining Agreement shall also be governed by American National Insurance Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy for Career Sales and Service Agents. All employees shall be provided a personal copy of such policy. An employee must acknowledge receipt of such policy by signing and returning the acknowledgement to the Company to be placed in the employee's personnel file. Any changes and/or additions mandated by any appropriate regulatory body (state or federal) will become a part of the Company's policy upon the effective date of the mandate. Any other changes will be provided to the Union and subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein or in American National Insurance Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy for Career Sales and Service Agents shall subject Agents to random testing for the existence of drugs or alcohol within their systems.
ARTICLE FORTY-ONE Grievance Procedure
1.	The purpose of this Article is to establish the exclusive procedure for the fair and prompt processing and settling of all disputes, including, but not limited to, any alleged violations of federal or state laws prohibiting discrimination or harassment based on the protected classes listed in this Agreement, as between the Company, the Union and/or any Agents covered by this Agreement.
2.	For the purpose of this Contract, the Grievance procedures set out below shall be available to the employees and to the Union. However, the procedure shall not apply to the following issues:
A.	Any matter reserved solely to the rights of management or to the discretion of the Company by the terms of this Contract, or any matter which is not regulated by this Contract; or except as otherwise specifically provided in this Contract, any matter which would require a change, however slight, from the wages, hours, and conditions of employment set forth in this Contract, or;
B.	Questions concerning a violation of the Article on Strikes and Lockouts or the damages arising from a violation of such Article, or;
C.	Any matter arising out of negotiations over any agreement intended to supplement or replace this Contract, or;
D.	In states whose workers' compensation statutes provide that the same is the exclusive remedy available, grievances involving the application of said states' workers' compensation statutes, or;
E.	Matters involving issues related to retirement benefits as found in this Agreement.
F.	Administrative functions performed in the Home Office are not subject to the grievance procedure.
3.	Step One:
A.	The Union may establish in each District Office or detached office a grievance committee consisting of not more than three (3) persons, all of whom must be Agents working in said District Office or detached office. The Union may change the membership of the grievance committee whenever it deems such change is necessary.
B.	All grievances shall be submitted in the District or detached office in which the Union believes
34
the action complained of occurred; except that if this is impractical, as in the case of an action committed by personnel in another district affecting the Agent, the grievance may be submitted in the Agent’s district or detached office.
C.	The grievance committee shall first present the grievance in writing on an approved grievance form (see “Exhibit A") to the manager in the District Office, or to the Sales Manager in a detached office, within fourteen (14) calendar days if the grievance questions discharge of an Agent, or within thirty (30) calendar days if the grievance questions the application or non-application of the terms of this Contract or within the time limit specified by the applicable statute of limitations of the jurisdiction where the act or omission occurred if involving an allegation of a violation of the anti-discrimination provisions of this Agreement. The time periods specified are from the date of the event complained of or when the Agent learned or should have learned of the event. The grievance must describe the provisions of this Contract allegedly violated, the date of the violation, the date the Agent became aware of the problem, and the remedy sought.
D.	The Manager of the District Office or Sales Manager in a detached office shall review the grievance with the grievance committee, and give the grievance committee and Agent a written answer within fourteen (14) calendar days after the presentation of the grievance to the Manager.
E.	All grievances impractical to institute at the First Step may be instituted at Step 2 if the Company consents. Such consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.
4.	Step Two:
A.	If the union is dissatisfied with the answer of the manager, it may give written notice of its dissatisfaction to the Director of Career Sales and Service Division within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the written answer of the manager. The grievance shall then be referred for conference to the Director of Career Sales and Service Division and to the president of the union, or their designees, who shall not exceed three (3) in number. Neither the Field Directors nor a District Manager of the district involved shall be the designee of the Company.
B.	Unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, the step two conference shall be held no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after the receipt by the Company of the union notice of dissatisfaction with the step one decision, in the Home Office of the Company, unless some other place is mutually agreed upon.
C.	The decision of the Director of Career Sales and Service of the Company or his designee or designees shall be conveyed to the union in writing within ten (10) calendar days after the conference.
ARTICLE FORTY-TWO
Arbitration
1.	In the event any party (the Union, Grievant or the Company) is dissatisfied with the resolution of a grievance pursuant to the provisions of Article Forty-One of this contract, such party may submit the grievance to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the following:
A.	Such request for arbitration shall be made to the Company within fourteen (14) days after notice of determination of the matters in issue by such Director of Career Sales and Service Division or the Director's appointee. Such requests shall be in writing, addressed to the Company at its Home Office in Galveston, Texas, and deposited for delivery via regular mail within fourteen (14) days after mailing in like manner of notice of such determination by such Director of Career Sales and Service Division or the Director's appointee.
35
B.	Grievances which have not been heard by an Arbitrator within a period of ninety (90) calendar days from the date the grievance was filed will be considered to have been abandoned and settled in the Company’s favor and may not be submitted to arbitration. Where the Arbitrator has been selected and notified within the ninety (90) calendar day period from which the grievance was filed but the Arbitrator, due to his/her schedule is unable to hear the matter within the ninety (90) day calendar period, the foregoing provision shall not bar the grievance because of such Arbitrator delay.
C.	The Board of Arbitration shall consist of one (1) arbitrator selected from a list of seven (7) persons provided by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. After the receipt of said list, the Union or the Agent and the Company shall each have the right to strike three (3) names from the list provided by the FMCS in the following manner: the representatives of the Company and the Union or the Agent shall determine by lot the order of elimination and, thereafter, each shall in that order alternately eliminate one (1) name until only one (1) remains. The seventh or remaining person shall be accepted by both the Union or the Agent and the Company as the impartial Arbitrator. The parties may, by mutual agreement, agree to an individual to act as an impartial Arbitrator rather than pursuing the selection process noted above through the FMCS. Should the parties fail to agree to an impartial arbitrator in the matter, then the parties are required to pursue the selection of an Arbitrator as noted above.
D.	Expenses will be borne equally by the Agent and/or the Union on behalf of the Agent and the Company, except in the case where the Union has chosen not to represent the Agent in the Arbitration process in which event the Company shall bear the cost of the Arbitration after the Agent has paid an initial fee of $125.00.
E.	Such arbitration shall be conducted in the state in which the grievance arises and shall be governed by the laws of that state. In the event the Company and Union or the Agent are unable to agree upon a city in that state, then such arbitration shall be held in the city that is the capital of each state.
2.	The arbitration procedure established herein is considered by the parties to be the most expeditious and most effective manner to resolve any and all disputes, potential disputes and/or claims as between the Company, the Union, and/or Agents, their heirs and assigns and is the exclusive method for the resolution of all such claims and/or disputes. The Company, the Union, and the Agents covered by this Agreement shall be required to exhaust all available remedies through grievance and/or arbitration as provided for herein.
3.	The arbitrator selected to hear the dispute has the authority to grant full equitable relief to the grievant and/or other adversely affected Agent. The arbitrator shall not be at liberty to change, add to or subtract from the wording or terms of this Agreement or any supplementation thereto except as required by applicable law.
4.	Parties to the arbitration procedure shall be entitled to representatives, including attorneys, of their own choosing with the understanding that each party shall be responsible to bear the cost of their respective representation. At least thirty (30) calendar days before the arbitration is scheduled, each party shall provide to the other a list of witnesses, their names, addresses and phone numbers that it intends to call at the arbitration proceeding. No other witnesses shall be heard by the arbitrator except those previously identified. Similarly, at least thirty (30) calendar days before the arbitration proceeding, the parties shall provide to each other any and all documents that each party intends to use as exhibits at the arbitration proceeding. Failure to provide exhibits shall preclude their being introduced or considered as evidence at the arbitration proceeding. The parties may enter a written agreement in advance identifying any exhibits that are not required to be produced.
36
5.	Should any term of this arbitration procedure be declared illegal, unenforceable, or unconscionable, the remaining terms of this arbitration procedure shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent possible, both Employee and the Company desire that the arbitrator modify the term(s) declared to be illegal, unenforceable, or unconscionable in such a way as to retain the intended meaning of the term(s) as closely as possible.
6.	The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Company, its Agents, and the Union and its members. The decision of the arbitrator shall be given in writing with both parties being provided the opportunity to file a post-hearing brief with the arbitrator in support of its position. If any party so desires, the decision of the arbitrator may be judicially converted and entered on the docket rolls as a judgment under the respective state's arbitration act.
ARTICLE FORTY-THREE
Conformance to Law
In making this contract, the Company reserves each and all of its rights under existing applicable laws, orders and regulations; and it is agreed that the terms of this contract shall be deemed amended from time to time as may be necessary to bring about compliance by either party with the federal, state or municipal laws relating to the subject matter hereof and regulating or applicable to life insurance or departmental rulings made pursuant to law now or hereafter in force in any of the states within the consolidated unit.
This Contract is subject to the official rulings, requirements, regulations, and executive orders of all applicable governmental agencies. In the event any change is required in any provisions hereof, the adjustment shall be made in a Special Weekly Allowance.
ARTICLE FORTY-FOUR Exclusive Agreement
1.	This Contract supersedes all prior agreements, commitments, and practices, whether oral or written, between the Company and the Union and between the Company and any of the covered employees, and expresses and includes all obligations and restrictions imposed on the Company and the Union.
2.	The Company and the Union acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Contract each party had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Contract. All rights and duties of both parties are specifically expressed in this Contract, and such expression is all-inclusive. This Contract constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and concludes collective bargaining for its term. Therefore, the parties hereto, for the life of this Contract, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Contract, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of any or all of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Contract.
3.	Any practice of the Company in the past, not specifically set out herein, is expressly eliminated as a subject for bargaining and, during the life of this Contract, may not be raised for further bargaining or negotiations.
37
ARTICLE FORTY-FIVE
Effective Date and Duration of Contract
1.	Except as otherwise provided in specific articles hereof, the first day of the term of this Contract is October 5, 2012, through midnight, October 4, 2015, unless extended as provided in paragraph 2 below.
2.	It is agreed, further, however, that unless one of the parties shall, at least sixty (60) days prior to the said expiration date, notify the other party in writing of its election that this contract shall not be extended, the contract shall be automatically extended for a period of one year, and thereafter shall automatically continue to be extended from year to year, unless such notice of election not to extend shall be given at least sixty (60) days before the end of any such year.
3.	Whenever such written notice not to extend this contract is officially given as set forth above, both parties agree to meet for the purpose of negotiating a new contract as soon as possible after the notice is given; provided, however, that in no case shall such negotiations start less than fifteen (15) days before the expiration date as above set forth, unless mutually agreed to the contrary.
4.	Provided, further, that this contract shall continue in full force and effect pending such negotiations for a new contract and may not be terminated during such negotiations by either party and without giving the other party sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof.
