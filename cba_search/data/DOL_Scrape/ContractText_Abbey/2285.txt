AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the J_______day of January 2018, by and
between TRUMP RUFFIN COMMERCIAL, LLC, dba Trump International Hotel Las Vegas (hereinafter, called the “Employer") and its successors and assigns, and the LOCAL JOINT EXECUTIVE BOARD OF LAS VEGAS, for and on behalf of CULINARY WORKERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 226, and BARTENDERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 165 (hereinafter, called the “Union”).
ARTICLE 1:	RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT COVERAGES
1.01. Recognition of the Union.
(a)	The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining
representative for the Employer’s employees employed at its facility as indicated in the first paragraph of this Agreement only, and specifically excluding any persons working for the Employer or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, or other companies with full or partial common ownership, at any other facility, or any subsequently acquired property not organized by the Union, working under the Union’s jurisdiction and working in those job classifications listed in Exhibit 1, attached to and made a part of this Agreement. The Employer and the Union agree that all employees working in classifications listed in Exhibit 1 are properly within the bargaining unit. Any classification established by the Employer not listed in Exhibit 1, where al! of the employees’ duties are covered by this Agreement, shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate comparable to related job classifications.
(b)	For clarification, “all employees” as used in subsection 1.01(a) includes workers the Employer may obtain from a temporary labor source, employment agency or other source besides the Employer’s own hiring process regardless whether the workers are on the Employer’s payroll or that of another entity and regardless of the job classifications or titles assigned to them by another entity, as long as they are performing bargaining unit work at the Employer’s facility. Temporary workers performing such bargaining unit work are covered by all economic terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Employer shall make contributions to benefit funds called for by this Agreement for all hours temporary workers perform such bargaining unit work. If temporary workers are not on the Employer’s payroll, the Employer shall obtain and provide to the Union the same information about such employees as it provides about its own employees pursuant to Section 4.03. The Employer shall also obtain the payroll and personnel records necessary to determine that any temporary workers performing bargaining unit work at the Employer’s facility are being paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and supply copies to the Union upon the Union's request. The Employer shall not enter into any arrangement with any source of temporary workers unless the Employer has the right under such arrangement to obtain and share with the Union the information described herein and shall terminate any arrangement for temporary workers as soon as it has the legal right to do so if the arrangement does not give the Employer the right to obtain and share with the Union the information described herein. The Employer shall provide to the Union copies of any and all contracts, agreements, purchase orders or other documents evidencing any arrangements existing as of the effective date of this Agreement under which the Employer may obtain temporary employees. The Employer and Union shall immediately form a committee of an equal number of high-level representatives of each party to share fully their information
1
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
about the Employer’s labor needs for big events and how those needs can be filled and on what terms. The committee shall have the power to amend this Subsection 1.01(b) by mutual consent. This Subsection 1.01(b) shall be effective at the mutual consent of the committee.
1.02. Open and Excluded Classifications.
Non-bargaining unit employees shall perform no bargaining unit work except such occasional work as is reasonably connected with or incidental to the proper and orderly conduct of the hotel operations they are supervising.
ARTICLE 2:	HIRING OF EMPLOYEES
2.01. Hiring Procedure.
Whenever the employer finds it necessary to hire new employees for those classifications covered by the Agreement, it may recruit and procure applicants from any source.
At its sole option, the Employer may notify the Union who shall assist the Employer in obtaining applicants who meet the qualifications required by the Employer. When applicable, the Union’s selection of applicants for referral shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis, and shall not be based upon or in any way affected by membership in the Union or the Union’s bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspects or obligations of Union membership, policies, or requirements, or upon an applicant’s race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin.
The Employer shall be the sole judge of an applicant’s suitability, competence and qualifications to perform the work of any job to be filled. The Employer may accept or reject any applicant for employment in accordance with applicable laws.
When the Employer considers applicants for employment who have not been referred to the Employer by the Union’s dispatch office, the Employer shall, in order to maintain a consistent and orderly process, advise such applicants that in order to obtain employment they must be dispatched for available positions. The Employer agrees no employee will be hired or put to work without a referral slip from the Union’s Dispatch Office except in the case of an emergency. The Union’s referral service shall send applicants named by the Employer directly back to the Employer. Such applicants named by the Employer shall be processed by the service without any discrimination. Any applicant named by die Employer shall be permitted by the Union’s referral service to register in the same manner as others. If there are any problems with processing of applicants, the parties will review such problems and make such changes as may be necessary.
2.02. Employee Orientation.
At their option the Employer shall give the Union the right to participate in the Employer’s employee orientation process for new employees. Union representatives shall be allowed to either participate jointly or immediately subsequent to Employer representatives in giving new employees information about the Union, the collective bargaining agreement and the benefit programs under the agreement. In advance of each orientation meeting, the Employer shall provide the Union with a list of all new employees who will be involved in the orientation, including each employee’s name, social security, job title, department and Article 10 category.

ARTICLES: SALARIES AND WAGES
5.01. Weekly Payment.
Employees shall be paid weekly, provided that if the Employer’s practice in the past has been to pay semi-monthly or bi-weekly it may continue to do so. The Employer may require that all payments for wages be made by direct deposit into an employee’s bank account as designated by the employee or on a designated pay card chosen by the Employer, Paystubs shall be available to the employee and (other than for employees in “open” classifications) must show the number of hours paid for in that pay period, broken down by straight-time and overtime hours. Records on the source and dates of gratuities included on paychecks shall be made available to the employees on request.
5.02. Gratuities.
All gratuities left by customers are the property of the employees exclusively, except as otherwise noted in this Agreement, and no Employer or department heads not covered by this Agreement shall take any part of such gratuities or credit the same in any manner toward the payment of an
5
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
employee’s wages. Cash gratuities left by guests checking out of rooms shall be the property of Guest Room Attendants unless otherwise specified by the guest in writing. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, employees shall not be required to divide their gratuities with any other person(s), and they shall not be coerced or discriminated against to cause them to do so. The Employer shall not post or display notices restricting gratuities; provided, however, that where the Employer has special events, sales promotions or other functions where the price charged includes gratuities, the Employer may publish and distribute literature, brochures and tickets for same which contain a notice of statement that gratuities are included in such price, if such notice or statement specifies which classifications of employees receive the gratuities.
Gratuities, regardless of the amount, signed by a registered hotel guest on that guest’s individual hotel checks, or by a registered hotel guest or other customer on the guest’s individual credit card, shall be paid to the employee in cash either after the end of the shift or immediately prior to the commencement of the employee’s next shift, provided that, in the case of gratuities signed on a hotel check, the employee must have followed the Employer’s established and published procedure for verifying that the person who signed for the gratuity is a registered hotel guest and is not exceeding his/her established credit limit. Employees who voluntarily participate in a pooling system will have their gratuities distributed on their bi-weekly payroll check.
No employee shall solicit gratuities from other employees.
5.03. Terminated Employees.
(a)	Applicable Laws to Article 5, NRS Section 608.020 - Discharge of an Employee -Immediate Payment: Whenever an employer discharges an employee, the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of such discharge shall become due and payable immediately.
(b)	NRS Section 608.030 - Payment of Employee Who Resigns or Quits Employment: Whenever an employee resigns or quits his or her employment, the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of the employee’s resignation or quitting must be paid no later than:
1.	The day of which the employee would have regularly been paid the wages or compensation; or
2.	Seven days after the employee resigns or quits, whichever is earlier.
5.04. Delinquencies.
If the Employer becomes delinquent in the payment of wages or is operating in receivership by the Board of Trade or a creditors’ committee, or in the case of liquidation or bankruptcy, all salaries earned become due and must be paid at once. In such cases, the Union reserves the right at any time to demand and receive daily payment of wages to all employees, provided that by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union such wages due may be deposited in an approved escrow.

5.05. Deductions and Donations.
(a)	No employee shall be required to subscribe to any form of insurance or to make contributions or suffer any deductions from wages without written authorization of such employee, except as may be required by law.
(b)	There shall be no automatic cash deductions from an employee’s wages for any cash shortage until after consultation with the employee and the responsibility for the shortage has been established by the Employer; provided, however, that prior to any such deductions the employee may have the Union review the case with the Employer. When any said deduction is permitted under the preceding sentence, then, in no event shall the deduction be delayed beyond the latter of five (5) days or the next paycheck due after the employee is notified of the intent to deduct. The Employer shall notify an employee in writing immediately after its determination that a cash shortage exists for which it intends to deduct the shortage from the employee in accordance with the preceding sentence unless the matter is otherwise resolved.
(c)	So long as Food Servers observe the Employer’s published procedure governing walkouts, there will be no automatic cash deductions from employees’ wages pending an investigation.
5.0	6. Superior Workmen.
The wage scales in this Agreement are minimum scales and do not prohibit the Employer from paying higher wages. It is specifically agreed that employees compensated at said higher wage rates may be returned to the scales published herein at the sole discretion of the Employer. Employees paid Superior Workmen rates shall have their wages increased by amounts of not less than the increases in the minimum wage scales as specified in Exhibit 1, attached to and made part of this Agreement, for the classifications in which they are employed.
5.0	7. Combination Jobs.
(a)	Combination jobs, including pay, shall be in accordance with the Employer’s existing practice, as follows. When an employee is assigned to work in two or more classifications in any day, he/she shall clock in/out to change classifications and shall be paid at the classification rate for the actual hours spent clocked-in and performing the duties of the classification. This provision, however, shall not apply in cases of temporary relief for meal and rest periods or other periods of short duration. Further, pursuant to Section 5.09, nothing in this contract shall be construed as limiting the right of the Employer to assign occasional work to any employee in order to ensure the proper and orderly conduct of hotel operations.
(b)	The Employer shall have the right to discuss with the Union, during the term of this Agreement, combining job classifications and the Union agrees to discuss and consider any job classification combinations proposed by the Employer.
5.08. Equal Pay.
The wage scales set forth in Exhibit 1 shall apply equally to male and female employees covered by this Agreement.
5.09. Classifications.
Both the Union and the Employer agree that providing guests with excellent service is the primary objective of all employees. Employees shall normally perform the work that has been
7
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
customarily performed by their job classification at the Employer’s hotel. However, nothing in this contract shall be construed as limiting the right of the Employer to assign occasional work to any employee in order to ensure the proper and orderly conduct of hotel operations.
5.10.	Gratuities For Large Groups.
A gratuity of eighteen percent (18%) shall be added to checks for parties of six (6) or more in all restaurants for guests paying with cash or credit card. This provision shall not apply to complimented guests.
ARTICLE 6: DISCIPLINE
6.01. Cause for Discharge.
(a)	Unless otherwise stated in this agreement, no employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 19.01, shall be disciplined and/or discharged except for just cause. The Employer shall follow a system of progressive discipline. The parties agree that progressive discipline normally requires, prior to suspension or discharge, that an employee be given a written opportunity to correct the deficiency, but that within the principle of progressive discipline, the Employer may impose immediate suspension or discharge for the following:
(i)	dishonesty;
(ii)	incompetence;
(iii)	misconduct;
(iv)	insubordination;
(v)	discourteous conduct toward a guest or an employee;
(vi)	failure to report to work without just cause;
(vii)	walking off the job during a shift;
(viii)	drinking alcohol or using a controlled substance, or being under the influence thereof, during the employee’s shift, or unauthorized possession thereof on hotel premises;
(ix)	destruction of property;
(x)	theft;
(xi)	engaging in any form of harassment;
(xii)	sleeping while on duty;
(xiii)	violence or threats of violence;
(xiv)	possession of firearms, explosives or illegal weapons on company property; and
8
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
(xv)	solicitation of gratuities.
When an employee who has completed the probationary period is disciplined and/or discharged, the reason therefore will be given to the employee in writing. Based on the Union and Employer’s established practice when an employee is discharged, copies of the written notice to the employee will be sent to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours of the discharge. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relevant to discipline or discharge, including videotapes, shall be provided to the Union.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level of .10 provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol. In the event the State of Nevada lowers the legal presumption of intoxication below the .10 level, the contract shall automatically be amended to reflect the lower level. A positive GC/MS blood te§t result for a controlled substance provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of the identified controlled substance.
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter. A copy of any written warning notice shall be Issued to the employee. The employee shall be required to sign all notices for the purposes of acknowledging receipt. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer’s own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.03. Time of Discharge.
No employees shall be discharged on his/her day off or while on vacation.
6.04. Disciplinary Suspension.
Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action. Suspensions for offenses listed under Article 6.01(a) shall not be removed from the employee’s personnel file.
ARTICLE?: REPORTING PAY
7.01. Reasons for Payment.
When the Employer or its representative orders an employee to report for work, or fails to notify an employee not to report for work as previously scheduled, for any reason, and said employee is not allowed to work, the Employer shall pay the employee at the employee’s regular rate of pay
9
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
for the employees’ scheduled shift, provided, however, that where an employee is sent home after commencing work because the Employer cannot present scheduled entertainment due to bona fide illness or disability of the entertainer or entertainers to perform, the employee shall be paid for the hours actually worked or four (4) hours, whichever is greater.
7.0	2. Discharged Employees.
Employees who are discharged must be notified not later than the end of their shift, except in cases of discharge for dishonesty discovered by the Employer after the end of the shift. If this is not done and the employee reports for work on his/her next regularly scheduled shift and is not allowed to work, the employee shall be paid for the scheduled shift.
7.0	3. Early Shift Release.
Employees shall not be required by the Employer to leave work before the end of a scheduled shift on which the employees have commenced work, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01; provided that this Section shall not be construed to prohibit an employee, with the Employer’s approval, from voluntarily leaving work early if the employee so desires and being paid only for the time actually worked on the shift.
ARTICLE 8:	DISCRIMINATION AND LIE DETECTOR TESTS
8.01. Prohibited Discrimination.
There shall be no discrimination by the Employer or the Union against any employee because of membership or non-membership in, or activity on behalf of the Union, provided that an employee’s Union activities shall not interfere with the performance of the employee’s work for the Employer. In accordance with applicable laws, there shall be no discrimination against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, privileges of or opportunities for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability or sexual orientation.
8.02. Lie Detector Tests Prohibited.
(a)	No employee shall be required or requested by the Employer to take a lie detector test.
(b)	Applicants for positions other than those for which individual bondable status is required under Section 8.04 shall not be given lie detector tests.
8.03. Confessions or Statements.
No employee shall be required, requested or coerced by the Employer or by any employee of the Employer to resign, or to sign a confession or statement concerning his/her conduct unless a Union representative is first given an opportunity to be present.
8.04. Bondable Status.
In accordance with the present practice as it exists with this Employer, employees who regularly, in the course of their employment, are required to handle money or negotiable instruments may be required to maintain bondable status as a condition of employment.

ARTICLE 9:	WORK SHIFTS, WORKWEEK AND OVERTIME
9.01. Shift and Weekly Overtime.
(a)	For the purposes of computing overtime only, eight (8) hours shall constitute a full shift based on a five (5) day workweek; ten (10) hours shall constitute a full shift, based on a four (4) day workweek; and six (6) hours or less shall constitute a short shift. All work performed in excess of eight (8) hours or ten (10) hours, if applicable on one (1) workday, or in excess of forty (40) hours in a week shall constitute overtime and shall be paid for at time and one-half (l-’/zX) the employee’s straight time hourly rate of pay. Except as provided for in Section 10.07, work performed on an employee’s sixth (6th) and seventh (7th) consecutive days of work shall be paid for at time and one-half (1-J6X) and two and one-half times (2-!4X) the employee’s straight-time hourly rate of pay respectively. Overtime shall not be paid under this Section for more than one reason for the same hours worked. Holidays not worked and paid for at straight-time under Section 12.02(a) of this Agreement shall count as a shift for the purposes of Section 9.03(a). Employees absent for personal reasons on any one or more of their first five (5) scheduled days of work in their workweek may work at the Employer’s request on a scheduled day off in the same workweek at straight-time.
Ten (10) hour shifts may be scheduled for employees in all classifications, except for Cooks, Utility Porters, and Housekeeping classifications (excluding Preventative Maintenance workers, who work ten (10) hour shifts), who may voluntarily agree to be scheduled for ten (10) hour shifts. Except as provided for in Section 10.07, all work performed by an employee with a ten (10) hour shift on that employee’s fifth (5th) consecutive day of work will be paid at time and one-half (l-'/zX), on that employee’s sixth (6th) consecutive day of work will be paid at two times (2X), and on that employee’s seventh (7th) consecutive day of work will be paid at two and one-half times (2-'AX) the employee’s straight-time hourly rate of pay respectively.
In the event an employee requests to change their regular work schedule and overtime pay would be required under this article, if the Employer grants the requested schedule change, the overtime provisions of this article would not apply for the employee that made the request. If the employee-requested schedule change involves more than one employee, i.e. trading days off, then all employees involved must waive their right to overtime under this provision.
(b)	The workweek for on-call and part-time employees shall coincide with the Employer’s workweek. If an on-call or part-time employee works more than forty (40) hours in a workweek or more than eight (8) hours in a shift, overtime will be paid at the appropriate overtime rate. Also, if an on-call or part-time employee works a consecutive sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) day in the same workweek, overtime shall be paid for such sixth (6,h) and seventh (7th) consecutive days as provided for above.
9.0	2. Days Off.
The Employer supports the principle of providing its employees with two (2) days off, or three (3) days off for employees on a ten (10) hour per day schedule, during each seven (7) day workweek. The Employer will make a reasonable, good-faith effort to schedule days off consecutively, except that when business conditions dictate, the Employer may split them. An employee may voluntarily elect to split their days off, which must be approved in advance by
11
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
the Employer. An employee who works on a scheduled day off shall be paid in accordance with Section 9.01. This Section shall not apply to Relief, On-Call, Extra, or Part-time employees.
9.0	3. Guaranteed Work.
(a)	Regular and relief employees who are scheduled and report for work at the beginning of their workweek shall be guaranteed pay for the following number of shifts for which they are scheduled in that workweek.
(b)	1. Not less than four (4) or five (5) full shifts as defined in Section 9.01 for:
COOKS AND UTILITY PORTER CLASSIFICATIONS except Utility Porters for banquets and private parties;
HOUSEKEEPING CLASSIFICATIONS;
BAR CLASSIFICATIONS except Banquet Bartenders and BARTENDERS serving hospitalities and cocktail parties;
2.	Not less than four (4) or five (5) full or short shifts as defined in Section 9.01 for Host Persons, for al! Food and Cocktail Server classifications, and for all Bus Person classifications.
(c)	However notwithstanding the above provisions, the weekly guarantee shall not apply to the following situations:
1.	The first week of employment, including the first week of active employment on return from absence from work or layoff.
2.	The week in which an employee begins his/her vacation or other absence from the job if said vacation or absence does not begin at the end of the employee’s scheduled workweek.
3.	Shift changes brought about by senior employees bidding in accordance with Section 19.04.
4.	The first and last week of employment for employees hired to provide relief for vacations or other absences from the job.
5.	Where the Employer, Union and the employee have mutually agreed that the employee would be scheduled for and work less than the contractually provided for workweek and/or shift.
6.	When the Employer’s establishment or any part thereof is closed as a result of an Act of God, mechanical failure, fire or failure of an entertainer to perform.
12
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
7.	When the Employer closes any part of its establishment for any reasons other than those stated in paragraph 6 and notice thereof is given to affected employees at least two (2) weeks in advance.
9.04. Split Shift
(a)	Split shifts shall be allowed only for Food Servers, Bus Persons, and Runners. The split shift shall be eight (8) hours within eleven (11) hours, with one (1) split. Any employee working a split shift shall receive two dollars ($2.00) per shift in addition to the regular rate of pay.
(b)	For employees working in distressed venues as specified in Section 10.07, the Employer may schedule split shifts for Relief, On-Call, and Part-Time employees, provided (i) there shall be no more than four (4) hours between the segments of a shift and (ii) all shifts (continuous and split) for Relief employees shall be bid by seniority as provided in Section 19.04.
9.05. Posting.
The Employer shall post each week, in a conspicuous place in each department available to Union representatives, a work schedule showing the first and last name and classification of each employee, and specifying days off and starting and finishing time, and house and classification seniority dates. When employees not originally scheduled to work during any week are later called into work during that week, their names and classifications and seniority dates shall be added to the posted work schedule not later than the end of the first shift they work. Social Security numbers will be provided to the Union upon request.
At least seventy-two (72) hours* notice must be given to employees whose scheduled days off are to be changed. An employee whose shift starting time is to be changed for the employee’s next scheduled shift must be so notified in person before leaving work on his/her prior shift. No regular employee shall be required to call in or stand by for calls. Shifts may not be rotated.

13
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
10.04. Extra Employee.
An extra employee, as distinguished from an on-call or part-time, is a temporary or part-time employee who is hired for pre-designated shifts (which pre-designated shifts shall be communicated to the hiring hall) to perform work in addition to or as vacation or temporary absence replacement for regular and relief employees already employed by the Employer. The pre-designated period may be extended where the replacement or supplemental period is extended upon agreement with the Union. Such agreement by the Union will not be unreasonably withheld. Extra employees shall not be covered by Articles 6, 11, 13 and 20, nor by Section 9.03,12.02(a), and 23.02.
10.05. Part-time Employee.
A part-time employee is an employee who is carried on the Employer’s regular payroll but whose work is not guaranteed under the terms of Section 9.03 of this Agreement.
10.06. Seasonal Pool Food and Beverage Employees.

Seasonal classification shall be limited to: pool cocktail servers, pool bartenders, pool apprentice bartenders, pool food servers, pool bus persons, pool runners, pool cooks, and pool stewarding workers. Seasonal employees shall not be covered by Articles 6,11, and 20, nor by Section 9.03, 12.02(a), and 23.02.
10.07. Staffing for Distressed Food and Beverage Venues.
(a)	During the term of this Agreement, the Employer may implement the conditions set forth in this Section in any buffet, coffee shop, room service or other food and beverage operation that the Employer and the Union agree is experiencing such stress that it may close or suffer a serious cut in style or hours of operation or in size. The venues included are listed on Exhibit B which may be amended from time to time to add venues as provided below.
(b)	In addition to regular full time, on-call, and part-time job categories, the Union and Employer have agreed to implement the job category of Full Time Flex as defined in this Section for all food and beverage job classifications (except the Utility Porter classification) in the venues identified on Exhibit B (to include the kitchen areas dedicated to each such venue). The Parties agree to meet within thirty (30) days after the yearly anniversaries of this Agreement to discuss the Full Time Flex category and any related issues. It shall be presumed that any new cafe, buffet and room service venue shall, at the request of the Employer, be added to Exhibit B upon opening to the public. Upon the Employer's request, the Parties will meet and discuss the inclusion of additional venues on Exhibit B. However, if the Employer seeks to add venues and/or additional kitchens to the list, including fine dining venues, it shall provide the Union with relevant information demonstrating that the venue is or is becoming economically distressed and the venue may be added to the list by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union.
(c)	A Full Time Flex employee is carried on the Employer's regular food and beverage payroll and guaranteed a work schedule consisting of a thirty (30) hour work week made up of no more than six (6) shifts of four (4), six (6), eight (8) or ten (10) hours. Work performed by a

Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
Full Time Flex, on-call, or part-time employee working in a distressed venue on the employee's seventh (7th) consecutive day of work shall be paid for at two and one halftimes (2-1/2X) the employee’s straight time hourly rate of pay.
(d)	Employees classified as Full Time Flex shall not exceed forty percent (40%) of the total number of bargaining unit employees in each classification employed by Employer in the venues identified on Exhibit B. Full Time Flex employees shall be offered additional work which becomes available before such work is offered to on-call or part-time employees (so long as such work would not result in the employee incurring overtime).
(e)	When a full-time flex category is first introduced into a venue, the Employer will determine the number of full time, Full Time Flex, on-call, and part-time positions needed in each classification.
1.	If the staffing levels established by the Employer include a reduction in the number of regular full time positions, the Employer will provide regular full time employees the opportunity to volunteer to move to a Full Time Flex position in their classification. If there are no or insufficient volunteers, the most senior employees in the classification shall remain regular full time employees and the remainder shall be re-classified as Full Time Flex.
2.	If available Full Time Flex positions are not filled by reclassification of regular full time employees, such positions will be posted for bid for on-call and part-time employees in the classification and shall be awarded by seniority in their classification.
3.	If an insufficient number of on-call and part-time employees bid on open Full Time Flex positions, such positions wifi be posted for promotional bidding.
4.	An on-call or part-time employee who does not obtain or accept a Full Time Flex position will be remain as an on-call or part-time employee.
(f)	The Employer may cross-utilize employees in all cooking and runner classifications to work in more than one of the venues listed on Exhibit B either during the same shift or during the same work week.

(g)	As provided in 10.07(a), the Employer and the Union may mutually agree to extend the terms of this section to newly opened venues, to restaurants other than buffets or coffee shops, or all or any combination of these.
(h)	A committee composed of Union and Employer representatives shall develop a joint program to inform bargaining unit employees and managers about the provisions relative to distressed venues, including recall rights, and then to monitor the implementation of this Section 10.07 to address any issues that arise during and after implementation.
(i)	Recall rights for employees laid off from distressed food and beverage outlets.
15
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
1.	Employer shall recall any employee who was laid off on or after January 1, 2017, as a result of the elimination of shifts, reduction of hours or closing of any food and beverage outlet identified on Exhibit B (a “Laid-Off Employee”) to the same outlet from which the employee was laid off if, the Employer (a) elects to implement the conditions set forth in this Section 10.07; (b) restores shifts, expands hours of operation, or reopens the outlet; and (c) adds additional staff. Provided, however, that for the purposes of this Section only, in the event a closed outlet reopens as a new outlet, Laid-Off Employees are only eligible for recall if the new outlet is similar in operations and in style of service to the prior outlet. For example, a casual dining outlet that reopens as a fine dining outlet would not be considered similar in operations or style of service. The parties shall agree upon a list of Laid -Off Employees eligible for these extended recall rights (the “Extended Recall Rights List”) which shall be attached hereto as Exhibit A. Any employee who should have been on the Extended Recall List but was left off accidentally shall be added to the list for future job opportunities by mutual agreement of the parties. However, anyone added to the list pursuant to this Section shall not be entitled to any compensation for any act or omission resulting from not being on the list previously (i.e. back pay, back benefits or benefit fund contributions), shall not have any right to displace any recalled or working employee, and the Union will not process any grievance relating to an employee being left off the list.
2.	The Employer shall send a recall notice via certified mail, return receipt requested, to each eligible Laid-Off Employee in the affected outlet to the employee's last known address or alternative address supplied by the Union (if any) no fewer than fort y-five (45) days before posting available positions, or as soon as practicable thereafter, once staffing needs are determined. The Employer shall simultaneously give copies of all recall notices to the Union. A Laid-Off Employee must respond to a recall notice within fourteen (14) days of the date the recall notice was mailed to the employee in order to be entitled to recall. Any Laid-Off Employee who fails to respond as directed in the recall notice within fourteen (14) days, or who declines to be recalled, shall be permanently removed from the Extended Recall Rights List and his/her seniority and continuous service terminated.
3.	Laid-Off Employees shall only be recalled to openings in the same classifications they held in the outlet at the time of layoff, in order of classification seniority and with priority over all other applicants, internal or external. After Laid-Off Employees in each classification have accepted recall to their classifications, if there are fewer available positions in a classification than there are Laid-Off Employees who accepted recall, such employees may apply for open, available bargaining unit positions in the outlet. The Employer shall select any Laid-Off Employees in order of house seniority who apply for said vacancies ahead of all other internal or external applicants, provided they are qualified to do the work at the time the vacancy exists.
4.	Laid-Off Employees recalled pursuant to this section shall be reinstated with their
corporate (continuous service for vacation purposes), house and classification seniority intact as of the date they were laid off.

ARTICLE 11:	VACATIONS
11.01. Amount of Vacation.
The Employer provides paid vacation for full-time and part-time employees and encourages them to utilize this benefit. Vacation is paid at the employee’s rate of pay at the time vacation leave is taken.
Full-time and part-time employees begin to earn vacation days on their hire date. Vacation days may not be taken until the completion of 90 days of continuous employment. Employees do not accrue vacation days during any unpaid leave of absence, including FMLA leave. Part-time employees accrue on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the number of days/hours worked per week. Vacation will be based upon the hours employees are regularly scheduled to work during the past anniversary year. Vacation will be compensated at regular straight-time rate of pay as of the date vacation is taken. Employees are encouraged to take time off. Employees are responsible for taking time off; days in excess of maximum carry over will be forfeited.
Upon termination of employment, employees will be paid for any accrued and unused vacation days in accordance with applicable law.
Vacation is earned as follows:
Full-Time and Part-Time:
Years of Employment	Hours earned per 8 0-hour Pay Period	Max Days Earned Per Year
Year 1	1.5385	5
Years 2-4	3.0769	io’
Years 5+	4,6154	15
17
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
The maximum number of carryover days during a year is as follows:
Years of Employment	Max Days / Hours Accrued Each Year	Maximum Carryover Days/Hours @ Anniversary Date
Year 1	5 days/40 hours	2 days/16 hours
Years 2-4	10 days/80 hours	5 days/40 hours
Years 5+	15 days/120 hours	6 days/56 hours
11.02. Break in Employment.
A change in ownership of the Employer shall not break an employee’s continuity of service for the purpose of vacation eligibility. Except as provided otherwise in Section 19.05, time absent from work while on authorized leave of absence or while on layoff shall not break an employee’s continuity of service. Neither time absent from work while on authorized leave of absence nor while on layoff shall change an employee’s anniversary date. Time absent from work while on authorized leave of absence or while on layoff shall be counted as months and years of continuous service in computing the number of weeks of paid vacation due and for all purposes of vacation eligibility. Provided, however, that the amount of paid vacation due an employee in a particular anniversary year will be reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect any time absent from work while on authorized leave of absence or while on layoff in excess of a total of thirty (30) days during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the employee’s anniversary date.
11.03. Time of Taking Vacation.
Vacation shall be taken in accordance with the Employer’s existing vacation practices, as follows. Vacation time may not be used until it is earned. Vacation time must be used in eighthour increments. When requesting vacation time, the employee should submit the request at least two (2) weeks in advance. Requests for vacation time with less notice except for illness will be considered only if there is an unforeseen emergency. The Employer may waive the notice period when business is slow and/or when the Employer is encouraging employees to take paid time off.
Written requests for vacation time will be handled on a first-come, first-served basis. Decisions to approve vacation time will be based on the staffing requirements needed to maintain hotel service levels. If multiple requests for vacation time are received at the same time, preference will be given based on seniority. However, once a vacation request is approved, it will not be changed because an employee with more seniority subsequently requests that same time off.
11.04. Vacation Pay.
Vacations pay shall be paid to employees in accordance with the Employer’s existing vacation pay practices, as follows. Vacation pay shall be computed on the basis of the employee’s current rate of pay at the time the vacation is taken; provided, however, that if an employee is regularly
18
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
scheduled to work in two (2) or more classifications with different rates of pay, the employee’s vacation pay shall be computed based on the rate of the employee’s primary job classification. Vacation pay shall be paid on the next regularly scheduled pay date for the payroll cycle in question.

ARTICLE 19:	SENIORITY
19.01. Probationary Period.
An employee will be considered as a probationary period employee until he/she has completed the initial orientation session(s) and ninety (90) days of work after his/her most recent date of hire by the Employer, after which his/her seniority shall date back to his/her most recent date of hire by the Employer. A probationary employee may be terminated at the discretion of the Employer, and such termination shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Probationary employees are not eligible for leaves of absence. The above probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union.
19.02. Definition of Seniority.
(a)	House seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee’s most recent date of hire into the bargaining unit as a regular, relief, on-call, or part-time employee by the Employer.
(b)	Classification seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee’s most recent date of hire into or transfer into his/her present classification on a full-time basis.
(c)	In the administration of this Agreement each of the classifications listed in Exhibit 1 is a separate and distinct classification.
(d)	The Employer will conduct lotteries for individual seniority among the effected employees that house or classification seniority fall on the same date.
19.03. Layoffs and Recalls.
(a)	In the event of layoffs due to a reduction in force, probationary employees within the affected classification(s) will be the first to be laid off. Employees will be laid off from and recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with their house seniority, provided they have the qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work available in their regular job classification. It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In accordance with their seniority, employees in layoff status will be offered, but not required to perform (subject to subparagraph [c]), all extra work in their classifications except for banquets or parties, before Extra employees are hired, before on-call and part-time employees are offered such work, and, to the extent practical, before regular and relief employees are assigned to work their sixth (6th) day; provided, however, that such employees who are offered and accept extra work shall be paid as Extra employees for such work in accordance with Section 10.04, but shall not be covered by the provisions of Section 9.03. For employees laid off without reasonable expectation of recall within sixty (60) days, the Employer shall provide employees with notice of vacancies (by posting or otherwise), and employees on layoff may apply for these vacancies. Employer shall select employees on layoff, who apply for said vacancies, provided that they are qualified to do the work. Employees must
26
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
successfully complete a ninety (90) day probationary period. Employee’s recall rights shall be unaffected by the operation of the above provision.
(b)	In the event of a layoff because of circumstances affecting only a portion of the establishment such as a room closing, the affected employees may be laid off without regard to house seniority, provided the layoff is scheduled to be fourteen (14) days or less, or, in the case of housekeeping department employees, the layoff is scheduled to be seven (7) days or less.
(c)	Employees to be laid off in accordance with Section 19.03(a) may be laid off without regard to their respective house seniority as each completes his/her current workweek. At the time of layoff the employee shall state availability or non-availability for extra work; where the employee indicates availability, the employee shall not be called for extra work after he/she refuses two (2) out of seven (7) offers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee may declare unavailability for extra work for a definite period while on layoff.
(d)	Specialty/Gourmet Room Cooks will not be laid off under the terms of Section 19.03(b) where they are immediately qualified to perform the work of cooks in their classifications in other kitchens, provided they have sufficient classification seniority to displace cooks in other kitchens.
(e)	Employees shall be recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)	If a position is restored less than 90 days of when it was eliminated, and if the person who held it is still actively at work, the person is returned to the position, or if the person who held it is on layoff, the most senior person on layoff is recalled to it, except that if multiple people on layoff are to be recalled at about the same time to several positions that have been restored or created, and the person who formerly held the position is one of those to be recalled, then the person is returned to his/her former position regardless of the relative seniority among those to be recalled.
(2)	If a position is restored 90 days or more after it was eliminated, or a new position is created, it is put up for bid. This is true even if the person who formerly held the position is still actively at work. All regular employees may bid, but laid off employees may not bid. If there are no bidders, the most senior person on layoff is recalled to the position and cannot refuse it.
(3)	Employees who obtain a position by bidding shall not be eligible for another transfer under this subsection or under Section 19.04(b) for six (6) months. Those who are transferred to a position without bidding remain eligible for transfer under those provisions.
19.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	When the Employer promotes an employee to another classification, the Employer will consider the employee’s seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in the other classification, and prior performance; and provided further, any employee, before being promoted to the classification of Bartender, must have passed the craft examination for
27
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
Bartenders conducted by the Union. Where qualifications to perform the work in the other classifications are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. The Employer shall encourage internal bidding in order to maximize promotional opportunities to permanent vacancies, but the Employer’s promotion decision shall be deemed to be valid unless arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. An employee who has successfully completed the course of training offered by the Southern Nevada Joint Management Culinary & Bartenders Training Fund for a promotional position, or the Employer’s in-house training program, shall be deemed qualified for such position. For purposes of this paragraph (a) and Article 19 of this Agreement, a “promotion” shall be deemed to be a transfer from one classification to another, regardless of any change in compensation. Any permanent vacancy that is not filled pursuant to Sections 19.04(b) or (c) of this Agreement, and which would constitute a “promotion” compared to another bargaining unit classification, shall be filled in accordance with this section, provided there is a qualified bidder. Permanent vacancies to be filled by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours near the employees’ time clock or other location to which employees have regular access. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period. An employee promoted under this section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which promoted, shall be transferred back to his/her former job, shift and station within thirty (30) shifts worked after the date of the promotion.
(b)	When there is a permanent vacancy, or a temporary vacancy of at least ninety (90) days, on a particular shift or station, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or stations who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their classification seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/or station applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the employee desiring to transfer. An employee transferred under this Section shall assume the weekly schedule of days of work and days off, and the daily shift scheduled, applicable to the vacant position to which he/she transfers, and the employee shall not be eligible for another transfer under this Section for six (6) months. An employee transferred under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which transferred shall be transferred back to his/her former shift and/or station within thirty (30) shifts worked from the date of transfer. The resulting vacancy or vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or station who desires to work on the shift or station where the vacancy exists. Permanent vacancies under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours in the department where the vacancy exists. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period.
(c)	On-call and Part-time employees. The Employer shall offer to on-call and part-time employees in a classification, in accordance with their on-call or part-time classification seniority, the first two out of every three permanent vacancies in that classification, after employees in that classification have exhausted their rights under Section 19.04(b) of this Agreement. Every third such vacancy will be filled by promotion as provided in Section 19.04(a) of this Agreement. On-call and part-time employees will have the same rights as other employees to bid for promotions using house seniority from original date of hire (as provided in Section 19.04). On-call and part-time employees who become regular or relief employees shall not be required to serve a new probationary period provided that the transfer is
28
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
within the same classification. If an On-Call or Part-time employee becomes a regular or relief employee, their classification seniority shall date from most recent date of transfer into their present classification on a full-time basis, and house seniority shall date from original date of hire.
19.05. Break in Continuous Service and Seniority.
An employee’s continuous service, seniority and status as an employee will be broken when:
(a)	The employee quits.
(b)	The employee is discharged for just cause.
(c)	The employee is absent exceeding the period of an authorized leave of absence.
(d)	The employee is absent, due to injury or illness sustained during the course of employment, exceeding the period for which statutory, temporary, total disability payments are payable under the Employer’s Insurance Company of Nevada (EICON), provided that the employee shall have one (1) week after his/her release in which to return to work. However, the time required for an appeal through the appeals officer level shall not, in and of itself, constitute a break in the employee’s seniority.
(e)	The employee is absent because of layoff exceeding six (6) months if the employee had less than six (6) months of active employment when the layoff began, or absent because of layoff exceeding twelve (12) months if he had six (6) or more months of active employment when the layoff began. However, this provision shall not apply to layoffs because of construction lasting less than eighteen (18) months.
(f)	The employee is absent exceeding six (6) months because of illness or injury not compensable under the Employer’s Insurance Company of Nevada (EICON).
19.06. Notification.
An employee who is to be recalled to work by the Employer under Section 19.03 shall be notified to return to work by the Employer advising the employee by telephone, certified mail return receipt requested, or other available means of communication of the date and time the employee is to report, and by confirming such communication by certified mail return receipt requested to the employee’s current address of record on file with the Employer. A copy of the confirmation letter shall be sent to the Union. Reasonable advance notice must be given an employee being recalled. If such employee fails to report to work within forty-eight (48) hours after the time specified for the employee to report, the employee’s seniority and continuous service shall be terminated, and the Employer shall be free to hire a replacement in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 20: GRIEVANCES AND ARBITRATION
20.01. Definition.
For purposes of this Agreement, a grievance is a dispute or difference of opinion between the Union and the Employer involving the meaning, interpretation, application to employees covered by this Agreement.
29
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
20.02. Step One Process and Time Limits for Filing Grievances.
(a)	Step One Process. The Employer and the Union agree to implement (if they have not already done so) a Step One Process for complaints and disputes related to individual disputes raised by an employee. The Step One Process gives responsibility to employees, union shop stewards and front line management to resolve workplace problems directly, quickly and cooperatively. The Step One Process is designed to reduce the level of formalism in the grievance procedure.
Under the Step One Process, an employee with a complaint or dispute shall use his or her best efforts to, within five (5) calendar days of the incident or circumstances giving rise to the dispute, or within five (5) calendar days of the time the employee reasonably could have acquired knowledge of the event, present the matter to his/her immediate supervisor. An employee has the right to request the involvement of the shop steward in this Step One Process. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to secure the presence of a union steward if he/she wishes to have the steward present during the discussion with the employee’s immediate supervisor.
The supervisor involved in the Step One discussion shall use his/her best efforts to respond to the employee within five (5) calendar days of such discussion. Such response may be in the form of a proposed resolution of the matter or may be a communication to the employee scheduling a meeting to further discuss the matter.
Settlements reached during the Step One Process shall be considered non-precedent setting, unless the Employer and the Union expressly agree that the settlement shall be reduced to writing and may be used as precedent in the future. However, the Parties agree that if a resolution is reached during the Step One process, documentation of the resolution shall be prepared and signed off on by the Company, the Employee and the Steward (if involved).
The Parties agree to provide jointly the required Step One Process training to current management personnel (including third party operators involved in the administration and application of this Agreement) and shop stewards by July, 2017. Refresher training will be scheduled at eighteen (18) month intervals for new management and shop stewards.
(b)	If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute or complaint in the Step One Process, such dispute or complaint may be reduced to writing as a formal grievance and shall proceed to a Board of Adjustment as provided in Section 20.03 of this Article.
20.03. Step Two Process - Procedure for Adjusting Formal Grievances.
All grievances shall be adjusted exclusively in the following manner:
(a)	No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is received in writing by either party within twenty (20) calendar days after occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or after the aggrieved party hereto acquires knowledge of the occurrence of such event, whichever is later. The written grievance shall set forth the provision(s) of this Agreement alleged to have been violated, and every effort will be made to set forth all of the known facts allegedly constituting the violation. At the time it submits a grievance to the Employer, the
30
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of any written statements, reports or documents relied on by the Union or the Grievant to support the grievance (but not including the employee’s written grievance submitted to the Union).
(b)	BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT. Any unresolved grievance shall be reduced to writing and scheduled for hearing by a Board of Adjustment within twenty (20) calendar days of the filing of the grievance. The Board of Adjustment shall be comprised of not more than three (3) representatives of the Employer and three (3) representatives of the Union. For the purpose of attempting to resolve grievances prior to arbitration, the parties, at any meeting prior to the Board of Adjustment hearing and at that hearing, shall make full disclosure to each other of all facts and evidence then know to them which bear on the grievance.
(c)	FORMAL ARBITRATION. Any grievance not settled by the Board of Adjustment may be referred to arbitration by written notice by the party who filed the grievance within twenty (20) calendar days of the Board of Adjustment. Representatives of the Employer and the Union may agree to select an arbitrator, but if they are unable to do so, the arbitrator shall be chosen from the panel, received from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (“FMCS”), of arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators and who reside in California or Nevada. No arbitrator shall be chosen to serve in two (2) consecutive arbitrations for the same hotel unless by mutual consent of the parties. The arbitrator shall be notified in writing of his/her selection, and shall have no authority, jurisdiction or power to amend, modify, nullify or add to the provisions of this Agreement. No evidence shall be introduced as to the withdrawal, during negotiations, of a proposal to change the Agreement. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Employer, the Union, and the employee(s) involved. Except in discharge cases, the expenses and fees of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Employer and the Union. In discharge cases, the expenses and fees of the arbitrator, and of the court reporter, if any, shall be paid by the party losing the arbitration. Where, in a discharge case, reinstatement is ordered by an arbitrator with less than full back pay, the costs of arbitration shall be divided evenly between the parties.
(d)	EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS. The time limits and other provisions set forth in this Article 20 may be extended or waived by mutual agreement of the parties.
20.04. Buyouts and Mitigation.
Employees with less than two (2) years’ service may be offered by the Company, no later than thirty (30) days following Employer’s receipt of the Union’s demand for arbitration, two (2) months’ pay including the higher of declared or assigned tips in lieu of processing a grievance and arbitrating the discharge. In the event the employee declines this offer when made by the Employer, the Union will not arbitrate the discharge unless it objectively determines that, in its judgment, the discharge constituted a flagrant miscarriage of justice. In the event a positive determination is made, and the Union processes the discharge to arbitration, the arbitration procedure to be used, i.e., either type of expedited procedure or the regular arbitration procedure, shall be determined by the Employer notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20.03.
Any employee covered by this Agreement who is discharged by the Employer and who disputes his/her discharge was for just cause shall have an affirmative duty to mitigate any potential

damages which might result to the Employer in the event the discharge involved is subject to Article 20 of this Agreement (Grievance and Arbitration) and an arbitrator overrules the discharge. In any dispute over the amount of back pay due to an employee under an arbitration award, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award any back pay to that employee for any period of time since his/her discharge unless it is reasonable to do so taking into account the efforts by the employee to fulfill his/her duty to mitigate damages with respect to that period of time.
20.05. Alternative Dispute Resolution.
The Parties recognize that there exists a mutual concern regarding the prompt, efficient and effective resolution of arbitration matters related to discipline and/or termination matters. The Parties agree, therefore, to implement a program (“Program”) designed to facilitate early presentation of arbitration matters to a neutral party for evaluation and resolution. However, the Parties both understand and agree that this Program is not intended as a substitute for early resolution of grievance matters through the Step One Process and/or the Board of Adjustment (“BOA”) process. Rather, it is intended to provide a procedure whereby the Parties are able to obtain a timely resolution of certain grievances.
A.	Coverage.
11
A grievance challenging disciplinary action or termination issued to an employee, that is not resolved through the Step One or BOA processes, may be subject to the Program. A grievance meeting the criteria set forth in this paragraph herein may be submitted to the Program if a timely demand for arbitration is made by the Party who filed the grievance and use of this Program is indicated in the demand.
The non-filing Party may object to the submission of the grievance to the Program, by providing written notice to the other Party within twenty (20) calendar days of the receipt of the demand for arbitration. In such event, the grievance shall proceed under Section 20.03 of this Article.
B.	Structure of the Program.
The Parties shall submit the grievance to a three person panel for a final and binding decision.
1.	Panel and Hearing Dates.
A panel of three (3) persons shall be established (“Panel”). One member of the Panel shall be selected by each Party. The person selected by each Party shall hold a high level position with their organization, shall commit to participate in the Program for the entire period of the program, and shall be given full authority to act as a neutral decision maker relative to any grievance presented to the Panel. The third member of the Panel shall be the Panel Chairperson and shall be selected jointly by the Parties. The Parties will share equally in the costs associated with engagement of the Panel Chairperson. The Panel Chairperson shall be a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators and shall be someone who agrees to serve as the Panel Chairperson for the entire period of the Program.
32
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
Each month, the Parties will select up to two consecutive days (based upon the number of grievances) on which the Panel will hear cases covered by the Program.
2.	Presentation of Cases.
a.	Scheduling of Cases. The Panel representatives for the Parties shall work together to identify the cases which are ready for presentation to the Panel and shall create the monthly agenda of cases.
b.	Exchange of Written Materials and Information.
One week prior to the monthly hearing date the Parties shall exchange the following:
-	all written documentation which they anticipate presenting to the Panel for each case scheduled to be heard by the Panel; and
-	a list of witnesses each Party anticipates it will present at the hearing.
If one Party objects to the use of an identified document, it shall notify the other Party immediately and the Parties shall attempt to resolve such dispute prior to the date of the hearing. If the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute, the Parties shall present the dispute to the Panel and the Panel shall have the authority to determine whether such document may be used during the Panel Hearing.
The Panel Chairperson shall have the authority to issue subpoenas (at the request of either party) requiring production of documents or other information and requiring witnesses to appear for the Panel hearing.
c.	Opening Statements.
The Parties shall each have an opportunity to present an opening statement to the Panel. The Company shall present first, followed by the Union, unless a different order of presentation is requested by the Panel.
During opening statements the Union and Employer representatives shall identify those persons who may offer relevant testimony and are available to testify before the Panel. The Panel shall identify those witnesses which it wishes to have testify and in what order. Witnesses will be questioned by the Parties, but shall be allowed to provide testimony in narrative form. All Panel members shall be allowed to ask questions of the witnesses and each Party’s representative shall also be provided with an opportunity to ask questions of the witness, following their initial testimony.
d.	Panel Assessment.
Once the Panel has determined that all witnesses and other information has been provided to it, the case will be submitted to the Panel for evaluation and decision. All panel deliberations and
33
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
individual panelists’ decisions shall be absolutely confidential. The Panel shall determine the outcome of the case. The decision shall be made by a majority vote of the panelists. The Panel Chairperson shall prepare a draft of a written decision on each case and forward the draft to the two other panelists for review and comment. Within two (2) weeks of the presentation to the panel, a single decision will be issued to the Parties and no dissenting opinion or comment will be made or issued. Decisions issued by the Panel will not be published and will not be considered to be precedent setting.
3.	Participants.
Union presentations shall be conducted by Union Grievance Specialists and/or Stewards. Employer presentations shall be conducted by Human Resources/Labor Relations personnel, operational or management personnel. Attorneys and other legal representatives will not be used by either Party to conduct the presentation of its case. However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to limit or restrict the right of either Party to seek legal assistance in the preparation of its presentation. The Parties agree and understand that during the first six (6) months of the Program the Parties may elect to have legal assistance during the Panel hearing.
4.	Procedures.
Prior to the presentation to the Panel, the Parties will discuss and prepare a joint submission of documents to the Panel which will include (but is not necessarily limited to) a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (or all relevant provisions), a copy of any Step One and/or Step Two documentation, a copy of the discipline(s) or termination challenged and a copy of any statements relied upon by the Employer in making its decision.
The Parties may use documentary and/or demonstrative evidence in the presentation of cases, including but not limited to copies of personnel and/or disciplinary records, policies and procedures, correspondence between the Employer and the Union, statements, investigative records and/or grievance process records, video tapes or other records which relate to the case presented. The only objection which is properly made to the presentation of such documentation is that a document is not authentic or is not appropriately presented under a provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If a dispute arises regarding the presentation of evidence, such dispute shall be resolved by the Panel Chairperson.
5.	Decision by Panel.
The Panel’s decision shall be final and binding on both Parties.
ARTICLE 21:	NO STRIKES - NO LOCKOUTS
21.01. No Strikes.

21,03. No Sympathy Strikes.
The Union and the employees further agree that they will not call, participate in or sanction any sympathy strike of the employees because the Employer purchases any merchandise manufactured by or any service requirements supplied by non-members of a union or by Employers of non-union workers or because it has such merchandise manufacturer for it by non-members of a union or employers of non-union workers. Such a strike shall be in violation of this Agreement.

The Union and the employees further agree that they will not call upon the Employer to participate or assist in the enforcement of any public or silent boycott against any product sold or offered for sale, or used by the Employer.

21.06. No Lockouts.
During the term of this Agreement, there shall be no lockout, strike or stoppage of any kind pending the determination of any complaint or grievance and for a period of ten (10) days thereafter, and then only for the refusal of either party to abide by such determination.
21.07. Arbitration Awards.
In the event the Employer fails to comply with an arbitration award and does not either seek judicial review of the award within the period of time required by law to obtain such review or comply with the award within such time period, the Union shall have the right to strike. In the event of a monetary award by an arbitrator, the appropriate sum of money shall be placed in an escrow bank account, paying interest at not less than the rate provided by Nevada law on judgments obtained under Nevada law.

ARTICLE 22:	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
22.0	1. Rights to Manage.
The right to manage the Employer’s business and the direction of its employees, including, but not limited to, the following rights, are reserved to the Employer. Such rights include the right to direct, plan and control operations, to determine the number of employees to be employed, and to determine the means, methods and schedules of operations. The Employer shall have the sole right to direct and control its employees. The Employer reserves the right, which is hereby recognized by the Union, to initiate any action toward any employee, including, but not limited to, reclassification, retention, scheduling, assignment, promotion, transfer, layoff and/or rehire. Seniority, among other factors, will be considered by the Employer when making these decisions. All of the foregoing rights are reserved to the Employer except to the extent they may be contrary to or inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
22.0	2. Rules and Posting.
The Employer may establish and administer reasonable rules, regulations and procedures governing the conduct of employees, provided that such rules, regulations and procedures are not inconsistent with any provisions of this Agreement. The Employer shall post and maintain any such rules in such places within its establishment so that all employees affected thereby, and business representatives of the Union, may have an opportunity to become familiar with them. The reasonableness of any rules, regulations and procedures provided for herein, are subject to the grievance procedures of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 23:	COURT APPEARANCE AND JURY DUTY
23.0	1. Court Appearance.
Employees required to appear in court, administrative proceedings, or at the police department on behalf of the Employer during their normal working hours shall receive their straight-time rate of pay for hours lost from work, less witness fees received. If an employee appears in court, administrative proceedings or at the police department on behalf of the Employer on his/her days off or after normal working hours, the employee shall receive his/her straight-time rate of pay for the hours spent in such appearance, less the witness fees received, but such time shall not be considered as time worked for any purposes under this Agreement.
23.0	2. Jury Duty.
The Employer considers jury/witness duty a civic responsibility and, in accordance with applicable law, will not discriminate against any employee who is called to serve.
All full-time (regular and relief) and part-time employees who have successfully completed their introductory period, who are called for jury service, will be eligible for up to two (2) weeks of jury duty pay per calendar year.
An eligible employee’s jury duty pay is the difference between the employee’s regular wage and the compensation received as a juror for each working day missed because of jury duty. Regular wage is defined as follows: the employee’s straight time hourly rate, not to include overtime, commissions, incentive, etc., multiplied by the average number of hours worked each day, constitute one (1) day’s regular wage.
36
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
Hours served on jury duty are not used in calculated overtime because such hours are not considered “hours worked.” Jury duty pay is a benefit, not a legal right.
Any employee called to serve on jury duty must notify his/her department head that he/she received a jury summons within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of summons.
Upon completion of jury duty, the employee must present a statement signed by an officer of the court signifying the times and dates the employee served and the amount of compensation the employee received from the court.

Additional voluntary supplemental benefits are available for purchase through payroll deduction including long-term disability and spouse and dependent life insurance.
24.0	2. Eligibility
Benefit plan details, including all terms and conditions and employee eligibility requirements, are governed by the applicable plan documents and relevant summary plan descriptions. Copies of these materials are available from the Employer’s Human Resources Department. Unless otherwise specified, the benefit programs apply only to eligible full-time employees.
The Employer, in its sole discretion, has authority to make all decisions regarding the availability of benefits, eligibility for benefits, and who provides Employer benefits. The Employer has the power and authority to construe and interpret the terms of the plans and to make all factual determinations regarding the plans and the administration of the plans. The Employer also has the right to amend or terminate such plans at any time with or without notice, including, among other things, the right to change the terms of eligibility and benefits provided. In the event that there are any conflicts between the actual plan documents and the descriptions provided in this Agreement, the actual plan documents control.

EXHIBIT 8 - EMPLOYER’S FAMILY & MEDICAL LEAVE POLICY
Family and MedicalLeave
It is the policy of TIHLV to create and maintain a positive working environment and to provide a fair and consistent basis for granting a leave of absence to associates.
TIHLV will grant time off, without pay, to all eligible associates for certain medical and family reasons. The Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) allows eligible associates to take up to twelve (12) weeks of job-protected leave per twelve (12) month period.
Eligibility and Reasons for Taking FMLA Leave
Under the FMLA, an associate who has worked for TIHLV for at least twelve (12) months and has worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the commencement of the FMLA leave, is entitled to take up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid FMLA leave per rolling twelve (12) month period, measured backward from the date an associate uses any FMLA leave, for any of the following reasons;
•	For the birth of his/her child and to care for his/her child after birth or for placement of a child with him/her for adoption or foster care;
•	To care for his/her child, parent or spouse who has a Serious Health Condition or;
•	For his/her own Serious Health Condition that renders him/her unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his/her position.
Married associates who work at TIHLV will be limited to a combined total of 12 weeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period, if the leave is taken for birth, placement, adoption or care of a child, or to care for a parent with a Serious Health Condition. However, married associates who work at TIHLV are each entitled to the full 12 weeks of FMLA leave during any 12-month period if the leave is taken to care for a spouse or child with a Serious Health Condition.
A "Serious Health Condition11 means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either:
•	Any period of incapacity or treatment connected with inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical-care facility, and any period of incapacity or subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or
•	Continuing treatment by a health care provider which includes any period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities) due to:
• A health condition (including treatment there-from , or recovery there-from) lasting more than three consecutive days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also includes:
• treatment two or more times by or under the supervision of a health care provider; or
55
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
•	one treatment by a health care provider with a continuing regimen of treatment; or
•	Pregnancy or prenatal care. A visit to the health care provider is not necessary for each absence; or
•	A chronic serious health condition which continues over an extended period of time, requires periodic visits to a health care provider, and may involve occasional episodes of incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes). A visit to a health care provider is not necessary for each absence; or
•	A permanent or long-term condition for which treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer’s, a severe stroke, terminal cancer). Only supervision by a health care provider is required, rather than active treatment; or
•	Any absences to receive multiple treatments for restorative surgery or for a condition which would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three days if not treated (e.g., chemotherapy or radiation treatments for cancer).
"Health care provider" means:
•	Doctors of medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine or surgery by the state in which the doctors practice; or
•	Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists and chiropractors (limited to manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to practice, and performing within the scope of their practice, under state law; or
•	nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives and clinical social workers authorized to practice, and performing within the scope of their practice, as defined under state law; or
•	Christian Science practitioners listed with the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts; or
•	Any health care provider recognized by the employer or the employer's group health plan benefits manager.
Intermittent and Reduced Schedule Leave
FMLA leave may be taken “intermittently” or on “a reduced leave schedule” under certain circumstances. Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an associate's usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday.
FMLA leave taken for birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care may not be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule.
If an associate needs intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment for the associate or a family member, including during a period of recovery from a Serious Health Condition, the associate should attempt to schedule treatments so as to create minimum disruption to his/her department. The Hotel may require the associate to transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an available alternative position for which the associate is qualified and which better
56
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the associate’s regular position. The alternative position must provide equivalent pay and benefits during the temporary assignment.
Substitution of Paid Leave
TIHLV requires that all associates substitute their earned and unused vacation days and personal days for any otherwise unpaid FMLA leave. In other words, an associate's earned and unused vacation days and personal days will run concurrently with any unpaid FMLA leave.
Request for FMLA Leave
All associates requesting FMLA leave must provide verbal or written notice of the need for the leave to the Human Resources Department. Within five business days after the associate has provided this notice, the Human Resources Department will complete and provide the associate with the Department of Labor Notice of Eligibility and Rights.
Associate notice requirements
Foreseeable Leave
An associate must provide the Hotel with at least 30 days advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment for a Serious Health Condition of the associate or a family member. If 30 days notice is not practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon as practicable. If an associate fails to give a 30 day notice of foreseeable FMLA leave, the Hotel may delay the taking of the FMLA leave.
Unforeseeable Leave
When the approximate timing of the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, an associate must provide notice to the Hotel of the need for FMLA leave as soon as practicable. Generally, such notice is expected within no more than one or two working days of learning of the need for FMLA leave, except in extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not feasible.
Medical Certification
A medical certification will be required from a health care provider for FMLA leave to care for a parent, spouse, or child with a Serious Health Condition, or for an associate’s own Serious Health Condition that makes the associate unable to perform the functions of the associate's job. The associate must provide the required certification within 15 days of the request. Failure to provide certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. The certification must indicate, among other things, (i) the approximate date the Serious Health Condition commenced, and its probable duration; (i i) a certification as to which part of the definition of Serious Health Condition, if any, applies to the patient's condition, and the medical facts which support the certification, including a brief statement as to how the medical facts meet the criteria of the
57
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
definition; and (iii) whether it will be necessary for the associate to take leave intermittently or to work on a reduced leave schedule basis (i.e., part-time) as a result of the Serious Health Condition and if so, the probable duration of such schedule.
The Hotei reserves the right to require an associate to get a second opinion, at the Hotel’s expense, from a physician selected by TIHLV. If the opinion of the associate’s and the Hotel’s designated health care providers differ, the Hotel may require the associate to obtain certification from a third health care provider, again at the Hotel's expense. This third opinion will be final and binding. Associates will be required to submit subsequent re-certifications to support continuing FMLA leave in accordance with applicable law.
Prior to returning to work, an associate on FMLA leave for the associate's own Serious Health Condition will be required to obtain medical certification from the associate's health care provider stating that the associate is able to return to work (i.e., a “fitness-for-duty certificate”). The Hotel may delay job restoration to an associate who fails to provide a fitness for duty certificate.
During FMLA leave, associates must provide their local Human Resources Department periodic reports on their status and intent to return to work.
Associates returning to work from FMLA leave must give at least one week’s advance notice to the Human Resources Department prior to returning from leave. Those associates not intending to return to the Hotel upon exhaustion of their leave must also provide the Human Resources Department with at least one weed’s advance notice of their intent not to return to work.
Benefits during Approved FMLA Leave
During an FMLA leave, the Hotel will maintain the associate's coverage under any group health plan on the same terms and conditions as would have been provided if the associate had been continuously working during the entire leave period. The associate’s benefits premium will be automatically deducted from any portion of the FMLA leave that is paid from the payroll. During any part of the FMLA leave that is not paid, the associate is responsible for paying the applicable benefits premium to the property by the first of each month. If premium payments are not received in full within thirty (30) days of such date, coverage will end and COBRA coverage will be offered to the associate.
The Hotel may recover its share of health plan premiums paid on behalf of an associate during a period of unpaid FMLA leave if the associate fails to return to work after the associate's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted or expires, unless the reason the associate does not return is due to (i) the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a Serious Health Condition of the associate or the associate's family member which would otherwise entitle the associate to leave under FMLA or (ii) other circumstances beyond the associate's control.
Associates will not accrue any vacation, sick or personal days while on FMLA leave.

Job Restoration
Upon returning from an FMLA leave, the Hotel will restore an associate who is not a "key associate" (as described below) to the same position the associate held when the FMLA leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an associate has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if the associate had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave period; if employment would have been terminated anyway, the associate has no right to reinstatement. For example, if an associate’s position was eliminated during the associate's FMLA leave, and the associate would have been terminated even if the associate had been continuously employed, the associate would not have a right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment.
It may be necessary for an associate to take more leave than originally anticipated. Conversely, an associate may discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no longer necessary. An associate must provide the Hotel reasonable notice of such changed circumstances where foreseeable.
Key Employees
The Hotel may deny job restoration to certain highly paid "Key Employees" if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the Hotel. The Hotel will inform you if you are a Key Employee.

SIDE LETTER RE: CLASSIFICATIONS
Trump Ruffin Commercial, LLC d/b/a Trump International Hotel Las Vegas (the “Employer”) and the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas, Culinary Workers Union Local No. 226 and Bartenders Union Local No. 165 (the “Union”) (collectively, the “Parties”), entered into a December 15, 2016 memorandum of agreement (“MOA”) regarding certain terms for the execution of a collective bargaining agreement between the Parties. In the MOA, the Parties agreed to maintain the status quo regarding, among other things, the Employer’s existing practices for scheduling its employees and regarding paid time off.
In furtherance thereof, the Parties agree to the following terms in order to apply and effectuate the Employer’s practices into the terms of the collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) between the parties.
Existing Practices:
The Employer currently maintains three primary categories of employees: full-time, part-time, and on-call.
The Employer maintains two sub-categories of full-time employees. The Employer’s more senior full-time employees are designated simply as “full-time” who are generally scheduled to the same days off for work each week. The Employer’s remaining full-time employees are designated as “full-time flex,” who work full-time hours but do not have a set schedule or regular days off from work, and instead work varying schedules to cover other employees’ days off and/or for business and operational reasons.
The Employer currently employs only one (1) employee in the bargaining unit who is designated as a part-time employee, who receives pro-rata vacation benefits.
On-call employees are scheduled for work on an as-needed basis, subject to hotel occupancy, staffing needs, and business demands. On-call employees are not eligible to receive paid time off (including vacation, personal days, and holiday pay).
Agreement:
For purposes of effectuating the terms of the CBA, and for consistency in use of terminology for employee designations, the Parties agree as follows:
Employees previously designated as “full-time” shall be converted to and hereafter referred to as full-time “Regular Employees” pursuant to CBA Section 10.01.
Employees previously designated as “full-time flex” shall be converted to and hereafter referred to as full-time “Relief Employees” pursuant to CBA Section 10.02. The Employer will no longer refer to these employees as “full-time flex.” The term “full-time flex” shall only be used
64
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas
in accordance with the job category created by CBA Section 10.07 on Staffing for Distressed Food and Beverage Venues.
Employees previously designated as “on-call” shall continue to be referred to as “On-Call Employees” pursuant to CBA Section 10.03. To maintain the status quo, and as set forth in CBA’s specific provisions, the “On-Call” Employees are not eligible to receive paid time off (including vacation, personal days, and paid holidays).
The employee designated as part-time prior to the CBA shall continue to be referred to as a “Part-Time Employee” under CBA Section 10.05.
In addition to the foregoing, the Employer agrees to post ten (10) full-time Relief Employee positions during the month of January 2018 to be filled by existing On-Call employees in the bargaining unit on the basis of seniority. The Employer’s posting of these positions in January 2018 shall not be interpreted to require the Employer to post additional such positions in future years of the Parties’ CBA.
Except as expressly set forth in this Side Letter, nothing herein is intended to modify, alter, or abrogate any of the terms of the MOA, including but not limited to, Paragraph l.g.
Any disputes regarding this Side Letter shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration process in accordance with CBA Article 20.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto by their duly designated representatives have hereunto set their hands this^2*3ay of vet	, 20 f , in Clark County, State of
