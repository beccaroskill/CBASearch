The arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be shared equally by the employer and the Union. However, each party shall be responsible for compensating their own representatives and witnesses as well as paying for necessary transcripts of the proceedings if desired.
The failure of the employee to appropriately present the grievance within the specified time limits shall render the matter resolved and not subject to further appeal.

Employees who receive seasonal or annual temporary upgrades to a given classification shall accumulate time toward step increases in pay. Therefore, as an employee accumulates a total of six (6) full months in such higher classification he/she shall be eligible to receive a one-half (1/2) step increase in pay. The employee shall then be paid the higher rate of pay for subsequent seasonal temporary appointments to that classification.

ARTICLE XVI Sick Leave
Section A.	Eligibility
All regular full and part-time employees and full-time and part-time probationary employees shall be eligible for paid sick leave.
Section B.	Accrual
Sick Leave shall be accrued as follows:
(1)	Sick leave shall be accrued for all regular full-time employees at the rate of one work day
for each month of service with no limit to accumulations.

(3)	Sick leave shall be accrued by probationary employees at the rate prescribed for regular
full-time and part-time employees.
(4)	Any employee shall continue to accrue sick leave while on any other compensated leave.
Section C.	Usage
Sick leave shall be granted under the following circumstances:

sibling).
"Emergency nature" generally refers to an unplanned illness, accident or unscheduled doctor's visit involving an urgent or life-threatening condition. Such emergency is normally considered to cover only one 24-hour period. Thus, a maximum of 8 hours of sick leave could be authorized. However, up to a maximum of 10 calendar days may be approved in cases involving hospitalization for a "serious" or life-threatening condition and up to one full day for outpatient testing which involves "serious" medical conditions.
5.	The first day an employee's immediate family member becomes ill and requires the

(1)	Requests for sick leave shall normally be made at least 15 minutes prior to the beginning
of work for that day.
(2)	Sick leave shall be chargeable only when used on regularly scheduled work days or work
periods and not on vacation time.
(3)	Department directors have the right to verify the reported sickness of an employee and
may require a doctor's certificate for absence due to sickness. The certificate must state the kind and nature of sickness or injury and whether the employee has been incapacitated for work for said period of absence.
In individual cases, if there is a sufficient reason to believe the employee may be abusing their sick leave, the employee shall first be given an oral warning. If the employee's leave pattern continues, a medical certificate will be required for all absences of sick leave and the employee will be advised in writing that all future requests for sick leave must be supported by an acceptable medical certificate. Abuse of sick leave shall be cause for disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
ARTICLE XVII
Safety, Health and Welfare

In computing seniority periods of employee suspension and leave of absence without pay (except for personal illness, injury, or as otherwise authorized by the City) in excess of thirty (30) cumulative working days per year shall be deducted from the employee's time of seniority. It is important to note any difference between "seniority date" and "adjusted start date."
