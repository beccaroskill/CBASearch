It is mutually agreed by and between the parties as follows:
ARTICLE 1 Recognition
Section 1
The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agency for all hourly-paid employees of the Company employed at its plants in the State of Wisconsin in accordance with the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours, rates of pay, working conditions and all other conditions of employment.
Section 2

Section 3
Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and also shall have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities, except to the extent that such right may be affected by this agreement.
Section 4

All employees of the Company who are subject to the terms of this agreement, shall, upon completion of their probationary period, become and remain members of the Union in good standing as a condition of employment. Employees losing their good standing in the Union by reason of failure to pay their monthly dues and initiation fee, will not be retained in the employ of the Company and upon written notice from the Union to the Company that any employee is not in such good standing with the Union, the Company will, within five working days, terminate such employee and remove such employee from the payroll of the Company. During such five working days, the Union agrees to meet with the Company for the purpose of discussion of the Union’s request. If the employee pays his delinquencies during such five-day period, he need not be discharged, but no employee shall have this privilege more than twice during the life of this agreement.

Time lost from work due to an industrial injury shall not count toward the probationary period. Although it shall be solely within the discretion of the Company during the probationary period to decide whether or not a probationary employee is to be retained by the Company, no such employee shall be discharged because of his membership or activity in the Union, and the Union will represent, and bargain for, such probationary employees with respect to all collective bargaining matters such as wages, hours, and any other conditions of employment.
Section 2

Step 1: An employee having a complaint or grievance, shall have the right, initially, to present the complaint or grievance verbally and directly to his Facilitator or to have such complaint or grievance presented verbally to the Facilitator by his steward. Although the Company agrees that it will deal only with the designated representative of the Union on such matters as are properly a subject for collective bargaining, it is the desire and the intention of both the Company and the Union that minor routine complaints or grievances of individual employees shall be disposed of as promptly as possible by the Facilitator. If a complaint or grievance is not settled in this step of the grievance procedure, it shall not preclude the aggrieved employee from requesting the Grievance Representative, or filing a written grievance under Step 1-A.
Step 1-A: Employees having a complaint or grievance may elect originally to file their complaint or grievance as a written grievance with their steward, and omit Step 1 set forth above. All written grievances shall be made out on triplicate grievance forms provided by the Union and must include the employee’s index number, and be signed by the aggrieved employee or employees. The 3rd copy shall remain in the grievance book. The steward will present the 2nd copy to his Grievance Representative
5
Article IV - Grievances
and the original copy to the Facilitator, and with the Facilitator attempt to bring about a settlement of the grievance. At this discussion the steward may also request the presence of his Grievance Representative. Either the Facilitator, steward or the Grievance Representative may request and obtain the presence of the aggrieved employee at this step of the grievance procedure. A written answer to the grievance shall be furnished to the steward by the Facilitator within twenty-four (24) hours after the discussion of the grievance has been concluded.
Step 2: In the event that no settlement can be reached that is mutually satisfactory to the employee, the steward, the Facilitator and the Grievance Representative, then the Grievance Representative may take up the matter with the Plant Vice President or other designated Company Representative. The Company may have a representative of the Personnel Department present at this step. At the request of the Grievance Representative, the steward and/or employee or employees, appropriate Facilitators, or other Company Representatives will be called in by the Plant Vice President or other designated Company Representative. Except in emergencies, the Grievance Representative and Plant Vice President or other designated Company Representative shall not meet more often than once a day at a mutually agreeable time. A written statement to the grievance as to whether it is settled and the terms, if any, or denied, shall be furnished to the Grievance Representative by the Plant Vice President or other designated Company Representative within twenty-four (24) hours after the discussion of the grievance has been concluded.
Step 3: In the event that the grievance is not satisfactorily settled in Step 2 above, the Bargaining Committee of the Union may then take up the grievance with the designated representative of the Company, indicating the grievances to be discussed. At the request of either the Union or the Company the parties shall meet not less than once a week in an attempt to settle grievances. Discharge grievances by employees or general policy grievances by the Company or Union shall be taken up commencing at this step of the grievance procedure. Although it is contemplated that meetings between the Company and the Union shall be re-1 stricted to the meetings designated above, meetings at this step may be; called by either party on shorter notice in the event of emergency.
Section 2
Should there be no settlement of a grievance or grievances between] the Union and the Company after the outlined steps of the Contract griev-| ance procedure have been exhausted, either party may submit such! grievance or grievances to arbitration within sixty (60) days after the griev-l ance has first been discussed in the third stage of the grievance proce-l dure. Either party shall notify the other in writing as to which grievance or! grievances are to be submitted to arbitration.	I
6
Article JV - Grievances

5.	Neil Gundermann
6.	Steven Briggs

The parties shall strike names alternately from the panel until one name is left. He shall be the arbitrator. The party requesting arbitration shall strike first and thereafter the parties shall alternate in striking first.
In the event that during the term of the contract one of the arbitrators listed above becomes unavailable to serve, the parties shall meet and agree on an alternate arbitrator for placement on the list.
In the event that a case arises in which both of the parties agree that it would be beneficial to select an arbitrator which is not one of the arbitrators on the above list, the parties may mutually select a different arbitrator to hear such a case.
With the exception of grievances concerning the incentive system outlined in this Contract, all grievances between the two parties shall be deemed arbitrable. Priority shall be given to discharge cases and the decision of the arbitrator shaii be due within thirty (30) days after the completion of all matters pertaining to the hearing.

Section 2
Any employee who is called to a personnel office or his Facilitator’s office for a disciplinary investigation, after he believes he has been sufficiently informed of the subject of the investigation shall be advised by the Company Human Resources representative conducting the investigation, or his Facilitator if he is conducting the investigation, that he may request and obtain the presence of the Grievance Representative or the steward for his department during such investigation.

10
Article V - Discipline and Discharge

Unless otherwise provided, all absences and tardies shall be handled on a point accumulation system as follows:
1.	Tardy or leaving early one (1) hour or less = 1/3 point.
2.	Tardy or leaving early more than one (1) hour but four (4) hours or less = 2/3 point.

3.	Leave of absence if approved by the Company.
4.	Medically documented worker’s compensation injuries or illnesses.

Q I onl/ rtf uurtrL
9. Disciplinary suspensions.
Consecutive days off for the same verified illness will be considered on an incident basis rather than a daily basis. Non-consecutive days off for the same verified illness will also be considered on an incident basis rather than a daily basis, provided that the employee has not returned to work for more than two (2) days. For example, an employee, off ill with the flu for two consecutive days who returns to work for two (2) days and then is absent the following day due to the same flu, would receive only one (1) point for that entire incident provided proper medical documentation is provided substantiating that the absence was related to the same illness, and that the employee was treated during the period of absence.
11
Article V - Discipline and Discharge
The following progressive discipline steps are included in the program:
Step 1: An employee who accumulates less than six (6) points will receive no disciplinary action.
Step 2: An employee who accumulates six (6) or more points but less than seven (7) will receive a first written warning.
Step 3: An employee who accumulates seven (7) or more points but less than (8) will receive a second written warning.
Step 4: An employee who accumulates eight (8) or more points but less than nine (9) will receive a third written warning.
Step 5: An employee who accumulates nine (9) or more points will be subject to termination.
The above policy shall be administered on a twelve (12) month rolling calendar. The present month and the preceding 11 months of active employment constitute the twelve (12) month rolling calendar. Time off for layoffs and leaves is dead time. If an employee is active for fifteen (15) or more calendar days in a calendar month, the month will count for purposes of the roiling calendar. If an employee Is active less than fifteen (15) calendar days in a calendar month, the month will not count for purposes of the rolling calendar; however, he can accumulate points during the month.
An employee who is unable to report for work for any reason must notify the Company via the ACTT system as soon as possible, but not less than fifteen (15) minutes prior to the normal work period. If an emergency prevents an employee from calling fifteen (15) minutes before the start of his or her shift, such employee must call or report to work as soon as he or she is reasonably able to do so.
An employee who’s seniority entitles him to three (3) or more weeks of vacation per vacation year will be allowed to back-charge up to three (3) vacation days per calendar year for days of absence (except the day before or after a holiday), provided the Personnel Department is notified via the ACTT system between two (2) hours prior to their scheduled starting time and their regularly scheduled shift ending time upon their return from the absence. Such absences will not count as points.
When an employee’s absentee record reaches Step 5, the Company can decide not to terminate the employee because of mitigating circumstances.
12
I
Article VI - Hours of Work
In the event that any employee objects to any warning or discharge, the grievance-arbitration procedure may be invoked; provided, however, the Union’s failure to submit to arbitration any grievance related to a warning will not in and of itself establish that such was proper. In the processing of any grievance that may arise hereunder, the Company agrees to furnish to the Union, at its request, all relevant information concerning said grievance.
ARTICLE VI Hours of Work
Section 1
Except where required otherwise for firemen, other similar special operations, the Die Cast Components Division, and Departments 242,243, & 763 (Waste Treatment, Plating and Heat Treating), eight (8) hours shall constitute the normal work day, and forty (40) hours, five (5) work days of eight (8) hours each, either commencing on Sunday and ending on Thursday for the third-shift, or commencing on Monday and ending on Friday for the first and second-shift, shall constitute the normal work week. Although this section does not constitute a guarantee of any minimum number of hours of work per day or per week, the Company shall not reduce the work day below eight (8) hours or the work week below forty (40) hours solely for the purpose of work spreading or work sharing to avoid the layoff provisions of the contract in situations where the layoff is caused by a lack of orders by our customers, except as otherwise provided for in this contract. Work spreading or work sharing to meet other legitimate business needs shall be permitted provided that it shall not extend beyond six (6) consecutive regularly scheduled working days. The Company and Union may agree to mutually extend this period where circumstances dictate, The Company will not spread or share work due to a lack of customer orders. It is only where the Company has sufficient orders but is faced with unusual or unforeseen circumstances (i.e., a strike or recall at a vendor or machine breakdown) of a periodic or short duration that the Company will use this language. It is the Company’s intention to use this language only for legitimate business reasons. This language is designed to minimize disruptions in the workforce while satisfying customer demands.
Section 2
The work week of each employee, except where required otherwise for firemen, other similar special operations, the Die Cast Components Division, and Departments 242, 243, & 763 (Waste Treatment, Plating and
13
Article VI - Hours of Work
Heat Treating), shall start on Monday, Sunday for the third-shift, at the established starting time of his respective shift, excepting as provided in Section 3.
Section 3
The starting time of the first shift for the normal bulk of the employees in the bargaining unit shall be 7:00 o'clock A.M. It is mutually agreed that certain departments shall have a starting time of 6:30 o’clock A.M.

31
Article VIII - Seniority
high seniority piecework employee earnings, then the high seniority piecework employees affected will have an opportunity, to the extent determined by the Company, to as soon as reasonable be directly transferred if seniority permits to similar work which they are capable of doing, where the least senior employees are performing such work. If it is determined that this is not possible, then these employees will be transferred, if seniority permits, to similar work which they are capable of doing in other departments or at other plant locations where less senior employees are performing such work. Shift preference will be given seniority permitting.
Section 9	— Insurance
(a)	If an employee with fess than five (5) years of seniority on his last day of work is temporarily laid off, his insurance shall be continued by the Company but not beyond the end of the third month following the month in which the layoff starts.

Section 10	— Transfers
The transfer of employees shall be subject to the following rules, and every transferred employee shall put forth normal, reasonable effort to perform satisfactorily the job to which transferred:
(a)	Permanent Transfers
When making a permanent transfer from a department due to a cut back or loss of jobs, the Company will transfer the least senior pieceworkers or dayworkers from the standpoint of seniority who are not needed to meet production requirements. Transfers will be made to the proper group and classification whenever possible.
(b)	Daily Transfers
(1)	Dayworkers: In making transfers from job to job within a department, or daily transfers out of the department, the Company will
32
Article VIII - Seniority
transfer the least senior employee from the standpoint of seniority from the group of dayworkers (i.e. labor grade and classification) selected by the Company from which the transfer is to be made. If the least senior employee in the group selected cannot perform the job satisfactorily to which the transfer is to be made, the Company may then transfer the next least senior employee from the group who can perform the job satisfactorily. When dayworkers are to be temporarily assigned to a piecework job on any given day when vacancies must be filled, the Company shall ask the most senior qualified employees from the group of dayworkers (Ie: labor grade and classification) selected by the Company assigned to the department and who are readily available in the immediate work area.
(2)	Pieceworkers: In making transfers from job to job within a department or daily transfers out of the department, the Company will transfer the least senior employee from the standpoint of seniority from the group of pieceworkers selected by the Company from which the transfer is to be made. If the least senior employee in the group selected cannot perform the job satisfactorily to which the transfer is to be made, the Company may then transfer the next least senior employee from the group who can perform the job satisfactorily. The next least senior employee transferred, whether to piecework or daywork, will be compensated for any loss of earnings based on his piecework average of the prior week, provided he notifies his Facilitator in writing, on the form provided by the Company of his claim and the amount thereof on each day the transfer occurs. This paragraph is not meant to prevent the Company from shutting a job down that is not needed that is being run by a more senior employee and moving him to an open job that is needed and without any adjustment in pay, but is only meant to compensate a senior employee whose skill and ability is utilized to do a job a less senior employee cannot do satisfactorily.
(3)	Transfers will be made on the basis of pieceworker to piecework and dayworker to daywork, unless necessary to do otherwise. Employees transferred to another job within their department at the start of the shift shall use their seniority for purposes of job preference. Employees assigned to a given department shall receive job assignments at the start of the shift before those that are transferred in for the day.
(4)	If an employee comes in to work late and there is no work available at that time in his department, he will be transferred to another department that has work. In the event that a piecework job opens up, the most senior employee will be returned to their department for that job.
33
Article VIII - Seniority
(5)	In the event that the Company must send employees home for lack of work, the affected employees may volunteer to leave by seniority.
(c)	Vacancies and Shift Openings
When vacancies or shift openings occur or new jobs become available, subject to the exceptions set forth in Sections 7 and 8 of this Article, first opportunity to fill such vacancy or job or shift opening shall be given to the most senior employee in point of Company wide seniority with eighteen (18) or more months of seniority who has on file in the Personnel Office a written request for transfer to such type of work, subject to the conditions herein contained. The types of transfers here involved, other than shift transfers, are not merely changes of machines, etc., within a department. The employee, in order to be considered, must have qualifications established, such as past experience in the plant, skill, training or ability, so that he may reasonably be expected to be able to perform the work satisfactorily. Transfer requests shall not be denied because of absenteeism or work record unless either or both of them are poor and the employee has failed to correct them in any given six (6) month period after having been warned to do so as recorded in his personnel file, but employees applying for supervisor and set-up jobs must have better than average attendance and work records. Transfer requests shall be valid for six (6) months from date of filing or renewal. The employee will receive a copy of his transfer request or renewal upon request. An employee may be denied a transfer request only once if there is no qualified replacement immediately available and then only in the first six (6) months from the original date of filing.
The employee and his grievance representative shall be so notified in writing of the denial of his transfer request. No employee shall have more than one request on file at any one time.
It is understood that employees with former job rights, who have bn file in the Personnel Office a request for transfer to return to their former department, job, and shift, shall be returned in accordance with seniority and ahead of employees who do not have former job rights to the job from which they were first removed due to layoff, industrial injury or illness. Such employees returning to former jobs shall also have priority, at their request, to return to their former shifts.
It is further understood that if an employee files a request for transfer for a job, other than the job for which he has former rights, and is transferred to such job, he shall thereby forfeit the former job rights referred to in the preceding paragraph.
When the Company requires employees to take tests for jobs such as floor inspector, etc., a Union representative may be present during
34
Article VIII - Seniority
such tests. The Company will furnish the Union Office with a list of all jobs that require testing.
No employee will be permitted to withdraw a request for transfer, nor will a request for transfer be honored for a job being filled, after arrangements to fill such job have been started.
If an employee is unable to satisfactorily perform the work after such transfer, and if the job from which he was transferred has been filled, he is subject to removal to other work he can satisfactorily perform. It is recognized that employees shall not abuse these transfer provisions by making repeated requests for transfer.
(d)	Job Posting
All skilled job openings in the Model Shop, Toolrooms, and Maintenance Departments will be posted on Company bulletin boards for two (2) working days (48 hours) and a copy of the posting will be furnished to the Union. The applicable transfer provisions in the contract shall be followed by those persons who seek a transfer as the result of a job posting.
All skilled upgradings in a Model Shop, Toolroom or Maintenance Department will be posted on the appropriate department’s bulletin board for two (2) days (48 hours) and a copy of the posting will be furnished to the Union.
These postings will be identified by job title, labor grade, shift, department and plant location. Employees will not be allowed to bid down solely for shift preference.
(e)	Returning to Work After Disability
Employees who have been returned to work from sick leave, industrial injury or non-industrial injury shall be reinstated to their former department, job and shift if seniority and physical condition permit.
(f)	Lighter Work
(1)	The Company will make every effort to find lighter work when the same is available to an employee who temporarily becomes physically unable to perform satisfactorily his regular job due to industrial injury, illness or non-industrial injury.
(2)	Temporary Limitation(s)
When possible an employee with limitations, whether from industrial cause or not, will be placed by the Company on available work in his department and on his shift, but if not possible, assigned work on another shift or in other departments.
35
Article VIII - Seniority
For an employee with limitations, whether from industrial cause or not, that will require a healing period of some duration, the Company will consider placing him upon an open job for which he is qualified and for which a more senior employee does not have a transfer request on file.
For an employee with limitations, due to industrial injury, that will require a healing period of some duration, the Company will consider transferring him to a special department for the duration of the healing period when such a special department is available. Transfers to such a special department shall be at Company request only.
(3)	Permanent Disability
An employee who upon completion of his healing period, whether after being on lighter duty at work or after absence from work, and whether from industrial cause or not, but who has permanent disability and can no longer perform his former job, will be assigned by the Company to an open job that he is capable of satisfactorily performing and for which a more senior employee does not have a transfer request on file. If there is no such open job, then the employee shall be placed by the Company, on the job of a less senior employee for which he is qualified and can satisfactorily perform, or if no such job is immediately available, placed on layoff.
(4)	Returning to Former Job
(1a)Industrial Injury: Upon completion of the healing period whether assigned to a special department at Company request or an open job at Company request, the employee shall be given former job rights and upon filing a transfer request to return to his former job and seniority and physical condition permitting, be allowed to bump in and replace the least senior employee in his former department, job and shift.
(1 b)Sick Leave and Non-Industrial Injury: Upon completion of the healing period, whether after being assigned to an open job at Company request or after absence from work and being rehired to a different job because of his physical condition, the employee shall be given former job rights and upon filing a transfer request to return to his former job and seniority and physical condition permitting, be allowed to bump in and replace the least senior employee in his former department.

Article IX - Wages
(e)	Stopwatch Time Study Procedure
Standards shall be set by stopwatch study. When using the stopwatch in the establishment of new standards, changed standards, or in check studies (or in the development of stopwatch standards) the following procedures in addition to those contained in (c) (General) above shall be followed:
(1)	The decimal minute stopwatch shall be used.
• (2) The continuous method of watch reading shall be used.
(3)	Before beginning the study, the time study person shall follow the procedures contained in section (c) (General) above and shall:
Prepare an elemental breakdown of the operation which shall consist of a detailed description of the method being employed at the time of the study including pictures of the part and work place and distinguished between elements which are manually controlled and those which are machine controlled.
Determine length of the machine cycle from the time the machine is activated until the completion of its cycle.
Carefully note the element breakoff points.
Determine the work elements so that no two consecutive elements shall be less than .05 in duration.
(4)	During the study, the time study person shall:
Record on the timestudy observation sheet all observed performance times for cyclic, non-cyclic and foreign elements;
Record on the timestudy observation sheet any unusual circumstances or occurrences which may have an effete on the results of the study.
(5)	Insure that pieces worked on pass inspection standards immediately prior to study and that this be recorded on the time study.
(6)	Calculate the standard according to the following procedure:
Disregard no watch reading obtained during the study unless a clear explanation of the reason for such strike out appears on the time study observation sheet.
Apply a performance rating factor to each average elemental time per cycle to obtain normal or selected elemental time per cycle on changed elements.
Add up normal or selected times plus all non-cyclic allowances. This will equal total selected time.
47
Article IX - Wages
Transmit to the employee involved within six (6) working days the job standard which is the result of the observation and calculations whenever possible.
(f)	Procedure for Changing Standards
A production standard once accepted shall not be changed except in the case where the Company makes a change in the materials, tools, machines, method or design of an operation. A production standard once accepted shall not be changed merely because of a change in name, symbol, or number of any materials, tools, machines, parts or operations.
(1)	The procedure for determining whether or not a change decreases or increases the standard time per piece shall be as follows:
The Company analyst shall determine and record the changes which have been instituted in the job circumstances:
After the time study has been made, the Company Analyst shall set up a comparative data sheet showing the elements of the operation which have been affected by the change, how the change has affected them, and the time for each elemerjj that existed prior to the change and the proposed time after the change;
The Company Analyst shall examine the data sheet and determine whether or not the difference in time for those elements which are affected by the change reduces or increases the time per piece which existed prior to the change;
If this application does not reduce or increase the time per piece which existed prior to the change, then the time per piece shall not be changed;
If a difference is determined which reduces or increases the time per piece than the time for those elements affected by the change shall be placed in effect and the old standard recomputed with the new figures.
(2)	Whenever the Company makes a change in a product or operation or introduces a new product or operation, the production < standards which have been accepted prior to the change or introduction and/or which are part of the operations on the new or changed product shall not be changed.
(3)	The above procedures for changing standards are based on the ! principle that any changes in standards shall permit the same in- I centive opportunity as existed under the accepted original 1 standards.	<
48
Article IX - Wages
(4)	Any E.C.O. changes which affect standards, must be incorporated by the Company within'ninety (90) days of the effective date of the change.
(5)	When employees on an engine assembly line are temporarily moved to an open line, the Company will take into consideration the magnitude of the move, and the degree of the change, and upon Union request, will meet with the Union to discuss loss of wages, to determine if loss of wages are needed.
(6)	It is understood that the Company will take into consideration method changes and if the method changes were entirely instituted by the operator, the Company will not take advantage of such changes. When changes are not entirely instituted by the operator, the Company will not take advantage of the proportionate changes attributable to the operator.
(7)	The discovery of clerical errors in the computation of a standard shall warrant an appropriate adjustment in that standard but such errors shall be brought to the attention of the parties within a reasonable period of time after the issuance of the standard.
(8)	When machines are moved from one area to another, the Company will not change the rate unless there is a change in the operation.
(g)	Procedures for Work Standards and Wage Incentive Grievances:
Any new or changed standard shall be given a fair trial, normally one (1) day, by the employees involved before a challenge of such standard is in order.
Any upward adjustment on a standard as a result of a grievance shall be retroactive from the date of the grievance to a maximum of twelve (12) months, if the upward adjustment occurs within three (3) years of the date of the filing of the grievance. If the upward adjustment occurs after three (3) years from the date of the filing of the grievance, the upward adjustment shall be retroactive to a maximum of twelve (12) months from the date of the settlement. This paragraph shall not apply if the job does not run regularly.
All back pay shall be paid within sixty (60) days of the actual settlement date of a grievance to any employee affected. If back pay is not paid within the sixty (60) day period, an additional 1,5 percent per month will be added to all payments from the date of the settlement unless an extension Is mutually agreed to between the Company and Union analyst. The employees not on the payroll who have back pay coming in excess of $5.00 will be paid by a separate check and those employees who have less than $5.00 coming will receive this money
49
Article IX - Wages
when they return to work. An employee who has less than $5.00 coming and does not return to work will have sixty (60) days after the new rate was applied to request payment. Payment will be mailed to him as soon as possible after his request.
A list of back pay for a settlement of a time study grievance and a copy of all production records used to calculate the back pay will be issued to the Union at the time of payment.
A written challenge of a standard shall be considered as a grievance and shall be processed under the grievance provisions set forth below:
(1)	A Grievance may be directed at the standard itself or any aspect of it.
(2)	Any grievance filed in connection with a standard may include a request which the Company shall fulfill that a stopwatch time study be taken of the operation under dispute, or in the event that such request is not made in the grievance, the Union shall have the right at any time during the discussion of such grievance to make a similar request which the Company will fulfill. Such a study shall be taken under the procedures contained in this Section. This study and its results shall serve in the grievance procedure as the basis for discussion and argument as to the appropriateness of the disputed standard.
(3)	The Union shall have the right to bring into the plant a consultant employed by PACE (AFL-CIO, CLC) or any other mutually agreeable consultant.

(2)	If the grievance cannot be resolved at this step, a meeting will be arranged between the parties, at which time the Union may be
50
Article IX-Wages
represented by its International Representative and other Union representatives.
(3)	If no agreement is reached, the Union may at any time, after (15) days advance notice in writing, take strike action. Provided, however, that there shall be no strike action unless and until such action has been authorized as provided in the Constitution of the international Union.

(1)	Whether a piecework job is a Class #4 or a Class #8 job or shall be changed from one to the other, is a matter for negotiation between the parties under the terms of this agreement and nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed as a waiver of the position of either party with respect to such matter.
Negotiated multiple machine base rates shall not be changed unless machine operations are added or dropped.
Once a multiple machine base rate is established on a job and a machine is added to the job, the job will be increased to the next machine base rate.
(2)	Upon request of the Union, the parties shall meet for the purpose of reviewing the Company’s incentive system with the view of having the Company obtain whatever recommendations, suggestions or requests the Union may wish to make on any phase of the incentive system, and any agreement which may result from such conferences shall be reduced to writing.
(k)	Special Piecework Rate
A special piecework rate is a rate that is applied to an operation from DAY to DAY. A special rate shall be set by the Facilitator and shall provide the opportunity for the operator’s average hourly earnings prior to the off-standard condition. The above shall also apply to new jobs.
Form #553 — Special Rate Card — is provided for recording a special piecework rate. The Facilitator is required to completely fill out this form when applying a special rate including an explanation of the reason for the use of this special rate.
Jobs which are not ready for permanent rates may be run with special rates which, being in the form of an estimate, may not necessarily agree with the permanent rate later set on the job.
51
Article IX - Wages
Special piecework rates are ordinarily applied to jobs with permanent rates under the following off standard conditions;

Dayworker’s Wage Plan
Section 3
This dayworker’s wage plan applies only to daywork employees and to permanent daywork jobs and does not in any way have any effect on incentive jobs, method of timestudy or establishment of piecework cates.
All new jobs and all new work will be daywork or pilot program.
53
Article IX - Wages
All daywork jobs have a job description, job number, and labor grade which has been agreed to by the Company and the Union and each have a copy of the job description.
It is recognized that the Company and the Union used a comparative ranking system and certain bench mark jobs in establishing the daywork system. It is also recognized that daywork jobs can change making them either harder or easier in comparison to other jobs in the Plan, it is the intent of both parties that jobs with significant changes be identified and be moved up or down in the Plan as necessary in order to maintain equity in relation to other similar jobs. It is also recognized that many jobs may undergo change, but that change does not automatically justify movement up or down, especially when viewed in relationship to other similar jobs which also may have or may be undergoing change. The Company and the Union will recognize all changes dating back to the implementation of the last upgrading or the original date of agreement to a job description, whichever is later.
The Company will furnish the Union with a list of daywork employees, their job number and their daywork rate at such time as daywork tapes'are prepared.
(1)	The Company shall write the job description and assign the job number and the labor grade for all new or changed jobs and will submit them to the Union for its approval. Job descriptions are primarily for the purpose of identifying specific jobs and describe generally the duties to be performed on the job. No job description shall require the performance of duties unrelated to the job. No job shall be considered a permanent job until there is an agreement between the Company and the Union on the job description, job number and labor grade. A job once deactivated will not be reactivated without the approval of the Union.
(2)	The rate of pay of a new or transferred employee or an employee who is moved from a job to a job with a different number shall be determined and put into effect by the Company, subject to the approval of the Union. If the rate of pay agreed upon by the Union and the Company is higher than the rate originally determined by the Company, then the correction ehall be made, as of the effective date of the agreement.
(3)	Employees temporarily assigned to a higher rated job on any given day when vacancies must be filled shall be the most senior qualified employees assigned to the department and who are readily available in the immediate work area. They shall have their regular rate increased by thirty cents (30c) per hour for each hour so assigned, or a minimum of sixty cents (60c), whichever is greater, per day.
54
Article IX - Wages

(6)	An employee who is lacking the necessary skills or qualifications necessary for performing the job he desires to have in his department may be rotated onto work that will provide such by the Company and at his current rate of pay.
(7)	Employees who do not have the necessary qualifications to be considered for skilled set-up jobs in Labor Grade 15 or a higher pay scale, can obtain the necessary experience on Grade “8” set-up jobs subject to the availability of such jobs and the contract provisions dealing with job changes and/or transfers.
If there is an opening for a Setup “A” employee in a department, that opening will be filled by a qualified Setup “A" employee and if no qualified Setup "A” employee is available, then a Setup “B” employee shall be used to fill the opening.
After 52 weeks on a Grade “B” set-up job, the employee if qualified will be considered, at his request, for transfer to a set-up job under the contract provisions dealing with job changes and/or transfers. Employees may be changed from Grade “8" set-up jobs to set-up jobs at the Company's request at any time, subject to the contract provisions dealing with job changes and/or transfers or removed from Setup “B” because of lack of ability or poor performance.
55
Article IX - Wages
(8)	For the purpose of determining the number of weeks worked in Paragraphs 5 and 7, a week worked shall be any week in which the employee worked at least 3 full days of the normal work week. Any week in which the employee did not work 3 full days of a normal work week shall not be counted.
(9)	Complaints or grievances related to this Dayworker's Wage Plan, which may arise between the Company and the Union, or between the Company and any employee, or group of employees, shall be handled as follows: Complaints or grievances will be referred to the Union paid Compensation Analyst(s) who will, in step 1, step 1A, and step 2 of the grievance procedure, attempt to resolve the complaints or grievances with the designated Company representative. The Plant Grievance Representative may be present at any of the above steps of the grievance procedure. If a complaint or grievance is not resolved, the grievance will be referred to the third stage of the grievance procedure at which time the daywork analyst may be present to discuss the grievance in dispute. The Union shall have the right to bring in a consultant employed by the International Union PACE (AFL-CIO, CLC) or any other mutually agreed upon consultant. The consultant shall have the right to observe any jobs related to the dispute.
In the event the grievance procedure has been exhausted and there is still no settlement, such grievances may be submitted to arbitration. Any upward adjustment of a labor grade as a result of a grievance will be retroactive to the date of the grievance.	i
(10)	Labor grade 18 Machine Tender jobs in DCCD will be moved to labor * grade 16. The Company and Union agree that these Machine Tender jobs and labor grade will not be used in the comparative ranking system.

Section 4
MEDICAL BENEFITS —
For employees and dependents
(After 60 days of seniority)
There are three (3) programs of Medical Benefits available. (Any of the 3 program categories may have more than 1 p!an option during the term of this agreement.)
(a)	HMO (Health Maintenance Organization):
An HMO provides both extensive medical coverage and preventive health care. Covered services are received through the facility or physician group chosen by the employee upon enrolment. With limited exception as specified in the HMO Benefit Booklet(s), there are no bills, claim forms, or out-of-pocket expenses to file employee beyond certain per service deductibles.
The HMO carrier is responsible for the administration, benefits, providers, and other related aspects of the Pian(s) it offers.
It is intended by the parties that the prime program through calendar year 2001 will be Compcare. The Company will make its best effort with any subsequent HMO(s) to provide for the level of benefits and provider access currently available under the Compcare program. An EPO (Exclusive Provider Option) may be installed in place of an HMO or any of its options. An EPO is like an HMO, except that it is not insured by a earner.
(b)	PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) - the Comprehensive Medical Expense Program.
(1)	Medical services obtained within the Southeastern Wisconsin service area.
(a)	The Comprehensive Medical Plan will pay 90% of all covered medical expenses for services obtained from the physicians, hospitals, and other providers participating in the designated Preferred Provider Organization (PPO). The current designated PPO is the Health Care Network of Wisconsin (HCN), covering the area referenced in heading (1) above. For services obtained from these PPO providers, there is a $100 deductible per person per year ($200 maximum per family) to be met before the plan begins paying 90%. If by way of the employee's 10% co-in$urance portion, the covered PPO expenses payable by the individual in a calendar year should reach $1100 per person or $2200 for a family (file employee's
82
Group Insurance Plan
“co-insurance limit”), the plan will pay 100% of further covered PPO charges for the rest of that year. Types of medical services available through the PPO may be added during the term of this agreement.
(b)	The Comprehensive Plan will pay 70% of all covered medical expenses for services obtained from non-PPO providers within the service area referenced in heading (1) above, after satisfaction of the deductible(s). For such non-PPO services, the annual deductible is $275 per individual with a $550 maximum per family. If by way of the employee’s 30% co-insur-ance portion, the covered non-PPO expenses payable by the individual in a calendar year should reach $3300 per person or $6600 for a family (the employee's "co-insurance limit”), the plan will pay 100% of further covered non-PPO charges for the rest of that year.
(c)	An additional copay for $75 for emergency room services, and $25 for urgent care facility services, will apply whether care is in-network or out, but will be waived if admitted with 24 hours.
(2)	For medical services obtained outside the service area, the same provisions as described in (1) (b) and (c) of this section apply, except that the Comprehensive Plan will pay 90% of covered expenses rather than 70%.
(3)	Covered expenses include the reasonable and customary charge for semi-private hospital room and board and other necessary hospital services, surgical procedures, obstetrical services, physicians’ and nurses’ fees, x-ray and radioactive therapy, physical therapy, diagnostic x-ray and lab fees, ambulance service, prosthetic devices, and other services and supplies.

All other covered expenses for such conditions will be payable at 50%, The maximum lifetime benefits payable for such conditions are included in the total lifetime maximum payable by the PPO program.
Effective 1*1-02, the Behavioral Health benefit will be administered by Innovative Resource Group (formerly CNR) using its own preferred provider network. It will include, and be integrated with, an employee assistance (EAP) component. Annual deductibles will not apply to behavioral health services.

85% - Generic
75% - Preferred Brand (Formulary), $10 min. copayment

The calendar year deductible will not apply to mail order prescriptions. Oral contraceptives and prescription pre-natal vitamins will be covered exclusively under the mail order service.
(6)	For employees hired and subsequently covered under the Comprehensive Plan after 2-1-98, the maximum benefits payable by the plan for pre-existing conditions will be limited to $4,000 for the first 12 months following the initial enrollment date. For late enrollees, maximum benefits for pre-existing conditions will be limited to $4000 for the first 12 months following the late enrollment date and to $4000 for the next 6 months thereafter. Time satisfied under prior creditable coverage will be counted toward the waiting period for a pre-existing condition, unless there was a 63 day or more break in coverage.
(7)	Continuation of coverage provisions are as prescribed by law.
(8)	The benefits of the Comprehensive Plan will be coordinated with those available under other plans. The Normal Benefits payable under this plan (what this plan would pay in the absence of other coverage) is the maximum allowable expense,

(c)	Indemnity - Medpar Plus
(1)	Covered services under the Medpar Plus plan are the same as those as in the Comprehensive Medical Expense program.
For such covered services, Medpar Plus will pay 100% of the amount allowable by Medicare according to its payment sched-ule(s) of procedures and treatment codes for the locale in which the services are rendered. If the bill should be higher than 100% of Medicare allowable under the relevant Medicare schedule, the plan and the covered member will each pay 50% of further charges.
For bills on which the services or diagnoses are ill-defined, a review will be conducted by IRG in order that the services/diag-noses can be properly categorized according to the relevant Medicare schedule.
85

Summary of Benefits
The following summary outlines benefits available. For more detailed information, please refer to your Retirement Plan Booklet or call the Retirement Benefits Administrator, phone 259-5384.
The Plan consists of a legal document and trust agreement, in case of any conflict between this summary and the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.
ELIGIBILITY FOR BENEFITS
I.	You may retire under the Briggs & Stratton Retirement Plan with full pension benefits if —
You are at least 65 years old and have at least 5 years of service,
You have 30 years of service,
— OR —
You have 10 years of service and are totally and permanently disabled.
II.	You may retire early with reduced benefits if —
You are at least 55 years old and have 10 years of service.
UI. You are entitled to a vested annuity at age 65 if you terminate employment after 5 years of service. A reduced annuity is available as early as age 55 with 10 or more years service.
FULL PENSION BENEFITS
The amount of your monthly pension is based on your final average monthly earnings, including profit sharing payments (described below), and your Credited Service.
The amount is based on 1.05% of your final average monthly earnings during the highest 5 of your last 10 completed calendar years of service, times your years of credited service and is subject to the following minimums:
Minimum Pension
Per Month Per Year
Effective -	of Credited Service
August 1, 2001	$28

Retirement Plan
EXAMPLES
These examples show how the formula works based on single life pensions with no benefits provided for survivors:
I.	Employee’s final average monthly earnings:	$2,500
Employee's years of Credited	Service	30
1.05% of $2,500=	$26.25
If he retires, he receives the $28.00 (8-1 -01), $29.00 (8-1 -02), $30.00 (8-1-03), $31.00 (8-1-04), $32.00 (8-1-05) minimum for each year of Credited Service (since this is more than the $26.25 provided by the 1.05% formula).
If he retires on or after 8-1-02, then he receives $29.00 x 30 years = $870.00 monthly for life.	1
If he retires on or after 8-1-05, then he receives $32.00 x 30 years =	j
$960.00 monthly for life.	1
il.	Employee's final average	1
monthly earnings:	$3,300
Employee’s years of
Credited Service	30
1.05% Of $3,300=	$34.65	*
If he retires, he receives $34.65 x 30 years = $1,039.50 monthly for life (since this exceeds the minimum of, $28.00 (8-1-01), $32.00 (8-1-05) per year of service).
REDUCED BENEFITS FOR EARLY RETIREMENT	’
If an employee retires after attaining age 55, but before age 60, his j pension benefits will be reduced to the actuarial equivalent of the benefit payable at age 65.
If an employee retires on or after age 60, full pension benefits com- — puted as shown above will be reduced by 4% per year (pro-rated to the number of months) from the date on which he reaches age 65 or attains 30 years of service, whichever is earlier.

SERVICE AND EARNINGS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION BENEFITS
SERVICE
Service is used to determine eligibility for a pension. It consists of an employee’s last period of continuous employment up to December 31, 1975, plus each calendar year beginning with 1976 and ending with the year in which the employee's normal retirement date occurs in which he has at least 1,000 hours of employment.
An employee with service before and after January 1,1976, and who has between 9-10,14-15,19-20 or 29-30 years of service at the beginning of a calendar year, will receive credit for another year of service when he completes 1,000 hours of employment during that calendar year, or on the , anniversary date of his employment, if earlier. Such anniversary date will be deferred to make up for any periods of strike or personal leave of absence.
93
Retirement Plan
CREDITED SERVICE
Credited Service is used to determine the amount of pension. Credited Service prior to December 31,1975 consists of the last period of continuous employment up to that date. After January 1,1976, a participant receives one year of Credited Service for each calendar year beginning with 1976 in which he has at least 2,000 hours of employment and a prorated portion of a year for fewer than 2,000 hours of employment. Credited Service shall accrue for employment after his normal retirement date.
HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT
Hours of Employment means all hours for which an employee is compensated including overtime hours (but no premium hours), vacation hours, plus periods of leave of absence for military service, disability, Union activity or layoffs, if the employee returns within the period authorized by such leave or layoff. Periods on strike or personal leaves of absence will not count as hours of employment.
FINAL AVERAGE MONTHLY EARNINGS
All wages including overtime at straight time rates paid to an employee during the period considered as Service are considered as earnings under the Plan, Final average monthly earnings are determined from the highest-paid five calendar years within the last 10 completed calendar years of considered service. When an employee is compensated for less than a calendar year, his compensation shall be annualized.
SURVIVOR BENEFITS
You may elect a lifetime monthly pension computed as shown on the previous page or you may elect certain survivor options which provide a reduced pension during your lifetime, so that payments may continue to your spouse or to other beneficiaries after your death.
Also, as an active employee who has met the requirements for regular or early retirement, you may elect certain survivor options which would provide a pension to your spouse or to the other beneficiaries if you die while actively employed,
These benefits will be explained in detail prior to your retirement. Active employees will be contacted about these benefits about 6 months prior to their eligibility for them and given a full explanation.
If you desire more information at any time consult your Retirement Plan Booklet or call the Retirement Benefits Administrator.
