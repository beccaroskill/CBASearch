Section 4.7	Stewards.
The provisions and rules regarding stewards shall be as follows:
4.7(a) The Union may designate one (1) employee as a steward for each one hundred (100) employees, or fraction thereof, for each shift in each shop. In instances where a shop has a unit geographically separated from its main location, the Union may also designate a steward for each such separate unit for each shift provided that such unit consists of a minimum of four (4) employees, is not adjacent to the shop's main location and is not established on a temporary short-term basis; notwithstanding Section 4.7(d), when such unit drops below four (4) employees, no employee in such unit shall have steward status. If a geographically separated unit of a shop does not have a separate steward, arrangements will be made to permit employees in such unit to contact a steward upon request. In the absence of the regular steward for any reason, the Union may designate a temporary steward to act for the regular steward. Such designation shall be in writing. (For the purpose of this Section 4.7, a shop shall be defined as any organization, geographically separated unit, or grouping of employees which the parties establish in advance by mutual agreement. The definition of "organization" as set forth in Section 22.1(n) of this Agreement shall be applicable to that term as used in Section 4.7.)
4.7(b) The effective appointment date of a steward will be the third workday following the date on which the appointment letter from the Union is received by the applicable designated office of the Company, provided the appointment is determined to be in conformance with Section 4.7(a) above.
4.7(c) The Company will notify the Union of cases requiring a selective reduction in the number of stewards to conform with Section 4.7(a) above. Within three (3) workdays following the date the Union receives such notice from the Company, the Union will notify the Company of the names of the appropriate number of individuals the Union desires to have deleted from the Company records as stewards. No surplus action will affect such excess stewards during such three (3)-workday period. The above three (3)-workday waiting period will not apply in the handling of situations wherein no selective reduction is involved.
4.7(d) An employee while serving as a steward shall not be surplused, transferred or loaned from his/her job title, or his/her shop, or his/her shift so long as other employees remain in his/her job title, and in the

shop and on the shift for which he/she is designated as steward. If he/she is not eligible so to remain in his/her job title, he/she will be offered downgrade to the highest labor grade job title within his/her normal line of promotion which is then being utilized in the shop and on the shift for which he/she is designated as steward. If he/she declines such a downgrade or if he/she is relieved of his/her steward's status prior to such downgrade action, he/she will then be subject to normal surplusing procedures as provided in Article 22.
4.7(e) Stewards will be promoted and recalled from layoff on the same basis as provided in Article 22 for other employees, except that in the event a shift in a shop is deactivated and is reactivated by the Company within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after such deactivation, the former steward will be offered an opportunity to return to that shop and shift provided the Company determines to utilize the steward's former job title or a lower grade in the same job family in such shop and on such shift within such one hundred twenty (120)-day period, and further provided that the former steward has not been replaced as steward by the Union in the interim.
4.7(f) A steward will retain his/her steward status while on approved medical leave of absence for a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, provided that he/she has not been replaced as steward by the Union prior to expiration of such leave.
Section 4.8	Departure from Work Assignment by Stewards to Investigate Complaints or Claims of Grievance.
Each steward shall notify and obtain permission from his/her supervisor before leaving his/her work assignment for the purpose of investigating complaints or claims of grievance on the part of employees or the Union or contacting the business representative in regard to such claim or grievance. Such permission shall be granted except where there is a substantial reason for delaying the contact or the investigation due to safety conditions or the fact that a critical operation is in process. The supervisor may be present during any discussion relating to any complaint or grievance. However, upon the request of an employee or steward, the supervisor shall authorize a steward to participate in a private discussion with an employee or business representative, relating to a complaint or grievance. Discussions of the type described in this Section 4.8 shall be conducted without requiring the employee or steward to clock out provided the discussion does not extend beyond the time that the supervisor considers reasonable under the circumstances.
Section 4.9	Departure from Work for Union Business.
Except as provided in Section 4.8 above, each steward, local lodge officer or district council delegate shall have authorization from the Union, give his/her supervisor at least twenty-four (24)-hour advance notice if possible

and clock out prior to departure from his/her work assignment to conduct Union business. If the work assignment given the steward, local lodge officer or district council delegate seriously interferes with the performance of his/her duties for the Union, or if Union business seriously interferes with his/her work assignment, the Company and the Union agree to cooperate in making arrangements to prevent such interference in the future. However, stewards, local lodge officers and district council delegates shall not be penalized for such Union business; provided, that nonpayment by the Company for time spent on Union business shall not be considered as a penalty. This Section 4.9 shall apply to cases of stewards who are designated to act for business representatives in accordance with Section 19.13 for the temporary period the steward is authorized as a designee.
Section 4.10	Security Clearances.
If governmental regulations require special clearance to obtain access to certain areas where employees are assigned who are within a bargaining unit defined in Article 1, the Company will cooperate with the Union to obtain necessary clearance for two (2) representatives designated by the Union: one (1) for the Puget Sound and Portland Units, and one (1) for the Wichita Unit. If this number is not adequate in view of the workload, the Company and the Union will discuss the possibility of attempting to obtain clearance for additional representatives.
ARTICLE 5
WORKWEEK, HOURS OF WORK, SHIFTS

The normal work schedule shall consist of five (5) consecutive workdays, Monday through Friday, followed by two (2) days of rest (Saturday and Sunday), except for those employees designated in advance by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union who regularly work on Saturday and/or Sunday, whose normal work schedule shall consist of five (5) consecutive workdays, followed by two (2) days of rest, which shall be treated as their Saturday and Sunday, in that order. The Company will attempt to meet its nonregular workweek assignments on a voluntary basis among the employees. In the event there are insufficient volunteers to meet the requirement, the supervisor may designate and require the necessary number of employees to work the nonregular workweek. Such designation shall first affect the junior qualified employees in the classification. When reducing the number of nonregular workweek assignments, senior employees within each job will be given their preference to return to regular workweek schedules. The purpose of nonregular workweek assignments is to provide for those maintenance and service functions that are required on a continuing seven (7)-day per-week basis. Such assignments will not be utilized for the purpose of providing maintenance or service in support of weekend production operations. It is mutually agreed that Maintenance

Section 5.2	Short Workweek.
In the event the Company deems it advisable to work any number of the employees on a short workweek, the Union and the affected employees will be notified in advance which days are to be worked, and such days worked shall be consecutive. An employee's options in regard to the use of vacation credit in such situation are set forth in Section 8.4(i).
Section 5.3	Shifts; Lunch Periods; Rest Periods.

Each employee who is scheduled to work two (2) or more hours of overtime after his/her regular shift shall receive a ten (10)-minute rest period prior to the start of the overtime. Changes of shift assignments shall be made on the first day of a new workweek whenever practicable.
Section 5.4	Shift Preference.
In order to ensure operational efficiency, the Company shall have the exclusive right to assign employees to any shift. Subject to the foregoing, senior employees who have a shift preference on file shall be given preference over junior employees who are assigned to the same job title and shift, junior returning non-bargaining unit employees, new hires, recalls from layoff, and promotional candidates for placement in openings in their job title and organization. Shift preference rights are not applicable over employees being downgraded, laterally reclassified on their current shift, laterally transferred to the organization on their current shift or over senior employees who are in their labor grade. Employees who have requested downgrades will not be given preference over senior employees in their organization who have shift preferences on file. Shift preferences must be filed more than three (3) working days prior to an organization effecting a shift change or declaring a job opening by submission of a dated open requisition. If an employee does not file a shift preference, it shall be

5.4(a) As stated, shift preferences as defined will not apply in instances where the exercise of such rights would affect the efficiency of Company operations in any organization on any shift. When such instances arise, it shall be the responsibility of organizational management to prepare an exception request for transmittal to the organization’s designated executive or delegate. Exception requests shall be discussed with the Union prior to submittal to the site senior Human Resources representative or designee for final approval.
5.4(a)(1) When staffing a new shift, the Company maintains the right to assign employees necessary to accomplish the work, including the right to assign employees with key skills regardless of their shift preference.

5.4(d) In the event two (2) or more employees have the same seniority date, the employee with the lowest BEMS ID will be provided the first opportunity for shift preference movement.

member of the reserve component during both of the applicable consecutive years. Employees with military orders to serve additional days of duty will be excused on unpaid authorized leave of absence. The amount due the employee under this Section 6.6(b) shall be reduced by the amount received from the government body identified with such training duty or services, for the period of such duty (up to the maximum period mentioned above). Such items as subsistence, uniform and travel allowance shall not be included in determining pay received from state or federal government.
6.6(c) Up to three (3) days bereavement leave with pay will be granted to an employee on the active payroll, including those on leave of absence for not longer than ninety (90) calendar days, who, because of death in his/her immediate family, takes time off from work during his/her normal work schedule as such term is defined in Section 5.1 of this Agreement. Such pay shall be for eight (8) hours at his/her straight time base rate, including shift differential and Cost of Living Adjustment where applicable for each such day off; however, such pay will not be applicable if the employee receives pay for such days off under any other provision of this Agreement. Bereavement leave must be taken on consecutive workdays as selected by the employee within thirty (30) calendar days following the death (or evidence of belated notification of death). For the purposes of this Section 6.6(c) the "immediate family" is defined as follows: spouse, same gender domestic partner, mother, father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, children, brother, sister, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, greatgrandparents, grandparents, grandchildren, stepmother, stepfather, stepchildren, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister and spouse's grandparents. In addition, an employee will be granted bereavement leave for a stillborn child if the employee provides a certificate of fetal death which has been certified by the attending physician.
Section 6.7	Garnishments.
In cases of dismissal or suspension of an employee because of writs of garnishment served upon the Company in litigation involving claims of third parties against such employee, such a dismissal or suspension will be treated as a dismissal or suspension under Section 19.3 and will be subject to the grievance procedure and other provisions of Article 19.
Section 6.8	Paydays.
For employees working in Washington, Kansas, and other states where mandatory direct deposit is permitted by law, paychecks will be delivered via direct deposit on Thursday of every second week, covering all wages, including overtime, earned through Thursday of the preceding week, except when other circumstances intervening beyond the Company’s control make

such practice impossible. For employees working in other states, paychecks shall be delivered via direct deposit on or before Thursday of every second week, or placed in the U.S. mail on or before Tuesday of every second week, covering wages, including overtime, earned through Thursday of the preceding week, except when holidays or circumstances intervening beyond the Company's control make such practice impossible.
Section 6.9	Report Time.
If an employee reports for work in accordance with instructions, he/she shall receive a minimum of eight (8) hours pay at his/her straight time base rate, including shift differential and Cost of Living Adjustment where applicable. Report time will not apply in case of emergency shutdowns arising out of any condition beyond the Company's control. An employee who leaves work of his/her own volition, or because of incapacity (other than industrial injury or illness), or is discharged or suspended after beginning work, will be paid only for the number of hours actually worked during that day. An employee who leaves work because of incapacity due to industrial injury or illness will be paid eight (8) hours pay at his/her straight time base rate, including shift differential and Cost of Living Adjustment where applicable.
Section 6.10	Overtime.
6.10	(a) The Company will first attempt to meet its overtime requirements on a voluntary basis from among employees who normally perform the particular work activity on a straight time basis; however, in cases of selective overtime new hires or rehires may be excluded for the first fifteen (15) calendar days of their employment. In the event there are insufficient volunteers to meet the requirement, the supervisor may designate and require the necessary number of employees to work the overtime.
6.10	(b) Overtime Scheduling Procedures for Extended Workday or Workweek.
(1)	The normal practice for the advance scheduling of overtime within the shop and shift will be to:
(a)	First, ask the employee regularly assigned to either the machine, job, crew or position providing the employee is in attendance when the overtime is being assigned, provided, however, that the Company may designate that employee to work the overtime before proceeding to Subparagraph 6.10(b)(1)(b).
(b)	Then, ask other qualified employees in the same job classification who are in attendance when the overtime is being assigned.

Section 7.3	Worked Holidays.
Employees who are required to work on the above-named holidays shall receive the pay due them for the holiday, plus double their base rate for all hours worked on such holiday, plus shift differential and Cost of Living Adjustment, if applicable, unless the employee starts to work at 10:00 P.M., or thereafter on that day.

his/her vacation as requested. Generally, Vacation Credit will be used in units of eight (8) hours; however, Credit may be used in lesser amounts to cover partial days of absence, subject to advance approval by the employee's supervisor.
8.4(b)(2) In instances where Company management believes the awarding of vacations as requested would interfere seriously with production requirements, the scheduling of vacations shall be as near to the dates requested as possible.
8.4(b)(3) In scheduling vacations, the Company will attempt to meet its production requirements by use of employees on a voluntary basis and, failing in this, the seniors will be given their preference of available vacation dates when request is made thirty (30) or more days prior to the vacation dates requested to the extent established vacation schedules will permit.
8.4(b)(4) In the event an employee is temporarily laid off as provided in Section 22.8 or is on approved leave of absence, he/she may elect to take his/her vacation with pay, to the extent of his/her eligibility, during such layoff or leave.
8.4(b)(5) If an employee's Sick Leave Credit is exhausted, management shall allow an employee to use vacation credit to care for a child, spouse, parent, parent-in-law, or grandparent as may be required by law, even if an employee is under a Corrective Action Memo for attendance. In other cases, management may approve on a case-by-case basis an employee's request to use Vacation Credit as sick leave for legitimate reasons for absence under the same conditions as set forth in Subparagraph 8.4(c)(1). Such approval will not be unreasonably denied; however, requests will not normally be approved if the employee is then under a Corrective Action Memo for attendance.
8.4(c) Use of Sick Leave Credit as Sick Leave. Sick Leave Credit may be used as follows:
8.4(c)(1) General. Between eligibility dates, an employee, including an employee on a leave of absence, may, at his/her option, use any part or all of his/her Sick Leave Credit as sick leave providing: (A) the employee is partially or wholly incapacitated by actual illness or injury on the days taken as sick leave, (B) an illness in the employee's immediate family requires the employee's presence or (C) the employee has a medical or dental appointment which can be scheduled only during working hours. The employee shall be paid for absence charged to sick leave and shall not be penalized for such absence providing the nature of the absence and anticipated length of absence is reported

to his/her organization on the first day of such absence, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible. As to possible rights after exhaustion of Sick Leave Credit, see Subparagraph 8.4(b)(5) and Section 8.5(a).
8.4(c)(2) Prior to First Eligibility Date. Prior to his/her first eligibility date an employee may use in accordance with Subparagraph 8.4(c)(1) accumulated Sick Leave Credits anticipated to be allocated on his/her first eligibility date. Use of such credits will be considered to be an advance from the employees' Sick Leave Credits due on his/her first eligibility date and will reduce such allocation accordingly. Should the employee terminate for any reason other than layoff prior to completion of his/her first year of service, sick leave payment made to the employee may be deducted from the employee's final paycheck and any remaining amounts will be due the Company.
8.4(d) Unused Vacation Credit. It is the intent of the parties that employees shall be required to use Vacation Credit as vacation. However, where an employee does not use all or part of such Vacation Credit as vacation with pay during the year between vacation eligibility dates, the employee shall receive pay in lieu of any remaining unused Vacation Credit after reaching his/her next eligibility date. An exception to the foregoing will be to allow employees to elect carryover of vacation credits in order to meet extended vacation needs, provided the employee makes such election in writing at least ten (10) working days before the employee's next eligibility date. Once an employee elects this exception to carryover vacation, that election will remain in effect unless otherwise requested. Vacation credits so carried over must be used during the next eligibility year and pay in lieu of vacation credits carried over will not be allowed until the end of the eligibility year following the eligibility year in which the carryover election is made. All payments in lieu of vacations shall be made at the employee's rate in effect on the employee's current vacation eligibility date, including shift differential where applicable.
8.4(e) Unused Sick Leave Credit. An employee who, on any eligibility date, has more than forty (40) unused hours in his/her Sick Leave Credit, less the number of leave without pay hours taken during the eligibility year, will receive pay-in-lieu of those hours over forty (40) in accordance with the following table:

8.4(f) Effect of Termination. Upon termination of an employee's employment for any reason on or after any eligibility date, such employee shall receive pay in lieu of his/her hours of Vacation Credit and Sick Leave Credit earned and unused up to and including the effective date of his/her termination of employment. For the purposes of this Section 8.4(f) only, an employee shall be deemed to have terminated on or after his/her first eligibility date if he/she worked on his/her last scheduled workday prior to that eligibility date. Such pay shall be in addition to such benefits as may be payable to the employee under the Financial Security Plan.
8.4(g) Effect of Military Service on Credit. Any employee who leaves to enter military service shall receive pay in lieu of his/her hours of Vacation Credit and Sick Leave Credit earned and unused up to the effective date of termination irrespective of whether he/she has been employed until his/her eligibility date. Such payment will be made when the employee furnishes proof, satisfactory to the Company, of his/her entry into military service within sixty (60) days after termination and without intervening employment elsewhere. Such pay shall be in addition to such benefits as may be payable to the employee under the Financial Security Plan.
8.4(h) Effect of Layoff on Credit. Any employee who is laid off (on other than a temporary layoff of fourteen (14) calendar days or less)

Such pay shall be in addition to such benefits as may be payable to the employee under the Financial Security Plan. Employees temporarily laid off shall not receive pay in lieu of unused Credit.
8.4(i) Use of Credit in Lieu of Working Short Workweek. In the event the Company deems it advisable to work an employee on a short workweek as provided in Article 5, Section 5.2, the employee may:
8.4(i)(1) elect against working the short workweek in which case he/she may apply for and use his/her unused Credit accumulated in the twelve (12)-month period preceding his/her last eligibility date (to the extent that it is not allocated or required to be allocated to his/her Sick Leave Credit) as time off with pay at the rate in effect on the day(s) such credit is used, including shift differential if applicable, or
8.4(i)(2) elect to work the short workweek and apply for and use such unused Credit as time off with pay for the regular workdays that are not worked in the short workweek, or
8.4(i)(3) elect layoff, in which case the provisions of Section 8.4(h) above shall apply.
Section 8.5 Financial Security Plan.
8.5(a) Use of Accrued Financial Security Plan Benefits. The Financial Security Plan is not applicable to employees within the units to which this Agreement relates.

8.5(b) Deferral of Benefit Payment. A Member may defer payment of benefits upon termination of Service regardless of the amount of the Member's account balance.
8.5(c) Annuity Form of Benefit Payment. A Member to whom a benefit is payable on account of retirement under a retirement plan sponsored by the Company may, prior to the Member's retirement date under such retirement plan, elect to receive all or any designated portion of this Plan benefit in an alternate annuity form regardless of the amount of the Member's account balance.

The failure of an insurance company, health care contractor or administrative agent to provide for any of the benefits for which it has contracted shall result in no liability to the Company, nor shall such failure be considered a breach by the Company of the obligations which it has undertaken by this Agreement. However, in the event of any such failure, the Company shall immediately evaluate the need to replace the services of such insurance company, health care contractor, or administrative agent.
Section 11.6	Administration.

Section 11.8	Federal or State Programs.
If during the term of this Agreement there is mandated by federal or state government a program that affords to employees and/or retirees covered by this Agreement similar benefits (such as but not limited to medical benefits and dental benefits) to those that are afforded by this Agreement, benefits afforded by this Agreement will be replaced by such federal or state

ARTICLE 13
LABOR GRADES - IDENTIFICATION
AND APPLICATION OF
Section 13.1	Labor Grades.
The various labor grades are those identified in Article 6.
Section 13.2	Corporate Job - Definition of.
"Job" as used in this Article 13 shall in each instance refer to, as a composite unit, The Boeing Company title, number, and description of the job.
Section 13.3	Identification of Existing Jobs-Placement in Labor Grade. The "Corporate Job List - Existing Jobs as of September 4, 2008” contains all the jobs existing as of that date. For the period of this Agreement, thereafter each job in that list respectively shall continue within the same labor grade as the one with which it is identified in such list.
Section 13.4	Procedure for Placement, Within Labor Grades, of New or Changed Jobs.
In the following sections of this Article 13, a procedure is established for the placement, within labor grades, of new jobs or jobs in regard to which, after the date of this Agreement, there has been a substantial change in job function or job description. Such procedure provides agreed upon measurements, standards and considerations to be applied in the placement of any such job within a particular labor grade.
Section 13.5	Establishment of New Jobs.
When work operations involving new or substantially changed requirements are established after the effective date of this Agreement and such requirements are not adequately or specifically described in an existing job, the Company will describe and establish a new job in a labor grade based upon its use of the Classification Guides and Representative Jobs referred to in Section 13.10 by notifying the IAM Overall Coordinator and the

Directing Business Representative at each major location of its action. If, forty-five (45) days after receipt of such notification of the establishment of the new job, the Union has not requested negotiation of the labor grade on the ground that pursuant to Section 13.10 the job should be in a different labor grade, the job will become permanent. The parties shall discuss the job description and changes shall be made by the Company in response to negotiation with the Union in the interest of clarity, better understanding or to more properly describe the way the work is organized; however, the organization of the work shall not be affected. If the labor grade is changed, such change will be retroactive to the date of installation by the Company. In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement on the labor grade such dispute may be submitted to arbitration under Section 13.9. However, neither the organization of work nor the determination of the job duties shall be subject to arbitration and the arbiter shall not have authority to alter a job description.
Section 13.6	Temporary Classifications.
Temporary classifications and code numbers identified with the prefix "T" may be established by the Company for new work functions for which no current job description is applicable and which require a period of time to stabilize job duties. This period shall not exceed ninety (90) days unless extended by mutual agreement. Extensions will be limited to two (2) and be granted in ninety (90) day increments. Employees will be assigned to such new work at their current labor grades. The Union will be notified of the effective date and approximate duration of the temporary classification and code number. If the permanent job title, job description and code numbers are installed at a higher labor grade than the labor grades of the assigned employees, these employees will be paid at the higher labor grade for the time assigned to the job duties of the applicable job title.
Section 13.7	Initial Staffing of New or Temporary Classifications.
When establishing a new or temporary classification (not job combinations) and where such new or temporary classification is comprised of portions of existing jobs in programs currently in production, the Company will identify the job classifications whose current work assignments will form the basis for the Determining Duties of the new or temporary job description. The Company will then initially staff these positions with senior volunteers from the employees currently assigned to those existing job classifications within the organization from the site where the new or temporary job is being installed. When a new job is installed in an existing job family, and is of a higher labor grade, all employees currently populating the lower labor grade in the normal line of promotion in the new job family shall be notified of the opportunity to file a Category B Effective Application in accordance with Section 22.1(b). If the temporary job results in the installation of a new job, the employees assigned to the temporary job

will have established rights to the new job. All further openings will be staffed in accordance with Article 22.
Section 13.8	Opportunity for Union to Challenge Placement in Labor Grade.
In the event the Union disagrees with the labor grade in which the new or changed job has been placed, it must, within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date the new or changed job description is forwarded by the Company, challenge the labor grade, detailing in writing the reasons why the Union disagrees and why another Classification Guide (considered with its Representative Jobs) is more appropriate to establish the labor grade; otherwise, the job title, description, and labor grade, as determined by the Company, will continue for the life of this Agreement.
Section 13.9	Procedure in Event of Disagreement.
If the Union challenges the labor grade in regard to a new or changed job, Company and Union representatives shall meet promptly, at a mutually agreed time, for the purpose of attempting to reach agreement as to the appropriate labor grade. If no agreement is reached within thirty (30) calendar days of the Union’s challenge as described in Section 13.8, the Union may, within the next ten (10) calendar days, request that the controversy be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Sections 19.6 to 19.10, inclusive, of Article 19.
Section 13.10	Classification Guides and Representative Jobs.
Each labor grade shall be identified with a "Classification Guide" and certain "Representative Jobs." Any disagreements between the Union and the Company shall be resolved (whether by agreement or arbitration) exclusively on the basis of applying the overall composite guideline afforded by each Classification Guide and the Representative Jobs identified with it. The Classification Guide and its Representative Jobs are to be considered together as presenting a composite picture of a particular grade level of work. No Classification Guide is intended to cover any of the specifics of a particular package of work but is intended instead to provide (together with its Representative Jobs) measurements and standards that identify a particular grade level of work. In each instance, the designated Representative Jobs are intended to provide a grade level picture only and will not always relate directly and specifically to each of the new or changed jobs that may be developed in the future. Further guidelines to be followed by the parties and (in the event of arbitration) by the arbiter are as follows:
13.10(a) The Determining Duties and Responsibilities (see the Rules referred to in Section 13.10(e)) in the job description describing the new or revised work shall be the basis for determining the appropriate labor grade.

13.10(b) The requirements to satisfactorily perform the work shall be considered. For example, typical requirements to be considered would be job knowledge, skill, responsibility, working conditions, and problem solving. The abilities and personal qualities of individuals who may already have been assigned to do the work shall not be evaluated.
13.10(c) The Classification Guides and Representative Jobs established for each labor grade shall be carefully studied and the sum of the requirements so represented shall be compared with those of the work to be graded.
13.10(d) The new or changed job shall be placed in the labor grade that is identified with the Classification Guide and Representative Jobs most comparable, in terms of work grade level, to the job to be graded.
13.10(e) The attached "Rules Governing the Application of Job Descriptions" and the glossary entitled "A Glossary of Terms and Phrases" shall remain in effect for the life of this Agreement.
Section 13.11	Retroactive Payment Where Labor Grade Changed.
If the Union challenges the labor grade of any new or changed job classification as to which the Company has submitted a revised job description to the Union, and it is determined that the job is not in the correct labor grade, the Company shall pay each employee involved at the corrected rate for time in which the employee has performed the determining duties specified in the job description subsequent to the date on which the Union notifies the Company in writing of its challenge of the labor grade placement and within forty-five (45) calendar days prior to that date. Section 19.5 of Article 19 shall not apply.
Section 13.12	Existing "Nonrepresentative" Jobs.
The parties recognize that, as of the date of execution of this Agreement, certain jobs now are in labor grades which, measured against the applicable guidelines, do not meet the standards and work level appropriate to the labor grade. Job references and comparisons in connection with placement of new or changed jobs within a labor grade are therefore limited to the Representative Jobs designated for the particular labor grade.
Section 13.13	Applicable Classification Guides and Representative Jobs.
During the life of this Agreement, unless changed by mutual agreement of the parties, the Classification Guides and Representative Jobs identified respectively with each labor grade shall be those to which the parties have mutually agreed bearing date of September 4, 2008, and entitled "Classification Guides and Representative Jobs for Use in Placing New or Changed Jobs Within the Appropriate Labor Grade."

Section 13.14	Misassignment Grievances.
During the life of this Agreement, the Company shall have sole responsibility for making work assignments. The Union, however, may challenge the labor grade of any employee covered by this Agreement based on the contention that the work assigned by the Company differs from the job description to the extent and in such a manner so as to require assigning the employee to an existing or new job that would be in a higher labor grade after applying the guidelines of Section 13.10. Disputes based on such contention may be settled in accordance with Article 19.
ARTICLE 14 SENIORITY
Section 14.1 Accumulation of Seniority.
The seniority of an individual at any time (subject to the other Sections of this Article 14) shall be:

An employee who applies for return from leave of absence on or before the expiration date of his/her leave will be returned in accordance with the following:
15.2(a) Where an employee returns from a leave of absence that was granted due to industrial injury or industrial illness and he/she is medically able to perform the job which he/she last held:

If an employee is found to be incapable of performing the work functions of the job title because of a medical recommendation, the Company will attempt to place such employee in available work which, in the opinion of the Company, he/she is medically capable of performing. In the event that reassignment to a lower labor grade, denial of promotion, denial of return to active employment, involuntary separation from the payroll or other adverse action results from the Company’s finding of medical disqualification, the Union may take such finding through the regular grievance channels; and such grievance, in order to be processed, (a) must be supported by medical testimony which is contradictory to the Company’s findings and (b) must be filed by the business representative with the designated representative of the Company within seven (7) workdays after the date of such reassignment to a lower labor grade, such denial of promotion, such denial of return to active employment, such involuntary separation from the payroll or such other adverse action.

16.8(c) When an employee at work requires immediate medical attention by a private medical practitioner or at a hospital due to an industrial injury/illness or exposure to hazardous agents in the work environment, and the employee is not able to provide his/her own transportation, the Company will provide the transportation to and from the employee's normal work location. If such an employee is returned to his/her work location too late to use his/her normal transportation home, the Company will provide that transportation.
Section 16.9 Medical Recommendations.
16.9(a) A medical recommendation is a description of an employee’s functional capabilities (i.e. physical or cognitive abilities) which are limited due to a medical condition. Medical recommendations are issued by the Company Health Care Provider based on a review of

A medical recommendation will be removed when the medical recommendation expires, or is discontinued by the Company’s Health Care Provider.
Section 16.10	Employees with Injuries or Illnesses.
With respect to employees who suffer an injury or illness on or after November 22, 1989:

Section 19.2	Employee Grievances.
In the case of grievances on behalf of employees and subject to the further provisions of Section 19.3 below, relating to cases of layoff or dismissal or suspension for cause or involuntary resignation:
STEP 1. Oral Discussion. The employee first shall notify his/her supervisor of his/her grievance and then, if he/she so desires, shall discuss his/her grievance with the steward or the Union business representative, and if the steward or the business representative considers the grievance to be valid, then the employee and the steward or business representative will contact the employee's supervisor and will attempt to effect a settlement of the complaint. This procedure, however, will not prevent an employee from contacting his/her supervisor if he/she so chooses. If the purpose of the employee's contacting his/her supervisor is to adjust the grievance, the steward or the business representative shall be given an opportunity to be present and such adjustment shall be in conformity with this Agreement.
STEP 2. Grievance Reduced to Writing - Handling at Supervisory Level. If no settlement is reached in Step l, the business representative, if he/she considers the grievance to be valid, may at any time reduce to writing a statement of the grievance or complaint which shall contain the following:
(a)	The facts upon which the grievance is based.
(b)	Reference to the section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated (this will not be applicable in cases of dismissal or suspension for cause or of involuntary resignation).
(c)	The remedy sought.
The business representative shall submit the written statement of grievance to the supervisor for reconsideration, with a copy to the designated representative of the Company. After such submission the supervisor and the business representative may, within the next five (5) workdays (unless mutually extended), settle the written grievance and, over their signatures, indicate the disposition made thereof. Otherwise, promptly after the expiration of such five (5)-day period (or agreed extension thereof) the supervisor and the business representative shall sign the grievance, with the supervisor indicating the basis for denying the grievance, and their signatures will indicate that the grievance has been discussed and reconsidered by them and that no settlement has been reached.
STEP 3. Written Grievance; Handling at Business RepresentativeCompany Representative Level. If no settlement is reached in Step 2, within the specified or agreed time limits, the business representative

may at any time thereafter submit the grievance to the designated representative of the Company. After such submission the designated representative of the Company and the business representative may, within the next ten (10) workdays (unless mutually extended), settle the grievance and, over their signatures, indicate the disposition made thereof. Otherwise, promptly after the expiration of such ten (10)-day period (or agreed extension thereof) the designated representative of the Company and the business representative shall sign the grievance, with the designated representative indicating the basis for denying the grievance, and their signatures will indicate that the grievance has been discussed and reconsidered by them and that no settlement has been reached.
STEP 4. Arbitration. If no settlement is reached in Step 3 within the specified or agreed time limits, then either party may in writing, within ten (10) workdays thereafter, request that the matter be submitted to an arbiter for a prompt hearing as hereinafter provided in Sections 19.6 to 19.9, inclusive.
Section 19.3	Dismissals, Suspensions, Layoffs, Etc.
In cases of layoff, or of dismissal or suspension for cause, or of involuntary resignation, the employee shall be given a copy of the layoff, suspension or termination of service slip, as the case may be, if he/she is available to be presented with such copy. If he/she is not available, copies of the slip will be sent to the employee and to the Union office. The employee shall have the right to appeal the action shown on the slip providing the business representative files a written grievance, beginning at Step 3, with the designated representative of the Company within seven (7) workdays after the date of layoff, dismissal, suspension for cause or involuntary resignation, or within seven (7) workdays after the date of the mailing of the copy of the slip, provided, however, that any dismissal or suspension of an employee who has committed a sex crime victimizing a child or children shall be deemed to be for cause and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this Article 19. The written grievance then may be processed through subsequent steps.
Section 19.4	Union Versus Company and Company Versus Union Grievances.
In the case of any grievance which the Union may have against the Company or the Company may have against the Union, the processing of such grievance shall begin with Step 3 and shall be limited to matters dealing with the interpretation or application of terms of this Agreement. Such grievance shall be submitted in writing to the designated representative of the Company or the designated representative of the Union, and shall contain the following:

Within ten (10) workdays thereafter either party may in writing request that the matter be submitted to an arbiter for a prompt hearing as hereinafter provided in Sections 19.6 to 19.9, inclusive.
Section 19.5	Retroactive Compensation.
Grievance claims involving retroactive compensation shall be limited to thirty (30) calendar days prior to the written submission of the grievance to Company representatives, provided, however, that this thirty (30)-day limitation may be waived by mutual consent of the parties.

Section 19.7	Selection of Arbiter - From Arbitration Panel.

The Puget Sound panel shall be comprised of six (6) arbiters and insofar as practicable, the arbiters shall be located in the general vicinity of the Puget Sound location. Assignment of cases to arbiters shall be accomplished by the parties taking turns in striking a name from the panel until one (1) name remains. The arbiter whose name remains shall be the arbiter for that case. The right to strike first shall be alternated between the parties on a case-by-case basis.

QUALITY THROUGH TRAINING
Section 20.1 Mutual Objective.
The Union and Company agree that it is to their mutual benefit, in a competitive global economy and environment of rapid technological innovation and change, to work together to improve the quality of worklife and productivity. The parties, utilizing participative principles, will offer a diverse range of opportunities for training, retraining, and personal growth to enhance employee development and satisfaction and support increased market share and improved economic performance of the Company.
Section 20.2 IAM/Boeing Quality Through Training Program.
20.2(a) Purpose. It is the intent of the parties to develop and implement a wide variety of mutually agreeable training, education, and learning programs and services as well as support for other joint activities. These activities will include efforts to ensure Union and management representatives are trained in participative, cooperative techniques and concepts. Therefore, the IAM/Boeing Quality Through Training Program (QTTP) exists to support the parties’ mutual objectives and will target training: (1) for employees who may be impacted or their job duties and responsibilities affected by technology changes and/or job combinations; (2) for employees who wish to meet their individual career/personal development goals; (3) for laid-off employees to enable them to become better qualified for employment within or outside the Company; and (4) to enhance employee workplace knowledge and skills (academic, employability, occupational and technical).
20.2(b) IAM/Boeing Joint Programs National Governing Board and Executive Directors. General direction and guidance of the IAM/Boeing Quality Through Training Program (QTTP) shall be the responsibility of the IAM/Boeing Joint Programs National Governing Board (Governing Board) as described in the parties’ Letter of Understanding No. 26, entitled Administration of Joint Programs, and the parties’ Letter of Understanding No. 18, entitled Expenditure of Funds Under Article 16 and Article 20. The Governing Board’s responsibilities also include determining the extent to which funding should be expended on paid time training for employees who may be impacted by technology changes and job combinations.

The recommended training programs will be developed, to the extent feasible, to be compatible with the Company’s existing training programs. In order to accomplish these activities the QTTP staff will: (1) make decisions regarding training delivery systems/processes (e.g., technical schools, community colleges, home study programs, in-plant skill centers, Employee Development Resource Centers, etc.); (2) evaluate the effectiveness of such training programs and courses and the delivery systems utilized; (3) develop communication programs to inform active and laid-off employees about the availability and purpose of the training programs and encourage employees to participate in and successfully complete the available training; and (4) investigate the availability of state and federal funds which could be used to augment training, placement, relocation and support services for active and laid-off workers. In addition to developing training programs for laid-off employees to enable them to become better qualified for employment by the Company, the staff also will consider special programs to assist laid-off employees in career advising and job placement for nonBoeing jobs.

The purpose of this program is to permit timely cash payments to recognize individual or team accomplishments that are the result of extraordinary performance or performance that exceeds job expectations. The Union will be notified of Boeing Cash Awards that are made to bargaining unit employees. The Company reserves the right to amend, modify, and/or discontinue the Boeing Cash Award Program at any time.
Section 21.3	Sabotage.
The Union agrees to report to the Company when it has knowledge of any acts of sabotage or damage to or the unauthorized or unlawful taking of Company, government, customer or any other person's or employee's property.

Section 21.4	Nondiscrimination.
All terms and conditions of employment included in this Agreement shall be administered and applied without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, status as a disabled or Vietnam era veteran, age, gender, or the presence of a disability, except in those instances where age, gender, or the absence of a disability may constitute a bona fide occupational qualification. If administration and application of the contract is not in contravention of federal or state law such administration or application shall not be considered discrimination under this Section 21.4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 21.4 or of this Agreement, a grievance alleging a violation of this Section 21.4, shall be subject to the grievance procedure and arbitration of Article 19 only if it is filed on behalf of and pertains to a single employee. Class grievances based on alleged violation of this Section 21.4 shall not be subject to the grievance procedure and arbitration under Article 19 of this Agreement.

Section 21.5	Security Interviews.
Each employee has the right, during a Security interview which the employee reasonably believes may result in discipline, to request the presence of his/her shop steward, if the shop steward is available. If his/her shop steward is not available, such employee may request the presence of another immediately available shop steward. If a shop steward, pursuant to the employee's request, is present during such an interview, the shop steward, in addition to acting as an observer, may, after the Security representative has completed his/her questioning of the employee, ask additional questions of the employee in an effort to provide information which is as complete and accurate as possible. The shop steward shall not obstruct or interfere with the interview.
Section 21.6	Employee Assistance.
The parties will cooperate in expanding employee assistance programs in order to promote the health and well-being of the workforce. These programs include the following:
21.6(a) Wellness Programs. The Company will emphasize programs to improve the health and wellness of the workforce. Examples would include health monitoring, exercise, hypertension classes, weight loss programs and stop-smoking classes.
21.6(b) Comprehensive Child and Elder Care Program. The Company will establish a comprehensive child and elder care program. This program will consist of referrals of employees to licensed care facilities, consultation with employees to determine individual needs and providing educational materials and programs. To further the objectives contained in this section, the Company agrees to establish a flexible account to fund child and elder care.
21.6(c) Joint Company-Union Alcohol and Drug Dependency Program. The parties recognize that drug and alcohol usage can adversely affect an employee's job performance and the maintenance of a safe and productive work environment and can undermine public trust and confidence in the Company's products. Accordingly, they agree to cooperate in substance abuse awareness and education. This will be in conjunction with the Joint Company-Union Alcohol and Drug Dependency Program. The details of the Program are described in the parties' Letter of Understanding No. 7, entitled Joint Company-Union Alcohol and Drug Dependency Program.
Section 21.7 Subcontracting.
The parties acknowledge that subcontracting work (moving work from a Company facility to an outside supplier) and offloading work (moving work from one Company facility to another Company facility not covered by this Agreement) affect the job security of employees. The word “work” for

purposes of this Section refers to work of a type currently performed within the bargaining unit. Accordingly, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company agrees that employees will not be laid off as a direct result of subcontracting or offloading work unless they are unwilling to change jobs (including a downgrade), shift, or locations within the bargaining unit. This layoff restriction does not apply to strategic work placements, see below, or offsets or offset arrangements (condition of sale placements); to a merger, sale, transfer, or other disposition of a plant or facility or operating unit thereof; or to temporary subcontracting or offloading necessary because of required equipment overhaul or repair, labor disruptions, or events beyond the control of the Company (acts of God, natural disasters, equipment failure, major accidents, etc.).
The parties agree to oversee, upon the Union’s request, significant subcontracting and offload proposals (those affecting at least ten (10) employees) and to determine whether a financially and strategically justifiable basis exists either to keep work within the Company or return work to a Company facility covered by this Agreement. To assist in the oversight process, Union Site Representatives, (six (6) in Puget Sound, and one (1) in Portland) will actively participate in the Company’s Work Movement Groups’ studies, for the purpose of reviewing and recommending, early in the business case analysis, subcontracting or offloading alternatives that are financially and strategically sound.
To enable the Union Site Representatives to suggest alternatives that would allow the retention of work within the bargaining unit, the Company will, at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to signing the subcontract or offloading the work, provide notice to the Union of plans to subcontract or offload work then being performed by bargaining unit employees. With respect to plans to consolidate work for efficiency or strategic reasons in a Company facility not covered by this Agreement, the Company will provide notice at least sixty (60) days prior to offloading the work then being performed by bargaining unit employees. The notice will include the reason for the planned subcontracting or offloading. The Company will provide the Union Site Representatives with the information used by the Company’s Work Movement Groups to assess the relative costs of subcontracting, offloading, or performing the work in the bargaining unit. The Union will keep confidential, and not disclose, any information provided pursuant to this Section 21.7 which the Company designates as not subject to disclosure.
For subcontracting and offloading decisions affecting less than ten (10) employees (including but not limited to decisions to consolidate work for efficiency or strategic reasons in a Company facility not covered by this Agreement), the Company will provide notice to the Union Site Representatives of plans to subcontract or offload work then being

performed by bargaining unit employees. The notice will include the reason for the planned subcontracting or offloading. The one hundred eighty (180) day or sixty (60) day notice restriction will not apply to subcontracting and offloading decisions affecting less than ten (10) employees. If time permits following the notice, Union Site Representatives may recommend subcontracting of offloading alternatives to such decisions (those affecting less than ten (10) employees) that are financially and strategically sound.
It is agreed that the Union Site Representatives’ evaluation process is to be limited to those significant subcontracting or offloading decisions where cost is the determining factor. Consequently, the notice and review process does not cover the following work transfers:
a.	Decisions made primarily for strategic considerations (“strategic work placement”) such as decisions to place work with foreign suppliers (1) for purposes of forming or continuing key strategic alliances, (2) for gaining potential access to a key market, (3) for entering risk sharing arrangements, or (4) because of condition of sale placements;
b.	Decisions arising from a merger, sale, transfer, or other disposition of a plant or facility or operating unit thereof;
c.	Decisions to subcontract or offload work due to lack of capability or capacity, or to prevent production schedule slippage;
d.	Decisions to temporarily onload work or to temporarily subcontract or offload work due to emergent short-term needs; or
In the event of a decision described in (a) through (d) above, the Company will notify the Union as soon as practical of the decision and the reasons for the decision. For tooling subcontracting or offloading decisions described in (a) through (d) above, the Company will provide Union Site Representatives with information concerning subcontracting or offloading activity on a monthly basis.
The Company’s Work Movement Group will conduct a monthly review with the Union Site Representatives to discuss activities related to the Company/Union oversight process and to discuss opportunities to improve the process. Upon the Union’s request, the Company will conduct a quarterly review to share the status of the previous quarter’s activities.
Anything in this Section 21.7 to the contrary notwithstanding, it is agreed that under and included within the meaning of Article 2 of this Agreement that the Company has the right to subcontract and offload work, to make and carry out decisions in (a) through (d) above, to enter offsets and offset arrangements, and to designate the work to be performed by the Company

and the places where it is to be performed, which rights shall not be subject to arbitration.
The parties recognize that the Company must compete in a highly competitive global economy, and commit to achieving the highest level of quality and productivity possible. Both parties recognize that ultimate job security can only be realized in a work environment that creates operational effectiveness, continuous improvement and competitiveness.
Section 21.8 Pilot Projects.
21.8(a) Objective. The Union and the Company agree that it is in their best interest to stimulate and support long-term, broad changes aimed at improving the quality of work life and productivity. This can be accomplished best by active involvement of the Union and the Company in planning, developing, implementing and evaluating innovative programs to further these aims. Accordingly, the parties shall:
1.	Review and evaluate pilot projects involving innovative approaches in the workplace and provide for their implementation, operation and assessment;
2.	Assure that pilot projects provide for employee and Union involvement through the establishment of joint pilot project committees to oversee project implementation, operation and assessment;
3.	Review experiences of other employees and unions with similar activities and provide for dissemination of information;
4.	Assess the impact on the pilot projects of existing work practices including, but not limited to, job security, compensation, job descriptions/classifications, training, and work schedules;
5.	Following implementation and assessment of a pilot project, review the feasibility of broader application; and
6.	Select consultants and other outside experts by mutual agreement.
21.8(b) Implementation of Pilot Projects. The Union and the Company shall meet and confer concerning implementation of any pilot projects including any necessary modifications to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The details of any pilot project which is agreed to by the parties shall be set forth in writing between the parties in a Pilot Project Agreement and must be approved by the Directing Business Representative of the unit where the project is proposed. It is the intent of the parties that implementation of a pilot project will not

directly result in the layoff of employees or the reduction of the pay of employees assigned to a pilot project and that the Company will pay for costs such as training. Neither the Union nor the Company is under any obligation to agree to the implementation of a pilot project.
21.8(c) Review of Pilot Projects. In addition to the on-going review by a pilot projects committee, the Union and the Company will review semi-annually the operation of all implemented pilot projects. While the parties anticipate that any implemented pilot project will continue throughout the duration of this Agreement, a pilot project may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement. In addition, it is agreed that following the first ninety (90) days of implementation of a project, either the Union or the Company may terminate a particular pilot project by giving written notice to the other, such notice to become effective on the sixtieth (60th) day thereafter.
21.8(d) Disputes Concerning Pilot Projects. No dispute concerning a pilot project or this Section 21.8 shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 19 of this Agreement except for a dispute alleging a violation of a Pilot Project Agreement or the approval or termination of a pilot project.
Section 21.9 Technology Briefings.
In order that employees can better prepare themselves for the skill requirements of the future, and in fulfillment of its obligation to provide information to the Union, the Company will not less than each six (6) months provide a briefing to the Union of the Company’s plans for the introduction of technological change which may affect employees. These briefings may be combined with briefings to the Hazard Communication Team under Section 16.2(e). The Union and its representatives will protect the confidentiality of Company sensitive and proprietary information disclosed in the briefings.
During these briefings, the Company will inform the Union of anticipated schedules of introduction of new technology, and will identify areas of skill impacts. In addition, when the Company intends to implement a technological improvement in its tools, methods, processes, equipment or materials which could have an impact on the work performed by bargaining unit employees, the Company will advise the Union of the nature and location of such technological changes and the extent to which they may affect the work performed by those employees.
The Company and the Union agree that this Section 21.9 fully sets forth the Company’s obligation to provide information concerning new technology or any other introduction or technological improvement of new machines, tools, methods, processes, equipment and/or materials. If the Union

Section 22.2	Surplusing Procedures - "Retentions" - Definition.
The surplusing procedures later specified in this Article 22 make various references to the use by the Company of "retentions." A "retention" is the retaining, in a job title in which a surplus has been declared by the Company, of an individual whose seniority position would have caused him/her to have been surplused while some other employee or employees with greater seniority are surplused. In each instance the retained employee will be designated, at the time the retention is used, to be retained in the job title rather than to have him/her affected by the surplus action. The retained employee shall be notified of his/her retention status and shall retain that status for the remainder of the six (6)-month period in which he/she is so designated unless such designation, within such period, is cancelled or is reassigned by the Company to a more senior employee in the same job title.

Also, prior to the time that any further surplus is declared in such job title, and whether within such six (6)-month period or thereafter, the retainee (or, after such six (6)-month period, the previous retainee) may be replaced in the job title by a more senior employee concurrent with the latter's downgrade to the job title. If such replacement occurs within the six (6)-month period, the Company shall be required to transfer such retention status to the downgraded senior employee. In instances where the replaced employee is not a current retainee, the most junior employee will be replaced. The Union will be notified of retention usage and may appeal to the site senior Human Resources representative or designee any perceived misapplications of this retention procedure. The site senior Human Resources representative or designee will have thirty (30) days to review the facts and correct any misapplications of this procedure.
Section 22.3	Surplusing Procedures - Number of Retentions Allowable.
22.3(a) Periods Used for Making Computations. For purposes of determining the allowable number of retentions and using and applying such retentions, calendar six (6)-month periods shall be used, the first period in each year to be from January 1 to June 30, inclusive, and the second period to be from July 1 to December 31, inclusive.
22.3(b) Allowable Number - By Location. For each such period the number of allowable retentions shall be determined separately for each of the following "locations": Seattle-Renton; Wichita; and Portland. At each such location, the number of allowable retentions for the applicable six (6)-month period will be four and one-half (4.5) percent of the bargaining unit head count at the beginning of the period.
22.3(c) Allowable Usage. At each location the use of the number of allowable retentions for the applicable six (6)-month period shall be in accordance with the following:
22.3(c)(1) Three (3) levels of seniority will be identified: (a) zero (0) years through nine (9) years, (b) ten (10) years through fourteen (14) years and (c) fifteen (15) years or more. The total retentions in all three (3) levels shall not exceed four and one-half percent (4.5), subject to Subparagraph 22.3(c)(3).
22.3(c)(2) Retentions shall apply only as against another employee in the same seniority level, subject to Subparagraph 22.3(c)(3).
22.3(c)(3) An additional one (1) percent number of retentions (one (1) percent in addition to the four and one-half (4.5) percent allowed by Section 22.3(b)) may be used in each such six (6)-month period at each such location only to retain (a) an employee in Labor Grade 5 or above as against another employee who is in a higher seniority level; or (b) an employee assigned to a program having restricted access limitations.

22.3(c)(4) Retentions described in Subparagraph 22.3(c)(3) will be accounted for separately and the Union will be advised of the reason the retention has been designated.
22.3(d) Computations - Fractional Results. In applying the percentages and making the computations under this Section 22.3, the number of allowable retainees shall be computed to the nearest whole number and a fraction of one-half (l/2) or more shall be treated as one (1).
Section 22.4	Surplusing Procedures - Use of Allowable Retentions Not Subject to Challenge.
The Company's use of retentions in the number allowed under Section 22.3, or the surpluses resulting from the application and use of such retentions, shall not be subject to challenge or to grievance procedure.
Section 22.5	Surplusing Procedures - Order of Surplusing.
In the event that the Company determines that there is an excess of employees in a job title at a particular Company location, the order of surplus of such excess will, subject to the use of retentions as defined in Sections 22.2 and 22.3, be in reverse seniority order in such job title at the primary or remote location where the surplus has been declared.
Section 22.6	Surplusing Procedures - Rights as to Downgrade.
Each employee upon being subject to surplusing action will have the right to be downgraded to the highest of the following:
22.6	(a) To a lower job title which is not lower than the next lower job title in his/her job family or previously held job families or,
22.6	(b) To the highest-graded job title, including emergency classification, held for ninety (90) or more consecutive calendar days during the preceding eight (8)-year period.
The foregoing will apply providing work is being performed in such lower job title applicable to Section 22.6(a) above or in the job title applicable to Section 22.6(b) above and providing further that his/her seniority entitles him/her to such placement when compared with the seniority of employees (other than retainees or stewards) in such job titles or of those employees who are Category A candidates for such job titles. If such an employee rejects a job offer for which he/she has downgrade rights and prefers layoff, he/she can so elect but he/she relinquishes Category A rights, to the job offered and rejected. When there is no such lower job title or where his/her seniority at the time does not entitle him/her to placement referred to in Section 22.6(a) or Section 22.6(b) above, he/she may be downgraded to any offered job title he/she will accept, or laid off.

surplusing procedures will be subject to the Category A rights of others to the extent provided in Section 22.7.
NOTE: The provisions of Section 22.6(a) and Section 22.6(b) will not apply in instances where following appropriate review, an employee was removed from his/her previous job title due to medical limitations, lack of qualifications or an employee requested downgrade.
Section 22.7	Surplusing Procedures - Preferential Rights as to Certain Category A Employees.
Employees in Category A with one (1) or more years of seniority at the time of surplus from a job title, and who have held the job title (or higher classification thereof) at the primary location where the transaction occurs, will, for the first three (3) years of their Category A status, have the preferential right to fill openings in such job title (or lower grade in the same job family) as against all other individuals, except as to the following:
22.7(a) Senior employees moved into the job title, whether by lateral reclassification, downgrade or emergency classification.
22.7(b) Junior employees moved into the job title on a temporary basis by lateral assignment, reclassification or downgrade for not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, or for ninety (90) calendar days when agreed upon by the Company and the Union, if requested by the Company for conditions such as surplus mitigation and maintaining production health, but not for the purpose of filling open requirements. Agreement will not be unreasonably withheld. This thirty (30)-day period relating to each individual assignment on a temporary basis cannot be extended by the assignment of another employee to the job title on a temporary basis. The Union will be notified of each such assignment or reclassification.
22.7(c) Employees, whether senior or junior, assigned to the job title from another Primary Location on a temporary basis for not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days unless mutually extended by the parties.
22.7(d) Junior employees who are assigned to emergency classification to a different occupation or job family for not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days, or for ninety (90) calendar days when agreed upon by the Company and the Union, if requested by the Company for conditions such as surplus mitigation and maintaining production health, but not for the purpose of filling open requirements. Agreement will not be unreasonably withheld.
22.7(e) For those openings in Labor Grade 4 and above only, junior employees in the same occupation or job family moved into the job title by downgrade, if at the time of filling the opening, the Category A

Section 22.8	Surplusing Procedures - Temporary Layoffs.
Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, when the Company determines it is necessary to reduce the number of employees working within a job title at a particular location, any employees in the organizations considered by the Company to have an excess number of employees, who are within such job title, may be temporarily laid off for not more than fourteen (14) calendar days, with or without application of the procedures stated in this Agreement during such period of temporary layoff. The Company agrees that the Union will be notified whenever possible in advance.
Section 22.9	Recall Procedures - Order of Recall of Category A Employees from Downgrade or Layoff.
The order of selection of individuals for assignment from Category A shall be from those who on the date of their layoff or downgrade were Category A candidates for the open job title strictly on the basis of seniority.
Section 22.10	Rules Relating to Lateral Transfers and Reclassifications.
Such transfers and reclassifications shall be in accordance with the following rules:
22.10(a) The Company may make lateral transfers (no change in job title) from one organization to another without limitation, subject only to the limitations of Section 22.7 of this Article 22 relating to preferential rights as to certain Category A employees.
22.10(b) The Company may make lateral reclassifications from one job title to another, or may make downgrades from one job title to another, subject only to the limitations of Section 22.7 of this Article 22 relating to preferential rights as to certain Category A employees.
22.10(c) An employee who has been reclassified to the job title within the preceding eight (8)-year period shall, in the event of surplus action affecting him/her, be afforded the right to return to one of the other job titles in a job family in which he/she has worked during the eight (8)-

year period described above, providing he/she worked in that job title or family for ninety (90) or more consecutive calendar days within or immediately prior to such eight (8)-year period, and has greater seniority than another employee (not a retainee or steward) in that job title. Reclassifications involving employees and the rights of such employees in connection with surplusing procedures will be subject to the Category A rights of others to the extent provided in Section 22.7. An employee who rejects such an offer shall have the right, upon their request, to be reclassified to a job title to which the employee has established downgrade surplus rights described in Section 22.6. Such employee shall be considered an employee accepting a downgrade and shall be eligible for the provisions of Article 6, Section 6.3(d) - Rate Retention and this Article 22. Such employee will not be eligible to file an effective application for Category A for the rejected job.
22.10(d) Any employee who is laterally reclassified by the Company and is within the following ninety (90) days found by the Company unqualified (for reasons other than not being "physically qualified"), to perform his/her new assignment shall be (1) assigned to other work in the same labor grade or (2) given the opportunity of returning to his/her former job title, providing, as to (2), that he/she worked in the former job title for thirty (30) consecutive days or more within the year preceding the reclassification to the new job and his/her seniority will support his/her return to the former job title. In the event an employee is holding a higher graded job classification but is no longer assigned to work as a lead (as defined by the Rules Governing the Application of Job Descriptions), he/she shall be given the same consideration for lateral transfers accorded to employees in the lower graded job classification of the work being performed.
NOTE: The foregoing paragraphs Section 22.10(c) and Section 22.10(d) will not apply in instances where, following appropriate review, an employee was removed from his/her previous job title due to medical limitations or lack of qualifications.
Section 22.11 Promotional Procedures1 - Order of Filling Openings. Selection of employees or individuals for assignment to an open job title shall be made in the following order (except that employees on leaves of absence in excess of thirty (30) days need not be considered for promotion during such leave):

The foregoing procedure, Section 22.11(b), shall apply unless such an employee is considered to be unsuitable because of physical limitations or because the employee does not possess the required program access credentials. Where such employees are considered to be unqualified, a memorandum will be prepared setting forth the reason the employee is unqualified. Two (2) copies of such memorandum will be sent to the site senior Human Resources representative or designee, for transmittal to the Personnel Section. One copy will be filed in the employee's folder. Where an employee is considered to be unqualified for promotion, he/she shall be so notified in writing and shall be considered for promotions to subsequent openings under the same procedures when the factors which caused him/her to be considered as unqualified no longer exist or have no bearing on the subsequent openings.

22.15(d) If, after such investigation, the Union determines the request to be one warranting further processing, and if no agreement can be reached between the Company and the Union as to a disposition of the matter prior to submitting it to the Review Board, then the matter shall be referred to the Review Board not later than ten (10) workdays after the filing of the request for review.
22.15(e) There shall be a Review Board or Review Boards to hear and determine requests for review at various Company locations. At Primary Locations, the Review Board(s) will meet at least once a month; a Review Board at a Remote Location will meet as necessary, but no later than thirty (30) days after a request for review is filed.
22.15(f) Each Review Board shall consist of three (3) members: one (1) appointed by the Union, one (1) appointed by the Company, and a chairperson whose selection shall alternate between the Union and the Company for each review.
22.15(g) The Board members shall be familiar with the types of work involved, but to the extent practicable, such Board members shall be from a different work area or organization. Neither the selecting supervisor nor the senior employee shall be members of the Review Board hearing his/her case, but they may be required to give testimony.
22.15(h) The Union Relations Office, or a representative thereof, shall establish the time and location of meetings of the Review Board and shall notify the Union of such schedule at least five (5) workdays in advance. At least twenty-four (24) hours before the meeting, the Review Board will be given the request for review, the work history and training records and employment application of the senior employee, and other information pertinent to the selection. The senior employee shall be notified of the meeting, and he/she may attend and testify, or submit additional written information, if he/she wishes to.
22.15(i) Each meeting of a Review Board shall be held during working hours. The Company will pay the wages of its committee member, the senior employee whose case is being reviewed, and the wages of the Union-appointed member of the Board if he/she is an employee on the active payroll. However, such Union-appointed member will only receive such wages while serving on his/her assigned shift.
22.15(j) The decisions rendered by each Review Board shall be based exclusively on evidence, testimony and information submitted to the Board prior to and at the meeting, and the burden of proof shall be upon the senior employee to establish that he/she is qualified.

22.15(n) The Company may continue to effect any adjustments in personnel irrespective of pending requests for review.
22.15(o) Processing of a request for review pursuant to and in accordance with Section 22.14 and this Section 22.15 shall be final and binding and neither the request nor the promotion to which it relates shall be subject to any other or further grievance procedure or challenge.

However, such employees may make application for consideration at other than their assigned location.
22.16(c) If it becomes necessary to reduce the number of employees working within job titles to which employees at a Remote Location are assigned, the following shall apply:
22.16(c)(1) Reduction in the work force at a Primary Location may be made without affecting employees assigned to any Remote Location.
22.16(c)(2) Reductions in work force may be made at a particular Remote Location without affecting employees working at a Primary Location or any other Remote Location.

surplus, to a layoff or downgrading, to a labor grade lower than that labor grade to which he/she was assigned at the Primary Location immediately prior to the transfer, may (subject to the Category A rights of others to the extent provided in Section 22.7) elect to return to the Primary Location to the labor grade to which he/she was assigned immediately prior to the transfer.
Section 22.17 Special Provisions in Regard to Employees on Travel Assignments.
The terms and limitations of this Article 22 shall apply to employees who are being compensated for living or travel expense as provided in Article 12 of this Agreement or those employees who are specifically assigned to an organization preparatory for such assignment or otherwise designated for such assignment, except that:
22.17(a) There shall be no requirement that other employees be transferred, promoted, demoted or recalled from layoff to fill job openings occurring in such special assignment, or that employees on such assignments be transferred, promoted or demoted as a result of job openings or surplus in other locations except as noted in Section 22.17(b) below. However, such employees may make application for consideration at other than their assigned location.
22.17(b) Where an employee is on a travel assignment and is subject to layoff or downgrading from a job title to which he/she is assigned while on such travel assignment to a labor grade lower than the labor grade to which he/she was most recently assigned prior to the travel assignment: He/she may elect to be returned to the original location, in which case his/her placement shall, subject to Section 22.7, be determined in the following order: (1) any job title offered by the Company in a labor grade not less than the labor grade he/she held immediately prior to the travel assignment; (2) the job title held immediately prior to the travel assignment; (3) any other job title offered by the Company which he/she accepts; (4) layoff.
22.17(c) An employee on travel assignment, who completes such assignment, will be returned to the job title held preceding the travel assignment unless surplus action that developed during the travel assignment resulted in the surplus of senior employees who have an effective application for Category A.

22.18(a)(2) The Company may transfer or demote non-bargaining unit employees (except those returning from the active management payroll) who have accumulated seniority under Section 14.1, to any collective bargaining unit covered by this Agreement only to job titles they have previously held within any such unit. Such transfers or demotions may be made subject to the preferential rights of Category A employees to the extent provided in Section 22.7.
22.18(a)(3) An employee returning from the active management (supervisory) payroll of the Company, and who is accumulating seniority or who has accumulated seniority in accordance with Section 14.1(b) will be returned to the job last held (if populated) or another job of the same labor grade or any lower grade.
22.18(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to the extent not covered by such terms and conditions, the procedures and rules relating to employees shall be determined by the Company.
22.18(c) As to an employee selected for a job opening on the basis of a Category A effective application who fails to respond to a recall or who declines to accept such an opening:
22.18(c)(1) If he/she is on layoff, he/she will lose seniority unless Subparagraph 22.18(c)(3) or Subparagraph 22.18(c)(4) applies.
22.18(c)(2) If he/she is on the active payroll and he/she declines for any reason to accept such an opening, his/her effective application as it relates to that job title will be considered cancelled but the employee may refile after a period of ninety (90) calendar days.
22.18(c)(3) If he/she is on layoff and, after interview, he/she declines to accept such an opening due to his/her valid assertion of his/her inability to perform the particular work assignment, his/her Category A effective application for that job title shall not be effective until he/she refiles an application for his/her Category A eligibility. The Union will be notified of all valid assertions.
22.18(c)(4) If he/she is on layoff and is advised by the Company that the job identified with the opening is estimated to be for less than ninety (90) calendar days duration, the employee may reject such offer and maintain, irrespective of the actual duration of the job, his/her Category A effective application for that job title. His/Her application shall not be effective for the following thirty

(30)-day period for other openings estimated to be for less than ninety (90) calendar days’ duration.
22.18(d) Where an individual has been selected to fill an opening due to his/her status as a Category A but is surplused from the job title (including those treated as a completion of a temporary promotion) prior to the completion of thirty (30) calendar days, such surplus date will be deemed to be the last date he/she held such job title for the purpose of Section 22.9.
22.18(e) An employee who has taken a disability retirement, or who has been demoted or laid off due to a medical recommendation, and whose medical condition subsequently improves sufficiently to allow him/her to perform the required work, shall be (1) returned to his/her former job title provided he/she returns within six (6) years of the date he/she last worked in that job title, or (2) returned to a job title, subject to the employee’s medical recommendation, for which he/she has established surplus rights in Article 22. The foregoing will apply provided work is being performed in such job title and provided further that his/her seniority entitles him/her to such placement when compared to the seniority of employees (other than retainees or stewards) in such job title. If his/her seniority is not sufficient to return him/her to his/her job title, he/she will be granted Category A status subject to the provisions of Section 22.1. His/Her Category A status will commence on the date he/she would have been subject to surplus action or the date on which his/her medical condition is sufficiently improved to allow him/her to perform the required work, whichever occurs first.
22.18(f) Whenever practicable, affected employees will be given at least twenty-four (24) hours notice prior to layoff.
ARTICLE 23

who upon their layoff become employed by a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company; employees who are laid off from the Company because of a merger, sale or similar transfer of assets and are offered employment with the new employer; employees who are laid off because of an act of God, natural disaster or national emergency; employees who are laid off because of a strike, picketing of the Company's premises, work stoppage or any similar action which would interrupt or interfere with any operation of the Company; and employees who terminate employment for any reason other than layoff, including, but not limited to, resignation, dismissal, retirement, death, or leave of absence.
Section 23.3	Amount and Payment of Benefit.
An eligible employee's total lump sum or income continuation benefit shall equal one (1) week of pay (i.e. forty (40) hours at the employee's base rate plus cost of living adjustment in effect on the date of layoff, but excluding any shift differentials or other premiums) for each full year of Company service as of the employee's layoff date, subject to a maximum benefit of twenty-six (26) weeks of pay. Eligible employees may elect either of the following:
23.3(a) Benefits will be paid as a lump sum following the effective date of layoff. Employees who elect this option will have all seniority under Article 14 and all recall rights under Article 22 canceled.
23.3	(a)(i) Income continuation benefits will be paid in eighty (80)-hour increments, subject to an employee's total benefit, on regular paydays beginning with the second payday following the effective date of layoff. Income continuation benefits shall immediately cease upon the earlier of any of the following events: exhaustion of the employee's total income continuation benefit; reemployment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; failure to respond with his/her acceptance within seven (7) regular workdays after dispatch by certified mail of a notice of recall from layoff; failure to report to work on the date designated by the Company; or change in the employee's employment status from layoff to resignation, dismissal, retirement, death, or leave of absence. Employees who elect this option will retain seniority as described in Article 14 and will retain recall rights as described in Article 22.
23.3	(a)(ii) Subject to continuation of the Plan, no employee shall be paid income continuation benefits more than once during any three (3)-year period; provided, however, if an employee is reemployed by the Company before payment of the employee's total income continuation benefit and is subsequently laid off in such three (3)-year period under conditions which make the employee

Section 23.4	Benefit Not Applicable for Other Purposes.
Periods for which an employee receives income continuation benefits shall not be considered as compensation or service under any employee benefit plan or program and shall not be counted toward Company service. Benefits under this Article may not be deferred into the Voluntary Investment Plan and shall be excluded from bargaining unit gross earnings for purposes of Letter of Understanding No. 34 of this Agreement.
Section 23.5	Continuation of Medical Coverage.
In the event of layoff, medical coverage for employees and dependents will continue until the employee is covered by any other group medical plan either as an employee or as a dependent, but in no event beyond six (6) months after the date of layoff. However, if the layoff occurs during or after a leave of absence, the maximum total period of continued coverage is thirty (30) months in the case of medical leave or twenty-four (24) months in the case of non-medical leave, measured from the end of the month in which the leave of absence began, irrespective of the date of termination. Required contributions, if any, must be paid during any period of such continuation of coverage.
ARTICLE 24 DURATION
This Agreement, as modified and extended in January 2014, shall become effective as of the beginning of first shift on November 2, 2008 (which date is the date as of which this Agreement was executed, sometimes referred to as the "effective date of this Agreement") and shall remain in full force and effect until midnight at the close of September 12, 2024, and shall automatically be renewed for consecutive periods of one (1) year thereafter (after September 12, 2024), unless either party shall notify the other in writing, at least sixty (60) days but not more than seventy-five (75) days prior to September 12th of any calendar year, beginning with 2024, of its desire to terminate the Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall terminate at midnight at the close of such September 12th, unless renewed or extended by mutual written agreement. In the case of such notice the parties agree to meet immediately thereafter for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement or a written renewal of this Agreement.
The Company and the Union agree and commit that for the term of the Agreement they will, on the day of the third, sixth, and ninth anniversary of the modification of this Agreement, or such other date as either party requests, mutually sign and execute a written amendment to this Agreement, which expressly reaffirms the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

RULES GOVERNING THE APPLICATION OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS
The following rules shall govern the application and interpret the intent of job descriptions and will be followed when job descriptions are revised or added:
1.	The Determining Duties and Responsibilities are those elements of the job which distinguish it from higher or lower-graded work. Performance of Associated or Incidental Duties and Responsibilities alone is not sufficient to determine a classification. It is intended that such associated or incidental duties shall not be distinguishing elements or determinants of a level of difficulty but are stated either for descriptive purposes or because they are integral and necessary parts of the job.
2.	When an employee is temporarily assigned to work falling in a higher labor grade than his/her regular job, he/she shall be paid at the higher rate for each day or major fraction (more than one-half) thereof that he/she remains so assigned. This rule is not intended to permit regular assignment for less than a major fraction of a day to a higher-graded job without payment for that job.
3.	When paragraphs under Determining Duties and Responsibilities are numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., each paragraph is considered an alternative requirement.
4.	An employee normally will perform some of the work of higher-rated jobs and some of the work of lower-rated jobs in the performance of his/her work assignment. The normal duties of any employee may include:
a.	Assistance to others, including demonstration of work to be performed and explanation of work area procedures. This does not imply that the employee providing the assistance is responsible for the quantity or quality of work of the employee being assisted.
b.	The use of proper hand and power tools and special shop equipment required to facilitate the work assignment.
c.	The submission of his/her completed work assignment or any portion thereof to inspection.
d.	The reporting of any job handicaps such as errors in materials, assembly procedures, tools, etc., in accordance with shop procedure outlined by supervisor.

5.	Work assignments shall be in accordance with established job descriptions. This shall not restrict the right of the Company to alter work functions or to formulate new job procedures and begin work thereon in accordance with Article 13 - Labor Grades - Identification and Application Of. The Company shall have the right to make work assignments and require the employees to comply with such assignments. This shall not prevent the employees and/or the Union from processing complaints or grievances arising from alleged misassignments in accordance with Section 13.14 of the Agreement.
6.	An employee is required to perform the work operations and duties described in or appraised as being covered by his/her job description with only a normal amount of guidance.
7.	Webster's New International Dictionary, Third Edition Unabridged, by G. & C. Merriam Company and the Glossary of Terms and Phrases will be used to establish the meaning of words and phrases used in the job description.
GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND PHRASES
The following terms and words are given definition and meaning to clearly indicate the common and consistent interpretation to be placed on them by all persons using the job descriptions.
1.	Adapt
To modify, alter or change furnished tooling to fit it for a specific need without altering its basic design.
2.	Angle, Compound
The angle between the two (2) non-coinciding sides of the two (2) oblique angles which are in different planes and have a vertex and one side in common. (Making a compound angle usually presents a coordinating tolerance problem since it results from holding two (2) adjoining component angles within tolerances. After the compound angle is formed, its measurement with protractor, square or sine bar is exactly the same as for any other angle and no more difficult.)
3.	Assembly Jigs
Jigs which facilitate holding and aligning a set of parts or assemblies for fabrication or assembly operations.
4.	Check, Functional
To determine whether a unit or portion of a system performs the function for which it is intended and, if not, whether rework or alteration is required. Checks of this nature include checking lines for leaks, making buzzer, bell or other continuity checks, and checking response to controls as on landing gear.

5.	Check, Operational
To make a complete check of an entire completed independent system. (An operational check always takes place on a completely assembled aircraft, missile, space vehicle or marine craft. Examples: checking the complete electrical system or hydraulic control system on a completed aircraft. It implies the necessity of a thorough knowledge of the shop theory involved.)
6.	Composites
Parts made of two (2) or more distinguishable material components either metal and/or nonmetal processed under heat and/or pressure to achieve a desired configuration.
7.	Contour (Curvature)
A curved surface having radii of different lengths all of which lie in parallel planes or the same plane, such planes being perpendicular to the curved surface, or a curved line having radii of different lengths all of which are in the same plane. The surface of a cone, a typical airfoil surface, the curved edge of a profiled plate and the curved layout line guiding the making of a router block are examples. Contour surfaces composed of sections of cylinders and edges whose profile is a section of a circle are excluded since the radii are the same length.
8.	Contour, Compound (Curvature)
A curved surface having radii of different lengths which lie in nonparallel planes. Compound curvatures are typical of stretch press and drop hammer dies. The surface of a sphere or section thereon would be a regular compound curvature and is excluded.
9.	Curvature, Reverse (Contour)
Means a compound curvature that reverses its curvature so that it has both concave and convex portions.
10.	Coordinated Tolerances, Coordinated Dimensions
These expressions are used only when exacting tolerances are implied, i.e., exacting tolerances are to be associated always with "coordinated dimensions," "coordinated tolerances" unless modified expressly. It should be understood that the mere location of a point by two (2) or more reference dimensions does not in itself mean that the dimensions themselves are coordinated. The following is an example of truly coordinated dimensions: The precise dimensions between two (2) holes must be held while at the same time the precise dimensions locating each of the holes must also be held with respect to another reference point or line.
11.	Data Input
The use of any terminal or keyboard device to insert information into a computer system.

12.	Data Retrieval
The use of any terminal or keyboard device to obtain information from a computer system.
13.	Developmental or Experimental Parts
Parts intended for use on an experimental or developmental aircraft, missile, space vehicle or marine craft, i.e., one of a few aircraft designated as being actually or potentially subject to major modification or change. These aircraft, missiles, space vehicles, or marine craft are usually produced singly or in small lots using standard tooling, improvised tooling, newly constructed production tooling or no tooling. Use of this term in a job description does not imply a particular level of difficulty unless such intention is clearly and specifically indicated.
14.	Draw, Deep
The relation of depth of draw to its other dimensions is such that it is distinguished by custom from moderate or shallow draw.
15.	Drawing Metal
The forming of sheet metal or other material by pressing it into a die while at the same time retarding movement of the metal into the die by mechanical holding, as with draw rings.
16.	Electronic Systems
Systems utilizing interrelated devices constructed or working by the methods or principles of electronics.
17.	Experimental Work, Developmental Work
Experimenting with the process or operation (assembly and/or fabrication) in order to develop new or improved methods, or building or making new assemblies and installations where exercise of a thorough knowledge of shop theory involved is necessary and further is a recognizably difficult assignment which requires ingenuity to accomplish the assignment satisfactorily. It does not include work done by a usual or established process or operation on a part even when such part is on or will later be used on an experimental or prototype product.
18.	Hand Tools
Hand tools normally used by the workmen in the performance of their occupation, such as files, rasps, deburring tools, chisels, saws, hand drills, screwdrivers, wrenches, mallets and punches.
19.	Layout
The actual marking of locating and reference points and lines on the material, part, tool, fixture, jig or assembly worked on. (Layout in itself does not imply a high level of difficulty of skill since it can be a

simple work operation such as measuring a length on a piece of lumber and marking a line or point at which it is to be sawed, marking lines on pavement with a chalk line preparatory to painting, or scribing around a furnished template on flat stock. On the other hand, layout can be a difficult work operation which requires much skill, knowledge, and experience to make the necessary computations, part setup, precise measurements and markings, and interpretation of complex blueprints such as on a complex die or casting requiring layout to establish locations for coordinated hole patterns, compound angles and/or irregular curvatures.)
20.	Layout of Part
Marking of points and lines which will determine the exact nature and dimensions of the part after machining or fabrication operations have been performed. (Layout of this nature is an integral and necessary step in the fabrication of the part.)
21.	Lead
On the part of any classified employee to delegate as authorized, a portion of his/her allocated work to employees assigned to work with him/her and pass on sufficient information to enable those employees to accomplish their work in a manner that will result in economy, quality and efficiency.
Employees classified on jobs which include lead responsibilities will:
(a)	Make detailed work allocations as instructed by the supervisor, in conformance with the classifications of employees being led, but will not make basic work assignments which affect the classification of employees.
(b)	Be responsible for furnishing sufficient and accurate information to assigned employees.
(c)	Interpret information, answer questions, review, check work and eliminate ordinary difficulties.
(d)	Perform the other "Determining Duties and Responsibilities" specified in assigned classification.
Employees classified on jobs which include lead responsibilities shall not formally appraise the work of other employees or make, as a result of solicitation by the supervisor, recommendations concerning employment, release, transfer, upgrading or disciplinary action relative to other employees, be directly responsible for the quantity or quality of work produced by other employees, be responsible for the assignment of overtime within the shop, be required to take attendance for other than the purpose of making detailed work allocations, or be responsible for handing out paychecks.

22.	Multi-Dimensional Measurement Systems
Measurement systems capable of generating precision coordinate data through the use of multi-dimensional techniques. These systems typically utilize optics, lasers, film based or digital technologies. Examples of current systems include, but are not limited, to laser trackers, coordinate measuring machines, photogrammetry and theodolites.
23.	Pickup
The performance, out of usual or normal sequence, of work operations which have been omitted by intention or of necessity (as part shortage or rushed schedule) or by oversight (as failure to drill a hole, make a cutout, or install a part). (Pickup work does not of itself establish a high or higher level of difficulty since work done out of sequence is very often no more difficult than when done in sequence. Therefore, the level of difficulty is to be determined from the composite job description and compared with the actual pickup work in question.)
24.	Plan Sequence of Operations
To devise and develop, subject to supervisory approval, a method of fabrication, assembly, installation progression, testing or inspecting, etc., for an employee's given work assignment whereby subject work will be accomplished in the most practical, expedient and efficient manner in keeping with quality standards. It is intended to relate solely to the employee's work operation and does not encompass the progression of the work order to or through the department.
25.	Production Aids
Devices such as temporary jigs and fixtures made by the worker to facilitate work operations, increase production or reduce elements of fatigue or strain. Production aids made into permanent tools will be checked and identified by tooling organizations.
26.	Program
A sequence of instructions that directs a computer to perform specific operations to achieve a desired result.
27.	Repair
To restore a part or assembly to its original state or utility after it has been damaged by accident or by wear. It does not have the same meaning as "Rework."
28.	Rework
To undo and then do over work previously accomplished in order to correct errors or make it conform to specifications. (Rework can be simple or difficult according to its nature and variety, therefore, the level of difficulty intended is to be determined from the composite job description.)

29.	Setup
A broad term which becomes specific only according to its usage and application to machines and/or operations concerned. It includes the various necessary physical work operations or steps (other than layout) which must be accomplished before actual fabrication can proceed. (Setup of a machine might include securing material to machine bed at the proper angle for cutting, selecting, aligning and setting cutting tool setting speeds and feeds, and adjusting coolant flow.) In most assembly operations, setup (e.g., positioning parts) is so closely intermingled with fitting and joining together that setup is not customarily designated as such. This is generally true of operations where machine operation is not the primary job factor.
30.	Shop Practice
The generally accepted method of performing a basic, common, or usual operation under specific conditions. It covers the knowledge which is common to the occupation itself and to most manufacturing shops using the operation under consideration. Besides the knowledge and ability to use required hand tools and equipment, it includes knowledge of general safety practices, conduct, rules of cleanliness, neatness, good housekeeping and care of equipment. Used in the phrase "shop practices and procedure," practice need not imply other than practices or methods learned or acquired at any one shop.
31.	Shop Procedure
The way custom and management require, wish or specify that the work be performed. It includes the organizational and Company rules, procedures and policies made known to the employee for his/her information and expected compliance. It covers or implies having sufficient knowledge of organization, management, and physical details of the Company to perform satisfactorily the required work in a generally harmonious manner.
32.	Shop Theory
The comprehensive craft knowledge and special skills associated with the particular trade and related trades without which advanced work of high quality, quantity and uniformity may not be performed. A thorough knowledge of shop theory is considered necessary to accomplish the more difficult and diversified work of an occupation and includes a real understanding of the capacities as well as limitations of the machines and skills used in the trade. It implies a knowledge of "why" as well as "how" a given task should be done. It is acquired by a combination of observation, experience and schooling.

A collection of programs, routines, and sub-routines that facilitate the programming and operation of a computer to include documentation and operational procedures.
34.	Tooling, Standard
Those tools or tooling used on the same or different types of machines or operations, principally in making a setup for either layout or machining and occasionally for bench or assembly work and which further are found commonly in nearly all shops and industries performing similar operations. (In the machine shop it would include Vee-blocks, parallel bars, angle plates, chucks, collets, machine vises, a wide variety of clamps, bolts, locks and wedges. In bench or assembly work it would include surface plates, table vises, and various common attachments used on portable and stationary tools to permit holding the work or increasing the scope of the tool.)

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 2
SUBJECT: FACILITIES MAINTENANCE SUBCONTRACTING
The Company and the Union have undertaken a joint review of subcontracting practices in the Facilities Maintenance and General Construction organizations at the Primary Locations covered by this Agreement. It has been determined that managing the unique subcontracting aspects of those organizations, including the cost effectiveness of subcontracting practices, can be improved by regularly reviewing subcontracting decisions, including work packages being subcontracted and let out to bid. Accordingly, the parties agree to develop a process to review subcontracting decisions at each Primary Location in order to determine whether work packages can be completed by hourly Facilities Maintenance and General Construction employees within budgeted costs and schedules. As part of this joint effort, the parties commit to furthering a work environment that creates operational effectiveness, continuous improvement, and competitiveness.
The Company will conduct a quarterly review with the Union to share status on the previous quarter’s activities and to discuss opportunities to improve the joint review process.
In addition, the Company agrees that employees in Facilities Maintenance and General Construction organization as of January 3, 2014, will not be laid off as a direct result of Facilities Maintenance or General Construction subcontracting. This restriction does not apply in the event of a merger, sale, transfer, or other disposition of a plant or facility or operating unit thereof, or to temporary subcontracting necessary because of required equipment overhaul or repair, labor disruptions, or events beyond the control of the Company (acts of God, natural disasters, equipment failure, major accidents, etc.). In lieu of layoff, employees will be retrained and reassigned for available work outside the Facilities Maintenance and General Construction organization.
The Company may continue to subcontract Facilities Maintenance and General Construction work to be performed on Company property by outside workers provided that such work is of a type and character as has been so subcontracted in the past.
Disputes involving alleged violations of this Letter of Understanding shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure provided for in Article 19 of this Agreement.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 3
SUBJECT: UNION INTERVIEW OF NEW EMPLOYEES
It is recognized by the Company that the Union has an interest and responsibility in explaining the function of the Union in a collective bargaining relationship and the advantages of membership in the Union. The Union is also aware and has agreed that solicitation of membership cannot be conducted during working time due to the interference and disruption that could result in working schedules. To accommodate both viewpoints and assure that an ample opportunity exists for the Union to explain their role in the bargaining relationship while preserving minimal interference in the Company's working schedule the following procedure will be utilized:
1.	At an appropriate time following the Company interview, all individuals employed into the IAM bargaining unit will be directed to an IAM&AW representative who is present in the Employment Office.
2.	The following message will be used by the Company representative to introduce the IAM&AW representative:
"The Union representative wishes to explain their designation as your bargaining agent, your opportunity for membership, and the payroll deduction of dues for members."
3.	The Union representative will advise the employees that membership in the IAM&AW is voluntary and not a required condition of employment.
4.	Both the Company and the Union agree to cooperate in the implementation and administration of this procedure. Neither party will interfere, restrain or coerce employees and both parties agree to use good judgment in all words and actions during this procedure.
5.	The Union agrees to minimal interference with the new employee employment processing and the Company agrees to refrain from any actions or statements which could adversely reflect upon the Union.
6.	The Union agrees to pay their representative's time allotted by this procedure and to have sufficient representatives present during normal working hours.
7.	With the implementation of the procedure for the interview of new employees it is agreed that any existing or contemplated arrangements for permitting the Union to explain membership to applicants or hires is no longer valid and will be cancelled.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 7
SUBJECT: JOINT COMPANY-UNION ALCOHOL AND DRUG DEPENDENCY PROGRAM
The Company and the Union establish the following Joint Company-Union Alcohol and Drug Dependency Program, relating to an employee’s voluntary entry into treatment in lieu of termination for attendance or performance, when deemed appropriate by the Company:
A.	The following are basic essentials for an effective alcohol and drug dependency program:
1.	Participation in the Program by an individual employee must be voluntary and will be kept confidential to preserve the employee's privacy.
2.	Effectiveness of the Program is directly dependent upon the degree to which the employee affirmatively seeks such voluntary participation.
3.	The Program is by its nature a progressive undertaking, and failure of an employee to participate in an earlier stage may eliminate the employee from subsequent stages.
4.	The Company's right to discipline an employee for unsatisfactory performance or attendance is not diminished or modified in any way by the fact that the employee may have an alcohol or drug problem. However, while discipline for other Company Rule violations shall not be affected by this Program, disciplinary action for unsatisfactory performance or attendance may be held in abeyance during the employee's cooperative participation in the Program, provided no further performance or attendance problems occur.
B.	The Program is divided into the following stages:
1.	Identification.
2.	Evaluation.
3.	Treatment.
4.	Return to work.
C.	Identification.
1.	Identification of an employee as having an alcohol or drug problem which interferes with job performance or attendance can occur in several ways:
a.	The individual employee acknowledges the problem and so advises a Company or Union representative.
b.	Company management or Union representatives become aware of the employee's performance or attendance problems

and have some reason to believe the problems are alcohol or drug related.
2.	At this stage, a brief counseling session attended by the employee, his/her supervisor and, if agreeable to the employee, his/her personnel representative and Union representative, should be arranged and the following items covered: (If the employee so desires, a separate, private counseling session with his/her Union representative can be utilized as an alternative to the Union representative's participation in the supervisor's counseling session with the employee.)
a.	The Program shall be clearly explained to the employee.
b.	The facts that participation is purely voluntary and will be kept confidential should be emphasized.
c.	It should be stressed that the extent of the employee's alcohol or drug problem, if any, has not yet been determined.
d.	The employee should be advised that normal disciplinary action appropriate for his/her job performance or attendance problems may be held in abeyance so long as he/she cooperatively participates in the Program, provided no further performance or attendance problems occur.
e.	The session will conclude by advising the employee that, if agreeable, an appointment will be arranged with the Company Employee Assistance Program for a professional evaluation of the problem.
D.	Evaluation.
1.	Because alcohol and drug problems vary considerably (their causes are innumerable, they may be temporary or of long duration, they may be acute or chronic, they may or may not involve serious physical deterioration), it is imperative that the scope of the employee's problem must be medically evaluated at the outset.
2.	At the appointment with the Company Employee Assistance Program, the employee will be advised that:
a.	The results of the evaluation will be retained by the Employee Assistance Program and by any outside medical evaluator, and will be provided to the employee and, if agreeable to him/her, to the Union.
b.	If the evaluation concludes that the employee does not have a significant alcohol or drug problem requiring further treatment, no further participation in the Program is required.
c.	If the evaluation concludes that the employee has an alcohol or drug problem requiring treatment, such treatment by an outside organization or medical expert from a list agreed upon

by the Company and the Union will be arranged by the Company Employee Assistance Program.
d.	The employee's participation in such treatment is voluntary. However, if the employee refuses such treatment, or fails to cooperate in its successful completion, any disciplinary action for his/her job performance or attendance problems which has been held in abeyance may be taken.
E.	Treatment.
1.	When the Evaluation Report indicates that treatment is necessary and the employee agrees in writing to participate, the Company's Employee Assistance Program will arrange with the employee and the selected treatment agency a schedule for treatment.
2.	If necessary for treatment, the employee will arrange for a medical leave of absence via Total Access for the period of the treatment.
3.	If the employee continues to work during treatment, he/she will be subject to normal rules of conduct and performance.
F.	Return to Work.
1.	If a leave of absence is required for the treatment of the employee's alcohol or drug related condition, the employee's return to work must be approved by the Company Employee Assistance Program.
2.	Such approval will depend, in large measure but not exclusively, on the recommendation of the outside treatment agency or expert as to the employee's successful completion of the treatment.
3.	An employee's failure to successfully complete the recommended course of treatment may result in termination of employment unless, in the opinion of the Company Employee Assistance Program, the employee is able to return to work.
G.	Costs incurred by the employee for medical evaluation and treatment will be reimbursed under the Company's Group Insurance Program subject to the requirements and limitations of that Program.
H.	The Company and the Union are interested in exploring the desirability of organizing a Boeing Chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous comprised of eligible hourly employees who could provide counseling and other essential supporting services to employees participating in this Program.

The purpose of this Letter is to define the objectives of the joint Union/Company Corporate Jobs Committee.
1.	The Corporate Jobs Committee shall consist of not more than six (6) representatives appointed in writing by the Union's Corporate Coordinator and not more than six (6) representatives appointed in writing by the Company's Vice President of Union Relations. This Committee may be comprised of representatives from the Puget Sound, Wichita, and Portland Primary Locations. The Union and the Company will each appoint a chair of its group.

2.	The Committee shall, as determined jointly by its chairs, study the job classification system established by Article 13 of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement in order to maintain the integrity of the system and to develop and implement plans for change that will provide job enhancement, employment security and productivity improvements. Such activities may include but are not limited to:
•	Developing innovative job structure proposals.
•	Deactivating zero or minimally populated jobs.
•	Combining jobs by placing similar work in similar job classifications.
•	Developing new jobs and revisions to existing jobs to accurately reflect organization of tasks.
•	Establishing like classifications and titles for all locations covered by the Agreement where work responsibilities are the same.
3.	If a Committee member is required to visit a Primary Location to fulfill a Corporate Jobs Committee commitment, the appropriate Committee members shall be notified and participate as appropriate in any business involving that visit.
4.	The Committee shall report to the Union and the Company on the job classification system, together with the suggestions of the Committee members for changes thereto. The results of the Committee's work

7.	The Committee shall function through the life of the Bargaining Agreement.

SUBJECT: OVERTIME
It is understood that the authority of the Company to require overtime work, established by Section 6.10 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, is necessary for business planning and meeting operational objectives. The parties recognize, however, that the exercise of this authority may affect employee productivity.
Accordingly, the Company and the Union agree, subject to the exceptions noted below, that the authority conferred by Section 6.10 of the Agreement shall hereinafter be limited as follows. No employee shall be required, and need not be permitted, to work overtime in excess of the following limits:
Quarterly Limit
•	The limit shall be one hundred twenty-eight (128) overtime hours in any budget quarter;
Weekend Limit
•	The limit shall be two (2) consecutive weekends;
•	Employees who have worked two (2) consecutive weekends may volunteer to work overtime on the following weekend;
•	Overtime work on either a Saturday and a Sunday, or on a Saturday or a Sunday, shall constitute a weekend worked;
•	The limit for overtime on a Saturday or a Sunday shall be eight (8) hours.
Holidays
•	All overtime on a holiday as set forth in Section 7.1 of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement or on the weekend which immediately precedes a Monday holiday or immediately follows a Friday holiday shall be voluntary.
All overtime in excess of the above limits shall be strictly on a voluntary basis and no employee shall suffer retribution for his/her refusal or failure to volunteer. An employee may be required to perform overtime work beyond the above limits where necessary for delivery of an airplane which is on the field, for customer-requested emergency repair of delivered products, or for Government DX or Government DO rated orders. In addition, an employee may be required to perform overtime on a holiday or on the weekend which immediately precedes a Monday holiday or immediately follows a Friday holiday where necessary for facilities maintenance.

SUBJECT: MEANING OF SECTION 19.3 OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
The Union and the Company have agreed in Section 19.3 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that any dismissal or suspension of an employee who has committed a sex crime victimizing a child or children shall be deemed to be for cause and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 19. This Agreement is based on both parties' recognition of (1) the growing awareness and abhorrence in our society of crimes victimizing children, and (2) the deleterious effect the presence in the work force of perpetrators of such crimes would have on the efficiency and morale of employees of the Company and on the reputation of the Company and its products.
The Union and the Company further agree as follows:
1.	For purposes of Section 19.3 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and this Letter of Understanding, the term "sex crime victimizing a child or children" includes rape, sexual assault, statutory rape, incest, child molestation, child pornography, public indecency, indecent exposure, indecent liberties, communications with a minor for immoral purposes, promoting prostitution, and similar crimes as defined in the jurisdiction in which the offense is committed, where the victim of said crime(s) is under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime(s). An employee shall be considered to have committed such a crime if the employee is convicted of the crime, or if the employee enters a special supervision program pursuant to a deferred prosecution arrangement relating to the crime.
2.	The provision of Section 19.3 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement referred to herein and this Letter of Understanding shall not be deemed to define "cause" or to affect Article 19 in any other respect whatsoever, and shall not be introduced or relied upon in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties which does not deal with the suspension or dismissal of an employee who has committed a sex crime victimizing a child or children.

SUBJECT: TIME LIMITS IN SECTION 19.3
The parties agree that the seven (7)-workday time limit for filing of a written grievance in the case of dismissals or suspensions shall be interpreted as follows:
1.	If the Union's Business Representative, within seven (7) workdays from the date of the suspension or dismissal, calls the Company's Union Relations office to request to review the employee's folder, the Business Representative shall have seven (7) workdays after he reviews the folder in which to file a written grievance.
2.	If no written grievance is filed during the additional seven (7)-workday period specified in paragraph 1, the matter is closed, provided, however, that if the Business Representative, within the additional seven (7)-workday period, informs Union Relations that he/she has decided not to file a grievance, the matter will remain open for fourteen (14) more workdays to allow the employee to appeal the Business Representative's decision. If the employee does not appeal, the matter is closed. If the employee does not appeal, but no written grievance is filed within the additional fourteen (14)-workday period, the matter is closed.

SUBJECT: JOINT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE COSTS AND QUALITY
The Company and the Union are committed to ensuring that employees have access to cost effective, quality health care coverage. Because of their ongoing concern about the quality of health care and costs, the parties agree to a Joint Committee on Health Care Costs and Quality. The Committee will have an equal number of representatives, including a co-chair, from each party. When appropriate, health care experts and representatives from the Company's health plans will be invited to attend Committee meetings. Each party may have their benefits consultants and advisors attend Committee meetings. The Committee will meet at least twice each year to discuss issues related to the health care program. The Committee also will meet with health care providers to express the parties' interest in obtaining quality health care at affordable prices. Among the topics that the parties will consider and discuss are:
•	Costs under the Company’s medical plans.
•	Overall plan design.
•	Efficient use of health care resources by consumers.
•	Cost management programs to address specific cost areas, including:
•	Disease management of selected high-cost chronic diseases.
•	Targeted health risk assessment.
•	Catastrophic case management.
•	Pharmaceutical management.
•	Measurement tools for evaluating health plans’ and providers’ efficiency, including but not limited to programs of the National Academy of Sciences and National Quality Forum as well as accreditation from nationally recognized groups such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) or the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT).
•	Benchmark data from other employers.
•	Opportunities to work with other employers, unions or other parties interested in obtaining quality health care at affordable prices.
The Company and the Union also will undertake initiatives to expand health care plan accountability for quality and efficiency. Among these initiatives will be:

•	Provider performance reporting on quality and efficiency to encourage use of the highest quality providers, including those who meet the highest patient safety standards.
•	Joint Company and Union meetings with health care plan administrators to understand their criteria for identifying high performance providers and to strongly recommend and offer advisory information in support of the development of high performance provider networks.
•	Provider programs focused on specific high-yield quality innovations shown to substantially improve patient safety.
•	Computerized physician order entry. Physicians will be required to enter prescriptions into a hospital database to screen for inappropriate medications and dosages and avoid potential adverse drug reactions/interactions.
•	Evidence-based hospital referral. Physicians will be required,
where practical, to guide patients to facilities with superior outcomes (linked to significantly lower patient mortality).
•	ICU physician staffing. Where available, physicians who are critical care specialists will provide ICU care.
To encourage plan participants to use the highest quality health care available, it is the intent that the Company will provide education to employees regarding the effectiveness of physicians, hospitals and other health care providers as it becomes available.
The Company and the Union are committed through these and other initiatives to improve quality and maintain reasonable costs, and they will recognize and endorse contracting decisions with physicians, hospitals and health plans based on compliance with these joint initiatives.

SUBJECT: SECTION 6.10(b) OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
The Company and the Union agree that Section 6.10(b) of their Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be administered as follows:
1.	With respect to Subparagraph 6.10(b)(1), the Company's practice is to seek volunteers for the advance scheduling of overtime within the shop and shift. However, the parties agree that an exception may be made for certain assignments where the employee regularly assigned to either the job, crew or position is the appropriate individual to perform the work of the overtime call-out. Therefore, the parties agree that in order to ensure that the employee regularly assigned to either the job, crew or position is designated to work the overtime pursuant to Subparagraph 6.10(b)(1)(a) only when he/she is the appropriate individual, such designation may be made only if it is approved by the Director or his/her delegate, the delegate being at least one (1) level above the employee's immediate supervisor.
2.	With respect to Subparagraph 6.10(b)(2)(f) the parties agree that the reference to deficient schedule performance or work quality being "currently documented" shall mean a Corrective Action Memo. In order to be used under Subparagraph 6.10(b)(2)(f), a Corrective Action Memo must state the period, not to exceed ninety (90) days, it will remain in effect and may serve as a basis for exclusion from overtime consideration only during that period.
3.	The Company will provide notification of designated weekend overtime no later than the first rest break on Friday. When emergent situations arise following first rest break, notification of such overtime will be provided as soon as possible.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING 17
SUBJECT: MODIFIED IN-LINE PROMOTION FOR CERTAIN JOB TITLES
The parties agree that career growth and promotional opportunities for qualified employees will benefit both the Company and employees. The parties acknowledge that in some job titles, the Category B process set forth in Section 22.1(b) of this Agreement does not consistently result in the promotion of employees who possess the technical skills and expertise to be successful in the open job in the normal line of promotion.
Accordingly, the parties agree that with respect to the job titles listed below, the parties will jointly develop minimum qualifications/requirements that employees in the job family must meet prior to filing an effective application to the personnel section for the open job title and designated shift, pursuant to Section 22.1(b)(2). The provisions of Sections 22.1(b)(1), 22.1(b)(3), and 22.1(b)(4) will continue to apply. The minimum qualifications/requirements for each job title will be jointly established within one year of contract ratification.
Once a candidate in the job family meets the minimum qualifications/requirements, the candidate may submit his or her request for an upgrade. When the next job opening occurs, the senior candidate who has met the minimum qualifications/requirement will be selected. In some cases, upon meeting the minimum qualifications/requirements, the promotion may be immediate.
Job Titles Subject to this Letter of Understanding
Facilities Crafts:
811XX Plumber Maintenance, 895XX Machine Repair Mechanic, C20/861 Electrician Maintenance
The parties will meet on a quarterly basis to discuss whether additional job titles should be added to, or removed from, this Letter of Understanding during the term of this Agreement. Additional job titles shall only be added to this Letter of Understanding by mutual agreement of both parties.
For all job titles subject to this Letter of Understanding, the Company will not select normal line of promotion designated candidates under Section 22.1(k).

Subject: NC/CNC/ADAPTIVE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND COMPUTER AIDED WORK STATIONS
The Company and Union agree to the identification and clarification of the below terms and descriptions as applicable to all Corporate Jobs as identified in Article 13 of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement:
A. 1. Numerically Controlled/Computer Numerically Controlled (NC/CNC) or other adaptive computer system machine controls are synonymous and will be used as such in all existing job classifications, and shall be incorporated as such into all existing and future job classifications as appropriate.
2.	Operators may make adjustments to existing machine control programs similar and in comparable technical complexity as those required to manually provide machine instruction such that machines optimally perform the identified machine tasks.

B.	Computer aided/assisted work stations such as those using PC's, computer terminals linked to main frame systems, CATIA or any and/or all subsequent integrated computer assisted technology systems, which are used to accomplish currently assigned or similar work assignments, shall not be used as justification for revision of grade level, but are considered tools and devices assisting the individual to accomplish assigned tasks. The actual duties and tasks accomplished by the individual as a composite in comparison to the classification guides and representative jobs will be the basis for grade designation as identified in Article 13 as applied in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
C.	Such terms will be incorporated into revised or new job descriptions and/or incorporated into the classification guides and/or Glossary of Terms and Phrases within the Collective Bargaining Agreement or a combination of the above.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 21
SUBJECT: NON-TRADITIONAL WORK SCHEDULES
The parties recognize that the efficient use of facilities and machinery is an integral part of the Company's competitiveness and that the Company's competitive position is essential to the employment security of its employees. The parties further recognize that a normal work schedule of eight (8)-hours-a-day five (5)-days-a-week is not always conducive to the efficient use of facilities and machinery. Accordingly, the parties agree they will consider implementing non-traditional work schedules where they deem it appropriate.
While the parties recognize that the details of non-traditional work schedules will have to be discussed on a case-by-case basis, and that no such schedules will be implemented except upon mutual agreement by the parties, the following guidelines will apply:
1.	The workweek and shift times set forth in Article 5 of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement will be adjusted to accommodate the non-traditional work schedule.
2.	The phrase "assigned shift" will be substituted for "eight (8) hours" wherever it appears in the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	Employees who work on their third consecutive day of rest will be paid overtime on the same basis as their first day of rest.
4.	For those calendar weeks encompassing any of the holidays observed by the Company, employees assigned to non-traditional work schedules will be converted for that week to a normal work schedule.

SUBJECT: PART-TIME WORK SCHEDULES
As a means of extending their commitment to employment stabilization, the parties have agreed to explore alternate work schedules which could serve the purposes of potentially reducing the number of layoffs and responding to the needs of individual employees. One of these alternate work schedules is a "part-time work schedule" which, for purposes of this Letter of Understanding, shall mean a fixed weekly work schedule which is less than the regular forty (40)-hour week. No minimum or maximum number of hours will be required, but fixed days (other than Saturdays or Sundays) and hours of work must be established. This Letter of Understanding is strictly limited to those part-time work schedules which are voluntary by an employee.
Participation in a voluntary part-time work schedule is subject to management approval which shall be effective for a minimum of ninety (90) days. In the event that more employees in a particular job classification in a shop volunteer than can be accommodated, selections will be made on the basis of seniority. Employees on part-time work schedules covered by this Letter of Understanding will be subject to all provisions of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement, except as follows:
1.	Holidays
Employees are eligible for holiday pay if they are scheduled to work twenty (20) or more hours in a seven (7)-day cycle or forty (40) or more hours in a fourteen (14)-day cycle. Payment will be four (4) hours of holiday pay for each Company holiday, regardless of calendar day or hours scheduled on the respective holiday. Employees required to work on a holiday will receive double their regular rate for the time worked in addition to any holiday pay to which they are entitled.
2.	Overtime
For the first ten (10) hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek, the employee will receive one and one-half times the base rate; for hours worked in excess of fifty (50) hours in a workweek, the employee will receive double the base rate. No overtime will be paid when less than forty (40) hours have been worked during the workweek. Notwithstanding any provision in the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement, employees on parttime work schedules will not be asked, or permitted, to work on a Saturday or a Sunday unless all other employees in the same classification in that shop have been offered the opportunity to perform the work.

Payment will be four (4) hours for each day served, regardless of calendar day or hours scheduled on each day served. For purposes of bereavement leave and report time, the phrase "assigned shift" will be substituted for "eight (8) hours." Employees on third shift who are approved for part-time work schedules will be reassigned to second shift.
4.	Group Benefits
Employees on part-time work schedules will be offered an insurance package consisting of the Traditional Medical Plan and Incentive Dental Plan. All normal Plan provisions will apply. Premiums will be paid by the Company on a pro-rated basis, as determined by scheduled weekly hours as follows:
1-19 hours
Pro-Rated Schedule
Medical and Dental Coverage
Not Eligible for Group Insurance
20-32 hours
70% Paid by Company
33 or more hours
100% Paid by Company
Employees eligible for group insurance may either pay the balance of the premium by payroll deduction or decline coverage entirely.
This Letter of Understanding may be cancelled by either party by giving written notice to the other upon each six (6)-month anniversary of its execution.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 23
SUBJECT: FACTORY SERVICE ATTENDANTS RATE STRUCTURE REVISION
The Company and the Union agree to the continued inclusion of the 8820A job classification as part of the approved Corporate job codes. As agreed in the 1995 Collective Bargaining Agreement this job will replace the existing 88201 and 88202 factory service attendant classifications. The Labor Grade “A” will have a minimum rate of $11.00 per hour with a maximum rate of $18.04 per hour. The Labor Grade “A” will only be applicable to the 8820A classification. All provisions of Article 6 of the parties’ current Collective Bargaining Agreement (“this Agreement”) will apply to employees in this classification who are not at the rate maximum. For those employees who are at the maximum rate any general wage increases provided for in Subparagraph 6.3(b)(1) will be paid as lump sums equivalent to the agreed upon general wage increase percentage. The lump sums will be paid as a percentage of bargaining unit gross earnings. Bargaining unit gross earnings are defined as that portion of an employee’s total earnings while in the bargaining unit which is computed at the employee’s base rate plus cost of living adjustment rate, shift differential rate, and non-regular workweek premium rate, as applicable, on regular and overtime hours worked, overtime bonus hours, third shift bonus hours, team leader premium, sick leave hours (including those paid from FSP funds), vacation hours, holiday hours, report time hours and leave with pay hours. All other payments to an employee, imputed or otherwise, are excluded from the definition of bargaining unit gross earnings. The rate range maximums will be adjusted in accordance with Section 6.4 of this Agreement, if applicable.
The 8820A classification applies only to newly hired employees and those individuals placed in this classification through any means other than the exercise of contractual rights provided by Article 22 of the Agreement. This job may not be populated while there are employees with Category A rights to the 88201 and 88202 job classifications.
Labor Grade "A" is not covered in the classification guides for labor grades one through eleven, but is to be assigned as stated in this Letter of Understanding.

SUBJECT: CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The Company is developing people strategies to support individuals in the workforce and retain valuable employees with the end goal to make the Company more competitive. These strategies recognize that employee concerns about child care can affect an individual's productivity and work focus. To support these strategies, the Company has implemented a Child Development Program to build on other Company programs which support employees and their families.
As one element of the Program, the Company has, in coordination with the Union, established two (2) near-site day care centers (Everett and Renton). The day care centers are operated by a third party with fees charged to participating employees geared at an operations break even level.
Additional components of the Company’s Child Development Program include providing leadership to help improve the quality and availability of child care in communities where employees live and enhancing child care referral services through the existing Child and Elder Care referral program. Consideration will be given to adding other elements, such as collaboration by the referral program with day care providers and parents on evaluation of facilities and day care curriculum, assistance in extended/alternate hours, and assistance dealing with specific day care needs.

SUBJECT: IAM/BOEING JOINT PROGRAMS EDUCATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM/LEARNING TOGETHER
The Union and the Company recognize that to achieve a highly skilled and motivated workforce the parties must create an environment conducive to learning opportunities. To that end, Joint Programs created a financial assistance program named Education Assistance. This jointly administered program provides easy access to financial aid to IAM bargaining unit employees pursuing additional education.
The Company has implemented a financial assistance program named Learning Together. This program is similar in scope to Education Assistance, but provides restricted stock awards not available to Education Assistance participants, and unlike Education Assistance has no fund limitations. In addition, Learning Together is made available to all Boeing employees.
In the spirit of joint cooperation, the Union and the Company agree to the following:
•	Learning Together and Education Assistance will co-exist.
•	Education Assistance will continue to be co-managed by the Union and the Company through Joint Programs.
•	Joint Programs will administer Education Assistance for IAM participants at District 24, District 70, and District 751.
•	Participants will receive the most favorable benefits of either Learning Together or Education Assistance.
•	Participants’ cost within Learning Together Guidelines will be borne by Learning Together.
•	IAM participants who complete doctorate, masters, bachelors, and/or two-year associate degrees will be awarded restricted stock in units identical to those awarded in Learning Together.

Employees granted an accelerated layoff date will be paid layoff benefits if they meet the eligibility criteria set forth in Article 23 of the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 35
SUBJECT: PATIENT SAFETY STANDARDS
Consistent with the Parties’ commitment to ensuring that employees have access to cost effective, quality health care coverage as detailed in Letter of Understanding No. 15, the parties agree that the term “patient safety standards”, as set forth in Attachment A and Attachment B of the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall be modified to be defined in its entirety as follows, effective immediately and continuing until the expiration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Patient safety standards refer to nationally recognized criteria for making hospital services safer. A hospital meets patient safety standards if it meets established criteria such as those listed below. The hospital must publicly certify upon request that it meets all criteria and the statements pertaining to standards are accurate and reflect normal operating procedures at the hospital. The criteria include:
a.	Criteria for Network Hospital Admissions for Complex Procedures Evidence-based Hospital Referrals: for patients admitted for one of several complex procedures (coronary artery bypass grafts, percutaneous coronary intervention, abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, pancreatic resection, esophagectomy and high risk deliveries), network hospitals must meet experience criteria, consisting of process, volume, and/or outcome measures, for the performance of the specific procedure. If complex procedures as identified by national standards change in the future, the parties agree that they will meet and discuss the changes.
b.	Criteria for Other Network Hospital Admissions
For patients admitted for all other procedures or conditions, network hospitals must meet the following standards:
Computerized Physician Order Entry: Prior to January 1, 2005, the hospital must publicly assure that by January 1, 2005, physicians will enter at least 75 percent of inpatient medication orders via a computer linked to error-prevention software. The software must be capable of alerting physicians to at least 50 percent of common, serious prescribing errors. On and after January 1, 2005, the hospital must publicly assure that it actually fulfills these capabilities.
Intensive Care Unit Staffing: On and after July 1, 2004, the hospital publicly assures that its adult and/or pediatric intensive care unit is managed or co-managed by critical care specialists who:
1.	Are present during daytime hours and exclusively provide clinical care in the ICU, and
177
1	2. At all other times, can return urgent ICU paging calls within
2	five (5) minutes and arrange for a physician or FCCS-certified
3	non-physician specialist to reach ICU patients within five
4	minutes at least 95 percent of the time.
5	In geographical areas where scientifically rigorous, risk-adjusted
6	outcome comparisons are publicly reported for intensive care unit
7	performance, favorable risk-adjusted outcomes may replace the above 8 criteria for intensive care unit staffing.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 36
SUBJECT: TEAM LEADER
The parties recognize that certain work groups may benefit from the designation of an employee as a team leader for the purpose of creating and maintaining a team environment and coordinating operational issues. The Company will determine the necessity for, and number of, team leader assignments. The team leader will serve as the leader of all bargaining unit employees in the assigned work group, irrespective of the job classifications of those employees. The selection of a team leader shall not be considered the establishment of a new job for the purposes of Article 13.
The selection of an employee for a team leader assignment shall be made in the following manner: Employees who meet the minimum criteria for a team leader assignment will self-nominate for a posted open team leader assignment. Open team leader assignments will be posted for a minimum of five (5) work days. A structured interview will be utilized to select recommended candidate(s). If the posted team leader assignment is filled by the Company, and there are two or more recommended candidates for the assignment, the recommended candidate with the greatest bargaining unit seniority will be selected. The provisions of Article 13 and 22 shall not apply to such selection.
Effective September 5, 2008, an employee selected for a team leader assignment shall be paid a premium of $2.00 per hour above his/her current base rate.
Employees assigned as team leaders shall not formally appraise the work of other employees or make, as a result of solicitation by their supervisor, recommendations concerning employment, release, transfer, upgrade, or disciplinary action relative to other employees, be directly responsible for the quantity or quality of work produced by other employees, be responsible for the assignment of overtime within the shop, be required to take attendance for other than purposes of making detailed work allocations, or be responsible for handing out paychecks. When authorized by the Company, a team leader may delegate a portion of his/her allocated work to employees in the team leader’s group.
Current leads will not lose grade or pay as a direct result of team leader assignments.
The parties agree to form a committee, consisting of an equal number of Company and Union Representatives. The committee will review the existing team leader selection process and discuss whether additional training should be provided to bargaining unit employees who seek Team

Leader assignments and/or to existing Team Leaders for skill enhancement. The committee will meet for the duration of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Letter of Understanding will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure in Article 19, with the exception of the seniority-based selection of recommended candidates. Additionally, nothing in this Letter of Understanding will alter or impact the Company’s right to select any bargaining unit employee for a temporary team leader assignment for a period of time not to exceed ninety (90) days. The following issues may be appealed by the Union through Step 3 of the grievance procedure set forth in Section 19.2 of the Agreement, but will not be subject to arbitration: (1) the Company’s decision to discontinue the assignment of any bargaining unit employee selected for a team leader position; (2) a team leader progress review; and (3) the duration of a temporary team leader assignment.

SUBJECT: MATERIALS DELIVERY AND INVENTORY PROCESS
The Company and the Union agree that parts, materials, tools, kits and other goods or products furnished by an internal or external supplier, vendor, contractor, or subcontractor may be delivered or presented to the Company at any location to be designated by the Company, including but not limited to local receiving areas, staging areas, parts control areas, materials and tool storage areas, and/or factory locations where parts or assemblies are installed. Such locations will be staffed, as necessary, with Company employees, including bargaining unit employees in classifications responsible for receiving and distribution, and job functions performed by employees that fall within bargaining unit job description(s) will continue to be performed by such bargaining unit employees.
On Commercial Airplane programs other than 787-Everett, internal and external suppliers, vendors, contractors, or subcontractors may, at the Company’s request, perform inventory transactions related to goods or products they are delivering or furnishing to the Company, with bargaining unit employees tracking use, disbursement, acquisition, and/or inventory of parts, materials, tools, kits, and other goods or products consistent with bargaining unit job descriptions.
The Company’s Materials Delivery Group Process Owner will consult with the Union Site Representatives on a monthly basis to discuss activities and issues related to the Materials Delivery and Inventory process and to discuss opportunities to improve the process, including the most efficient use of Boeing employees and resources and the implementation of new technology. Upon the Union’s request, the Company will conduct a quarterly review to discuss decisions or issues with the Materials Delivery and Inventory process from the previous quarter’s activity.
The parties will explore options for retraining or reassigning bargaining unit employees to equal level jobs when bargaining unit employees are impacted by the Company’s implementation of process and technology changes. In addition, forklift drivers (419 classification), MPRFs (614 classification), Factory Consumables Handlers (607 classification), Environmental Control Workers (HazMat - 855 classification), and Shipping/Distribution (611 classification) as of September 3, 2008 will not be laid off or removed from their job classification and grade as a result of the Materials Delivery and Inventory process.
Nothing in this Letter of Understanding will be construed to permit suppliers or vendors to install parts or components on the airplane, unless the vendors or suppliers are correcting errors or performing warranty work.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING NO. 38
SUBJECT: SI&A / MSE INFRASTRUCTURE, ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Self-Inspection and Acceptance (SI&A) / Manufacturing Self Examination (MSE) is the process of having the employee who made the product, or performed the task, also check the product or task data, and indicate that the product/task conforms to requirements. This is indicated by having the same employee stamp off his or her work as conforming to requirements.
In February, 2001, a joint IAM/Company committee was formed in an effort to facilitate resolution of issues and concerns regarding implementation and maintenance of SI&A programs. The committee’s charter was and is to work together to improve the SI&A implementation and maintenance process. As further described below, the committee will remain available as a resource to provide guidance and direction for the Site Representatives as necessary. This committee shall be referred to as the SI&A Leadership Committee.
The committee recommended changes to improve SI&A / MSE implementation and maintenance processes. It reviewed currently implemented areas and met with affected employees to establish some of the existing best practices and areas of concerns. This provided the insight to make improvements in several areas. The committee also developed and implemented improvements to our procedures and infrastructure for SI&A / MSE, and identified and documented the type of environment required to foster successful implementation. To accomplish those changes, the committee modified the procedures to provide criteria for implementation readiness evaluation, for monitoring progress to ensure sustainability of the program, and identification of the environmental factors that will lead to successful implementation of SI&A / MSE programs.
The primary purpose of this Letter is to define the roles, responsibilities and interaction within the SI&A / MSE infrastructure.
Site Representatives
Each site having implemented or that is in the process of implementing SI&A / MSE will have two (2) Site Representatives, one (1) from the Company and one (1) from the Union, to be appointed by their respective leadership. Additional Site Representatives may be added upon mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. These individuals should be (or be interested in becoming) an SI&A / MSE subject matter expert. It is expected that they will have completed all SI&A / MSE prerequisite courses and have had exposure to SI&A / MSE. They should have excellent conflict resolution and communication skills.

The Site Representatives’ primary responsibilities are to act as a resource to the employees, management, and area committees; to provide information and perform monitoring activities; to attend meetings and participate as required; and to resolve issues and concerns elevated to them by area committees. They will also help coordinate and participate in area SI&A / MSE overview presentations. They will need to stay informed of SI&A / MSE implementation progress and issues across BCAG & IDS as a network, to identify and spread “best practices” tools, and to encourage communication.
The Company will provide a reasonable amount of time for the Site Representatives to perform their required duties. As determined by the SI&A Leadership Committee, training and education requirements will be provided to the Site Representatives.
Area Management
Area management will provide active support for the implementation and maintenance of SI&A / MSE by fostering an environment that encourages engagement and supports the desired culture and values identified as keys for success.
Area Committees
The area committees have the primary responsibility for implementation and ongoing maintenance of SI&A / MSE in a specific shop or work area. The area committees should decide the meeting frequency and include at least the following functional representation: Quality & Manufacturing IAM members and management. Additional participants, such as Quality Engineering and Manufacturing Engineering, will be asked to participate as needed and determined by the Area Committee. The area manager and the Site Representative will work together to select area committee members. The active involvement of each of these team members is critical to success, and adequate time should be allowed to ensure this involvement takes place. The number of committee members should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the implementation work statement. Their responsibility is to work with Quality Engineering in assessment of the suitability of SI&A / MSE for the work area statement.
This assessment should include consideration of work content as well as current process capability and control. The area committee must ensure adequate employee involvement and understanding of the SI&A / MSE process. This includes addressing any concerns or issues and elevation of unresolved issues to the Site Representatives for assistance. The area committee will provide input and oversee the initial and ongoing employee training and assessment processes to ensure each individual’s skill and knowledge is adequate to perform the SI&A / MSE function and that any knowledge gaps are constructively addressed through additional training. Additionally, they may be involved in the development of training as 183

SUBJECT: WORK PLACEMENT
737 Work Placement.
The Union has inquired about the Company’s intentions to place production work on the 737MAX program in Puget Sound. Independently, the Company has been undertaking a thorough review of the 737MAX program, including options for locating such work. The Company has assessed those options in light of the economics set forth in its proposal to extend the current Collective Bargaining Agreement for four (4) years, and should those economics be achieved through a contract extension, the Company will locate the 737MAX production work in Puget Sound. With approval of the contract extension, the Company will produce the 737NG models and 737MAX models in Renton, to the extent such production can be feasibly completed in the current and existing 737 Renton production facilities. The fabrication work currently being performed by bargaining unit employees in support of the 737 production will be continued in their current and existing facilities in Puget Sound and Portland - again, to the extent such production can be feasibly completed in those current and existing facilities.
Wichita Tanker Work Placement.
In the event the Company decides to place Tanker production work currently performed in its Wichita facilities (or work of a similar type) in a location other than Wichita, the Company agrees that such Wichita Tanker production work will be performed in the Company’s current and existing facilities in Puget Sound.
P-8 Production Work Placement.
The Company will continue production of the P-8 program in the Company’s current and existing facilities in Puget Sound. The fabrication work currently being performed by bargaining unit employees in support of the P-8 production work in Puget Sound and Portland will be continued in their current and existing facilities in Puget Sound and Portland, to the extent such fabrication work can be feasibly completed in those current and existing facilities.
Everett Wide-Body Airplanes.
The Company intends to continue production of wide-body airplanes in its Everett facilities.
Supplier Warranty Work.
The amount of supplier warranty work required to be performed on 787 aircraft in inventory at Everett (e.g., PlaneTech employees performing supplier warranty work), is higher than anticipated due to incomplete

Eligibility
Eligible Employees
You are eligible for the Package if you are an active Boeing employee represented by one of the following International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, Collective Bargaining Agreements: Aerospace Industrial District Lodge No. 751, District Lodge No. 70, and District Lodge No. W24. You are not eligible to enroll if you are working in a capacity that, at the sole discretion of the plan administrator, is considered contract labor or independent contracting.
Eligible Dependents
Dependents eligible for the medical and dental plans are your legal spouse (as recognized under both applicable state law and the Internal Revenue Code) and children (natural children, adopted children, children legally placed with you for adoption, and stepchildren) who are under age 26, unmarried, and dependent on you for principal support.
You may request coverage for the following dependents:
•	An opposite-gender common-law spouse if the relationship meets the common-law requirements for the state where you entered into the common-law relationship.
•	A same-gender domestic partner if
-	You and your partner live in the same permanent residence in a permanent, exclusive, emotionally committed, and financially responsible relationship similar to a marriage.
-	Your partner is at least 18 years old, is not related to you by blood, is not married to or separated from another person or involved in another domestic partner relationship.
-	Your domestic partner relationship is not solely to obtain coverage under the Plan.
A same-gender domestic partner is considered a spouse for the purpose of the medical and dental plans.
Some states have laws that require insured health plans to offer coverage for certain registered domestic partners.
•	Unmarried children of your same-gender domestic partner who are under age 26 and dependent on you for principal support. These children are considered stepchildren for the purpose of the medical and dental plans.

•	Other children, as follows, who are under age 26, unmarried, and dependent on you for principal support:
-	Children who are related to you either directly or through marriage (e.g., grandchildren, nieces, nephews).
-	Children for whom you have legal custody or guardianship (or for whom you have a pending application for legal custody or guardianship) and are living with you.
Proof of dependent eligibility will be required.
In accordance with Federal law, the Company also provides medical and dental coverage to certain dependent children (called alternate recipients) if the Company is directed to do so by a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) issued by a court or state agency of competent jurisdiction.
Documentation is required to request coverage for dependents, including a child named in a QMCSO, a child for whom you have been given legal custody or guardianship, a spouse, or a same-gender domestic partner or his or her children. You must provide the Boeing Service Center with any required supporting documentation by the date specified by the Boeing Service Center or your request will be denied.
Special Provisions When Family Members Are Boeing Employees
If your spouse, same-gender domestic partner, or dependent child is employed by Boeing and eligible for any type of benefit plan offered by Boeing, your dependent must be covered separately under the plan or plans available to that dependent.
No person may be covered both as an employee (active or retired) and as a dependent under any type of plan offered by Boeing, and no person will be considered a dependent of more than 1 employee. Eligible dependents do not include other Boeing employees covered under any Company-sponsored plan providing medical, vision care, prescription drug, dental, or similar services. However, if your spouse is a part-time Boeing employee, retired, on approved leave of absence or layoff, or an employee of a subsidiary company, your spouse and eligible dependent children are considered eligible dependents if other Boeing coverage is waived. If you and your spouse both are Boeing employees and have dependent children, you both may elect medical and dental coverage for eligible children under 1 parent’s plans. As an alternative, parents may elect medical coverage for eligible children under 1 parent’s plan and dental coverage under the other parent’s plan. In either case, all eligible children must be enrolled in the same medical plan and the same dental plan (except as required by a QMCSO). The same provisions apply to a same-gender domestic partner and his or her children.

Special Enrollment Events

•	You or your dependent loses or becomes ineligible for other health care coverage because of an event such as loss of dependent status under another health care plan (through divorce, legal separation, termination of a same-gender domestic partnership, or dependent child reaching the limiting age), death, termination of employment, reduction in hours of employment, termination of employer contributions toward the coverage, elimination of coverage for the class of similarly situated employees or dependents, moving out of the plan’s service area with no other coverage available from the other health care plan, or reaching the lifetime limit on all benefits under the other health care plan.
•	You or your dependent becomes ineligible for Medicaid or a state Children’s Health Insurance Program and loses coverage; you or your dependent becomes eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or a state’s child health care plan.
•	You or your dependent exhausts any continuation coverage from another employer; that is, coverage provided under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (COBRA), ends.
•	You gain a new dependent because of marriage, entering a same-gender domestic partnership, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.
Note: For this purpose, “other health care coverage” does not include coverage through Medicare or Medicaid.

If you experience a special enrollment event, you can enroll yourself and/or your eligible dependents in a medical and/or dental plan as described above. You can enroll in any family status tier and any health plan option available to you.
Special enrollment is not available if you lose coverage because of failure to make timely premium payments or termination from the plan for cause (such as for making a fraudulent claim).
If you decline enrollment in the medical and dental plans because of other employer-sponsored health care coverage (such as through a spouse’s employer), you may be able to enroll yourself and eligible dependents in the Company-sponsored medical and dental plans during the year as long as enrollment is within 60 days after other coverage ends.
If you have a new dependent as a result of marriage, entering into a samegender domestic partner relationship, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may enroll the new dependent during the year as long as enrollment is requested within 120 days after the qualified event.
Qualified Status Changes
If you experience one of the qualified status changes listed below, you may be able to enroll in medical or dental coverage, change your current coverage, or drop your coverage midyear. Any change to your coverage must be consistent with the status change that affects your or your dependent’s eligibility for Company-sponsored health care coverage or health care coverage sponsored by your eligible dependent’s employer.
Qualified status changes are the following events:
•	You marry, divorce, or become legally separated, or the marriage is annulled.
•	You enter into or dissolve a same-gender domestic partner relationship.
•	You acquire a new, eligible dependent child, such as by birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.
•	Your spouse or same-gender domestic partner or dependent child dies.
•	You or your spouse or same-gender domestic partner or dependent child starts or stops working.
•	You or your spouse or same-gender domestic partner or dependent child has any other change in employment status that affects eligibility for coverage such as changing from full time to part time (or part time to full time), salaried to hourly (or hourly to salaried), strike or lockout, a transfer between a nonunion salaried position and a union-represented position, or beginning or returning from an unpaid leave of absence,

or a dependent child’s birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. To request enrollment for a new dependent more than 60 days but within 120 days after marriage, entering into a same-gender domestic partner relationship, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you must call the Boeing Service Center and speak with a customer service representative. You must provide the Boeing Service Center with any required supporting documentation by the date specified by the Boeing Service Center or your request will be denied.
Effective Date of Coverage
Employees
If you are a newly hired employee, the Package becomes effective as follows:
•	Medical and dental coverage becomes effective on the first day of the month following your first day of employment.
•	Life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability, and survivor income coverage becomes effective on the first day of the month following your first day of employment, provided you are actively at work on that date.
You must be on the active payroll on the first day of the month.
For coverage during a leave of absence, see the Leaves of Absence section.
Dependents
Current eligible dependents are covered for medical and dental benefits on the same date your coverage is effective. Eligible dependents acquired after your coverage is effective become covered on the date of marriage or entering into a same-gender domestic partner relationship, date of birth, or date the child is legally placed with you for adoption, if application is made within 120 days of the event. For other newly eligible dependents, coverage is effective on the date dependency is established, if application is made within 60 days.
You authorize required contributions when enrolling eligible dependents.
Life Insurance Plan
The life insurance benefit is $32,000. The total amount is payable in the event of your death from any cause at any time or place while covered. Payment is made in a lump sum or installments to the designated beneficiary. You may change beneficiaries at any time by contacting the Boeing Service Center.
If you become permanently and totally disabled for longer than 6 full calendar months at any time before age 60 and while covered under the 202

plan, the life insurance benefit is paid as a permanent and total disability benefit in monthly installments of $500 beginning the first day of the month after the service representative receives proof of the disability. The disability must have existed continuously for 6 months and be expected to keep you, for life, from performing any work for compensation or profit. The installments continue while you remain totally and permanently disabled until the life insurance benefit, with interest on the unpaid balance, is exhausted. (The final installment is for the balance of the fund.) If you die while entitled to receive this monthly benefit, your beneficiary receives the balance of the life insurance benefit and the accrued interest credited to date of death in a lump sum. Separate periods of total disability resulting from the same or related causes and separated by less than 30 days of active work are considered one period of total disability.
If you recover and return to work, the unpaid installments plus accrued interest to date are reinstated as the total life insurance benefit. Payments for a subsequent disability are limited to this reduced amount.
If you recover but do not return to work, all coverage terminates. You may then convert the total unpaid installments plus accrued interest under the conversion of benefits provision.
The rate of interest allowed on the unpaid balance is the rate for special settlement methods under the individual life insurance policies issued by the service representative.
Proof of disability must be furnished within 12 months of the date active work ends.
If you are hired or rehired on or after January 3, 2014, and you are not a participant in The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan (BCERP), the Company will provide a $15,000 disability insurance benefit in the event you become disabled and satisfy the conditions that would otherwise have qualified for a disability retirement benefit under the BCERP. You will not be eligible for this disability insurance benefit if you are eligible for any disability retirement benefit under the BCERP.
Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan
Accidental death and dismemberment benefits are provided if your loss of life, paralysis, or loss of hand, foot, eyesight, hearing, or speech is caused by a covered accident (including an occupational accident) that occurs while you are covered under the plan.
The full principal sum, $32,000, is paid to your beneficiary if you die. This amount is in addition to any amount payable under the group life insurance coverage.

If you sustain more than 1 loss as the result of the same accident, no more than 100% of the principal sum will be paid.
If you are unavoidably exposed to the elements due to an accident occurring while covered under this plan, and as a result of such exposure suffer a loss for which a benefit is otherwise payable, the loss will be covered under the terms of this plan.
If your body has not been found within 1 year of the disappearance, forced landing, stranding, sinking, or wrecking of a vehicle in which you were an occupant while covered under this plan, the loss will be covered as an accidental death under the terms of the plan.
No plan benefits will be paid for a death or loss caused in whole or in part by, or resulting in whole or in part from:
•	Suicide or intentionally self-inflicted injury.
•	Declared or undeclared war or act of declared or undeclared war occurring in the continental limits of the United States, unless it is an act of terrorism.
(“Terrorism” means any violent act intended to cause injury, damage, or fear and committed by or purportedly committed by one or more individuals or members of an organized group to make a statement of the individual’s or group’s political or social beliefs, concepts, or attitudes and/or to intimidate a population or government into granting the individual’s or group’s demands.)
•	An illness, sickness, disease, bodily or mental infirmity, medical or surgical treatment, or bacterial or viral infection, regardless of how contracted, except bacterial infection resulting from an accidental cut or wound or accidental food poisoning. However, if a covered loss results from medical or surgical treatment of an injury, benefits will be provided for the loss.
Short-Term Disability Plan
Benefits are paid for disabilities due to pregnancy-related conditions, illness, and accidental injuries on or off the job. Disabled means you are unable to perform the essential functions of your regular occupation or other appropriate work Boeing makes available as a result of a pregnancy-related condition, illness, or accidental injury (on or off the job).
205
1 The following schedules state the benefit amounts, classes of disability, and 2 the maximum period of payment. Benefit amounts are determined by your 3 labor grade.

A-1-2-3	$280.00	$140.00
4-5-6-7	300.00	150.00

9	retroactive to the first day of the disability.
10	No benefits are payable for any period during which you are not under the
11	regular care of a physician. To receive benefits according to the schedule,
12	you must be seen by a physician within the first 7 days of disability;
13	otherwise benefits begin on the date you are actually seen and treated. For
14	this benefit, physician refers to a legally qualified, licensed physician, with
15	a course of treatment that is consistent with the diagnosis of the disabling
16	condition and according to guidelines established by medical, research, and
17	rehabilitation organizations. All determinations of total disability are made
18	by the service representative within the terms of its contract with the

An increase or decrease in your short-term disability coverage amount is effective the first day of the month following or coinciding with a change in labor grade. If you are both disabled and away from work on the date an increase or decrease would be effective, the change is delayed until you return to an active work schedule.
Reinstatement of Benefits
•	Benefits are reinstated after a period of disability when you return to active work for at least 30 consecutive days.
•	If you are absent due to the same or a related disability during this 30-day period, benefits are not reinstated. However, you are eligible for any benefits remaining from the original 26-week period on the first day of the subsequent disability.
•	If you return to active employment for at least 1 full day and the subsequent disability is due to entirely different and unrelated causes from the prior disability, you are considered as having started a new period of disability.
Income Tax Withholding
Short-term disability payments are reported to the Federal government and may be considered taxable income. Income tax will be withheld if required by law.
Social Security (FICA) withholding is made from employee disability payments and reported to the government. The amount is the current FICA withholding rate. This withholding is required by law and is matched by the employer.
Survivor Income Plan
If you die from any cause, at any time or place, while covered under the plan, survivor income benefits are payable to eligible survivors, as listed below. Survivor income benefits are composed of transition benefits and bridge benefits.
Transition Benefit
The transition benefit is $210 per month for any month the survivor receives either no Social Security benefits or Social Security benefits reduced solely because of age. If the survivor receives unreduced Social Security benefits, the transition benefit is $140 per month.
The transition benefit is paid for a maximum of 24 months to these survivors, in the following priority:
•	Your widow or widower lawfully married to you.

•	Your unmarried child or children under age 25 if living with and dependent on you for at least 50% of their support during the year immediately preceding your death. The child continues to be eligible regardless of age if totally and permanently disabled and living with and dependent on you.
•	Your parents or parent if dependent on you for at least 50% of their support in the year before your death.
Benefits begin the first day of the month following the date you die and are payable on the first day of each month thereafter. Benefits are divided equally where 2 or more persons are to receive the benefits. If there are no qualified survivors, no benefits are paid.
Bridge Benefit
After transition benefits are paid, if your eligible spouse was at least age 50 at the time of your death, monthly payments of $210 are made to your spouse while living and unmarried until the earliest of these dates:
•	Your spouse remarries.
•	Your spouse reaches age 62.
•	Full widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits under the Federal Social Security Act become payable.
However, if your surviving spouse is eligible to receive mother’s or father’s insurance benefits under the Social Security Act, monthly payments are deferred until your spouse stops receiving mother’s or father’s insurance benefits.
Medical Plans
The Company-sponsored medical plan is the Traditional Medical Plan. Where appropriate, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Coordinated Care Plans (CCPs) will be offered to retirees and their dependents in addition to the Traditional Medical Plan.

See “Covered Medical Services and Supplies” for more details on benefits.
Out-of-Pocket Maximums
For some services, you are required to pay a certain percent of charges, called out-of-pocket expenses.
When your out-of-pocket expenses (or when your family members’ combined out-of-pocket expenses) reach the annual out-of-pocket maximum, most other benefits are paid at 100% of usual and customary charges for the rest of that benefit year, up to any maximum benefit amounts.
The following expenses do not count toward the out-of-pocket maximums:
•	Any balance remaining after a benefit maximum has been reached.
•	Benefits paid at a reduced amount or denied when you fail to follow medical review program procedures and requirements.
•	Covered medical services for TMJ/MPDS treatment.
•	Covered medical services for treatment of mental illness or substance abuse.
•	Covered services for tobacco cessation.
•	Covered medical services paid at 100% of usual and customary charges or in full.
•	Deductibles.
•	Expenses for services or supplies not covered by the plan.
•	Hospital emergency room copayments.
•	Office visit copayments.
•	The difference between usual and customary charges and the provider’s actual charge.

any licensed provider covered under the plan, the plan offers certain advantages if a network provider is used.
The contracts with network providers include direct billing and payment systems. This means you do not need to submit a claim form when a network provider is used.
Nonnetwork Providers
Covered services obtained from nonnetwork physicians, hospitals, and other covered health care providers in a license category eligible to participate in the network (for example, M.D.s) are paid according to whether network providers are available in that location.
Providers in a Category Not Eligible to Participate in the Network
Certain types of providers may or may not be network providers depending on their location. The plan may not have network contracts with providers in a specific category in a particular location (such as podiatrists or chiropractors in certain locations).
Medical Review Program
The medical review program lets you and your physician know whether certain types of nonemergency care will be covered under the plan before the care is provided and the expense is incurred.
The plan pays regular benefits for certain types of nonemergency care only if the medical review program is contacted before care is received. Benefits may be limited or denied if these requirements are not followed.
Medical review program requirements do not apply if primary coverage is provided through another employer’s group medical plan.

Although contacting the program is not required before emergency or pregnancy-related admissions, you or your physician should contact the program soon after admission to be assured whether the rest of the confinement is covered. Hospital preadmission review for childbirth is not required for a mother and newborn for the first 48 hours following a normal delivery or 96 hours following a cesarean section.
Voluntary Second Surgical Opinion
The plan encourages you to get a second opinion before having any nonemergency surgery.
A second (or third) surgical opinion will be covered under the network/nonnetwork provider payment levels, subject to the plan’s copayments and/or deductibles and coinsurance.
Individual Case Management
In the event of a severe or long-term illness or injury, the service representative assists your network provider in identifying treatment alternatives that offer cost-effective care and enhancements to quality of life.
Covered Medical Services and Supplies
In general, the plan covers medically necessary services and supplies used to diagnose or treat a nonoccupational accidental injury or illness as well as medically appropriate services and supplies for certain types of preventive care and other conditions, up to plan limits.
Acupuncture
The plan covers medically necessary acupuncture for a covered illness or in place of covered anesthesia. Treatment must be provided by a licensed acupuncturist (L.A.C.), doctor of medicine (M.D.), or doctor of osteopathy (D.O.). You can contact the service representative to determine if acupuncture is covered for a particular condition.
Ambulance
Professional ambulance services are covered to transport you from the place where you are injured or become ill to the first hospital where treatment is given. These services also are covered when the physician requires an ambulance to transport you to a hospital in your area of residence to protect your health or life. Air ambulance transportation is covered when medically necessary.
Ambulance service from one hospital to another, including return, is covered only if the facility is the nearest one with appropriate regional specialized treatment facilities, equipment, or staff physicians.

Centers of Excellence
The plan offers a higher level of benefits for covered transplants and/or bariatric (weight loss) surgery at approved Centers of Excellence—facilities that specialize in a particular treatment. When you use a Center of Excellence, your eligible expenses will be paid at 100 percent. This means you will not be required to pay coinsurance. The deductible still applies where applicable. If you must travel a minimum of 75 miles from your residence to use a Center of Excellence, the plan also offers certain travel benefits. For additional information about this program, including facilities that qualify for the higher benefit level, call the member services number on the back of your medical plan ID card.
Christian Science Sanatorium
Charges for a semiprivate room in a sanatorium are covered if you are admitted for the process of healing (not rest or study) and are under the care of an authorized Christian Science practitioner. If a private room in a sanatorium is used, you are responsible for the difference between the charge for the private room and the sanatorium’s average charge for a semiprivate room. If the facility provides only private rooms, the plan covers up to the charge for semiprivate rooms in similar local facilities.
A Christian Science sanatorium is a facility that, at the time of the healing treatment, is operated (or listed) and certified by the First Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston, Massachusetts.
Congenital Abnormalities and Hereditary Complications
Medically necessary services and supplies are covered when required for the treatment of congenital abnormalities and hereditary complications. This coverage applies to newborn children as well as to all other persons covered under the plan.

The plan covers necessary services and supplies for cosmetic surgery only if the surgery is required for the prompt repair of an accidental injury or improvement of function due to congenital abnormality. All other surgery performed for cosmetic purposes is excluded, except as specifically provided for treatment after a mastectomy (see “Reconstructive Breast Surgery”).
Dental Repair of Accidental Injury
Services and supplies for the prompt repair of sound natural teeth or other body tissues as a result of an accidental injury are covered, but only to the extent they are not covered by your Company-sponsored dental plan. This may include surgical procedures of the jaw, cheek, lips, tongue, and other parts of the mouth and treatment of fractures in the facial bones (maxilla or mandible).

•	Able to withstand repeated use.
•	Solely for the treatment or improvement of a critical function related to the medical condition.
•	Appropriate for use in the home.
Examples of covered durable medical equipment are crutches, wheelchairs, kidney dialysis equipment, standard hospital beds, oxygen equipment, and diabetic supplies and equipment such as blood glucose monitors, insulin infusion devices, and insulin pumps. Covered equipment must not be useful to a person in the absence of the medical condition.
The repair or replacement of durable medical equipment due to normal usage or change in the patient’s condition, including growth of a child, also is covered.
Emergency Room
Emergency room treatment at either a network or nonnetwork facility is paid at the network level if it is a medical emergency. A patient admitted to a nonnetwork hospital retains emergency status (and benefits are paid at the network level) for 24 hours or until the patient can be transferred safely to a network facility. However, for care at a nonnetwork facility when the condition is not a medical emergency, covered services are paid at the nonnetwork level.

•	Insulin-dependent diabetes.
•	Major pelvic surgery.
•	Peripheral neuropathy or autonomic insufficiency.

Hemodialysis
The plan covers repetitive hemodialysis treatment for chronic, irreversible kidney disease. Covered services and supplies include the rental, lease, or (under certain conditions) purchase of hemodialysis equipment. Purchase of specific supplies is contingent on the supplies having no real utility to the patient in the absence of the disease and having no value to other household members. Coverage of the purchase of equipment is subject to specific conditions, including an amortization period, decided by the service representative.
Hemodialysis treatment and equipment are covered by the plan for the first 30 months following Medicare entitlement due to end-stage renal disease. After this 30-month period, Medicare provides primary coverage and the plan provides secondary coverage.
Home Health Care
Medically necessary home health care visits and supplies are covered if inpatient care in a hospital or skilled nursing facility otherwise would be required. In addition, you must be considered homebound, which means leaving home involves a considerable and taxing effort and public transportation cannot be used without the help of another.
Home health care requires prior approval; see “Medical Review Program”. Before receiving home health care, the attending physician must provide a written treatment plan (a written program for continued care and treatment).

•	Consistent with the condition’s symptom or diagnosis and treatment.
•	Not able to be provided safely in an outpatient setting (for an inpatient service or supply).

Prescription Drug Program
The prescription drug program described in this section is available to employees and dependents enrolled in the Traditional Medical Plan.
This program offers 2 coverage options for prescription drugs and medicines:
•	Retail pharmacy card program—you can use the pharmacy card to obtain covered prescriptions from a participating retail pharmacy.
•	Mail service program—called Medco By Mail.
A formulary applies to all retail pharmacy and mail order purchases. (A formulary is a list of drugs determined to be effective in both cost and treatment and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A nonformulary drug also may be effective for treatment, but is not as costeffective as formulary or generic drugs. A group of practicing physicians and pharmacists routinely reviews drugs to include in the formulary. If clinical data show several drugs are equally effective, the most costeffective drug usually is chosen. The formulary may change from time to time.)
There are 3 categories of prescription drug purchases:
•	Generic—drugs that are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts but usually cost less.
•	Brand-name formulary—brand-name drugs selected for the formulary based on cost and effectiveness.
•	Brand-name nonformulary—brand-name drugs not selected for the formulary.
The program includes utilization management services and generic incentives (see “Pharmacy Management” and “Member Pay the Difference Generic Incentive Program” below) to help ensure cost-effective, clinically appropriate treatment.

Network Dental Plan
Note: Effective July 1, 2012, the Incentive Dental Plan will be replaced with the Network Dental Plan, as described here.
The Network Dental Plan described in this section is available to active employees and their dependents. This plan also helps you pay for minor and major dental work, including fillings, crowns, dentures, bridges, and orthodontic services.
You and your covered dependents may receive dental care from any licensed dentist or other licensed professional who is approved by the plan. However, your out-of-pocket costs generally will be lower if you use a network dentist.

*	When multiple treatment dates are required, the charges apply toward the annual maximum benefit for the benefit year in which the procedure is completed. (A prosthesis is considered complete on the date it is seated or delivered.)
*	* This lifetime maximum benefit for orthodontia applies to all periods during which the person is covered under any Company-sponsored dental plan.
You and your dependents are responsible for paying all charges for services and supplies the plan does not cover.
Annual Deductible
Generally, the annual deductible is the amount you must pay out of your own pocket each benefit year before the plan begins to pay benefits. The annual deductible applies to most covered services but not all. The following network diagnostic and preventive care services and supplies are excluded from the annual deductible:
•	Cleanings (prophylaxis).
•	Examinations.
•	Fissure sealants.
•	Fluoride treatment.
•	X-rays.
Orthodontia (Class IV) also is excluded from the annual deductible.
This means that the plan begins to pay its coinsurance percentage immediately for these basic dental services. The coinsurance percentage you pay for these services does not count toward your annual deductible.
This plan has an individual annual deductible and a family annual deductible. If you and 3 or more of your dependents are covered under the plan, the family annual deductible limits the total annual deductible you are required to pay in any benefit year.
The annual deductibles are shown in the “Network Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.”
Coinsurance Percentages
For many services and supplies, you and the plan each pay a percentage of the recognized fee. These percentages are called coinsurance percentages.
Generally, except for certain diagnostic and preventive Class I services and supplies, you must first satisfy the entire annual deductible before the plan pays its coinsurance percentage.
A coinsurance percentage does not apply to

•	Class I services and supplies received from network providers.
•	Any amounts you pay for services that the plan does not cover.
•	Any amounts that exceed the maximum allowable fees recognized by the plan.
Coinsurance percentages are shown in the “Network Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.”
Benefit Maximums
For Classes I, II, and III, an annual maximum applies to each covered person. The annual maximum amount is shown in the “Network Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.” You are responsible for paying any charges over the annual maximum benefit.
For Class IV, a lifetime maximum benefit applies to each covered person. The lifetime maximum benefit amount is shown in the “Network Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.”
Recognized Fees
This plan pays benefits based on recognized fees. A recognized fee is the provider’s charge for a covered service, up to the plan’s maximum allowance. The amount of the recognized fee depends on whether you see a network or nonnetwork provider.
Under this plan, recognized fees are determined as follows:
•	For a network dentist, recognized fees are network allowed charges.
•	For a nonnetwork dentist who is a contracted member dentist with Washington Dental Service, recognized fees are the fees that the dentist filed with the service representative for specific dental services and supplies.
•	For a nonnetwork dentist who is a nonmember, recognized fees are the lesser of either
-	The amount charged by the dentist.
-	The maximum fee that the service representative approved for nonmember dentists in the state where services are performed.
When alternative procedures are available, the plan covers the least expensive procedure. However, if your dentist submits satisfactory evidence to the service representative that a more expensive procedure is the only one professionally adequate for you, the plan covers the more expensive procedure according to the appropriate benefit payment level.

How Dental Coverage May Be Extended
The plan generally does not cover services or supplies that you receive while you are not covered under the plan. However, the plan will cover certain services and supplies for an additional three months after the date coverage would otherwise end. These services and supplies and the conditions for extending care are described below:
•	A crown that is required to restore a tooth (independent of the crown’s use in connection with a partial denture) if the tooth is prepared for the crown while you are covered. If the tooth is prepared after your coverage ends, your dentist must have documented the need, such as by requesting a pretreatment estimate, before your coverage ended.
•	A prosthetic device (including abutment crowns of a partial denture), if the impressions are taken while you are covered, and the device is installed or delivered within 3 months after your coverage ends. If the impressions are taken after your coverage ends, your dentist must have documented the need, such as by requesting a pretreatment estimate, before your coverage ended.
•	Orthodontia care provided within 3 calendar months after your coverage ends.
•	Restorative, endodontic, periodontic, and oral surgical procedures completed within 3 months after your coverage ends. If the services start after your coverage ends, your dentist must have documented the need, such as by requesting a pretreatment estimate, before your coverage ended.
Prepaid Dental Plan
The Prepaid Dental Plan benefits will be as follows:
Provider Selection
Participating providers offer complete dental care to you and your dependents. You must select a participating provider when you enroll in the Prepaid Dental Plan. All covered dental services, except orthodontic and out-of-area emergency care, are provided by this selected provider.
If you wish to transfer to another participating provider, you must contact the service representative. An approved transfer is effective the first day of the month following the service representative’s receipt of the change request.
Orthodontic care may be obtained from any licensed dentist.
Plan Payment Levels and Maximum Benefits
The plan provides all necessary covered dental services at no cost to employees and eligible dependents except as specified below.

•	The plan pays 50% of usual and customary orthodontic charges, to a $2,000 lifetime maximum benefit during all periods the eligible person is covered under the plan.
•	The plan pays up to $50 of reasonable charges for out-of-area emergency services and supplies.
Out-of-Area Emergencies
The plan pays an out-of-area emergency benefit for dental services and supplies provided by a licensed dentist other than your selected participating provider.
Out-of-area means the covered person is more than 50 miles from the selected participating provider. The plan pays reasonable charges for these services and supplies, without prior approval, to a maximum of $50. Payment for out-of-area emergencies is made only if all these conditions apply:
•	The dental care is provided by a dentist outside the plan’s service area.
•	The service or supply is covered under the plan.
•	The dental care is required for an acute condition and is provided solely for the immediate relief of that condition.
•	The patient could not have been reasonably expected to go to the selected participating provider for the care.
Coordination of Benefits
If you or your dependent has medical, dental, or other health coverage in addition to being covered under these medical and dental plans, the following rules govern coordination of benefits with the other coverage. Other coverage includes, whether insured or uninsured, another employer’s group benefit plan, other arrangement of individuals in a group, Medicare (to the extent allowed by law), individual insurance or health coverage, and insurance that pays without consideration of fault.
The service representative has the right to obtain and release any information or recover any payment it considers necessary to administer these provisions.
Order of Payment
The primary plan pays its benefits first and pays its benefits without regard to benefits that may be payable under other plans. When another plan is the primary plan for health care coverage, the secondary plan pays the difference between the benefits paid by the primary plan and what would have been paid had the secondary plan been primary.
•	A plan is considered primary if

-	It has no order of benefit determination rules.
-	It has benefit determination rules that differ from coordination of benefit rules under state regulations or, if not insured, that differ from these rules.
-	All plans that cover an individual use the same coordination of benefit rules, and under those rules, the plan is primary.
• If the aforementioned rules do not determine which group plan is considered primary, this plan applies the following coordination of benefit rules:
-	A plan that covers a person as an employee, retiree, member, or subscriber pays before a plan that covers the person as a dependent.
-	A plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee is primary. The plan that covers a person as a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee or as a dependent of a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee is secondary.
-	If a dependent child is covered under both parents’ group plans, the child’s primary coverage is provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year, with secondary coverage provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes later in the calendar year.
-	If a dependent child’s parents are divorced or separated and a court decree establishes financial responsibility for the health care coverage of the child, the plan of the parent with such financial responsibility is the primary plan of coverage. If the divorce decree is silent on the issue of coverage, the following guidelines are used:
o The plan of the parent with custody pays benefits first.
o The plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays second.
o The plan of the parent without custody pays third.
o The plan of the spouse of the parent without custody pays fourth.
-	If none of the aforementioned rules establishes which group plan should pay first, then the plan that has covered the person for the longest period is considered the primary plan of coverage.
-	Continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as amended, always is secondary to other coverage, except as required by law.
-	If an employee or dependent is confined to a hospital when first becoming covered under this plan, this plan is secondary to any plan already covering the employee or dependent for the eligible expenses related to that hospital admission. If the employee or dependent does

not have other coverage for hospital and related expenses, this plan is primary.
Benefits under a Company-sponsored medical or dental plan are not coordinated with benefits paid under any other group plan offered by the Company. You can receive benefits from only 1 Company-sponsored medical or dental plan. However, when dental services performed by a licensed dentist also are covered under the medical plan, the dental plan pays its benefits first and the medical plan is secondary.
Federal rules govern coordination of benefits with Medicare. In most cases, Medicare is secondary to a plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee. Medicare is primary in most other circumstances.
Traditional Medical Plan
The primary plan pays benefits without regard to any other plan. When the Company-sponsored plan is secondary, it adjusts benefits so that the total payable under both plans for expenses covered under the Company-sponsored plan is not more than would be payable under the Company-sponsored plan. Neither plan pays more than it would without coordination of benefits.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under individual insurance, group insurance, or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis.
Treatment of end-stage renal disease is covered by the Company-sponsored plan for the first 30 months following Medicare entitlement due to endstage renal disease, and Medicare provides secondary coverage. After this 30-month period, Medicare provides primary coverage and the Company-sponsored plan provides secondary coverage.
Network Dental Plan
Benefits payable under the Company-sponsored dental plan take into account any coverage (including orthodontic coverage) you or your eligible dependents have under other plans.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under group insurance or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis. However, plan excludes any medical plan sponsored by the Company. This means the dental plan pays first when dental expenses performed by a dentist also are covered by any medical plan sponsored by the Company.

The dental plan pays regular benefits in full or a reduced amount which, when added to benefits payable by another plan, equals 100% of allowable expenses.
When an Injury or Illness Is Caused by the Negligence of Another
In some situations, you or a covered dependent may be eligible to receive, as a result of an accident or illness, health care benefits from an automobile insurance policy, homeowner’s insurance policy or other type of insurance policy, or from a responsible third party. In these cases, this plan will pay benefits if the covered person agrees to cooperate with the service representative in administering the plan’s recovery rights.
If a person covered by this plan is injured by another party who is legally liable for the medical or dental bills, he or she may request this plan to pay its regular benefit on his or her behalf. In exchange, the covered person agrees to:
•	Notify the plan within 30 days of giving notice to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of the covered person’s intention to pursue a claim.
•	Complete a claim and submit all bills related to the injury or illness to the responsible party or any insurer.
•	Complete and submit all of the necessary information requested by the service representative.
•	Reimburse the plan from any payment he or she receives from the responsible party or any other source.
•	Allow the plan to be subrogated to all rights of recovery a covered person has against the responsible party or any other source and to cooperate with the service representative’s efforts to recover from the responsible party or any other source any amounts this plan pays in benefits related to the injury or illness, including any lawsuit brought against the responsible party or insurer.
•	Grant the plan a lien in the amount of benefits paid which can be enforced against any source of funds available to compensate the covered person for injury or illness caused by another party.
This provision applies whenever you or a covered dependent is entitled to or receives benefits under this plan and is also entitled to or receives compensation or any other funds from another party in connection with that same medical condition, whether by insurance, litigation, settlement, or otherwise. The plan is entitled to such funds to the extent of plan benefits paid to or on behalf of the individual as a first-priority right, whether or not the individual has been “made whole,” and without regard to any common

fund doctrine. The plan is entitled to such funds regardless of whether the plan’s benefits are identified as being included in the funds and regardless of whether liability for payment of the funds is admitted by the responsible party or any other source of the funds. This plan may recover such funds by constructive trust, equitable lien, right of subrogation, reimbursement, or any other remedy allowed under applicable law.
The covered person shall do nothing to prejudice the plan’s subrogation or recovery interest, including, but not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan. If an individual fails, refuses, or neglects to reimburse the plan or otherwise comply with the requirements of this provision, or if payments are made under the plan based on fraudulent information or otherwise in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the provisions of the plan, then, in addition to all other remedies and rights of recovery that the plan may have, the plan has the right to terminate or suspend benefit payments and/or recover the reimbursement due to the plan by withholding, offsetting, and recovering such amount out of any future plan benefits or amounts otherwise due from the plan to or with respect to such individual. The plan also has the right in any proceeding at law or equity to assert a constructive trust, equitable lien, or any other remedy or recovery allowed under applicable law, against any and all persons or entities who have assets that the plan can claim rights to. The plan has a first-priority right of recovery from any judgment, settlement or other payment, regardless of whether the individual has been “made whole,” and without regard to any common fund doctrine.
In the event that any claim is made that any part of this subrogation and recovery provision is ambiguous or questions arise concerning the meaning or intent of any of its terms, the plan or service representative shall have the sole authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of this provision.
Termination of Coverage
Life Insurance Coverage
Life insurance coverage stops on the date your active employment terminates.
Within 31 days after you terminate employment, by making application and paying the first premium to the plan’s insurer, you may convert life insurance coverage to an individual life insurance policy on any regular whole life insurance plan. This individual policy will be issued, without medical examination, at the insurer’s regular rates. The amount of life insurance converted cannot exceed the amount in force on the date insurance terminates.

If, after an individual conversion policy is issued, benefits under the Life Insurance Plan are payable due to permanent and total disability, the individual policy must be surrendered without claim other than the return of paid premiums.
If your death occurs within 31 days after your coverage ends, a life insurance benefit is payable equal to the amount you could have converted to an individual policy.
Accidental Death and Dismemberment and Survivor Income Coverage
Accidental death and dismemberment and survivor income coverage stops on the date your active employment terminates.
Short-Term Disability Coverage
Short-term disability coverage stops at the end of the calendar month your active employment terminates.
Medical Coverage
Medical coverage for you and your dependents stops at the end of the calendar month your active employment terminates or the end of the last month required contributions are paid, whichever occurs first. If earlier, your dependent’s coverage stops at the end of the month in which he or she no longer qualifies as a dependent.
However, coverage may be continued under certain circumstances as specified below. Any required contributions must be paid during these periods for coverage to continue.
If you are terminating employment, the service representative will make available an individual program of medical benefits similar to those then being issued for group conversion. The benefits provided under the individual plan will not exactly duplicate the benefits provided under this group medical plan. This conversion privilege is also available to your covered dependents who cease to qualify under the group policy and to surviving covered dependents if you die. No evidence of insurability is required.
Dental Coverage
Dental coverage for you and your dependents stops at the end of the calendar month your active employment terminates. If earlier, your dependent’s coverage stops at the end of the calendar month in which he or she no longer qualifies as a dependent.
However, coverage may be continued under certain circumstances as specified below. Any required contributions must be paid during these periods for coverage to continue.

Retirement
If you are eligible for, and enroll in, the Retiree Medical Plan, medical coverage for you and your dependents ends at the end of the month following the month in which your active employment ends.
Change in Eligible Class of Employment
When you remain employed by the Company but no longer in the class eligible for coverage under this Package, coverage for you and your dependents stops at the end of the month in which your transfer is effective. If you become totally disabled before coverage ends under the Package, the life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability, and survivor income benefits of the Package, which would have continued if you had stayed in the eligible class, will continue according to the terms governing benefits during leaves of absence instead of all other Company life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability benefits.
Continuation of Medical and Dental Coverage (COBRA)
If medical and dental coverage for you and your dependents (including a same-gender domestic partner and his or her children) otherwise would terminate due to one of the following reasons, these benefits may continue for specified periods under Public Law 99-272, Title X, as amended, if the individual makes a timely request to the Company and pays the required contribution.
•	Reduction in hours or termination of employment for any reason.
•	Your death.
•	Your divorce or dissolution of a same-gender domestic partner relationship.
•	A dependent child ceasing to be a dependent as defined under this Package. (A child eligible to be continued under the Package’s incapacitated child provision will still be considered to have dependent status.)
•	Your dependent’s loss of eligibility because you became eligible for Medicare.
If you are laid off, the Company will contribute to the cost of COBRA medical coverage for you and your dependents. Company contributions will continue at the same rate as for active employees until you are covered by any other group medical plan either as an active employee or as a dependent, but in no event beyond the expiration of the COBRA period or 6 months after the date of layoff, whichever occurs first.
If you die (other than from an industrial accident), the Company will contribute to the cost of your dependents’ COBRA medical and dental coverage for up to 12 months. Your dependents’ contributions for the first

12 months of COBRA medical and dental coverage will be the same as for dependents of active employees.
If you die from an industrial accident, the Company will contribute to the cost of your dependents’ COBRA medical and dental coverage for up to 36 months. Your dependents’ contributions for COBRA medical and dental coverage will be the same as for dependents of active employees.
Leaves of Absence
When you are absent with leave, coverage may continue as follows; any required contributions must be paid during these periods for coverage to continue.
Approved Medical Leaves of Absence
If you are eligible for coverage and begin an approved medical leave of absence due to a total disability, you are eligible for the Package the same as an active employee until the last day of the calendar month in which your leave began. (Your eligible dependents also are eligible for medical and dental benefits.)
If you are totally disabled and remain on an approved medical leave of absence that extends beyond this period, your life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability, survivor income, medical, and dental benefits (and dependent medical and dental benefits) continue up to 6 full consecutive calendar months during the approved medical leave with Company contributions.
If the approved medical leave extends beyond this 6-month period due to continuous total disability, your medical coverage continues for up to an additional 24 months with Company contributions. Medical coverage ends earlier if you become eligible for Medicare or are no longer considered totally disabled. You also may continue the life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, survivor income, and dental benefits (and medical and dental benefits for eligible dependents) during this time by paying 100% of the cost of coverage on or before the tenth day of the month in which they are due.
If you or your covered dependent is considered disabled by Social Security during the seventh or eighth month of the absence, you may continue medical and dental coverage for yourself and eligible dependents for up to 5 additional months by paying 150% of the cost of coverage.
Medical and dental coverage continued after the sixth calendar month of medical leave is considered COBRA continuation coverage.

Other Approved Leaves of Absence
If you are eligible for coverage and begin an approved leave of absence, you are eligible for the Package the same as an active employee until the last day of the calendar month in which your leave began. (Your eligible dependents also are eligible for medical and dental benefits.)
If the approved leave extends beyond this time, your life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, short-term disability, survivor income, medical, and dental benefits (and dependent medical and dental benefits) continue for up to 3 full consecutive calendar months with Company contributions.
After this 3-month period, you may continue medical and dental coverage for up to an additional 21 months by self-paying 100% of the cost of coverage; this is considered COBRA continuation coverage. You also may continue life insurance coverage for the duration of the approved leave of absence by self-paying 100% of the cost of coverage.
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
If the required coverage for family and medical leaves of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is more generous than that already described in this section, the Company provides any required additional coverage under its group health plans.
Uniformed Services Leave of Absence
If you take a leave of absence for service in the U.S. uniformed services (including the military, National Guard, and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service), you are covered under the Package until the end of the month in which your leave began. If you remain on an approved leave of absence, coverage under the Package continues until the end of the third full calendar month of the leave as if you were an active employee on an approved nonmedical leave of absence.
If uniformed service extends beyond 3 months, you will be enrolled for COBRA coverage automatically as of the beginning of the fourth full calendar month of your leave. You may continue COBRA coverage for an additional 21 months while your uniformed services leave continues, in accordance with your rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
During a temporary period after September 11, 2001, military leave of absence can be extended for a total of 60 months, based on military orders. Your life insurance, medical, and dental coverage continue during this period. The cost of coverage during this 60-month period is the same as for active employees.

Your COBRA continuation period runs concurrently with coverage during USERRA leave.
If you return to active employment promptly after uniformed service, according to USERRA, the Package is reinstated on the date you return to the active payroll.
Changes in Leave Types
If your type of leave changes from a medical leave of absence to a nonmedical leave of absence (or vice versa), your periods of leave will be considered separate leaves of absence. However, if the type of your nonmedical leave of absence changes (for example, from family leave to personal leave), your maximum period of coverage in your new leave category will be reduced by the number of days or months for which you already received an extension of your active coverage.
Successive Periods of Leaves of Absence
Successive periods of leave are described below:
•	2 medical leaves of absence separated by less than 30 days of continuous work are considered 1 leave of absence unless the second leave is due to entirely unrelated conditions.
•	2 medical leaves of absence separated by 30 or more days of continuous work are considered new and separate medical leaves of absence.

Eligibility
You are eligible for the Retiree Medical Plan if you retire from the service of the Company under the Company-sponsored retirement plan (The Boeing Company Retirement Plan, or “BCERP”) as follows (See below for employees hired or rehired on or after January 3, 2014, who are not participants in the BCERP):
• You are an active employee and meet the following requirements:
-	You are age 55 or older with 10 or more years of vesting service under a Company-sponsored retirement plan.
-	You are disabled, become eligible for disability benefits under the Company-sponsored retirement plan, and are at least age 50 with 10 or more years of vesting service at retirement.
-	You are on an approved leave of absence, you are age 55 or older with 10 or more years of vesting service at retirement, and you retire under the Company-sponsored retirement plan within 2 years following the start of your approved leave of absence.
-	You are on layoff, you are at least age 55 with 10 or more years of vesting service at retirement, and you retire under the Company-sponsored retirement plan within 6 years following your layoff.
If you are hired or rehired on or after January 3, 2014, and are not a participant in The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan (BCERP), the eligibility requirements described above will be applied in a manner that retains retiree medical eligibility under comparable circumstances for those employees not participating in the BCERP. Specifically, the eligibility provisions will be modified as follows:
•	“At retirement” or “retire under the Company-sponsored retirement plan” will mean “at termination of employment” or “terminate employment”,
•	“10 or more years of vesting service under the Company-sponsored retirement plan” will mean the employee would have had 10 or more years of vesting service under the BCERP had he or she been a participant in the BCERP (with vesting service to be determined in the same manner as under the BCERP), and
•	“Disabled or become eligible for disability benefits under the Company-sponsored retirement plan” will mean that the employee would have become eligible for disability benefits under the BCERP had he or she been a participant in the BCERP.
You are no longer eligible for coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan after attaining age 65 or becoming eligible for Medicare.

Eligible Dependents of Retired Employees
Dependents eligible for the Retiree Medical Plan are your legal spouse (as recognized under both applicable state law and the Internal Revenue Code) and children (natural children, adopted children, children legally placed with you for adoption, and stepchildren) who are under age 26, unmarried, and dependent on you for principal support.
You may request coverage for the following dependents:
•	An opposite-gender common-law spouse if the relationship meets the common-law requirements for the state where you entered into the common-law relationship.
•	Other children, as follows, who are under age 26, unmarried, and dependent on you for principal support:
-	Children who are related to you either directly or through marriage (e.g., grandchildren, nieces, nephews).
-	Children for whom you have legal custody or guardianship (or for whom you have a pending application for legal custody or guardianship) and are living with you.
Proof of dependent eligibility will be required. Some states have laws requiring insured health plans to offer coverage for certain registered domestic partners.
In accordance with Federal law, the Company also provides medical coverage to certain dependent children (called alternate recipients) if the Company is directed to do so by a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) issued by a court or state agency of competent jurisdiction.
Documentation is required to request coverage for dependents, including a child named in a QMCSO, a child for whom you have been given legal custody or guardianship, or a spouse. You must provide the Boeing Service Center with any required supporting documentation by the date specified by the Boeing Service Center or your request will be denied.
Special Provisions
• Your dependents.
If you or any of your dependents is covered or becomes covered (or eligible for benefits by reason of having been covered) under another Company-sponsored plan providing medical benefits, that person is not eligible for the Retiree Medical Plan. If you and your spouse are both employed by or retired from Boeing, you each must be covered by your own Boeing-sponsored medical coverage. However, if your spouse is a part-time Boeing employee or on an approved leave of absence or layoff, your spouse and eligible children are considered eligible dependents if other Boeing coverage is waived. If your spouse and eligible children are
280
1	covered under your spouse’s Boeing-sponsored plan, they will be
2	considered eligible for the Retiree Medical Plan at the time they no
3	longer are eligible for coverage under your spouse’s plan.
4	No person may be covered both as a retired employee and as a dependent 5 and no person will be considered as a dependent of more than 1 retired or 6 active employee.
7	• Your death.
8	Upon your death, your spouse and any other covered dependents remain
9	eligible for coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan until the earliest of
10	these dates:
11	-	Your spouse or other dependent attains 65 years of age.
12	-	Your spouse or other dependent becomes eligible for Medicare.
13	-	Your spouse’s death.
14	- The end of the last month that contributions are paid.
15	Surviving covered dependents under age 65 may continue their coverage
16	as described above, or as described in the Termination of Retiree Medical
17	Coverage section, or convert their medical coverage as described in that 18 section.
19 Disabled Children
20	A disabled child age	26 or older continues to be eligible if a physician
21	provides proof that he	or she is incapable of self-support due to any mental
22	or physical condition	that began before age 26. You may be required to
23	confirm the disability	from time to time. The child must be unmarried and
24	dependent on you for principal support. Coverage continues under the 25 Retiree Medical Plan for the duration of the incapacity as long as you 26 continue to be enrolled in the plan and the child continues to meet these 27 eligibility requirements.
28	Special applications for coverage are required for disabled dependent 29	children age 26 or older.
30	Retiree Medical Plan Enrollment
31	Initial Enrollment
32	You and your eligible dependents automatically will be enrolled at the time 33 you become eligible, provided you pay any required contributions. You and 34 your dependents will be enrolled in the same plan as immediately before 35 retirement, if available.

You may elect to change medical plans by calling the Boeing Service Center within 31 days of the date you retire. The Company will supply enrollment instructions at the time of your retirement.
All family members, including you, must be enrolled in the same medical plan.
Spouse Coverage
Each retired employee enrolling a spouse must provide information regarding coverage available through another employer to determine whether special contributions are required to enroll the spouse. If you do not authorize a required contribution, your spouse will not be enrolled for medical coverage. You will not be able to enroll your spouse until the date your spouse loses the option to be covered under the other employer-sponsored medical plan.
The Company will require periodic verification of data.
Special Enrollment Events
If you declined coverage in the Retiree Medical Plan for yourself and/or your eligible dependents when you were first eligible because you or your dependents had other employer-sponsored medical coverage, you may enroll yourself and/or your eligible dependents if you or your dependent experiences one of these special enrollment events:
•	You or your dependent loses or becomes ineligible for other employer-sponsored medical coverage because of an event such as loss of dependent status under another employer’s plan (through divorce, legal separation, or dependent child reaching the limiting age), death, termination of employment, reduction in hours of employment, termination of employer contributions toward the coverage, elimination of coverage for the class of similarly situated employees or dependents, moving out of the plan’s service area with no other coverage available from the other employer, or reaching the lifetime limit on all benefits under the other employer’s plan.
•	You or your dependent becomes ineligible for Medicaid or a state Children’s Health Insurance Program and loses coverage; you or your dependent becomes eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or a state’s child health care plan.
•	You or your dependent exhausts any continuation coverage from another employer; that is, coverage provided under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (COBRA), ends.
•	You gain a new dependent because of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption.

If you experience a special enrollment event, you can enroll yourself and/or your eligible dependents in a Retiree Medical Plan as described above. You can enroll in any family status tier and any health plan option available to you.
Special enrollment is not available if you lose coverage because of failure to make timely premium payments or termination from the plan for cause (such as for making a fraudulent claim).
Deferred Enrollment
If you decline enrollment in the Retiree Medical Plan because of other employer-sponsored health care coverage (such as through your spouse’s employer), you may be able to enroll yourself and your eligible dependents in the Company-sponsored Retiree Medical Plan at a later date as long as enrollment is within 60 days after other coverage ends.
If you decline dependent enrollment when first eligible and your dependent’s other health care coverage was through continuation coverage from a previous employer (coverage mandated by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as amended), your dependent must exhaust his or her COBRA coverage to be eligible for deferred enrollment.
If you are not enrolled in the Company-sponsored Retiree Medical Plan and have a new dependent as a result of an event such as marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may enroll yourself, your spouse, and any dependent children during the year as long as enrollment is requested within 60 days after the event by contacting the Boeing Service Center.
If you are enrolled in the Retiree Medical Plan and have a new dependent as a result of marriage, birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, you may enroll your new dependent during the year as long as enrollment is requested within 120 days after the qualified event. See “Changes in Status” below for more information.
If you are enrolled in the Retiree Medical Plan and have not enrolled your eligible dependents because of other employer-sponsored health care coverage, you may be able to enroll your eligible dependents in the Company-sponsored Retiree Medical Plan at a later date as long as enrollment is within 60 days after other coverage ends. The coverage loss must be due to loss of eligibility for the health care coverage (including from divorce, legal separation, death, termination of employment, or reduction in hours of employment), termination of employer contributions toward such coverage, or reaching the other plan’s lifetime maximum benefit.

Status Changes
If you already are enrolled for this retiree medical coverage, you may be able to change coverage or add an eligible dependent if you experience one of the status changes described below.

If you are eligible for retiree medical coverage at the time active employment with the Company ends, you may defer enrollment in the Retiree Medical Plan until the date your benefits begin under the Company-sponsored retirement plan. If you are hired on or after January 3, 2014, are not a participant in The Boeing Company Employee Retirement Plan (BCERP), and are eligible for retiree medical coverage at the time active employment with the Company ends, you may defer enrollment in the Retiree Medical Plan until any time before becoming eligible for Medicare or attaining age 65 as long as you have other employer sponsored medical coverage (such as through your spouse, as an active employee, or COBRA coverage).
You are not eligible for retiree medical coverage after becoming eligible for Medicare or attaining age 65.
Dependents
Current eligible dependents are covered for retiree medical benefits on the same date your coverage is effective, provided proper application is made and you pay any required contributions. Eligible dependents acquired after your coverage is effective become covered on the date of marriage, date of birth, or date the child is legally placed with you for adoption, if application is made within 120 days of the event and you pay any required contributions. For other newly eligible dependents, coverage is effective on the date dependency is established, if application is made within 60 days and you pay any required contributions.
Medical Plans
The Company-sponsored medical plan is the Traditional Medical Plan. Where appropriate, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Coordinated Care Plans (CCPs) will be offered to retirees and their dependents in addition to the Traditional Medical Plan. See your Summary Plan Description or Certificate of Coverage for a description of medical plan benefits.

Covered medical expenses for the Traditional Medical Plan are described in the Summary of Traditional Medical Plan Benefits section of Attachment A. Highlights of specific benefit amounts are described in the Traditional Medical Plan Schedule of Benefits in Attachment A.
Vision care program benefits do not apply to the Traditional Medical Plan.
Prescription drug benefits are as shown below.
Prescription Drug Program
The prescription drug program described in this section is available to retired employees and dependents enrolled in the Traditional Medical Plan. This program offers 2 coverage options for prescription drugs and medicines:
•	Retail pharmacy card program—you can use the pharmacy card to obtain covered prescriptions from a participating retail pharmacy.
•	Mail service program—called Medco By Mail.
A formulary applies to all retail pharmacy and mail order purchases. (A formulary is a list of drugs determined to be effective in both cost and treatment and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A nonformulary drug also may be effective for treatment, but is not as costeffective as formulary or generic drugs. A group of practicing physicians and pharmacists routinely reviews drugs to include in the formulary. If clinical data show several drugs are equally effective, the most costeffective drug usually is chosen. The formulary may change from time to time.)
There are 3 categories of prescription drug purchases:
•	Generic—drugs that are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts but usually cost less.
•	Brand-name formulary—brand-name drugs selected for the formulary based on cost and effectiveness.
•	Brand-name nonformulary—brand-name drugs not selected for the formulary.
The program includes utilization management services and generic incentives (see “Pharmacy Management” and “Member Pay the Difference Generic Incentive Program” on page 291) to help ensure cost-effective, clinically appropriate treatment.

Under the Retiree Medical Plan, a $75 annual deductible applies to each individual for prescription drugs purchased under the retail pharmacy card program. For families of 3 or more, the annual deductible maximum is $225. This deductible is separate from the Traditional Medical Plan annual deductible described in the Schedule of Benefits. A covered person’s out-of-pocket expense is limited to $75 for each prescription or refill after the deductible is satisfied. Usual and customary charges are the charges the service representative allows for participating pharmacies. *If you choose a brand-name drug when a generic equivalent is available, you will pay more than the coinsurance and copayments shown in this table.

Prior authorization may be required for certain medications.
Medco By Mail covers up to a 90-day supply per prescription or refill. Authorized refills are covered only after the initial order has been used. Certain controlled substances are subject to quantity limits.
Unless the physician indicates otherwise, you will receive a generic equivalent of the prescribed drug when available and permissible under the law. You also may receive a different brand that is medically equivalent.
Pharmacy Management
Specific drugs are reviewed by the prescription drug program service representative at the point of sale to determine if your prescription is covered by the plan, clinically appropriate, and consistent with usage guidelines.
Member Pay the Difference Generic Incentive Program
To encourage the use of generic drugs, if a brand-name drug is purchased when an equivalent generic is available (for both retail pharmacy and mail service)—whether you or your physician requests the brand-name drug— you will pay the generic coinsurance or copayment plus the cost difference between the brand-name drug and generic drug.
If for any reason your physician believes that you must use a brand-name drug, he or she can ask for a coverage review by calling the service representative. The service representative will request information from your physician and review it to determine if your need for the brand-name drug meets the conditions to qualify for coverage. If coverage is approved, you will be charged the brand coinsurance or copayment for the brand-name drug. If coverage is not approved, coverage will be provided according to the member pay the difference generic incentive program.
Review Process for Brand-name Drugs
Brand-name drugs are covered at no additional cost to you when your physician provides information to the service representative, (Express Scripts at 1-800-841-2797) showing that you:
•	Experienced an adverse reaction, allergy, or sensitivity to a generic equivalent,
•	Experienced therapeutic failure with a generic equivalent,
•	May be destabilized by changing to a generic equivalent, or
•	Would be at unnecessary risk by changing to a generic equivalent.

Coordination of Benefits—Retired Employees
If you or your dependent has other health care coverage in addition to being covered under this Plan, the following rules govern coordination of benefits with the other coverage. Other coverage includes, whether insured or uninsured, another employer’s group benefit plan, other arrangement of individuals in a group, Medicare (to the extent allowed by law), individual

insurance or health coverage, and insurance that pays without consideration of fault.
The service representative has the right to obtain and release any information or recover any payment it considers necessary to administer these provisions.
Order of Payment
The primary plan pays its benefits first and pays its benefits without regard to benefits that may be payable under other plans. When another plan is the primary plan for health care coverage, the secondary plan pays the difference between the benefits paid by the primary plan and what would have been paid had the secondary plan been primary.
•	A plan is considered primary if
-	It has no order of benefit determination rules.
-	It has benefit determination rules that differ from coordination of benefit rules under state regulations or, if not insured, that differ from these rules.
-	All plans that cover an individual use the same coordination of benefit rules, and under those rules, the plan is primary.
• If the aforementioned rules do not determine which group plan is considered primary, this plan applies the following coordination of benefit rules:
-	A plan that covers a person as an employee, retiree, member, or subscriber pays before a plan that covers the person as a dependent.
-	A plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee is primary. The plan that covers a person as a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee or as a dependent of a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee is secondary.
-	If a dependent child is covered under both parents’ group plans, the child’s primary coverage is provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes first in the calendar year, with secondary coverage provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes later in the calendar year.
-	If a dependent child’s parents are divorced or separated and a court decree establishes financial responsibility for the health care coverage of the child, the plan of the parent with such financial responsibility is the primary plan of coverage. If the divorce decree is silent on the issue of coverage, the following guidelines are used:
o The plan of the parent with custody pays benefits first.
o The plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays second.

o The plan of the parent without custody pays third.
o The plan of the spouse of the parent without custody pays fourth.
-	If none of the aforementioned rules establishes which group plan should pay first, then the plan that has covered the person for the longest period is considered the primary plan of coverage.
-	Continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), as amended, always is secondary to other coverage, except as required by law.
-	If the retired employee or dependent is confined to a hospital when first becoming covered under this plan, this plan is secondary to any plan already covering the retired employee or dependent for the eligible expenses related to that hospital admission. If the retired employee or dependent does not have other coverage for hospital and related expenses, this plan is primary.
Benefits under a Company-sponsored health care plan are not coordinated with benefits paid under any other group plan offered by the Company. You can receive benefits from only 1 Company-sponsored health care plan.
Federal rules govern coordination of benefits with Medicare. In most cases, Medicare is secondary to a plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee. Medicare is primary in most other circumstances.
Payment Provisions
The primary plan pays benefits without regard to any other plan. When the Company-sponsored plan is secondary, it adjusts benefits so that the total payable under both plans for expenses covered under the Company-sponsored plan is not more than would be payable under the Company-sponsored plan. Neither plan pays more than it would without coordination of benefits.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under individual insurance, group insurance, or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis.
Treatment of end-stage renal disease is covered by the Company-sponsored plan for the first 30 months following Medicare entitlement due to endstage renal disease, and Medicare provides secondary coverage. After this 30-month period, you will be covered by Medicare only.
Coordination of benefit provisions of Company-sponsored HMO and CCP plans vary by plan.

When an Injury or Illness Is Caused by the Negligence of Another
In some situations, you or a covered dependent may be eligible to receive, as a result of an accident or illness, health care benefits from an automobile insurance policy, homeowner’s insurance policy or other type of insurance policy, or from a responsible third party. In these cases, this plan will pay benefits if the covered person agrees to cooperate with the service representative in administering the plan’s recovery rights.
If a person covered by this plan is injured by another party who is legally liable for the medical or dental bills, he or she may request this plan to pay its regular benefit on his or her behalf. In exchange, the covered person agrees to:
•	Notify the plan within 30 days of giving notice to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of the covered person’s intention to pursue a claim.
•	Complete a claim and submit all bills related to the injury or illness to the responsible party or any insurer.
•	Complete and submit all of the necessary information requested by the service representative.
•	Reimburse the plan from any payment he or she receives from the responsible party or any other source.
•	Allow the plan to be subrogated to all rights of recovery a covered person has against the responsible party or any other source and to cooperate with the service representative’s efforts to recover from the responsible party or any other source any amounts this plan pays in benefits related to the injury or illness, including any lawsuit brought against the responsible party or insurer.
•	Grant the plan a lien in the amount of benefits paid which can be enforced against any source of funds available to compensate the covered person for injury or illness caused by another party.
This provision applies whenever you or a covered dependent is entitled to or receives benefits under this plan and is also entitled to or receives compensation or any other funds from another party in connection with that same medical condition, whether by insurance, litigation, settlement, or otherwise. The plan is entitled to such funds to the extent of plan benefits paid to or on behalf of the individual as a first-priority right, whether or not the individual has been “made whole,” and without regard to any common fund doctrine. The plan is entitled to such funds regardless of whether the plan’s benefits are identified as being included in the funds and regardless of whether liability for payment of the funds is admitted by the responsible

party or any other source of the funds. This plan may recover such funds by constructive trust, equitable lien, right of subrogation, reimbursement, or any other remedy allowed under applicable law.
The covered person shall do nothing to prejudice the plan’s subrogation or recovery interest, including, but not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan. If an individual fails, refuses, or neglects to reimburse the plan or otherwise comply with the requirements of this provision, or if payments are made under the plan based on fraudulent information or otherwise in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the provisions of the plan, then, in addition to all other remedies and rights of recovery that the plan may have, the plan has the right to terminate or suspend benefit payments and/or recover the reimbursement due to the plan by withholding, offsetting, and recovering such amount out of any future plan benefits or amounts otherwise due from the plan to or with respect to such individual. The plan also has the right in any proceeding at law or equity to assert a constructive trust, equitable lien, or any other remedy or recovery allowed under applicable law, against any and all persons or entities who have assets that the plan can claim rights to. The plan has a first-priority right of recovery from any judgment, settlement or other payment, regardless of whether the individual has been “made whole,” and without regard to any common fund doctrine.
In the event that any claim is made that any part of this subrogation and recovery provision is ambiguous or questions arise concerning the meaning or intent of any of its terms, the plan or service representative shall have the sole authority and discretion to resolve all disputes regarding the interpretation of this provision.

•	Your dependent attains 65 years of age.
•	Your dependent becomes eligible for Medicare.
•	The death of your surviving spouse.
•	The end of the last month that any required contributions are paid.
Your surviving covered dependents under the age of 65 may be permitted to convert their medical coverage as described below in “Conversion Privilege.”
Continuation of Medical Coverage (COBRA)
If medical coverage for your dependents otherwise would terminate due to one of the following reasons, these benefits may continue for specified periods under Public Law 99-272, Title X, as amended, if the individual makes a timely request to the Company and pays the required contribution.
•	Your death.
•	Your divorce.
•	You become entitled to Medicare.
•	Your dependent child ceases to be a dependent as defined under this plan. (A child eligible to be continued under the plan’s disabled child provision will still be considered to have dependent status.)
Conversion Privilege
If medical coverage terminates for reasons other than voluntary cancellation of coverage or by becoming eligible for another Company-sponsored plan, you or your dependent may apply for an individual policy of insurance of a kind then being issued by the service representative for group conversion purposes. Evidence of good health will not be required, provided written application is made and the first retiree medical premium is paid within 31 days following the end of the month in which medical coverage terminates. The policy will be issued at the service representative’s customary rate applicable to the age of the individual and to the form and amount of insurance provided under the converted policy.
