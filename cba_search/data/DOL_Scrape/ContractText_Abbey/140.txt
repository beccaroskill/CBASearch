After deducting 10% of the total fee (which deduction shall be no less than $50 but no greater than $400) to cover expenses, The Times shall share the remaining fee evenly with the employee, whose share shall in no event be less than $50.

C.	Prior to implementing the Program, The Times shall meet and negotiate with the Guild regarding the establishment of the initial monthly revenue goals.
Thereafter, The Times shall establish such goals, as well as monthly “breakout” goals {i.e., at a level above and beyond 140% of the monthly revenue goal) for each TSIR semiannually. The Guild may grieve and/or arbitrate specific monthly revenue goals on the grounds that they are inequitable (i.e., unachievable by a reasonably diligent and successful TSIR given the prevailing market conditions when the goals were set). A TSIR shall receive incentive compensation (over and above his or her base salary) based on his or her monthly performance relative to the monthly revenue goal as indicated in the following table:
Performance vs. Monthly Revenue Goal 80%	Monthly Incentive Compensation $300
90%	$600
100%	$900
110%	$1,300
120%	$1,750
130%	$2,250
140%	$2,800
The monthly incentive compensation of a TSIR who achieves the “breakout” goal shall be $3,500. The Times shall not materially change the structure of the Program without providing the Union with notice and an opportunity to negotiate.

D.	Effective January 1,2005, and each January 1st thereafter, each Sr. TSR employed as ofthe Agreement’s effective date may elect whether to enter the Program.
Such an election may be made only once, and may be revoked one year thereafter, in which case the employee shall be reclassified as a Sr. TSR. When an employee hired as or promoted to TSIR concludes his/her third year in the Program s/he may elect at that point to become a Sr. TSR and shall not serve a trial period in that position.
E.	The introduction and/or utilization of the Program shall not adversely impact Sr. TSRs or Group 10 Sales Representatives. The Times shall not re-assign work from employees in either job to TSIRs solely because of their lower base salary. Nothing herein shall otherwise affect The Times’s rights concerning the mode of sale for any advertising category or account.
F.	All Fund contributions and supplemental disability pay for TSIRs shall be based on the minimum salary for Group 7 employees hired after May 1,1994.
G.	Because the Program is experimental, the parties will meet after its second year to review its status and success. In addition, TSIRs shall not be excluded from any applicable annual Department-wide award program. Sr. TSRs and TSIRs shall be treated as one group for all seniority purposes under the CBA.
