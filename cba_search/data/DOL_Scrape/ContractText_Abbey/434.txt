RECOGNITION
Section 1.01 The Companies recognize the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for those employees having the occupational title classifications outlined in Appendices A and B for the collective bargaining units described in the Agreement of Recognition. Section 1.02 Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing the inclusion of any employee or employees not properly includable in the above described bargaining unit, nor shall be construed as a waiver or forbearance on the part of the Union of any right to represent any employee or employees properly includable in such bargaining unit as contemplated under the National Labor Relations Act as now or hereafter amended or superseded.

ARTICLE 2
FORCE ALLOCATION
Section 2.01 EMPLOYMENT SECURITY COMMITMENT
The Companies’ policy will be to offer all employees, who continue to meet performance standards, employment security through reassignment and retraining even if their present jobs are eliminated. This policy will be maintained so long as there is no change that will materially alter any of the Companies’ Business Plan achievement.
Employees who utilize personal and/or career development programs designed to help them stay abreast of continuing technological and business changes, and who exercise flexibility in accepting new or changed work assignments and locations, will be assured employment security so long as there is no change that will materially alter any of the Companies’ Business Plan achievement.
Section 2.02 EMPLOYEE CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
The Employee Career Development Program, developed jointly by the Companies and the National Union, is designed to provide for the ongoing development of each employee’s capability throughout their careers with the Companies.
A.	The Program will be governed by the Vice President - Human Resources and the CWA Vice President, District 9, or their designated representatives, as well as three (3) representatives of the Companies and three (3) representatives of the Union. This Governance Board will oversee the activities of the Training/Retraining Working Committees.
B.	The Companies will provide specific, relevant and timely information regarding existing job opportunities to the Union. This information will be based on semi-annual force forecasts of future force reductions and job growth areas created by, but not limited to, major technological changes and consolidations. This information will be communicated to the appropriate Union and management representatives so that these representatives can help employees make decisions about their individual career paths.
ARTICLE 2
3
C.	The purpose of the Employee Career Development Program is to:
1.	Educate employees about the necessity for, and reality of, change.
2.	Enable an employee to assess personal knowledge, skills, attributes, behaviors and goals.
3.	Determine the knowledge, skills, attributes and behaviors for jobs and build a training and/or career path for each participating employee.
4.	Provide individual career and development counseling by trained counselors.
5.	Encourage employees to take control of their careers and seek out new career opportunities in sufficient time to take advantage of such opportunities.
6.	Emphasize each employee’s responsibility to seek out and take advantage of these and other career development tools and processes to better ensure their personal employment security.
D.	The Governance Board identified in Section 2.02A will be responsible for integrating and coordinating the activities of the Training/Retrain-ing Working Committees into the Employee Career Development Program.
E.	All Regular Full and Part-time employees with at least one (1) year of service will be eligible to participate in the Employee Career Development Program(s). Participation in the Program(s) shall be voluntary. Time spent by employees in Program activities will normally be outside of scheduled working hours. Such time will not be paid and will not be considered as time worked for any purpose.
Section 2.03 TRAINING/RETRAINING WORKING COMMITTEES
A.	The Training/Retraining Working Committees shall consist of equal numbers of Company and Union representatives.
B.	The functions of the Training/Retraining Working Committees are to:
1.	Develop programs which offer additional training opportunities to employees which will allow them to attain new skills and pursue different career paths.
4
2.	Propose those programs to the Governance Board for approval of appropriate expenditure of the Training/Retraining funding.
3.	Administer the programs and report on at least a quarterly basis to the Governance Board.
C.	The provisions of Sections 2.02 and 2.03 do not in any way affect the Companies’ right to implement the provisions of Article 2, Section 2.05, Section 2.06 or Article 8.
Section 2.04 THE AUTOMATED UPGRADE AND TRANSFER SYSTEM
The Companies and the National Union agree that the Companies will replace the Upgrade and Transfer Plan with an automated transfer plan that shall provide placement opportunities for Regular employees. This Plan, called the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System (AUTS), will enable Regular employees to move to new job titles and work locations. Such moves not only benefit the Companies, but also benefit employees by allowing them to influence the direction of their individual careers.
A.	Regular Transfers
1.	Participation in the AUTS shall require employees to verify, supply
and update personnel data relative to work experience, testing, education and training. This information shall be the basis of each employee’s resume maintained in the AUTS database.
2.	Information regarding job openings will be made available to employees on an automated basis by the Companies. Such information will also be available to the Union Locals.
3.	Eligible qualified employees seeking placement can submit trans-
fer requests for currently open positions and for future openings. Employees may have up to six (6) transfer requests at any one time. These may be upgrade, lateral or downgrade transfer requests and they may be for future or current vacancies. Each transfer request will designate a specific title and exchange (See Appendix C4).
a. Employees will receive reports regarding the activity associated to their transfer requests every four (4) to six (6) weeks.
ARTICLE 2
5
4.	A vacancy will be listed for a minimum of five (5) business days, during which time eligible employees may submit transfer requests for the position.
5.	The employee will have two (2) work days to accept or reject a job offer. Once a job offer has been made, all other transfer requests will be put on hold until the job offer has been accepted or declined.
6.	An employee’s transfer request will be maintained in the active file and/or considered for current open positions if the employee has met the prerequisites of satisfactory job performance, timein-title and time-in-location (as indicated in Appendix C2), testing and other job requirements as determined by the Companies and indicated on the appropriate job brief.
a.	Least senior identified surplus employees (Section 2.06B1) and employees placed under the provisions of Section 2.05 (Force Balancing) and Section 2.06 (Force Movement) of this Article will not be required to meet time-in-title and time-in-location requirements in order to submit transfer requests following such identification and/or placement.
b.	If an employee refuses a job offer which matches a request, then that request will be cancelled; and it, or any other request that would include the same title and exchange, may not be resubmitted for a period of six (6) months from the date of refusal. When an employee accepts a job offer, all other transfer requests on file will be cancelled.
c.	Transfers submitted to AUTS for current positions expire thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a job match list or upon selection of a candidate for the vacancy, whichever occurs first. Transfers submitted for future positions will remain in file for six (6) months from the date of receipt, but will be cancelled upon the occurrence of any of the following:
1.	The employee no longer meets eligibility or qualifications requirements.
2.	The employee withdraws the request.
3.	The employee leaves the Company payroll.
6
4.	The employee is no longer a Regular employee.
d.	Transfers will remain in file, but on inactive status, if any of the following are in excess of thirty (30) calendar days: leaves of absence; temporary promotions to management and disabilities.
e.	Eligible employees not test qualified for positions being sought through AUTS will be provided the opportunity to take such test(s) in the same order of consideration applicable to filling job vacancies under Section 2.04B1, subject to the availability of testing resources and the job vacancy rate for the positions being sought. Within each step in the sequence of search, employees will be tested in seniority order.
B.	Selection
1.	When the Companies declare a vacancy, the Companies may list on the requisition up to ten (10) skills taken from the job brief. These skills are in addition to the prerequisites described in Section 2.04A6. Employees will be selected by the skills listed on the requisition. Skills are based on the employees’ work experience, training and education and are listed in their resumes. The Companies may, at their discretion, interview employees on job match lists to confirm their skills. When two (2) or more employees have equal skills related to the vacancy, seniority will determine the choice. The normal sequence of search to fill a vacancy will be:
a.	Qualified employees in the Available Employee File consisting of personnel returning from medical disability, military, care of newborn children, care of immediate family, Union leaves of absence, qualified medically restricted employees and surplus employees;
b.	Laid off employees as referenced in Article 8;
c.	Employees requesting changes of job titles and/or locations;
d.	New hires.
2.	In applying the provisions of Sections 2.04B1a through 2.04B1c, Nevada employees will be considered for Nevada positions for which they are qualified before such opportunities are made
ARTICLE 2
7
available to Pacific employees. Pacific employees will likewise receive consideration for Pacific positions before such opportunities are made available to Nevada employees.
3.	Employees and new hires in Section 2.04B1c through 2.04B1d may be considered concurrently. When two (2) or more individuals are equally qualified, seniority will determine the choice.
4.	Notwithstanding Sections 2.04B1 through 2.04B3, VP entities may reserve up to 50% of their vacancies by title for intra VP entity movement. Those vacancies identified for intra VP entity movement will be made available to qualified employees within the same VP entity before such opportunities are made available to employees from other VP entities. Intra VP entity selection will be determined by skills and seniority as described in Section 2.04B1. A VP entity will not have more than 50% of its vacancies reserved on a title by title basis at any point in time during the life of this contract.
5.	The Companies reserve the right to refuse transfers and may initiate transfers as they deem necessary.
C.	Retreats
1.	A Regular employee who has accepted a new job assignment, which is an upgrade under this Section 2.04, may elect to retreat to the previous department within the first six (6) months after the date of transfer, except as specified in Section 2.05C and 2.06B10. The employee will be reassigned to the previous job or a comparable job within the same headquarters as the previous job as a vacancy becomes available. If the Companies and the Union Local(s) agree, the affected employee may be offered a comparable job outside the headquarters.
2.	The receiving department may elect to retreat an employee within the first six (6) months after the date of transfer except as specified in Section 2.05C and 2.06B10.
3.	For both employee and Company initiated retreats, the first six (6) months may be extended for formal classroom training, leaves of absence, or disability.
D.	Joint AUTS Review Committee
8
1.	The Companies and the National Union will establish a Joint AUTS Review Committee comprised of two (2) Union representatives and two (2) representatives of the Companies. The responsibilities of the Committee will include:
a.	Assisting the Companies in providing for an orderly and efficient transition to AUTS;
b.	Monitoring the ongoing operation of AUTS;
c.	Analyzing overall AUTS results;
d.	Addressing concerns raised as to the staffing of positions through AUTS.
2.	The Joint Review Committee will meet on a regular basis, but not less than once each quarter.
3.	The Joint Review Committee is not empowered to enter into agreements modifying the Contract, employees’ wages, benefits (or other forms of compensation), job titles or representation status.
4.	Agreements made by the Joint Review Committee will not prejudice the position of either the Companies or the Union and will not be cited in any other proceeding. Such agreements will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.
5.	Individual placement decisions made pursuant to the AUTS shall
be subject to the grievance procedure. Issues not resolved in the grievance procedure may be presented to the Joint AUTS Review Committee for final and binding resolution. Neither the AUTS nor its administration shall be subject to arbitration.
E.	Mini-Transfers
The mini-transfer procedure is completely separate from the process described in Section 2.04A. The mini-transfer process is administered by local management without the involvement of the Placement organization. Local management will consider mini-transfer requests before issuing a requisition. Time-in-title and time-in-location is accrued for employees who change their shift, location or status due to a minitransfer.
1.	Regular employees (except for Operator Services employees listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01A) may submit local requests to change their shifts (day, evening or night) within their title and
ARTICLE 2
9
their building locations or other organizational units as determined by the Companies and the Union. If there are no written requests on file, the available qualified employees within the building or organizational unit as determined by the Companies and the Union will be offered the vacancy.
2.	Regular employees (including Operator Services employees listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01) may submit local requests to change their work locations within their same titles. Requests for change in work locations will be to different buildings, or to different organizational units within the same district.
3.	Regular employees (including Operator Services employees listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01) may submit local requests to change their status from full-time to part-time or from parttime to full-time. Requests for change in status will be within the employee’s title and their building locations or other organizational units as determined by the Companies and the Union.
4.	When a vacancy occurs, the Companies will review requests from available qualified employees. Employees will be considered in order of seniority. The normal sequence of search to fill a vacancy will be:
a.	Employees requesting change of shifts under Section 2.04E1;
b.	Employees requesting change of locations under Section 2.04E2;
c.	Employees requesting change of status under Section 2.04E3;
d.	Requests will be honored within the same State before allowing for interstate movement.
5.	The qualifications and availability of employees for the purpose of administering this Section 2.04E will be determined by the Companies.
Section 2.05 FORCE BALANCING
Whenever any conditions, including economic or force conditions or technological change (defined as changes in equipment or methods of operations), are considered by the Companies to warrant relocation of existing
10
work and/or rearrangement of employees, Regular employees may be reassigned. Prior to such reassignment(s), management will inform the affected Union Local(s) of the proposed move(s). The parties will then discuss the need for such reassignment and may explore possible alternatives. If the parties do not agree, the Companies will administer the reassignment of Regular employees.
If the reassignment of Regular employees is deemed necessary by the Companies, the following provisions will apply:
A.	Relocation of Existing Work
1.	In applying the provisions of Section 2.05A, the affected work group will be considered to be an administrative work unit. An administrative work unit is defined as those employees who have the same title classification and who perform similar work, as determined by the Companies, and share a common overtime list and vacation schedule or, if not sharing both the same overtime list and vacation schedule, sharing either the same overtime list or vacation schedule, whichever list or schedule is smaller.
2.	When only a portion of the work performed within an administrative work unit is to be relocated, employees will be offered the opportunity to follow the relocated work based on net credited service as shown by the records of the Companies.
3.	If the amount of work to be relocated equates to less than one (1) full employee’s work, the Companies, at their discretion, may allow an employee to follow that portion of relocated work.
4.	If the relocation of existing work involves a move for an employee which is considered commutable, the employee will follow the work to the new location. Commutable employees who refuse reassignment under the provisions of this Section and least senior commutable employees who refuse reassignment under Section 2.05B will be considered to have voluntarily resigned and will not be entitled to Separation Benefits.
5.	If the relocation of existing work is to a non-commutable location, the employee may elect to either follow the relocated work or be identified as surplus. In the latter case, the employee will be administered according to the provisions of Article 2, Section 2.06.
ARTICLE 2
11
B.	Force Rearrangements
1.	In an attempt to avoid the declaration of surplus, or to balance the force, the Companies may rearrange employees in the same title, consolidated headquarters (Section 2.09B) and Presidential entity. The Companies will determine the appropriate work group(s) within the title, consolidated headquarters and Presidential entity for administration of the force rearrangement(s). There is no requirement to use any of the force rearrangement procedures prior to declaring a surplus.
2.	Prior to a force rearrangement, the Companies will inform the affected Union Local(s) of the proposed move(s). Those Union Local(s) and the Companies will discuss the need for the force rearrangement(s), possible alternatives and whether any “additional vacancies,” as described in Section 2.05B4, will be offered. The Union Local(s) and the Companies will meet and discuss these issues in a timely manner. If there is no agreement between the Union Local(s) and the Companies, the Companies will administer the force rearrangement(s).
3.	The least senior qualified surplus employees in the affected work group (“affected employees”) will be offered the available jobs in their same title, consolidated headquarters and Presidential entity. By seniority, the affected employees may elect to take such vacancies or replace the least senior employee with the same title within the same consolidated headquarters and within the same VP entity who is outside the affected work group. This process will continue until all available vacancies in the title, consolidated headquarters and Presidential entity are filled.
a.	If the most senior of the affected employee(s) elects not to replace the least senior employee in the title, consolidated headquarters and VP entity, then the most senior of the affected employee(s) will be assigned to a vacancy.
b.	If the most senior of the affected employee(s) elects to replace the least senior employee in the title, consolidated headquarters and VP entity, then the replaced employee will be held out of the process until all the affected employee(s) who have more seniority than the replaced employee(s) have the opportunity to either replace the remaining least senior employee(s) in the title, consolidated headquarters
12
and VP entity or be assigned to a vacancy. If there are no remaining affected employees with more seniority than a replaced employee(s), the replaced employee(s) will be assigned to a vacancy, if available.
4.	If the Companies and the affected Union Local(s) agree during their advance discussions, the affected employees may also be offered any or all of the following types of available jobs in their Presidential entity (“additional vacancies”):
•	same title which are outside the consolidated headquarters;
•	same wage schedule within the consolidated headquarters;
•	and same wage schedule which are outside the consolidated headquarters.
If any such additional vacancies are made available to the affected employees, the same process described in Sections 2.05B3, 2.05B3a and 2.05B3b will be followed. That is, by seniority, the affected employees may elect to take an offered vacancy, including an additional vacancy, or replace the least senior employee with the same title within the same consolidated headquarters and within the same VP entity who is outside the work group. This process will continue until all offered vacancies, including additional vacancies, are filled.
5.	Employees who choose not to accept a commutable assignment will leave the service of the Companies. Employees who choose not to accept a non-commutable assignment will leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits.
6.	Employees who accept a non-commutable assignment under Section 2.05B will be entitled to relocation expense reimbursement. Such employees will also be entitled to submit unlimited requests through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System for six (6) months from the effective date of their assignment. If an employee had the option of accepting a commutable job (other than replacing the least senior employee with the same title within the same consolidated headquarters and VP entity), but elected a non-commutable job, the employee will not receive relocation expense reimbursement and will not be eligible to submit unlimited requests through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System for the six (6)-month period.
ARTICLE 2
13
7.	The Companies will inform the affected Union Local(s) of the results of a force rearrangement no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the effective date. The results will include the effective date of the force rearrangement, involved work locations and the name, title and net credited service (NCS) date of each involved employee.
C.	Employees reassigned under the provisions of Section 2.05 will have Limited Return Rights for up to 24 months from the effective date of their assignment. Limited Return Rights are to the employee’s former title, exchange and VP entity.
D.	As used in this Section 2.05 and Section 2.06, the term “qualified” refers to employees who have met the basic requirements of the job, including all tests, requirements and physical classifications as stated in the Jobs Handbook.
Section 2.06 FORCE MOVEMENT
A.	Prior to a declaration of surplus, the Companies will implement any or all of the following steps:
1.	Maintain overtime at a minimum level within the surplus work group.
2.	Terminate Temporary, Term and Occasional employees, if appropriate, where the Companies determine that surplus employees are qualified to perform the work.
3.	Stop hiring in the surplus title within the surplus work group.
B.	Force Movement Process
1.	The Presidential entity (or if there is no Presidential entity, the highest level entity below Presidential entity) will notify the affected Union Local(s) and the Executive Director-Labor Relations fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the surplus declaration date. The Presidential entity (or if there is no Presidential entity, the highest level entity below Presidential entity) will notify the surplus work group ten (10) calendar days prior to the surplus declaration date. If the Union Local(s) so choose, they may join in the roll-out scheduled by the Companies to notify the surplus work group. Labor Relations will notify the National Union in writing of a declaration of surplus.
14
a.	A work group is defined as one containing Regular employees with the same job title in a specific consolidated headquarters (see Section 2.09B) within a Company Presidential entity. In Company organizations without a Presidential level of management, a work group will consist of Regular employees with the same job title in a specific consolidated headquarters within the highest level entity below Presidential level.
b.	Surplus employees are the least senior employees in a surplus work group.
2.	Liaison Committees comprised of Company and Union representatives will be established (one (1) for Northern California and Nevada and one (1) for Southern California) to function in an oversight role regarding problems encountered during the placement of surplus employees. The membership of each Liaison Committee will be comprised of one (1) representative from CWA District 9, one (1) representative from the affected CWA Local(s) and one (1) each from Labor Relations, the affected Company department and the Placement organization. These committees are empowered to resolve any issues or problems regarding the placement of employees under the Force Movement process described in Sections 2.06B and 2.06C.
a.	The Liaison Committees are not empowered to enter into agreements modifying the Contract, with respect to employee’s wages, benefits (or other forms of compensation), job titles or representation status.
b.	Agreements made by the Liaison Committees regarding the placement of surplus employees will not prejudice the position of either the Companies or the Union and will not be cited in any other proceeding. Such agreements will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.
c.	Unresolved issues or problems regarding the placement of surplus employees will not delay or defer the Force Movement process. In the event the Liaison Committee is unable to resolve a problem within thirty (30) days, the issue(s) may then be addressed under the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Contract. To ensure timely resolution of grievances regarding the placement of surplus employees,
ARTICLE 2
15
such grievances will bypass Step I and Step II of the grievance process and be forwarded to the National Union Representative and Labor Relations Director with a summary of facts and the positions of each party prepared by the appropriate Liaison Committee.
d.	The Liaison Committees will discuss temporary and term positions that would be appropriate for consideration for surplus work groups. These committees are empowered to implement placement options in the appropriate Company organizations in an effort to relieve the surplus.
e.	The Liaison Committees will discuss positions that are being made available for new hires that would be appropriate for consideration for surplus work groups. These committees are empowered to implement placement options regarding these positions in the appropriate Company organizations in an effort to relieve the surplus.
3.	When a work group is notified of a surplus declaration, the Companies will offer Separation Benefits, as described in Section 2.07, the Special Leave of Absence and the Transition Leave of Absence to employees within the surplus work group, within the first ten (10) calendar days of the notice period. Employees may elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits or one (1) of the above referenced leaves to the extent necessary to relieve the surplus.
4.	Declaration of surplus shall not be made more frequently than once every three (3) calendar months for each specific work group.
5.	Once surplus has been declared to the Union, all activities under Section 2.05B will cease for the surplus work group(s).
6.	All Regular employees within a surplus work group will be given priority consideration for all available lateral (same wage schedule) and downgrade jobs, except jobs that are represented by other unions, beginning on the surplus declaration date (see Section 2.06B1). However, surplus employees represented by CWA will not be offered jobs in the non-represented unit if a declared surplus condition exists in that non-represented unit and will not
16
be given priority consideration for those jobs if a surplus condition exists in another bargaining unit.
a.	All Regular employees in the surplus work group who wish to volunteer for the available lateral and downgrade jobs may submit unlimited requests for current and future jobs through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System beginning on the surplus declaration date.
b.	Qualified employees who have submitted transfer requests pursuant to Section 2.06B6 will be matched to jobs by seniority.
c.	Employees will have two (2) work days to accept or decline a job offer. Employees in a surplus work group who choose not to accept an offer for a position for which they had submitted in accordance with Section 2.06B6 will leave the service of the Companies.
d.	Employees who accept jobs outside the CWA bargaining unit will assume the representation status of those jobs.
e.	The Placement Areas for employees covered by this Contract are:
1.	For California employees:
Bay	Los Angeles
North Coast	Orange/Riverside
Sacramento/North	San Diego/Imperial
Valley Central Coast
2.	For Nevada employees:
The State of Nevada
f.	The Rearrangement Areas for employees covered by this Contract are:
1.	Southern California from the Tehachapi mountains to the Mexican Border for employees working in Southern California.
2.	Northern California from the Tehachapi mountains to the Oregon border for employees working in Northern California.

ARTICLE 2
17
7.	If the procedures described in Sections 2.06B3 through 2.06B6 have not resolved a declared surplus at the conclusion of thirty (30) calendar days including the date of the declaration, the remaining least senior identified surplus employees in the work group will be offered the Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO) as described in Section 2.07K. Employees may elect the VSRO or elect to be assigned to available Regular full-time positions (i.e., lateral, downgrade, commutable, non-commutable) within the CWA bargaining unit. Regular employees in the surplus work group may also continue to volunteer for lateral and downgrade positions as described in Section 2.06B6a until the Companies determine that the surplus is resolved in their work group.
a.	The Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO) includes Separation Benefits as described in Section 2.07, an additional $3,000 and eighteen (18) months unlimited access to AUTS with selection status the same as that of employees requesting changes of job titles and/or locations (see Section 2.04B1c).
b.	Least senior identified surplus employees will have five (5) calendar days within which to make their election between VSRO or assignment.
c.	Qualified least senior identified surplus employees who decline VSRO or who do not make any election within the five (5) calendar days will be assigned to available positions.
d.	The order of selection will be:
1.	by seniority, qualified volunteers in the surplus work group;
2.	qualified least senior identified surplus employees who remain surplus after the thirty (30) day voluntary phase described in Section 2.06B6.
e.	Qualified least senior identified surplus employees will be assigned in the following order:
•	lateral jobs within the Placement Area by seniority;
•	downgrade jobs within the Placement Area by seniority;
•	lateral jobs within the Rearrangement Area by inverse seniority;
18
•	downgrade jobs within the Rearrangement Area by inverse seniority;
•	lateral jobs within California for employees of the Companies in California by inverse seniority;
•	downgrade jobs within California for employees of the Companies in California by inverse seniority.
f.	If the Companies deem appropriate, certain qualifications may be waived under the provisions of this Section 2.06B7.
g.	Employees who choose not to accept an offer for a job which is a commutable lateral position will leave the service of the Companies. Employees who choose not to accept an offer for a job which is a downgrade and/or non-com-mutable position will leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits and eighteen (18) months unlimited access to AUTS with selection status the same as that of employees requesting changes of job titles and/or locations (see Section 2.04B1c).
8.	Those employees placed through the force movement process will have Return Rights for up to twenty-four (24) months from the effective date of their assignment.
a.	Those employees with Return Rights will have up to twenty-four (24) months unlimited access to AUTS for any regular position.
b.	Those employees with Return Rights will have concurrent consideration with candidates described in Sections 2.04B1c and 2.04B1d and priority selection status if equally qualified with the most qualified candidate of those described in Sections 2.04B1c and 2.04B1d.
c.	Return Rights will cease when an employee is placed in a position through AUTS prior to the expiration of the twenty-four (24) month period.
d.	Notwithstanding any other provisions in the contract, employees with Return Rights who accept positions through AUTS will not be entitled to Relocation Expense reimbursement.
ARTICLE 2
19
9.	Employees who accept downgrade positions under Section 2.06 will be entitled to Reassignment Pay Protection Plan Benefits as described below:
LESS THAN 15 YEARS OF NET CREDIT SERVICE
WEEKS	WAGE	REDUCTION
1 through 52	None
53 through 57	1/3
58 through 62	2/3
63 & thereafter	Full
15 OR MORE YEARS OF NET CREDITED SERVICE
WEEKS	WAGE	REDUCTION
1 through 160	None
161 through 164	1/3
165 through 168	2/3
169 & thereafter	Full
10.	There are no retreat rights for employees placed into available jobs under the provisions of Section 2.06. However, employees who fail formal training after such placement will be returned to their former organizations, will be placed back into the force movement process and will be assigned to a Regular full-time (lateral/downgrade) position as described in Section 2.06B7.
11.	The Companies may engage in selective hiring during the Force Movement Process.
C.	If no Regular jobs are available, the remaining surplus employees will be offered the opportunity to either replace certain commutable contract labor if appropriate, or to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits. Surplus employees who fail to make a choice relative to available contract jobs will leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits.
1.	Qualified employees who replace contract labor will be entitled to Reassignment Pay Protection Plan Benefits as described in Section 2.06B9. For purposes of determining the appropriate wage reduction, the competitive wage rate (prevailing rate for the contract job minus the value of Company-paid benefits) will be considered the wage rate of the contract job. Assignments involving the replacement of contract labor will be considered temporary until a Regular job is available.
20
a.	Employees in temporary contract jobs will be automatically matched in order of seniority to Regular lateral or downgrade jobs as positions become available. Employees may express their preferences for reassignment by submitting transfer requests through the Automated Upgrade and Transfer System. They may designate any lateral or downgrade job titles as the job titles in which they wish to be placed should vacancies occur.
b.	Employees in temporary contract jobs who choose not to accept an offer of a Regular job will leave the service of the Companies.
D.	At any time during the force movement process, if the Companies determine that surplus has been resolved in a work group, the Companies may rearrange the force as described in Section 2.05B.
E.	In the event that no commutable contract jobs are offered to surplus employees, the remaining surplus will be maintained until such time as a Regular lateral or downgrade job may be offered, or until the Companies inform the National Union in writing of their intent to lay off Regular employees.
1.	Maintained surplus employees who choose not to accept a commutable lateral job offer will leave the service of the Companies. Maintained surplus employees who choose not to accept a downgrade or a non-commutable job offer will leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits.
2.	Maintained surplus employees may, at the Companies’ discretion, be placed into commutable part-time jobs, if such jobs are available. Surplus employees who choose not to accept an offer of a commutable part-time job will leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits.
F.	Managers may be reassigned to the bargaining unit utilizing either of the following provisions:
1.	Management employees may be reassigned to the bargaining unit provided there are no significantly qualified employees (i.e., employees who perform similar work, as determined by the Companies) with greater seniority available to fill the vacancy with a transfer request on file for the position to which the manager would be assigned.
ARTICLE 2
21
2.	An administrative addition may be created, whereby the management employee may be reassigned to the work group.
3.	If a manager (who has been a manager for six (6) continuous months or more immediately prior to the reassignment) is reassigned to the bargaining unit, surplus shall not be declared in that work group for six (6) months or until the force level is reduced to the level which existed in that work group prior to the reassignment of the manager, whichever occurs first.
Section 2.07 SEPARATION BENEFITS (For Pacific Bell Home Entertainment, see Appendix B, Section B2.01)
A.	If during the term of this agreement, the Companies notify the National Union in writing that a surplus condition exists for any reason that will necessitate the reassignment of Regular employees, and the Companies deem it appropriate, the Companies may offer Separation Benefits in such job titles and such work locations as the Companies determine to be appropriate. If the Companies elect to so offer, Regular employees may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits subject to the following conditions:
1.	The Companies will determine the job titles and work locations in which the surplus exists, the number of employees in such titles and work locations who are considered to be surplus and the period during which the employee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the Companies. None of the determinations by the Companies nor any part of this Section 2.07 will be subject to arbitration.
2.	The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits shall not exceed the number of employees determined by the Companies to be surplus.
3.	An employee’s election to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits must be in writing and transmitted to the Companies within ten (10) calendar days including the date of the offer. The employee may designate on the election form that the election is to be effective and irrevocable immediately. If
22
the employee does not so designate, such election may not be revoked after the ten (10) calendar day period.
B.	If the Companies deem it appropriate, they may elect to offer Separation Benefits to selected titles in a work group (see Section 2.06B1a) as a force management tool. The Companies will notify the National Union in writing when any such offer is made. The Companies also will, in advance of making this offer to employees, discuss the matter with the affected Union Local(s). After this discussion, if the Companies elect to so offer, Regular employees may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits subject to the following conditions:
1.	The Companies will determine the job titles and the work locations for which the offer is to be made, the number of employees who may accept the offer and the period during which the employees may, if they so elect, leave the service of the Companies. None of the determinations of the Companies nor any part of this Section 2.07 will be subject to arbitration.
2.	The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits shall not exceed the number of employees identified by the Companies on the date of the offer to be appropriate.
3.	An employee’s election to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits must be in writing and transmitted to the Companies within ten (10) calendar days including the date of the offer. The employee may designate on the election form that the election is to be effective and irrevocable immediately. If the employee does not so designate, such election may not be revoked after the ten (10) calendar day period.
C.	Employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits will receive payments based on the employee’s net credited service and basic weekly wage rate at the time of leaving the Companies as indicated below:

D.	Employees may select one of the following payment options for Separation Benefits:
1.	A single payment paid by the end of the month following the month in which the employee separates; or
2.	A single payment paid at the end of the first quarter of the year following separation; or
3.	A partial payment, in the amount determined by the employee, paid by the end of the month following the month in which the employee separates, with payment of the balance deferred until the end of the first quarter of the year following separation; or
24
4.	Monthly payments beginning the month following the month in which the employee leaves the service of the Companies until all payments have been made.
E.	The years of net credited service will be prorated for any period during which an employee is employed on a part-time basis in the same manner as calculated in the Pacific Telesis Group Pension Plan.
F.	As used in this Section, “basic weekly wage rate (or its equivalent)” does not include differentials, overtime or any other extra payments.
G.	At the time of reemployment with the Companies, a recipient of the Separation Benefits must repay the entire unused portion of the payment (the number of weeks of payment minus the number of weeks off the payroll). Repayment may be made in whole or by payroll deductions in each payroll period. Deductions will be made at the rate of at least ten (10) percent per week of the employee’s basic weekly wage rate. The entire amount must be repaid within twelve (12) months of reemployment.
H.	In those cases where payment has been deferred and the employee has not received final payment at the time of reemployment, the employee will receive a single payment for the actual number of weeks off the payroll.
I.	In those cases where the recipient has elected, or is receiving, monthly payments of Separation Benefits, such payments will be suspended upon reemployment with the Companies.
J.	Employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive Separation Benefits will continue to receive six (6) months of continued Company paid medical, dental and vision coverage, beginning on the date of their separation, with eligibility for COBRA coverage beginning at the end of the continued Company paid coverage.
K.	Least senior identified surplus employees within a surplus work group that remain surplus after the thirty (30) day voluntary phase of the force movement process described in Section 2.06B6 will be offered and may elect, in order of seniority, to leave the service of the Companies and receive the Voluntary Surplus Reduction Option (VSRO) subject to the following conditions. VSRO includes:
•	Separation Benefits as described above in Section 2.07
•	$3,000 added to the Separation Benefits payment
•	Eighteen (18) months unlimited access to AUTS
ARTICLE 2
25
1.	The Companies will determine the period during which the employee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the Companies. None of the determinations by the Companies nor any part of this Section 2.07K will be subject to arbitration.
2.	The number of employees who elect to leave the service of the Companies and receive VSRO shall not exceed the number of employees determined by the Companies to be surplus.
3.	An employee’s election to leave the service of the Companies and receive VSRO must be in writing and transmitted to the Companies within five (5) calendar days of the last day in the thirty (30) day voluntary phase of the force movement process. Such election may not be revoked after the five (5) calendar day period.
4.	The $3,000 will be added to and paid with Separation Benefits in the manner elected as a payment option under Section 2.07D.
5.	At the time of reemployment with the Companies, a recipient of VSRO must repay the entire unused portion of the payment (the number of weeks of payment minus the number of weeks off the payroll). The $3,000 will equate to four (4) weeks of pay and that four (4) weeks will be added to the number of weeks of Separation Benefits for this purpose. Repayment may be made in whole or by payroll deductions as described in Section 2.07G.
6.	In those cases where payment has been deferred and the employee has not received final payment at the time of reemployment, the employee will receive a single payment for the actual number of weeks off the payroll calculated as described in Section 2.07K5 above.
7.	In those cases where the recipient has elected, or is receiving, monthly payments of VSRO (i.e., the $3,000 added to and paid with Separation Benefits), such payments will be suspended upon reemployment with the Companies.
Section 2.08 RELOCATION EXPENSE (The provisions of this section do not apply to Pacific Bell Home Entertainment)
A.	Employees who, in the judgment of the Companies, are required to relocate their residence as a result of a permanent Company-initiated transfer shall receive reimbursement for reasonable moving expenses
26
as agreed upon from time to time between the Companies and the National Union.
1.	Employees accepting non-commutable positions under Sections 2.05, 2.06B, 2.06C, 2.06D and 2.06E will be entitled to relocation expense reimbursement.
B.	If there is no change of residence, as covered in Section 2.08A, the employee will not receive any reimbursement for moving expenses under this Section 2.08.
C.	When an employee requests a change of headquarters, the expenses involved in such change shall be borne by the employee.
D.	When an employee is returned to a previously held work assignment because of failure to meet performance requirements in connection with an employee-initiated transfer, any cost incurred by the returned employee will be borne by the employee.
E.	For the purposes of this Article, an assignment shall be considered non-commutable if the distance from the employee’s permanent residence to the new work location is greater than that from the employee’s permanent residence to the former work location and the actual one-way commuting distance exceeds forty-five (45) miles or the actual one-way commuting time is greater than sixty (60) minutes by personal vehicle or greater than ninety (90) minutes by public transportation.
Section 2.09 ASSIGNMENT OF HEADQUARTERS (For Pacific Bell Home Entertainment, see Appendix B, Section B2.08)
A.	For purposes of this Article, the term “headquarters” shall be understood to mean the exchange (or the consolidated exchange area), as described in Section 2.09B, to which the employee is permanently assigned.
B.	Certain exchanges have been consolidated in order to facilitate force movements within general geographical areas. The exchanges and consolidated exchange areas (underlined) listed below are considered headquarters for purposes of this Article.

The Companies agree to meet with the Union upon the Union’s request to discuss any aspect of the job evaluation process which led to the Companies’ decision regarding the recommended title and/or wage schedule, including the rationale used by the Companies to arrive at the Companies’ recommended title and/or wage schedule.
D.	Within thirty (30) calendar days from the Union’s receipt of the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice or no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the Union’s receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice, the Union shall have the right to initiate negotiations concerning the wage rates or schedules established or changed by the Companies.
E.	If negotiations are not so initiated within the thirty (30) calendar day periods described in Section 4.01D or if agreement is reached between the parties concerning the wage rates and schedules within sixty (60) calendar days following receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the wage rates and schedules set by the Companies or agreed to by the Parties, shall remain in effect.
F.	If negotiations are so initiated pursuant to Section 4.01D and if the parties are unable to reach agreement on the schedule of wage rates within sixty (60) calendar days following the Union’s receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the Union must notify the Companies in writing of its intention
50
to submit the issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates to a Neutral Third Party for resolution, to be selected as set forth in Section 4.01G.
NOTE: The Union’s written notice shall specify the wage schedule the Union believes should be assigned to the job in question and the reasons why.
If such notification is not received by the Companies within sixty (60) days of the Union’s receipt of the Section 4.01A2 follow-up notice or the Section 4.01B2 reclassification notice, the matter shall be considered settled in the Companies’ favor and shall not be subject to further handling under this procedure, nor may the issue be submitted to the problem resolution, grievance and arbitration procedures.
G.	The Neutral Third Party previously referred to shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties from a panel of six (6) arbitrators selected for their expertise in the field of job evaluation.
The members of the panel may be changed by mutual agreement of the parties. Though the panel members will normally receive first consideration, the parties reserve the right to jointly select a Neutral Third Party outside of the panel to serve on an ad hoc basis.
1.	The Neutral Third Party will render a written decision within fifteen (15) working days after the hearing.
2.	The Neutral Third Party is empowered to decide only whether the wage schedule assigned by the Companies or the wage schedule requested by the Union is the appropriate wage schedule.
3.	The Neutral Third Party is not empowered to assign a wage schedule and title classification that is not currently contained in the collective bargaining agreement or to render a decision on any other issues.
4.	The Neutral Third Party shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify any provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
H.	The procedures set forth in Section 4.01 shall be the exclusive means by which the Union may dispute the schedule of wage rates which the Companies set for any new, restructured or redefined job title or classification established by Section(s) 4.01A and B. Disputes regarding job classifications which are not governed by this Section 4.01 may be
ARTICLE 4
51
pursued under the Problem Resolution Procedures set forth in Article 7.
Section 4.02 ASSIGNING TITLES
A.	The assignment of particular titles to employees with titles listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01, A3.01 and A4.01 and Appendix B, does not mean that they shall perform only the kind of work coming under their title classification, nor that certain kinds of work shall be performed exclusively by certain classifications of employees.
B.	Except as provided for in Appendix A, Sections A3.05B and C an employee assigned to work falling in a higher wage group (other than work incidental to the lower classification) shall, during the period the employee is assigned to work falling in a higher wage group, be assigned a title in the wage group in which the employee works a greater part of the normal workweek for a period of one week or more.
C.	Employees who are regularly assigned to work coming under more than one (1) title classification listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01 and A2.01, or Appendix B, which carry identical wages and working conditions, shall be classified under the title which covers the work on which they are engaged for the greater part of the time.
Section 4.03 PART-TIME, TERM, TEMPORARY AND OCCASIONAL EMPLOYEES
A.	PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
A part-time employee is one who is employed and normally scheduled to work less hours per average month than a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group working the same normal daily tour. Treatment of a part-time employee under the Companies’ benefit plans and payment programs is dependent on the employee’s “average workweek” and whether the employee is “grandfathered.”
1.	“GRANDFATHERED” PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
a.	Certain part-time employees shall be “grandfathered” as follows:
1.	Regular part-time employees who were on the active payroll of the Companies as of December 31, 1980
52
and who were classified as part-time on August 9, 1992 shall be “grandfathered” so long as they continue to be classified as part-time; and
2.	Regular employees who were on the active payroll of the Companies as of December 31, 1980, who were classified as full-time on August 9, 1992, and who become classified as part-time as a result of surplus in which there are no Regular commutable full-time jobs available for which they are qualified, shall be “grandfathered” so long as they continue to be classified as part-time, unless and until such time as they have been offered, and have rejected, the opportunity to be placed in a commutable Regular full-time job.
b.	“Grandfathered” employees shall, during the applicable term of part-time employment, receive payments under benefit plans and payment programs on the same basis as was applicable to part-time employees on December 31, 1980.
2.	ALL OTHER PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
All part-time employees who are not “grandfathered” shall receive payments under the Companies’ benefit plans and payment programs as described in this section.
a.	Part-time employees who are not “grandfathered” include, but are not limited to:
1.	Employees who were on the active payroll of the Companies as of December 31, 1980 and who were not classified as part-time on August 9, 1992; and
2.	Regular part-time employees who were hired or rehired on or after January 1, 1981.
b.	When an employee begins working part-time the “average workweek” will be determined in advance by dividing the employee’s normally expected scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (For example: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6, rounded to an average workweek of 16 hours). This “average workweek” will apply until an employee has worked a full calendar quarter as a part-time employee.
ARTICLE 4
53
c.	After an employee has worked a full calendar quarter as a part-time employee, the “average workweek” will be redetermined as of the end of each calendar quarter during which the employee was classified as a part-time employee for the entire quarter. The “average workweek” for the following quarter will be determined by averaging all hours worked during the prior quarter. This average includes:
(1)	Hours worked up to a maximum of eight (8) per day or forty (40) per week; and
(2)	Hours scheduled or assigned to be worked but excused, paid or unpaid.
(3)	The total of (1) & (2) above will be limited to a maximum of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) per week.
d.	For periods of service as a part-time employee after January 1, 1993, proration calculations for wages or service for each of the following benefit plans and payment programs will be based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee’s “average workweek” to a forty (40) hour workweek:
Pension Plan
Comprehensive Disability Benefit Plan
Life Insurance Plans
Savings Plan
Severance Plans
Vacation, Holiday and Paid Personal Days Off Sickness Absence Payments
Team Performance Award
The revised calculation method will not apply retroactively, and employees receiving disability benefits under the Comprehensive Disability Benefits Plan, sickness absence payments, or vacation payments on January 1, 1993 will continue to receive the same level of benefits until their eligibility for such benefits or payments expires.
e.	Monthly contributions to the Medical, Dental and Vision Plans will be prorated using the same percentage calculated in Section 4.03A2b or 4.03A2c as applicable. The Companies will pay that percent of the cost of coverage for
54
Medical, Dental and Vision care. The part-time employee will pay the difference between the Company contributions and the cost of the plan.
3.	A part-time employee shall not be paid Sickness Absence payments under Section 5.01F unless such absence due to sickness occurs on a day of the week on which the employee is normally scheduled to work and a full-time employee in the same circumstance would be paid.
B.	TERM EMPLOYEES:
Term employees are those engaged for a specific project or limited period with the definite understanding that their employment is to terminate upon completion of the project or at the end of the period. Employment is expected to continue for more than one (1) year, but no more than three (3) years. Term employees are covered by all provisions of this Contract except where otherwise provided.
Term employees are not to be assigned work which would directly result in the surplus or layoff of Regular employees in the same title and administrative unit to which they are assigned.
C.	TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES
1.	Temporary employees are those engaged for a specific project or a limited period, with the definite understanding that their employment is to terminate upon completion of the project or at the end of the period, and whose employment is expected to continue for more than three consecutive weeks but not for more than one year.
2.	All Temporary employees shall be advised of their employment status and all pertinent information related thereto at the time of hiring.
3.	All provisions of this Contract shall apply to Temporary employees, except where otherwise provided.
4.	Should the term of employment of a Temporary employee exceed one year, then the employee will be reclassified to a Term employee effective with the first day following the completion of one year.
a.	The maximum term of employment for a Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under the provisions
ARTICLE 4
55
of this Section 4.03C4 will be three (3) years from the date of hiring as a Temporary employee.
b.	A Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under the provisions of this Section 4.03C4 will be eligible for Term employee benefits as described in Section 4.03E from the time of reclassification.
c.	A Temporary employee who is reclassified to Term under the provisions of this Section 4.03C4 will be eligible for vacation and Personal Days Off in accordance with the provisions of Article 6, Sections 6.02A1 and 6.04 applicable to Term employees, from the date of reclassification. However, nothing in this Section will cause such a reclassified employee to receive more vacation or Personal Days Off than they would have received had they been classified as a Term employee from the date of hiring as a Temporary employee.
D.	OCCASIONAL EMPLOYEES
An Occasional employee is one who is engaged on a daily basis for a period of not more than three (3) consecutive weeks, or for a cumulative total of not more than thirty (30) days, in any calendar year, regardless of the length of the daily or weekly assignments. An Occasional employee who actually works or is engaged to work in excess of three (3) consecutive weeks or thirty (30) days in a calendar year shall be reclassified as a Regular or Temporary, full-time or part-time employee as appropriate.
E.	BENEFIT ELIGIBILITY
Employees are eligible to participate in employee benefit plans and other payment programs as shown below. Specific eligibility requirements are as described in individual plan documents or terms described elsewhere in the Contract or Company policies.

WORK ADMINISTRATION, COMPENSATION AND SPECIAL PAYMENTS
Section 5.01 WAGE SCHEDULES AND PAYMENTS
A.	Employees in titles listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01, A4.01 or Appendix B shall be paid at their weekly basic rate of pay for forty (40) hours of work. Employees in titles listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01 shall be paid at the basic rate per week as established for their respective title classifications. The wage schedules and top rates of pay shall be as stated in Appendix C3 of this Contract.
In any case where a Company building is located upon property which lies within two (2) exchanges, and if such exchanges are classified differently for wage rate purposes, any employee who is regularly assigned to report for work in such a Company building shall be paid at the wage rate that pertains to the higher exchange classification.
B.	Except as provided in Section 5.01D, wage increases in the amounts shown in the schedules shall be granted automatically on completion of the time intervals specified.
1.	No wage increase shall become effective during a period of absence in excess of seven (7) calendar days, paid vacations excepted.
a.	A period of absence of seven (7) calendar days or less shall have no effect on the establishment of the effective date of increase.
b.	If the effective date for a scheduled increase occurs during a period of absence in excess of seven (7) calendar days, but not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, the increase will become effective on the day the employee returns to work. Such adjustment in the effective date of this increase shall not change the date from which the time interval for the next increase would otherwise be computed.
c.	If the effective date for a scheduled increase occurs during a period of absence of over thirty (30) calendar days, the first thirty (30) calendar days of such absence shall be credited to the employee’s previously accrued time on the wage
59
ARTICLE 5
progression schedule and the increase shall become effective either on the day the employee returns to work if the employee has been credited with the necessary time interval for the next increase, or after the employee has worked the remainder of the applicable wage progression time interval.
2.	In no case shall the application of the provisions of this Section 5.01B operate to make an increase effective on a date earlier than would have resulted had no absence occurred.
C.	When an employee is absent for more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, only the first thirty (30) calendar days of such absence shall be credited to the employee’s previously accrued total schedule time on the wage schedule.
D.	FLEXIBLE STARTING RATES
1.	When, in the judgment of the Companies, an increase becomes desirable in starting rates for any or all title classifications in a particular exchange listed in Appendix C4 of this Contract, the Companies will so notify the Union and will discuss with the Union both the starting rate and method of progression from the new starting rate to the particular existing schedule.
2.	If the Union and the Companies reach an agreement thereon, the schedule for such title classification or title classifications between the points where the old schedule is reached and the maximum rate, as well as the overall schedule length, will remain unchanged; and the employees to whom such altered schedule applies will be placed on the altered schedule with the same total schedule time they had on the previous schedule.
3.	If the Companies and the Union fail to reach agreement within fifteen (15) days after the above date of notification of said proposal, such schedule shall remain unchanged.
4.	The Companies may discontinue or reduce the amount of such increased starting rates at any time but such discontinuance or reduction shall not cause a decrease in the wage rate of any employee whose wage rate was increased under Subparagraph 1 or 2 of this Section 5.01D. The application of this Subparagraph 4 shall not result in starting rates lower than those on the old schedule.
60
E.	An employee hired with previous wage experience credit, military service, technical training, typing or key punch skills useful to the Companies shall be granted wage credit in accordance with the wage credit practice agreement.
F.	All employees with at least one (1) year of service shall be paid for sickness absence beginning with the first scheduled working day of absence. Sickness absence payments shall be limited to a maximum of five (5) days in the seven (7) day period.
1.	The scheduled working days referred to in this Section 5.01F shall be computed in accordance with the pattern of scheduled days of the workweek in which the sickness absence first occurred regardless of the number of scheduled workdays in that week. This pattern shall be deemed to continue into all subsequent workweeks of such absence for determining work time lost and days for which sickness absence should be paid.
2.	Sickness absence shall not be deemed to continue into the second workweek unless such absence includes the first scheduled day of the original work schedule for the second week.
G.	When employees report on the job for duty on a scheduled day and subsequently become sick and are excused by the supervisor before completion of their tour of duty, they will be paid at straight time for the remainder of the full tour of duty for which scheduled.
H.	Sickness absence payments referred to in Sections 5.01F and 5.01G above shall include any shift or job differentials which the employee would have received had the employee worked, but shall not include any extra payments which would have been received had the employee worked, such as Sunday, holiday, or overtime extra payments.
I.	The supervisor shall decide whether employees with titles listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01, A2.01 or Appendix B, shall work or be excused from duty because of bad weather conditions. If the supervisor decides that the employees cannot work, they shall be paid for the balance of the half-tour that they were excused from duty. If the employees are notified at or before noon, no payment will be made for the afternoon. Employees who do not report for duty shall not be paid under the provisions of this Section.
ARTICLE 5
61
J.	When an employee in titles listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01, is transferred from night work to day or evening work at management’s request and loses a day’s work opportunity because of the transfer, wage payment shall be made for the day lost at straight-time at the employee’s normal rate of pay.
K.	Employees shall be paid bi-weekly, payment of wages due for the two-week pay-period to be made when practicable not later than the Friday following the last day of the pay-period. When practicable, paychecks shall be distributed in sufficient time to permit employees to cash their checks within normal banking hours on the regular pay day.
Section 5.02 RELIEF DIFFERENTIALS
A.	A fixed relief differential of eight dollars ($8.00) a day will be paid to any employee in any title who, in addition to normal duties or in the performance of a new assignment, temporarily relieves or assists a manager for a half tour or more. These assignments may involve planning, distributing, directing, coordinating and training responsibilities other than induction or orientation. The assignment specifically excludes disciplining.
B.	A three dollar ($3.00) daily differential will be paid when an Operator relieves a Service Assistant, Service Assistant-Bilingual or a Central Office Associate for a half tour or more.

1.	An employee in a title listed in Appendix A, Sections A1.01 or A2.01 shall receive a shift differential in the amount of ten (10) percent of the employee’s weekly basic rate of pay, except that when premium payments are paid for a temporary change of shift in accordance with Appendix A, Section A1.05D, or A2.03F as appropriate, a shift differential will not be paid.
62
Note: An employee who works a scheduled shift on a Sunday or Holiday, any part of which falls after 7:00 P.M. or prior to 6:00 A.M., shall receive a shift differential without regard to his/her regular shift.

b.	When only a part of the week is involved, the differential shall be prorated on the basis of a five (5) day week, that is, one (1) day’s differential is one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly differential.
c.	An employee receiving a differential who is temporarily assigned to a day shift in connection with training assignments, vacation reliefs or training reliefs for a period of one (1) week or more but less than two (2) weeks shall retain the shift differential but shall not receive premium pay for the change of shift. Such vacation relief shall be deemed to include any additional days which the employee on vacation may take immediately preceding or following the employee’s vacation.

63
ARTICLE 5
a.	The shift differential paid under the provisions of Section 5.03A2 shall be added to the basic rate of pay in computing vacation, overtime, holiday and Sunday payments.
b.	The shift differential shall be for a full-time week of five (5) shifts. When an employee works less than a full-time week of five (5) shifts to which a differential is applicable, the shift differential will be prorated; that is, one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly differential will be paid for each full shift worked for which the differential is provided in Section 5.03A2.

Section 5.04 OVERTIME AND CALL-OUTS (For Pacific Bell Home Entertainment, see Appendix B, Section B2.05)
A.	The provisions of this Section apply to all employees unless otherwise specified. Refer to Appendix A for additional overtime and premium payments provisions.

For employees having titles listed in Appendix A, Section A3.01, time worked on weekdays in excess of a full tour of duty (eight hours for an 8-hour tour, seven and one-half hours for a 7-1/2 hour tour, seven hours for a 7-hour tour, or six hours for a 6-hour tour) shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) hours’ pay for each hour worked.
E.	Time paid for but not worked on a holiday which falls Monday through Friday in the calendar week, and time paid for but not worked on Personal Days Off shall be included when determining time worked in excess of the normal workweek (or its equivalent for employees identified in the Paragraph directly above). The following time shall be excluded when determining time worked in excess of the normal workweek or its equivalent:

If a call-out as specified in Section 5.04H above results in an employee working eight (8) hours at one and one-half (1-1/2) hours’ pay for each hour worked, such time may be considered in lieu of a regular tour/shift, and, at management’s discretion, the employee may be relieved from duty.
I.	When employees are called for work which requires their immediate services, work time starts from time of notification. The minimum time paid for shall be two (2) hours and shall be paid for at the rates applicable (premium, holiday, straight-time, etc.). Normal traveling time to home will be included except when:

2.	An employee entitled to receive the per diem allowance and lodging at the Companies’ expense under Section 5.05A1 may, upon proper management approval and in lieu of the per diem allowance and lodging at the Companies’ expense, be granted home board and lodging allowance at the rate of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per day when the nature of the work will permit and the employee establishes a bona fide home at the location of the work. When such home board and lodging is authorized, it shall
ARTICLE 5
67
also be paid for periods not worked on Sundays, holidays, days absent due to weather conditions and other authorized absence not including vacations.
3.	An employee entitled to receive the per diem allowance and lodging at the Companies’ expense under Section 5.05A1 may, upon proper management approval, be granted an allowance at the rate of thirty-five dollars ($35.00) per day for each day worked in lieu of the per diem allowance and lodging at the Companies’ expense when the location of the work permits travel on the employee’s own time and expense, between the employee’s bona fide home and the location of the job. In such cases, the thirty-five dollar ($35.00) allowance will only be paid for the days actually worked.
4.

E.	VACATION PAY - AS OF JANUARY 1, 1993 FOR PART-TIME EMPLOYEES WHO ARE NOT “GRANDFATHERED” (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 4.03A2)

B.	Unpaid time off will include approved leaves of absence. A leave of absence for personal reasons is a privilege which may be granted to employees rather than a right to which they are entitled. Granting a leave of absence for a period of over thirty (30) days does not guarantee the employee will be given a position when the leave expires unless agreed to in writing at the time the leave is granted.
Section 6.06 PLANNED TIME OFF
The scheduling of planned time off will be in seniority order within individual work groups. It is the intent of the parties that employees’ selections will be granted to the extent practicable consistent with force requirements and the needs of the service.

1.	Vacation - full week
2.	Vacation/Personal Day Off - day-at-a-time
3.	Personal Day Off - two (2) hour increments
B.	Vacation schedules will be prepared by the Companies for each occupational and administrative unit except as provided in Section 6.06B1. The selection of vacation dates within each schedule will be on the basis of net credited service as shown by the records of the Companies, except as provided elsewhere in this Section or unless otherwise agreed to.
ARTICLE 6
79
1.	Prior to the preparation of vacation schedules for any vacation year, the district level representative of the Companies will meet with the President and his or her designated representative of the Union Local involved to discuss the appropriate employee groups, comprising the employees within the district level’s jurisdiction, for which such schedules shall be prepared. In the event of failure to reach agreement, final determination of the appropriate employee groups shall be made by the Department Head or the Department Head’s authorized representative.
2.	Each employee in the bargaining unit defined in Appendix A, Section A2.01, except Operations Administrator, Data Administrator, Nevada employees and in other bargaining units as agreed to by the parties, will have a first choice before anyone who splits their vacation makes a second choice.

3.	An employee transferred at management direction will retain any vacation period(s) previously scheduled and approved.

D.	Prior to the beginning of the vacation year, management will canvass the work group to allow the employees to select vacation and Personal Days off from available dates. The period during which vacation and Personal Days Off can be chosen by seniority rights will cover the 15 months from December 31st of the current year through March of the subsequent vacation year.

G.	It is recommended that all employees take at least 10 days off (vaca-tion/Personal Days Off) in the vacation year earned for the sake of their well being.
H.	No work will be scheduled on a vacation day or Personal Day Off. A vacation week is a calendar week, Sunday through Saturday. When an employee’s vacation period spans a full week, no work will be scheduled the Saturday prior to, or Sunday following, the vacation week.
I.	All vacation may be taken in increments of less than a full week.
J.	A vacation week of the new year may begin on Sunday of the same week in which December 31 falls on or before Wednesday.
K.	Vacation weeks and Personal Days Off carried over from the previous vacation year through March 31 of the subsequent vacation year have precedence over selection of current year Time Off only in the first three (3) months of the vacation year. Any Time Off carried over from one vacation year to the next and not taken by the last day of March will be secondary in terms of scheduling to the selection of time off for the current vacation year.
Payment will be made in lieu of all vacation and Personal Days Off carried over from the previous vacation year which are not taken by December 30 of the following vacation year.
L.	The Companies will not pay any expenses including per diem and lodging incurred by employees when they take individual vacation days or Personal Days Off while working at a non-commutable temporary work location.
M. When employees return to work from sickness or accident disability, and they have not taken all vacation and/or Personal Days Off for which eligible for the vacation year, they may take whatever can be accommodated within the remainder of the current vacation year through the end of the next vacation year. Time off carried over from the previous vacation year, and taken during the first quarter of the next vacation year under this provision will take precedence over vacation selection for the current vacation year, but will be secondary to vacation carried over under the provisions of Section 6.06K.
ARTICLE 6
81
N.	Employees going on a leave of absence may receive pay in lieu of vacation they are eligible to receive or take the vacation upon their return. Should the employee return during the same 24 month period in which time off can be taken, he or she will receive whatever vacation and Personal Days Off that can be accommodated during the remainder of the period. Payment will be made in lieu of any time off not used.
O.	Individuals leaving the employ of the Company shall receive payment in lieu of vacation and Personal Days Off to which they are eligible provided they have worked during the vacation year and have not had all of the vacation and Personal Days Off to which they are eligible during such period. This includes pro-rata payment of earned vacation for those employees who terminate with less than one year of service.
P.	For purposes of tracking or making payment in lieu of vacation or Personal Days Off, all time off earned in the previous vacation year must be taken before any time off for the current vacation year can be taken. For scheduling purposes, all other Paragraphs in this Section, 6.06, shall apply.
82
ARTICLE 7
PROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCEDURES
Section 7.01	The Companies and the Union agree that timely interaction on issues can eliminate the cause for most grievances. While management maintains the right and responsibility to make decisions which affect the business, the parties will endeavor to jointly evaluate and plan proposed actions that affect the employees, the Union and the Companies.
Section 7.02	REQUEST FOR UNION REPRESENTATION
The Companies shall release the appropriate Union representatives who are required by the Problem Resolution Procedures.

1.	The employee shall be informed of the subject of the meeting at any formal level of discipline or investigatory interview prior to the meeting.
2.	The Union representative and the employee shall be allowed a reasonable period of time to consult prior to the meeting, if requested.

We must initiate communication to prevent problems as most problems can be prevented through timely, open and honest communication.
A.	When operational changes are being considered in a work area that will significantly affect the working conditions of one or more employees, the manager will communicate these anticipated changes and the reasons for them to the appropriate Union representative and solicit any input to improve the effectiveness for all concerned. This communication will generally occur not less than ten (10) calendar days in advance of the effective date of such anticipated changes. In matters requiring immediate implementation, the minimum time frame shall not apply. In these cases, communication and solicitation for input from the Union will be conducted at the earliest practical opportunity.
ARTICLE 7
83
Subsequently, where agreement is reached, communication to the employees will be conducted jointly by the manager and the Union representative. In all cases, communication to the affected employees will not occur prior to a discussion with the appropriate Union representative.
B.	When an employee is trending toward disciplinary action for job performance, for example attendance, quality, quantity, etc., management will normally involve the Union and solicit its input and assistance. The manager and the Union representative will work jointly to identify and eliminate the cause of the employee’s problem to prevent it from recurring.
C.	When a Union representative identifies an issue or dispute in the work area, he or she will interact with the appropriate manager in the work area. An effort should be made by both parties to resolve the problem.

E.	The first day of the arbitration hearing will be held within six (6) months from the date of the Union’s notification in writing of its intent to arbitrate the grievance. If the arbitration request involves an employee’s dismissal and the six (6) month time limit is exceeded, the period used for computation of any back pay liability for the Company shall not exceed a date six (6) months from the date of the Union’s notification of intent to arbitrate the dismissal issue, except when the time limit has been extended by mutual agreement.
Section 7.11	ARBITRATOR

Upon receipt of the Union’s intent to arbitrate, each case will be automatically assigned to an available arbitrator. The first case so heard under this procedure shall be assigned to the arbitrator appearing first on the panel. Subsequent arbitration requests shall be assigned to other arbitrators in the order of their sequential assignment to the panel.

ARTICLE 7
91
hearing date can be scheduled in accordance with the time limits of this Section.
2.	The designated representatives of the Companies and of the Union shall promptly agree on a hearing date, secure a firm commitment on the hearing date from the arbitrator and schedule the hearing in accordance with regular procedures.
3.	If the parties can’t agree on a proposed date, then the arbitrator shall schedule a hearing date within the six (6) month time frame.
D.	Grievances involving the suspension of an individual employee or a grievance involving the dismissal of a Regular or Term employee may be handled in accordance with the Expedited Arbitration provisions of Section 7.15 by mutual agreement of the Labor Relations Director and the designated representative of the National Union, except for those which also involve an issue of arbitrability, Contract interpretation, or work stoppage (strike) activity and those which are also the subject of an administrative charge or court actions.
Section 7.12	POWER OF THE ARBITRATOR
A.	The Arbitrator has no authority to add to, subtract from, or otherwise modify the provisions of the Contract.
B.	If the Arbitrator finds that a dismissal was made without just cause, the Arbitrator will either:

2.	Reduce the dismissal to a suspension and reinstate the employee without back pay for the period of suspension set by the Arbitrator as limited by Section 7.10E.
Section 7.13	ARBITRATOR’S DECISION
A.	Except as provided in Expedited Arbitration, Section 7.15, the Arbitrator will render a decision within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the matter is submitted.
B.	All decisions within the power of the Arbitrator will be final and binding on all parties.

grievances and may not be cited or used as a precedent in other arbitration matters between the parties.
Section 7.14	EFFECT OF RESOLUTION
A.	Where employees are reinstated with back pay, the employees will receive their regular rate of pay for the time lost, but not for suspension time under Section 7.12B2 as limited by Section 7.10E. They will also receive reimbursement for any actual expenses incurred and paid by the employees during the period of dismissal which would have normally been paid by the Companies’ Medical, Dental, or Vision Plans. Amounts paid to employees will be reduced by an amount equal to the total of the termination or layoff allowance received from the Companies at the time of dismissal, and any wages earned in other employment. Pacific Bell employees will be liable to the State of California, Employment Development Department for overpayment of unemployment benefits received since date of dismissal. Nevada Bell employees will likewise be liable to the State of Nevada, Employment Security Department for such overpayments.
B.	In the event a grievance is arbitrated under the provisions of Expedited Arbitration, Section 7.15, any awarded back pay liability shall be computed in accordance with the provisions as expressed in Sections 7.12B1 and 7.12B2, as limited by Section 7.10E.

B.	Within six (6) months of the Union’s request for arbitration, the parties will schedule a mediation conference to be held at the earliest available date of a mediator mutually agreeable to both parties. The mediation conference will normally be held in either a Company or Union facility. Should the availability of a mediator unnecessarily delay the processing of the grievance in the opinion of either party, either party may request that the mediation step be bypassed and the grievance be scheduled for arbitration.

An attorney will not be used by either party at the mediation conference. The number of employees who shall suffer no loss in pay under Article 3, Section 3.02 of the Contract shall be no more than two (2).

94
D.	The representatives of the parties are encouraged, but not required to present the mediator with a brief written statement of the facts, the issue and the arguments in support of their respective positions. If such statement is not presented in written form, it shall be presented orally at the beginning of the mediation conference.
E.	The mediation conference will normally be attended by the grievant, the Local President, the grievant’s supervisor and District Level Manager. Attendance at the mediation conference shall be limited to those people actually involved in the mediation conference.
F.	All written material that is presented to the mediator or to the other party shall be returned to the party presenting the material at the termination of the mediation conference. The mediator may, however, retain one copy of the written grievance, to be used solely for purposes of statistical analysis.
G.	Proceedings before the mediator shall be informal in nature. The presentation of evidence is not limited to that which has been presented in the grievance proceedings. However, the issue mediated will be the same as the issue the parties have tried to resolve through the grievance process. The rules of evidence will not apply, and no record of the mediation conference shall be made.
H.	The mediator will have the authority to meet separately with Company or Union representatives, but will not have the authority to compel the resolution of a grievance.
I.	The Company and Union spokespersons at the mediation conference may accept the resolution proposed by the mediator and such settlement or any other settlement resulting from the conference shall not be precedent-setting for other cases or grievances and may not be cited in any other proceeding between the parties. If no settlement is reached during the mediation conference, the mediator shall provide the parties with an immediate oral advisory opinion, unless both parties agree that no opinion shall be provided. The mediator shall state the grounds of his or her advisory opinion.
J.	If no settlement is reached at the mediation conference, the grievance will be heard in arbitration in accordance with provisions expressed in Section 7.10. Such hearing will be held within six (6) months of the date of the mediation hearing. In the event that a grievance which has been mediated subsequently is arbitrated, no person serving as a
ARTICLE 7
95
mediator between these parties may serve as arbitrator. Nothing said or done by the mediator may be referred to at arbitration. Any settlement proposal made by either party at the mediation conference shall not be referred to at the arbitration hearing.
K.	The mediator shall conduct no more than three (3) mediation conferences per day. The fee and reasonable expenses of the mediator will be shared equally by the parties.
L.	In the event that the mediation of a grievance is scheduled, and then postponed or canceled, the parties shall remain liable for the fee specified in Section 7.18K, unless another grievance is substituted for that grievance postponed or canceled.
Section 7.19	DISMISSALS
A.	The Companies agree that no employee will be dismissed without a full and complete investigation by department supervision.

*Includes all applicable differentials
97
For employees with twenty-one (21) or more years of net credited service, an additional four (4) weeks’ pay at the current wage rate will be made for each additional completed year of service.
1.	For Regular part-time employees, the amount of layoff allowance is determined by reducing the employee’s basic weekly wage rate in proportion to the average number of hours worked to the average number of full-time hours applicable to the tours within which the hours were worked during the twenty-six (26) weeks immediately preceding the layoff.
2.	Any vacation payment to which the employee is eligible will be made in addition to the layoff allowance.
D.	If an employee who has received a layoff allowance is recalled or reengaged, and the number of weeks since the effective date of leaving is less than the number of weeks’ pay upon which the layoff allowance was based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks will be considered as an advance to the employee by the Companies. Repayment of this amount will be made at the time of reemployment, or through payroll deductions in each payroll period at the rate of at least ten (10) percent per week of the employee’s basic weekly wage rate, with the entire amount to be repaid within twelve (12) months of the date reemployed.
E.	If an employee who has been laid off and given a layoff allowance is subsequently recalled or reengaged and again laid off, the layoff allowance in the case of the second layoff or of any subsequent layoff will be based on the employee’s net credited service, less any prior layoff allowance received and not refunded to the Companies. However, no deduction will be made from the second or subsequent layoff allowance if the employee has been back at work for at least twenty-four (24) months since the date of reemployment.
F.	Employees specifically designated as surplus and laid off will retain certain recall rights for twenty-four (24) months following the date they left the work group. Recall rights will be administered as follows: 1. Surplus employees who are laid off must submit a form provided by the Companies if they wish to be recalled from layoff. On this form, employees may express their preferences for reassignment or placement after recall. They may designate any job
98
titles for which they are qualified as the job titles in which they wish to be placed should vacancies occur. Employees may also designate as many work locations as they wish for placement consideration. These location designations may be as specific (e.g., a building) or as general (e.g., a city or an entire geographical area) as the employees desire. The employees’ preferences may be modified by the submission of a revised form as often as they wish during the twenty-four (24) month period that the employees retain their individual recall rights. Employees laid off under the terms of this Section must keep the Companies informed of the address where they can be reached.
2.	Laid off employees will receive placement priority as described in Section 2.04B1b.
3.	A given employee shall receive only one (1)job offer for a position in the employee’s previous work group. The employee will receive only one (1) job offer for a position in the same job title in one (1) work location within a headquarters which the employee requested. The employee will receive a maximum of two (2) job offers in any other job titles for which the employee is qualified. If an employee refuses to acceptthe one (1)job offer made in either of the first two (2) cases described above or refuses to accept two (2) offers made in the last case, the employee will receive no otherjob offers.
ARTICLE 8
IF THE EMPLOYEE IS OFFERED	THEN
1. A job in his/her previous work group	no other job offers will be made.
2. A job in the same title in one (1) work location which he/she requested	no other job offers will be made.
3. A job in any other title(s) (than the one held by the employee at the time he/she was displaced) and declines	the employee will be entitled to one (1) more job offer from either 1, 2, or 3.
4.	Whenever an employee receives ajob offer as described in Section 8.01F3, the employee has three (3) calendar days from the date of the offer in which to accept or reject the job offer. If the employee accepts ajob offer, the employee has fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of acceptance to report to work. Failure to report to work within this period will result in the termination of the job offer and the employee will forfeit all recall rights.
99
5.
Laid off employees recalled to a position as described in Section 8.01F3 will not be entitled to relocation benefits.

Section C3 WAGE SCHEDULES
Section C3.01 TRANSITION TO NEW WAGE SCHEDULES FROM SUPERSEDED WAGE SCHEDULES
Effective April 4, 2004
Effective April 3, 2005
Effective April 2, 2006
Effective April 1, 2007
Effective April 6, 2008
A.
The existing wage schedules for all employees will be increased (by step and zone) effective April 4, 2004, April 3, 2005, April 2, 2006, April 1, 2007 and April 6, 2008.
The guidelines for administering these wage rates are as follows:
1.	Employees engaged prior to the effective date of the new wage schedule ...
a.	First, should receive any wage adjustment they normally would have received (on the old schedule) as of their scheduled increase date.
b.	Should then be placed on the same step of the new Wage Sched-
ule as they are on the old (e.g., move from Step 6 to Step 6).
c.	Employees should then progress on the new schedule in the same manner as on the old schedule, carrying with them the time already accrued on that step.
EXAMPLE: An employee with four (4) months on Step 2 would move to Step 2 on the new schedule and would progress to Step 3 after the completion of two more months.
2.	If an employee is on Short-Term Disability benefits as of one of the wage Increase effective dates, wage changes will be made effective on the date that the employee returns from absence.
3.	An employee hired after one of the wage increases stated above becomes effective should be placed on the new wage schedule by the appropriate job title, wage zone and, if applicable, wage credit, effective on their date of hire.
4.	In no case should any employee’s wages be increased to a rate higher than the top rate of the new appropriate wage schedule.

Section C5 TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD (TPA)
For employees covered under this agreement the Team Performance Award (TPA) will apply for the years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009.
Section C5.01 TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD (TPA) -DESCRIPTION
A.	Purpose
The TPA is intended to encourage and reward team performance of employees by providing incentive compensation based on attainment of Corporate and Business Plan objectives. Participants will earn an award based on the performance of Pacific Bell. The Company performance measures will be the same as the Company performance measures used for the management Team Award.
B.	Awards
Awards under the Plan are based on performance over an Award Year (calendar year). A standard award amount is determined for each Award Year, a percentage of which may be earned by eligible employees depending on team performance during the Award Year. Standard Award amounts are included on the wage schedules of this appendix.
1.	Award Level
The TPA is tied to Company success. The maximum award earned for financial and service performance is 100% of the standard award. Pay-outs greater than 100% are at the discretion of the Company. Any discretionary pay-out percentage over 100% will be the same as the Company pay-out percentage used for the management Team Award of Pacific Bell. The minimum threshold is a 50% pay-out. Performance which results in a calculation below 50% results in no pay-out.
186
2.	Award Computation
C.
Eligible employees will receive awards based on Company performance including financial and services measures. Section C5.02 describes the performance measurement process and the computation of the TPA.
3.	Award Payment
Payment of awards will be made as soon as practicable after the Award Year and will normally occur the payday of the last full pay period in February.
Eligibility
Team members who have at least 90 days active service during the Award Year are eligible for awards. Active service may not be rounded up to 90 days to achieve eligibility. Neither may disability or leave of absence time be included to meet the 90 days minimum active service requirement.
■ ■
X o
D.	Prorating Awards
Those employees in the Plan for 90 days or more but less than twelve months receive prorated amounts. Amounts will be prorated on a daily basis.
E.	Part-Time Employees, Temporary Employees and Term Employees
Part-Time employees are eligible for a prorated award based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee’s average workweek for the calendar year to a forty (40) hour workweek.
Temporary and Term employees are eligible for a prorated award if all other eligibility requirements are met.
F.	Transfers, Promotions, Retirements, Resignations and Dismissals
Participating employees who transfer, resign, retire, or are dismissed during an Award Year will be treated according to the following provisions:
1.	Transfers
An employee transferring between positions is eligible for a prorated award according to the time of active service in that position. A total of 90 days active service in all eligible positions must be met, however.
187
2.	Promotions
Employees moving between award eligible levels during an Award Year shall have their award prorated according to the time of active service at each level.
3.	Temporary Promotions/Reclassifications
Temporary promotees/reclassifications are eligible for a prorated award according to the time of active service in that title.
4.	Retirements
Retirees with 90 days or more of active service during the Award Year are eligible to receive prorated awards.
5.	Resignations
An employee who resigns or is laid off during an Award Year is eligible for a prorated award if all other eligibility requirements have been met.
6.	Dismissals
An employee who is dismissed during the Award Year is not eligible for the award.
G.	Short-Term Disability Absence
Employees having cumulative Short-Term disability absence(s) for ninety (90) days or less in a year will receive a full award. When the disability period is in excess of ninety (90) days in a year, the award will be prorated to the nearest day of active service for the Award Year.
H.	Other Leaves of Absences
Employees on approved military leave(s) of absence who have one (1) year or more service will be given full wage credit up to three (3) months toward the award. Employees on other approved leave(s) of absence will have cumulative leave time in excess of thirty (30) days excluded from award computation.
I.	Time Off For Union Activities
Time off for union activities (both UP and UA time) will be counted as time worked when computing awards.
Excused time in any month in an Award Year which is counted as time worked will be added to actual time worked before prorating.
188
J.	Benefits Treatment
The TPA is recognized for many benefit programs that are pay related.
The effect of this practice on specific benefits is shown below.
1. Death Benefits
2.
Awards paid within the twelve (12) month period prior to the date of death are included in the basic pay. Awards received in the twelve months prior to the date of retirement are included in the death benefit computation for a retired employee. Awards received after retirement do not affect the benefit.
Group Insurance
Awards received in the past twelve (12) months are included in the computation of basic pay for all insurance coverage. Deductions from monthly pay will be made for employees purchasing Supplementary coverage on an annualized basis.
3.	Savings Plan
TPA will be included in Savings Plan deductions.
4.	Short-Term Disability
Payment is equal to the current base wage rate. The TPA is not considered.
5.	Long-Term Disability
Maximum payment is 50% of the base wage rate in effect at the beginning of the disability. The TPA is not considered.
6.	Pensions
The TPA is included when pension bands are assigned.
K. Taxes, Personal Allotments
Awards are subject to state and local taxes, Federal Income Tax, Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax and California State Disability deductions at the time of payment. Union dues will be deducted at the same rate as they are deducted for wages. Employees with 401(k) elections will not have State or Federal Income Taxes deducted from that portion.
Personal allotments such as Savings Bonds and United Giving contributions will not be made.
189
L. Overtime
Overtime payments will be based on an hourly rate which includes both base and TPA payments.
An employee’s hourly wage TPA rate for overtime payments will be calculated as follows:
The hourly rate will be equal to actual award divided by 2080 hours.
Example of TPA Overtime Payment Using TPA hourly rate:
An employee’s TPA Payment equals $1,768. The employee worked 100 hours of overtime in the award year at a time and one-half rate (100 x 1.5 = 150 hours).
TPA	Overtime	TPA
Hourly	Hours	Overtime
Rate	Worked	Payment
$1,768 =	.85 X 150	=	$127.50
2080
The TPA Overtime Payment (TPAOT) will be included in the pay check of the last full pay period of February TPA Pay-out.
Section C5.02 TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD (TPA) -COMPUTATIONS
The TPA will provide annual cash payments, based on an employee’s wage schedule, depending on whether the Company meets, exceeds or misses its financial and service goals. The TPA will be based on Pacific Bell performance. The Company performance measures will be the same as the Company performance measures used for the Pacific Bell Management Team Award.
The TPA payments will be determined as follows:
1.	A standard award, based on the top step of an employee’s wage schedule, will be given annually if the Company meets its financial and service goals. The standard award will be 5.0% of annual top step pay for each of the years 2004-2009.
2.	The standard awards described in number 1 above will be adjusted based on percent achievement of Company performance measures.
The TPA pay-out will be based on the percent achievement of Company performance measures. Each year, Pacific Bell will set:
190
•	financial and customer service targets
•	a financial/service weighting
3.
4.
The percent achievement of the Company’s financial and service targets will determine the Team Performance Award. The Company pay-out percentages for the Team Performance Award will be the same as the Company pay-out percentages used for the management Team Award of Pacific Bell.
An example of a pay-out computation is shown below:
•	Company performance targets for financial and service performance were set by the Company. The Company also determined that the TPA pay-out would be based 75% on financial performance and 25% on service performance.
•	98% of the financial target was attained, which resulted in 98%. The weighting of the financial portion is 75%. 98% multiplied by 75% equals a 73.5% result.
•	100% of the service target was attained, which resulted in 100%. The weighting of the service portion is 25%. 100% multiplied by 25% equals a 25% result.
•	The financial result of 73.5% plus the service result of 25% equals a TPA pay-out of 98.5%.

Sample Pension Computation
Note: Refer to your Summary Plan Description for a full description of how a pension is computed, including the supplemental pension, early retirement discount, survivor annuity option, etc.
192
The basic monthly pension is computed as your service credit multiplied by the monthly benefit amount (above) for your pension band.
You will find the pension band for your job and wage schedule in the Wage Schedule Tables of the Contract.
For example, if an employee with a wage schedule assigned pension band 114 retired in January, 2006, with thirty (30) years of service, the pension would be 30 x $51.59 = $1,547.70 per month.

Section C8 WAGE ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE
Section C8.01 GENERAL
A.	The following definitions will apply to this practice:
1.	A Change of Assignment is a change from one title classification to a different title classification.
To determine whether an employee’s change of assignment is to a lower, equal or higher-rated schedule, compare the top rate of employee’s former schedule with the top rate of the schedule to which the employee is being assigned. When comparing top rates, include any applicable job (not shift) differential, except a relief differential.
2.	Steps - are a specified number of six month intervals on a schedule. Steps are associated with specific wage rates. We currently have 9 and 11 step schedules.
3.	Elapsed Time - is the time an employee has accumulated or should be credited with on a step.
4.	Total Schedule Time or Wage Experience Credit is determined by combining the number of months corresponding to the employee’s current step, and the elapsed time on that step.
B.	The following rules should apply to all moves between schedules, whether to lower, equal or higher rated schedules:
1.	When the change of assignment occurs on the same date on which a scheduled increase is due, both increases shall be effective on that date but the scheduled increase shall be considered as preceding any applicable promotional increase.
2.	When the change of assignment is to a schedule in a different wage area, the employee shall first be placed on the former schedule in the new wage area with the same total schedule time. Movement to the new schedule will then be according to the rules outlined in Sections C8.02, C8.03, C8.04, C8.05, or C8.06 which follow.
3.	In no case shall the new wage rate exceed the top rate of the schedule to which the employee is assigned.
194
4.	In no case shall any employee lose Total Schedule Time or Wage Experience Credit with exception of the limitation STEPFROM MAXIMUM.
Section C8.02 CHANGES OF ASSIGNMENT TO A
HIGHER-RATED SCHEDULE
Compare the rate associated with the employee’s step on the lower-rated schedule, including any applicable job differential (except a relief differential), with the rate associated on the new schedule as determined by allowing the employee full Wage Experience Credit in progression or at maximum on the old wage schedule. The employee shall then be placed on the new wage schedule according to the following rules:
>
X o
A.	If the wage rate on the new schedule is equal to or lower than the rate on the lower-rated schedule, the employee shall be placed on the step of the new schedule having the rate nearest to but not less than the employee’s existing rate.
B.	If the rate on the new wage schedule is higher than the rate on the lower-rated schedule, the employee shall be placed on the new schedule allowing full Wage Experience Credit in progression, or at maximum from the old schedule.
C.	The employee shall be placed on the step on the new wage schedule, as determined by the comparisons made in paragraphs A. and B. preceding, but not to exceed the step down from maximum of the new schedule as listed following paragraph D, except as provided in Article 4, Section 4.01B2.
D.	To determine the time interval to the next progression increase on the schedule to which assigned, credit shall be allowed for the employee’s elapsed time on the step of the lower-rated schedule, both in progression or at maximum WITH THE EXCEPTION of any movement involving a limitation on the step from maximum. In such cases, no credit shall be allowed towards the next progression increase.

Dear Carole and Reid:
This Memorandum of Agreement will confirm our understanding of October 22, 1989, regarding retention of personnel folder documentation.
The Companies’ policy on the retention of personnel folder documentation regarding job performance in the areas of attendance, quality, and/or quantity of work on employees who have been subject to disciplinary action is:
“Once disciplinary action has been taken and the problem corrected, all records will be destroyed.”
This policy will be supplemented with this clarification:
“Under normal conditions, the records will be destroyed within one year of the action taken.”
This Memorandum of Agreement will only become effective if the collective bargaining agreement between the parties embodied in the Memorandum of Agreement dated October 22, 1989, is ratified by the Union membership on or before December 1, 1989. If that Memorandum of Agreement is so ratified, this Memorandum of Agreement will become effective and will be subject to termination in accordance with Article 9 of the collective bargaining agreement effective August 6, 1989.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT
The pension plan will be modified effective October 1, 1995 to provide that from time to time during the life of the contract, the Companies may designate work groups in which they will offer an Early Retirement Benefit (ERB) providing enhanced pension benefits. For purposes of this memorandum of agreement “work group” shall mean a group identified by Vice President, headquarters and job title. ERB is intended to be offered to alleviate or avoid surplus conditions. The Companies will determine, in their discretion, whether and when to offer ERB, but surplus will not be declared in a work group where ERB has not been offered to all work groups with the same title and Vice President entity within the consolidated headquarters defined in Article 2. There will be a thirty (30) calendar day election period. The Companies may place a limit on the number of employees who will be eligible for the ERB benefit separately in each work group. The Companies will send to the Union a listing of the work groups to be offered ERB before the start of the thirty (30) calendar day election period. Employees who elect to accept the offer and who are eligible under the participation limit for their group have to terminate employment at the time that is set for their retirement. They will not be allowed to revoke their election to retire, and their termination at the time set for their retirement will not be subject to arbitration.
4 + 4 Pension Enhancement
ERB is a 4+4 pension enhancement. Employees who meet all eligibility requirements will have four (4) years added to their age and four (4) years added to their service for purposes of computing their enhanced pension as of their retirement date.
The four (4) years of service and four (4) years of age that are added in computing the amount of the enhanced pension under ERB only apply as of the eligibility date and the retirement date and only apply for purposes of:
a.	Determining eligibility for a service pension under ERB;
b.	Computing the amount of the enhanced pension under ERB;
c.	Determining the application of an age related discount;
d.	Bridging of past service for determining eligibility and for a service pension and the pension amount; and
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
205
e.	Meeting the requirement that an employee have at least eighteen (18) months in a pension band in order to apply all past service to the value of the band.
Eligibility
An employee in a designated work group is eligible to receive the ERB enhanced pension if:
1.	The employee is a current employee who has not waived rights to active benefits.
2.	The employee’s actual age and service (without any enhancements) as of the final day of the thirty (30) calendar day election period meet the normal service pension requirement or would meet the requirement with the addition of four (4) years to age and four (4) years to service, that is:
Normal Service Pension Requirements
a.	any age with 30 years of service
b.	age 50 with 25 years of service
c.	age 55 with 20 years of service
d.	age 65 with 10 years of service
Eligibility Requirements with 4 + 4 any age with 26 years of service age 46 with 21 years of service age 51 with 16 years of service age 61 with 6 years of service
If prior service would be bridged with the addition of four (4) years of service, the bridged total shall be used for determining if the employee would meet normal pension requirements as of the end election period, and for computing the pension amount as of the retirement date, but not for any other purpose. For instance, it will not be used for determining service for the metering process described below.
3.	The employee elects to retire with the ERB pension enhancement and signs and delivers an election form to the appropriate Company during the thirty (30) calendar day election period.
4.	The employee satisfies the requirements of the limitation on the number of eligible employees, if applicable.
5.	The employee retires in the month that is determined through the metering process described below or on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day following the end of the election period, if the metering process is not used. Employees who terminate employment before the applicable times will not receive the enhanced pension.
206
Temporary Supplement to Age 62
If an employee retires with a service pension under ERB and the employee has not reached his or her sixty second birthday at retirement, the employee’s pension, after the 4+4 enhancement, will be increased by the addition of a 30% supplement. This temporary supplement will be paid each month, with the last payment made for the month in which the retiree’s sixty-second birthday occurs.
There will be a separate election for a lump sum cashout applicable to this temporary supplement. If the employee elects a cashout of the single life annuity the temporary supplement will also be cashed out. If the employee elects monthly payments of the service pension annuity, the employee may separately elect a cashout of the temporary supplement only.
Participation Limits
1.	Within any work group the Company may place a limit on the number of employees who will be eligible for the ERB benefit.
2.	Any such limit on a work group will be set before the thirty-day election period begins, and the Company will inform the Union of work groups with participation limits.
3.	If the number of employees submitting election forms exceeds the limit for the work group, eligibility will be determined by seniority, i.e., only the senior employees up to the limit will be eligible. This eligibility determination is made as of the end of the election period, and will not be changed.
Metering Process
In each second level work unit, or the next level higher work unit if there is no second level work unit, the Companies may use the following process to determine when employees within a work unit must retire in order to receive the ERB pension enhancement.
1.	Before the thirty (30) calendar day election period begins, the Companies will designate the work units using this metering and will inform the Union.
2.	The metering process will result in selection of a specific retirement month, within one (1) year from the end of the thirty (30) calendar day election period, for each prospectively eligible employee in the work unit who elected ERB. Only calendar months will be designated as retirement months. The month in
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
207
which the election period ends may be a designated retirement month.
3.	There are two steps to the metering process:
a.	Within ten (10) calendar days following the end of the election period, for each work unit using the metering process, the Companies will distribute a metering list designating the specific calendar month or months in which employees in that work unit may retire with ERB, and the number of such employees that may retire in each such designated month.
b.	If more than one month is designated, each prospectively eligible employee will identify his or her preference order for all available months on the metering list in which he or she is allowed to retire. Employees shall have five (5) calendar days from receipt of the metering list in which to identify their retirement month preference order. The preference lists will then be matched, by seniority, with the metering list, so that each employee receives his or her most preferred retirement month remaining on the metering list, after the preferences of the more senior employees (as expressed on their preference lists) have been given effect. If two employees have identical seniority, the one whose last four social security number digits comprise the larger number will be treated as if he or she were more senior. An employee who does not identify his or her preferences within the above timeframe, or who submits an incomplete preference list and whose preferences have all been taken, will be scheduled to retire in the earliest remaining available month on the metering list.
4.	Once the retirement schedule is set, it will not be changed.
5.	If an employee terminates employment before the month he or she elected through this metering process, the employee will not receive the ERB pension enhancement. Employees who do not select a particular date during the month they elected through the metering process for retirement will be terminated as of the last day of that month.
6.	If a work unit does not use the metering process, all the employees in that work unit who elect ERB and meet the other ERB eligibility requirements must retire on the fifteenth (15th) calendar
208
day following the end of the election period in order to receive the enhanced pension.
7.	Employees receiving short term disability benefits and employees on a leave of absence as of the thirtieth (30th) day of the thirty-day election period will not be included in the metering process, and must retire on the fifteenth (15th) day following the end of the thirty-day election period, or earlier if their short term disability benefits end earlier.
Other Provisions Applicable to ERB
1.	The pension plan will be amended for each ERB offer. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Companies shall have the right to amend the pension plan as appropriate to implement ERB.
2.	The ERB service enhancement is not a permanent change to the employee’s term of employment or net credited service and will not be used for any purpose other than determination of the ERB benefit, e.g., it will not be used to determine vacation or seniority, including seniority regarding the ERB metering process.
3.	The enhanced pension benefit is available only to those employees who meet all eligibility requirements and are designated eligible by an amendment to the pension plan, and only during those periods and under those conditions designated. The pension enhancement will not be applied to any employee who terminates employment before the time set for the employee’s retirement.
4.	If an employee who was previously granted an enhanced pension under Early Retirement Choice (ERC) or Early Retirement Incentive (ERI) is in a work group where the ERB benefit is offered, the employee’s eligibility for the ERB benefit and the amount of benefit are determined without regard to any enhancements provided under ERC or ERI.
5.	For employees with part-time service during their term of employment, the four (4) years of enhanced service will be prorated in computing the amount of the pension benefit. No proration will apply for the purpose of determining eligibility for a service pension under ERB.
6.	Employees receiving short term disability benefits or employees on leave of absence from a work group that has offered the
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
209
enhanced pension will be eligible for the benefit if they otherwise meet the eligibility requirements.
7.	Employees temporarily promoted out of the work group or transferred out as of the ERB designated election period will not be covered by the pension enhancement.
8.	If an employee who has accepted an offer of ERI Phase II enhanced pension benefits is still an employee after the effective date of this Memorandum of Agreement, the employee will retire under the provisions of the ERI Phase II offer. However, if the ERB pension enhancement is offered in such an employee’s work group and the thirty-day election period for the work group starts before the employee’s retirement date under ERI Phase II, the employee will retire on the date established under ERI Phase II, but will receive the better of the ERI Phase II benefit or the ERB benefit determined as of the retirement date. An employee in this circumstance will not be subject to a participation limit on eligibility under ERB and will not be counted toward the number of employees eligible under any participation limit on the employee’s work group.
9.	If an employee retires with a service pension enhanced under ERB and at a later time returns to employment with the Companies and becomes an active participant in the pension plan, the employee’s service and pension will be determined in the future without regard to the ERB enhancement. On subsequent termination the employee will receive the greater of the normal pension benefit without regard to the ERB or the benefit that was determined under ERB, subject to the offset rules of the pension plan for a cashout of a previous pension.
10.	Administration of the Early Retirement Benefit will not be subject to arbitration.

Gentlemen:
This letter supersedes our May 11, 1984 (tab 252) letter regarding monitoring. The reference to TSPS is changed to TOPS. The agreement will continue to apply to Pacific Bell only. There is no intent to change the agreement which reads as follows:
Our approach to monitoring and productivity measurements will be based on a premise that fosters a work environment that builds on mutual trust and respect and that enhances job satisfaction.
We agree that:
• Remote monitoring for evaluate purposes will be conducted as follows:
-	Done only when all employees in the work group have been notified by a visual indicator which will be used only when monitoring is taking place.
-	Limited to thirty (30) calls per month for TOPS and fifty (50) for Directory Assistance. Monitoring of an employee will take place on no more than three days per month and will be limited to one monitoring session each day.
New employees for three (3) months following initial training may have double that number taken.
-	Coverage of an employee should take place as soon as is possible, but must take place within the same day.
-	No make-up observations will be taken.
•	Diagnostic monitoring will be done on a parallel basis at the employee’s position to identify individual training needs and provide follow-up to ensure training has been effective.
•	Parallel monitoring for the purpose of verifying the effectiveness of new practices and customer response, etc. will be taken with operator’s who agree.
216
•	No employee will be dismissed solely as a result of monitoring unless secrecy of communications, fraud, loss of revenue or gross customer abuse is involved.
•	Service management observations will not be taken.
Good service to customers and enhanced revenue are of equal importance. Productivity measurements will be reviewed with the Union periodically to maximize these objectives.
Monitoring is intended to be used for training and development of operators in order to reach their potential and provide good customer service. ORIGINAL SIGNED: September 11, 1986

Gentlemen:
This confirms our understanding of September 11, 1986, with respect to pay treatment of certain employees with physical restrictions. This Memorandum cancels and supersedes our letter dated March 29, 1977, regarding the return to work of certain physically restricted employees.
The pay treatment is as follows:
If the rate of pay on the new assignment is lower than that of the employee’s former job, the employee will be red circled at the employee’s previous rate based on the following table:
Net Credited Service Under 6 months 6 months to 2 years 2 years to 5 years 5 years to 15 years 15 years to 20 years 20 years to 25 years 25 years and over	Period of Red Circling 0 2 weeks 4 weeks 13 weeks 26 weeks 39 weeks 52 weeks
Employees will continue to receive their progression increases at the higher rate during the period of red circling as well as any general wage increases and team awards that become effective during this time. Where applicable, the team awards will be prorated according to the Team Award Plan.
If at the completion of the period of red circling the physical/medical restrictions still exist, the employee’s wage rate will be reduced to the wage rate of the new assignment.
This Memorandum of Agreement will only become effective if the collective bargaining agreement between the parties embodied in the Memorandum of Agreement dated August 1, 1986 is ratified by the Union

membership on or before September 12, 1986. If that Memorandum of Agreement is so ratified, this Memorandum of Agreement will become effective and may be terminated by either party by giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party of its intention to terminate this Memorandum of Agreement.

Gentlemen:
This letter supersedes our prior agreement of August 24, 1983 (old tab 258) regarding scheduling of employees for Sunday plus Four to reflect the current contractual references. This agreement continues and reads as follows:
“Employees defined in Appendix A, Section A1.01, A2.01 and Appendix B, Section B1.01 subparagraphs A and B may voluntarily waive the requirement as stated in Appendix A, Section A1.02J and A2.02I and Appendix B, Section B1.03I to be scheduled for Sunday plus four additional consecutive days.
An employee will be scheduled according to the Sunday plus four additional consecutive days rule unless the employee notifies his/her supervisor of his/her waiver one week prior to the posting of the schedule.”

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
RELOCATION
This Memorandum of Agreement will confirm our understanding of August 6, 1995, with respect to reasonable moving costs as provided for in Section 2.08A of the Contract between Pacific Bell/Nevada Bell and the Communications Workers of America. This memorandum cancels and supercedes our letter on the same subject dated June 20, 1990.
Relocation expense reimbursement will be paid to employees who accept a Company-initiated transfer to a non-commutable work location. Company-initiated transfers are those transfers and reassignments made under the provisions of Section 2.05 or Section 2.06 of the Contract. A work location shall be considered to be non-commutable as described in Section 2.08E of the Contract.
An employee who accepts a Company-initiated transfer to a non-com-mutable work location will be eligible for moving expense reimbursement if the employee has moved his/her residence to a commutable location (as described in Article 2, Section 2.08E of the Contract) or if, in the determination of the Companies, the employee has moved his/her residence appreciably closer to the new work location.
1.	Relocation expense reimbursement will be paid according to the attached schedule, up to a maximum of $12,000.00 or
2.	A commute allowance of $200 per month will be paid for up to three (3) years. Employees who elect the commute allowance in lieu of relocation (CILOR) may, within one (1) year from the date of transfer, elect to move their residence. In such cases, relocation expenses will be reimbursed in accordance with the attached schedule, up to a maximum of $9,600. In no event will the combination of commute allowance and moving expenses exceed $12,000.
This Memorandum of Agreement will also confirm our understanding of November 27, 1989, regarding the application of relocation benefits. This Memorandum of Agreement supersedes our letter dated December 18, 1986; however, this Memorandum does not change the intent of that letter, which reads as follows:
“In the event an employee who is commuting to work, on his/her own volition, a distance exceeding that which is normally considered commutable and is subject to a Company-initiated move to a location which is also non-commutable but results in a commute that is less than the
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
223
employee’s previous commute, the employee will not be entitled to relocation benefits including CILOR.
However, if an employee, under similar circumstances, is subject to a Company-initiated move which results in a commute greater than that which the employee previously experienced, the employee will be entitled to relocation benefits should the employee decide to move his/her residence within one year of the effective date of the Company-initiated move, or CILOR.”
Effective date/language: Termination date/language:	Upon ratification of the Contract. In accordance with the conclusion Article of the currently effective collective bargaining agreement between Pacific Bell/Nevada Bell and the Communications Workers of America.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT SUBCONTRACTING
The Companies prefer to have employees in the bargaining unit perform traditional telephone work. However, when the Companies determine that it is necessary to subcontract that type of work, the Companies agree to the following:
1.	The Companies will provide notice to the appropriate Union Local before contracting out work when the contracting project is anticipated to last more than ninety (90) days and to discuss the reasons for the contracting.
2.	To carefully consider the use of union-represented contractors to perform traditional telephone work with the understanding that the selection of any contractor is determined solely by the Companies.

In addition, this committee may review situations where contractors are performing traditional telephone work and the work is expected to continue long-term and discuss appropriate solutions.
4.	The Vice President-Labor Relations and the Vice President-District 9 will also establish a joint committee to examine work previously performed by bargaining unit employees to determine if it would serve the interests of both parties to have the work brought back into the Companies. The joint committee should be formed within 60 days following ratification and have their first meeting within 90 days following ratification. The joint committee shall make recommendations to the Vice President-Labor Relations and the Vice President-District 9 within 90 days of holding such meeting. The Union members of the joint committee will be paid in accordance with Section 3.02B of the current collective bargaining agreement.
5.	The Companies will provide the Union a monthly report regarding the contracting of bargaining unit jobs. The report will include:

The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (Company) has the responsibility for providing high-quality telephone service to the public. This includes not only the proper functioning of equipment but such things as accuracy, completeness, promptness, courtesy and helpfulness of employees in business transactions with customers. It is agreed by the Company and the Communications Workers of America (Union) that appropriate procedures will be used to meet this obligation.
In addition, the Company and the Union agree that the laws with respect to secrecy of communications must be followed, and that both have an obligation to prevent any acts by employees which tend to perpetrate fraud, violate secrecy or cause loss of revenue.
It is agreed that supervisory monitoring as defined and referred to in CPUC Decision No. 73146 may be used to achieve the above objectives.
As defined, “Supervisory monitoring” is used by telephone companies to train and supervise individual employees in their performance of telephone service assignments.
Under CPUC Decision No. 73146, supervisory monitoring is permitted without notice (i.e., without a “beep tone”) when performed without the making of any written notation or any record of the contents, substance, purpose, effect, or meaning of any conversation (which includes the employee’s conversation) which may have been heard during said supervisory monitoring.
A person performing supervisory monitoring may not disclose to anyone (including supervisory personnel and the observed employee) any part of any conversation overheard while performing such supervisory monitoring. The Company is obligated to insure, by proper training and direction of its supervisory people, that supervisory monitoring is properly used. To insure that this is done the Company agrees to train its supervisory people in the implementation of this Agreement covering the use of supervisory monitoring as follows:
a.	Record of supervisory monitoring will be made on check-off type summary sheets recording only technical details and manner of job performance. No written notations of a conversation will be made except as absolutely necessary to protect secrecy of communications or to prevent fraud or loss of revenue.
b.	When a record of a job discussion between a Traffic or Central Office Manager, or other supervisor and the observed employee
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
229
is made, it will not include the contents, substance, purpose, effect, or meaning of any observed conversation, unless secrecy of communications, fraud, or loss of revenue is involved. An employee shall be permitted to review his/her personnel record upon his/her request.
c.	Supervisory monitoring may be used to determine training needs and to evaluate the grade of service of individual employees. Other supervisory steps, such as training sessions, visual observation, individual discussions and coaching shall be used in addition to supervisory monitoring to evaluate and improve an employee’s performance.
d.	Employees subject to supervisory monitoring will be so advised.
e.	Supervisory monitoring will be done only in the quarters where the employee is working.
This Agreement does not preclude the Union’s right of grievance procedure and/or arbitration as set forth in the Agreement between the parties.
This Agreement may be terminated by either party in accordance with the appropriate Collective Bargaining Agreement covering Wages, Hours and Working Conditions for bargaining unit employees represented by the Union.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
SUPERVISORY MONITORING - SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES
This Memorandum of Agreement confirms the understanding between the Company and the Union regarding Supervisory Monitoring for Service Representatives in Pacific Bell.
Supervisory monitoring will be conducted as follows:
•	Done only when all employees in the work group have been notified by a visual indicator which will be used only when monitoring is taking place.
•	Monitoring used for evaluative or disciplinary purposes shall be limited to no more than 10 calls per month. Such monitoring of an employee will take place no more than two days per month and will be limited to one monitoring session each day.
•	New employees for six (6) months following initial training will have no limit to the number of calls monitored.
•	Coverage of an employee should take place as soon as possible, but must take place within 24 hour of the call being monitored.
•	No employee will be dismissed solely as a result of monitoring unless secrecy of communications, fraud or gross customer abuse is involved.
•	Simultaneous monitoring will be used solely for coaching and development of management personnel and will be done only with the concurrence of the monitored employee.
•	Monitoring that is performed by anyone other than management shall be used for coaching and development and may not be used for evaluative or disciplinary purposes. Employees receiving Relief Differential are not management.
To facilitate implementation and understanding, the Union and the Company recognize the importance of developing a best practices package for supervisory monitoring. To assure this, we agree to reconvene the Supervisory Monitoring Joint Committee to develop a best practices for supervisory monitoring package. The Supervisory Monitoring Joint Committee will have the best practices package developed by December 31, 1995. The Union and the Company also agree that common definitions are important and further agree that the terms listed in the attached Glossary of Terms will have the meanings stated there.

The amount of the special promotion credit will be based solely on the employee’s net credited service, annualized salary rates of the old and new jobs, and Annual Pension Service Credit Table, as of the date of promotion or transfer to a new job title or classification, and will be
241
equal to the difference between the applicable annual Pension Service Credit for the new job and the applicable annual Pension Service Credit for the old job, multiplied by the employee’s net credited service.
For employees of SNET Information Services, Inc., annualized salary rates of the old and new jobs shall include the employee’s commission amount, if any, used in determination of the annual Pension Service Credit in effect as of the date of promotion or transfer.
The special promotion credit will be credited to the employee’s account effective in the month immediately following the month in which the employee attains six (6) months in the new position.

Dear Dina:
The following represents our agreement with respect to Evolving Technologies and Traditional Telecom Work: FTTP, VoIP, WiFi (and other wireless data technologies). This agreement shall expire on April 4, 2009. Much of the work related to the evolving technologies of the telecommunications industry are extensions of traditional telephone work or copper cable switched technology. The new technologies referred to here are Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), WiFi and other data services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Traditional telephone work has been installation, maintenance, network construction & surveillance, repair, customer premise work, billing, operator services, sales and service, customer service, and technical support. Since the work supporting the new technologies is functionally related to the work required in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the new work will be performed by workers covered by the collective bargaining agreements.
Fiber to the Premise (FTTP)
Both parties recognize that most FTTP work today is done under the core contracts. The parties agree that all non-management FTTP work which falls into the comparable categories of traditional telephone work now performed on the switched network including construction, repair, customer service, billing, sales, technical support, terminations, splicing and testing will be performed under the core contracts. Construction work that is similar to work that is currently done in the circuit network will continue to be performed as it is under the core contracts. For example, the parties recognize that trenching is work that is traditionally contracted.
Fiber to the premise shall be CWA bargaining unit work as described below. The assignment of fiber to the premise work shall be made just as it is for the copper switched network today. As the network evolves to a packet-switched fiber network, the core bargaining unit will continue to perform
252
the type of work that was previously bargaining unit work in the circuit switched network.
CWAshall be recognized for construction, splicing, testing, terminations of fiber to premise/neighborhood or node work and all associated equipment required to make fiber operational. Aerial drops to the premise shall be CWA-represented work. All other service drops in the fiber network shall be done as they are in the circuit-switched network.
When the customer premise work is performed by SBC, SBC CWA employees will do it under the core contracts or DataComm contracts as it is done today. If in the view of the Company, the nature of some of the customer premise work and interacting with the customer and the required set of skills to perform that work require a different craft title, the parties agree to meet to bargain an appropriate rate.
This includes testing, splicing and termination at the interface device as well as installing associated equipment to make the fiber functional as communications cable at the premise.
WiFi
Currently, WiFi (and other wireless data technologies) consists of DSL (and high-speed internet) lines installed by SBC CWA-represented employees from and including the central office to the customer premise termination including the interface device or protector. Terminal equipment is installed on the customer premise. As the WiFi business grows, SBC expects to expand the work performed by SBC employees. If SBC performs the customer premise work, SBC will utilize core or DataComm employees for CPE installations. Outside the SBC footprint, SBC may use contractors to perform this work. Within the SBC footprint contractors may be used on a temporary basis under unusual circumstances. SBC and the Union will discuss at the President’s Council the best way to meet service and installation commitments and grow the Business. These SBC non-management employees shall be represented by CWA or eligible for card check recognition. All DSL customer service work associated with WiFi (and other wireless data technologies) shall be done by CWA-represented employees.
VoIP
To the extent that routers and servers go into the network owned by SBC, SBC shall assign that work to the CWA bargaining unit since they perform related work in the circuit world. VoIP is an evolution of the PSTN and
253
comparable work performed today by CWA-represented employees shall be performed for VoIP technology. VoIP work in the network and at the premises will be performed under the DataComm contracts. As the work transitions from the circuit switched network, the current core technicians will transition with the work. The Company will make training available to enable their transition.
Customer Service
Tier 1 DSL customer service work is best performed bundled with other SBC services. CWA-represented employees will perform this work as well as all customer service work for all SBC services. This work shall include billing, selling and servicing. This includes Tier II customer service work. Currently, EchoStar employees will deal with TV and satellite service quality issues and other technical support issues.
The Union and SBC share similar views about utilizing SBC service reps to interface with the customer. CWA-represented employees shall do all customer service work of SBC products.
SBC-represented employees shall sell DSL (and other high-speed internet services), VoIP, long distance, and video and service SBC customer accounts which include these services.
The parties will discuss expanding outbound telemarketing jobs within the bargaining unit at the President’s Council.
It is understood that the Company will continue to use sales agents and multiple sales channels, e.g., Radio Shack, Best Buy.
Global Services/DataComm
Global Services/Datacomm work done today by bargaining unit employees will continue per applicable CBA. SBC will not remove work from existing CWA bargaining units to non-represented worksites, centers, or contractors.
No bargaining unit employees currently performing Datacomm associated work as defined in the FCC OI&M order shall be laid-off.
SBC concurs that card check applies to non-management employees performing work within Global Services/Datacomm including Premier Care, Customer Care Centers, and Dedicated Support & Services.
Where there are mixed units of non-represented and represented Data-Comm employees, SBC shall be neutral in any accretion petition filed by
254
the Union at the NLRB provided SBC concurs as to which bargaining agreement will be applicable to any accreted employees.
Tier 1 and 2 Customer Contact/Technical Support
Technical support work today is contracted work through Accenture. At the conclusion of the contract (without extension) SBC prefers that its employees perform this work. In order to facilitate moving this work to SBC employees, in 2006 SBC shall perform cost studies to determine the potential wage, benefits, and procedures to perform this work by SBC employees. It is the mutual goal of the parties to have this work performed by CWA represented employees. This will be discussed at the President’s Council. CWA represented employees shall do all Tier II customer contact/technical support work.
Buried Service Wire
In order for SBC to compete in buried service wire, it is in both parties’ interest to negotiate and reach an agreement which will make this business a success.
The Company and the Union agree that they will meet for the purposes of negotiating a nationwide collective bargaining agreement.
In the event the parties are unable to reach final agreement on any element of the collective bargaining agreement stated above, the disputed issues will be submitted to the Presidents Council for resolution. The Council, at its discretion, may submit the issues to a neutral third party for mediation.
Any and all Buried Service Wire work currently performed in any of the core bargaining units will continue to be performed by that unit under the terms and conditions of the relevant collective bargaining agreement.
Video
Any and all video work currently performed in any of the CWA bargaining units will continue to be performed by that unit under the terms and conditions of the relevant collective bargaining Agreement.
It is in both parties’ interest to negotiate and reach an agreement which will make this business a success. The parties recognize that this is a competitive business and that a competitive cost structure will be required to succeed.
SBC shall recognize the Union as the exclusive representative for all nonmanagement employees performing work associated with video provided the work is performed at an overall cost structure that is competitive.
255
Work required to be done by other companies through present or future partnerships or alliances with SBC will also continue to be done by such other companies if required by contract. Such work will transition to CWA-represented employees if permissible and the President’s Council shall review its progress.
Dispute Resolution on Evolving Technologies
If there is no mutual resolution of any dispute at the President’s Council, CWA shall have the right to enforce the terms of this agreement through any lawful means (other than the grievance or arbitration process), including, but not limited to recourse to the National Labor Relations Board, recourse to any court of competent jurisdiction, or a combination of any such actions.
Sincerely,
256

Dear Dina:
As our industry and our company evolve, powerful economic and competitive dynamics will be at work. While we address many of these dynamics in our Evolving Technologies and Traditional Telecom Work agreement, further discussion on issues not addressed in this agreement may be necessary. These include:
•	rapid product and service evolution that is driven by highly accelerated technological progress;
•	the rise of facilities-based competitors - especially the largely nonunion cable industry - that have a distinct and substantial cost advantage in competing for customers;
•	a customer expectation of highly competitive price points for new products and services.
We acknowledge that it is in our mutual best interest to anticipate these financial and market dynamics and to explore how we jointly address them in a satisfactory way.
SBC agrees with CWA that these new technologies will redefine the communications industry as we are challenged to provide our customers with a broader range of communications vehicles and options.
We strongly agree that it is in our mutual best interest as a company and a union to create a means for more timely, disciplined and formal discussions to explore the jobs associated with these new technologies and their impact on our company and its employees.
In light of our mutual recognition that this is a significant and important issue for the future of SBC and the CWA, we suggest that the Presidential Council that we have jointly established is the ideal vehicle for us to continue the formal exchange of information and review of these sorts of emerging issues.
258
We propose that the Presidential Council be expanded and charged with exploring the impact of future technologies in a timely manner. Some ideas that come to mind are:
•	The union and company could identify subject matter experts who can best serve in such a capacity.
•	Topics for consideration by the panel could include:
-	SBC’s new technologies and product offerings
-	SBC’s affiliations and partnerships
-	SBC’s joint marketing programs
We are open to discussing additional ideas the CWAmight have to explore the impact of new technologies.
Sincerely,

259

AMENDMENTS TO THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT REGARDING NEUTRALITY & CARD CHECK RECOGNITION
SBC Operations, Inc. (“the Company”) and Communications Workers of America (“the Union”) hereby agree to the following amendments to the Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) Regarding Neutrality & Card Check Recognition, dated October 1, 2002:
1.	Duration. The duration of the MOA shall be extended to April 4, 2009.
2.	New Language shall be added to the MOA as follows:
The issue of eligibility under the card check agreement needs further discussion. At issue is the impact on the Company and the Union of defining employees who are defined as non-supervisory under the NLRA and those who are defined as non-represented/non-management. In the 2004 negotiations, the Union is not seeking to change the historic balance. However, as technology changes the nature of the network and its services there may need to be an adjustment in some of the historical exclusions or the administration of the card check process. We need to address this issue and related definitional issues from a forward-looking perspective in the President’s Council. The Company and the Union will appoint individuals to evaluate jobs in DataComm and report, jointly or separately, to the President’s Council their findings and recommendations as to the proper job classifications in DataComm as management or non-management for purposes of application of the card check agreement. The President’s Council will consist of the regional presidents, the data services president, and a senior representative of human resources on behalf of the Company. The Union representatives will consist of the District Vice Presidents and a representative of the CWA National office.
