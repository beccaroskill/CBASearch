PREAMBLE
Whereas, the Executive Branch of the State of Maine (hereinafter referred to as “State" or “employer") and the Maine State Employees Association, Service Employees International Union, Local 1989 (hereinafter referred to as “MSEA-SEIU”) desire to establish a constructive, cooperative and harmonious relationship; to avoid any interruption or interference with the operations of the employer; to promote effective service and quality of work life towards the accomplishment of the missions of the State; and to establish an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences;
Therefore, this Agreement by and between the parties is entered into as of July 1, 2007.

ARTICLE 1.	UNION RECOGNITION
Pursuant to the Maine Labor Relations Board certification dated January 5, 1978, the State recognizes the Maine State Employees Association (MSEA-SEIU) as the sole and exclusive representative for the purpose of representation and negotiations with respect to wages, hours of work and other conditions of employment for all employees included in the Operations, Maintenance and Support Services Bargaining Unit.
In the event of a dispute between the parties as to future inclusions or exclusions from the unit resulting from the establishment of new or changed classifications or titles, either party to this Agreement may apply to the Maine Labor Relations Board for resolution of the dispute.
Employees who are employed on a seasonal basis, i.e., for regularly recurring seasonal periods of three (3) months or more, shall be covered by the provisions of this Agreement upon the completion of six (6) months employment, subject to any special provisions relating to their employment. In order to qualify, such six (6) months must be worked in not more than three (3) consecutive years and only time in pay status during such seasons shall count. Employment time of persons outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment to a seasonal position, and employment time of persons holding a seasonal intermittent position shall not count towards the completion of such six (6) months.
Part-time employees will be covered by the provisions of this Agreement after completion of six (6) months of service except for the provision for dismissal for just cause. The just cause provision for dismissal shall apply after completion of 1,040 compensated hours exclusive of overtime hours. All benefits provided to part-time employees shall be prorated to the extent required by State law.
Temporary, seasonal and on-call employees, excluded by law from the bargaining unit, include project employees, seasonal employees not covered by the preceding paragraphs, persons from outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment, and intermittent employees. Project employees are employees appointed to a project position which is restricted to a planned work program to
2
be completed within a specified period of time and which is not regularly recurring. Intermittent employees are employees who are appointed for a period of time on a sporadic basis and who work not more than one thousand forty (1,040) hours in any consecutive twelve (12) month period beginning with the date of hire or anniversary of date of hire.
Any employee designated as intermittent, who works in excess of the limits set out above and who works more than 1,040 regularly scheduled hours during the period since appointment as an intermittent employee without a break in service due to resignation or dismissal shall be covered by the terms of this Agreement. The sporadic periods such an employee is not in pay status because of the sporadic nature of the position shall not be considered to be a break in service. Where a legislative position count permits, such employee shall be placed in a permanent or limited period full-time or part-time position as appropriate, provided that he or she is eligible for appointment. If necessary, the employee may reopen the appropriate register to establish eligibility.
Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as removing any rights or benefits of temporary, intermittent, project or seasonal employees provided under Title 5, MRSA, Sections 553-A and 559, Public Law 667,1978, or any other provision of law or rule.

Such access will be subject to the representative providing the appropriate State representative with advanced notice of the visit. Such access will not disrupt State operations or violate agency security procedures. If access needs to
3
be temporarily delayed for special reasons, those reasons shall be explained to the MSEA-SEIU representative.
Any MSEA-SEIU representative may have access to employees in this unit for the purpose of explaining MSEA-SEIU programs and benefits during employees’ non-working time, e.g., breaks, lunch periods and after hours, provided such access does not interfere with State operations. Such access shall be to non-work areas.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director of the Bureau of Human Resources may consider exceptions pursuant to Civil Service Rules.
An employee who demotes to a lower pay grade shall have his/her rate of pay adjusted to the highest rate in the new pay grade which is lower than the rate of the class from which the employee left, considering the same pay components listed above.
When an employee transfers (remains in the same pay grade) and remains within the same or equivalent salary schedule, his/her rate of pay will remain the same.
When an employee transfers (remains in the same pay grade), but moves from one salary schedule to another dissimilar salary schedule, his/her rate of pay will be adjusted to the closest step in the new salary schedule that does not result in a loss of pay, considering the same pay components listed above.
Determining the appropriate salary step upon promotion, demotion, or transfer may not result in a salary that is greater than the maximum or less than the minimum rates established in the salary schedule for the new classification.

For purposes of this Article, when a part-time employee moves from the part-time track to the full-time track, seniority calculations shall be converted to reflect actual time worked in the part-time position. Seniority credits for the purpose of this conversion shall be calculated according to the employees scheduled workweek.

APPENDIX C
ARTICLE 66. UNION SECURITY
[Prior to September 20, 2007, the following Union Security Article was in effect.]
1.	Selection of Fee
Any employee covered by this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, be required to choose from the options of membership in MSEA-SEIU or payment to MSEA-SEIU of a service fee equal to their pro-rata share of the costs to MSEA-SEIU that are germane to collective bargaining and contract administration as defined by law.
Employees shall be required to (a) sign a written payroll deduction authorization form authorizing deduction from their pay of the membership dues or service fee, or (b) tender the amount of the service fee due to the union, or (c) indicate in writing their religious objection to such fee and make contributions at least equal in amount to the service fee to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee so objecting and the Union. Employees choosing (b) or (c) shall make payments within ten (10) days after each payday.
The obligation to pay fees or dues shall become effective as follows:
a.	For employees first hired after December 1,2004, the payment obligation shall be effective at the start of the pay period commencing closest to but not earlier than the thirtieth day after the end of their initial six months of probation;
b.	For all other employees, the period commencing closest to but not earlier than July 1, 2005. This obligation shall be implemented simultaneously with the salary increase scheduled for July 2005.
103
2.	Calculation of Service Fee
MSEA-SEIU shall determine the amount of the service fee to be charged to non-members, consistent with both applicable law and this Article and shall certify to the State the amount of the service fee.
The service fee paid by part-time employees shall bear the same ratio to part-time dues as the fee paid by full time employees bears to the dues amount paid by full time employees.
3.	Change of Status
The right to join MSEA-SEIU shall be determined by the Union's own Constitution and Bylaws. Otherwise, employees may change their status with regard to membership in MSEA-SEIU or service fee payment as follows:
a.	Employees may change their status from service fee payer to MSEA-SEIU member, or from MSEA-SEIU member to service fee payer, at any time.
b.	Employees may also start or eliminate their payroll deduction for MSEA-SEIU dues or for the service fee at any time.
c.	Employees who wish to eliminate payroll deduction, must tender their dues or service fees directly to MSEA-SEIU.
d.	In order to change status and/or eliminate or change any payroll deduction option consistent with paragraphs (a) through (c) above, the employee must provide written notice to both MSEA-SEIU and the employee’s payroll officer. MSEA-SEIU and the payroll officers shall promptly notify one another that an employee has provided written notice of a requested change, providing identifying information regarding each such employee. It may take up to four (4) weeks for the requested change to take effect.
4.	Payments and Deductions
It shall be the sole responsibility of MSEA-SEIU to collect its dues or service fees and to verify contributions made in lieu of service fees. No payroll deduction of service fees shall be made from workers’ compensation benefits or for any payroll period in which
104
earnings received are insufficient to cover the amount of the deduction, nor shall such deductions be made from subsequent payrolls to retroactively cover the period in question. Employees shall not be penalized for failing to pay service fees for any such pay period(s).
5.	Notice and Audit
MSEA-SEIU shall calculate the amount of the fee after the close of its annual audit, based on the expenditures reflected in the most recent available audited records. That calculation shall also be audited to verify that the union's records have actually been audited; have been correctly reproduced from the audit report, and that the union has performed any mathematical adjustments correctly, and for any other purpose required by law. The fee will be effective on a paydate at least 30 days after the notice described below has been provided to members of the bargaining unit, or provided to newly eligible employees.
Once the audit is complete, MSEA-SEIU shall prepare a notice, consistent with applicable law, to all employees covered by this Agreement who are not members of MSEA-SEIU. Such notice shall be updated annually and shall explain the choices and indicate that the sums determined to be the service fee were audited by an independent auditor based on the union’s financial records for its most recent fiscal year. The notices shall include all information required by applicable law, including at a minimum, the major categories of expenses, as reflected in the audit; whether each expense will be included in the service fee; the identity of the auditor(s); and the opinion of each audit, including the opinion included in any adjusted audit(s). The State agrees to distribute this notice and dues deduction forms, provided by MSEA-SEIU, to new employees at the time they are hired. MSEA-SEIU shall provide notices required by law to all current bargaining unit employees who are not members of MSEA-SEIU. Any change in the amount of the service fee to be deducted shall be certified to the Director of the Bureau of Employee Relations by the Treasurer of MSEA-SEIU at least thirty (30) days in advance of the change. At the same time MSEA-SEIU provides the annual notice to non-members, it will also make the notice available to MSEA-SEIU
105
members through means of communication available to the union, such as posting on MSEA-SEIU’s website.
6.	Religious Objectors
In the event that any employee covered hereby holds a sincere and bona fide religious belief that conflicts with an obligation to financially support MSEA-SEIU, public employee organizations or labor organizations in general, that employee shall have the right to refuse to make service fee payments; provided, however, that said right to refuse shall continue only so long as the employee makes contributions at least equal in amount to the service fee to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee so refusing and the Union. Part-time employees’ contributions to non-religious charitable organizations shall coincide in amount with the payments of those part-time employees paying the service fee. MSEA-SEIU shall not unreasonably deny the choice of such non-religious charitable organization suggested by the employee.
Should an employee have a pending written request for religious objector status or a pending administrative or legal challenge regarding their religious objector status, the employee must place an amount equal to the service fee in an interest-bearing escrow account pending resolution of such dispute or request. MSEA-SEIU shall pay for any maintenance fees associated with such escrow accounts. The State shall not be liable for any fees, costs, damages, expenses, or any other form of liability involved with regard to such escrow accounts.
7.	Disputes
The amount of the service fee shall be subject to review pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees. Pending resolution of any such dispute, the disputed amount of fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account. MSEA-SEIU shall pay for any maintenance fees associated with such escrow accounts. The State shall not be liable for any
106
fees, costs, damages, expenses, or any other form of liability involved with regard to such escrow accounts.
MSEA-SEIU is solely responsible for payment of the fee charged by AAA for the cost of providing necessary administrative services.
The arbitrator will be compensated by MSEA-SEIU, in accordance with the per-diem rate currently on file for that arbitrator with the AAA, and shall be reimbursed for expenses by MSEA-SEIU. Attorneys’ fees, witness fees, and other expenses shall be borne by the respective parties. No fees, costs, damages, expenses, or other form of liability involved with regard to arbitration shall be borne by the State.
In the event a dispute under this Article is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to order the State to pay such service fee on behalf of any employee. If the arbitrator decides that an employee has failed to pay or authorize the payment of the service fee in accordance with this Article, the only remedy shall be the termination of the employment of such employee if the employee refused to pay or authorize payment of the required service fee and the State complied with the adverse employment action procedure described below.
8.	Failure to Pay Fee
It shall be the sole obligation of MSEA-SEIU to certify to the State the name of each employee who has not paid his or her service fee or who has not made a contribution in lieu of a service fee and who, in the case of employees who are actively challenging the amount of the fee or the procedures implemented pursuant to this article, are not paying the disputed amount into the interest-bearing escrow account established by the union. MSEA-SEIU agrees to cooperate in any State investigation performed due to or in reliance upon each statement.
The Discipline article does not apply to employees who have not complied with this Article. The following procedure shall apply. On the first occasion the State determines, after an opportunity to investigate, that an employee failed to comply with this Article, the State shall provide the employee with notice of a finding of a violation of
107
this Article and afford that employee a 30-day period to comply fully with this Article, paying all arrears due. Should the employee fail to timely correct this deficiency or should the employee be subsequently found by the State as failing to comply with this Article, the employee shall be provided with a notice of proposed dismissal. The employee will be afforded an opportunity to meet with the appointing authority or his/her representative prior to the action proposed. The employee will be entitled to have a Union representative or steward present. At that meeting, the appointing authority or his/her designee will give the employee an explanation of the employer’s evidence against the employee (if that has not already been provided) and offer the employee an opportunity to respond. Any employee who has not timely complied with the obligations of this Article must be dismissed. A dismissal in compliance with this Article may not be challenged through the Grievance Procedure article of this agreement,
9.	Indemnification
MSEA-SEIU agrees that it shall indemnify, defend, reimburse, and hold the State harmless (collectively, “Indemnification") against any claim, demand, suit, cost, expense, damages, or any other form of liability, including attorneys' fees, costs, or other liability arising from or incurred as a result of any act taken or not taken by the State, its members, officers, agents, employees, or representatives in complying with or carrying out the provisions of this Article, including, but not limited to, as a result of being ordered to reinstate an employee terminated at the request of MSEA-SEIU for not paying the service fee; in reliance on any notice, letter, or authorization forwarded to the State by the union pursuant to this Article; and including but not limited to any charge that the State failed to discharge any duty owed to its employees arising out of the service fee deduction; provided that, nothing herein shall require Indemnification for any intentional deprivation of an individual’s constitutional rights by the State. MSEA-SEIU will intervene in and defend any administrative or court litigation concerning the propriety of any act taken or not taken by the State, including, but not limited to, termination for failure to pay the service
108
fee. In such litigation the State shall have no obligation to defend its act taken or not taken.
10.	Severability
Should the United States Supreme Court, the First Circuit Court of Appeals or any Court in Maine hold indemnity clauses relating to union security void or unenforceable on Constitutional or public policy reasons, this Article shall be stricken in its entirety upon written notification to MSEA-SEIU by the State. Should any Court find the indemnity clause in this Article to be void or unenforceable for any reason, this Article shall be stricken in its entirety upon written notification to MSEA-SEIU by the State. Should the State provide such written notification, the parties shall enter into negotiations regarding a replacement Union Security Article.
