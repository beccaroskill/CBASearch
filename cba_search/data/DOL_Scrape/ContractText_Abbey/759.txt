The term "staff nurse" applies to registered professional nurses who are employed primarily to give direct nursing care to patients/clients, to scrub or circulate in the operating room, and to work directly with patients during examinations or treatments. Delivery of care is directed toward promotion and restoration of health, prevention of disease and care of the sick and

THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between the undersigned Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association.
1.	RECOGNITION:
The Minnesota Nurses Association will be the sole representative of all registered professional staff nurses, clinical educators, and assistant nurse managers employed in the Hospital.
2.	EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT:
It is the mutual purpose of Minnesota Nurses Association and the Hospital to encourage each nurse to continue and pursue her or his professional interest and education in nursing. To this end, salary increments for educational advancement are provided for in Section 4, Salary, paragraph (b) of this Agreement. Provision has also been made in Section 13, Leave of Absence, for appropriate leaves of absence for educational purposes.
(a)	Tuition Reimbursement:
The Hospital shall pay the nurse minimum reimbursement in the amount of one hundred percent (100%) of tuition and required fees and books up to two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per year for educational course work at an accredited institution under the following circumstances. If the nurse is taking course work toward a bachelor's or master’s degree in nursing, the reimbursement is increased to three thousand dollars ($3000.00) per year.
(1)	The manager must approve the proposed course or sequence of studies as having a reasonable relation to the nurse's professional employment.
(2)	The nurse must sign a certificate that she or he will continue to or return to work at the Hospital for at least one (1) year after completion of the course or sequence of studies. If a nurse fails to continue or return to work for as least one (1) year, the repayment shall be prorated based on the amount of time the nurse continues to work for the Hospital. Nurses who have 20,800 seniority hours or more at the time of termination shall not be required to make any repayment. At the time of layoff, a nurse will continue to be eligible for reimbursement as provided in this Section for courses previously approved and shall not be required to repay the Hospital any reimbursement which would otherwise be required to be repaid.
3
Children'! Minneapolis 1004-2007
(3)	Payment shall be made upon satisfactory completion of each course for which reimbursement has been requested. Provided, nevertheless, that the nurse shall repay the Hospital any reimbursement she or he has been paid hereunder to the extent that she or he does not continue to or make herself or himself available to return to work at the Hospital for at least one (1) year after completion of the course or sequence of studies.
(4)	Eligibility for reimbursement during a leave of absence:
a.	If a nurse has received approval for reimbursement according to policy and started the program, and then becomes sick and goes out on an extended medical leave, the nurse will still receive reimbursement. If she/he does not actually return to work or does not fulfill her/his work requirement from (a) (2) above, the Hospital will seek to recoup the money.
b.	If a nurse is out on a Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave, within the twelve (12) weeks, her/his benefits continue as if she/he were still working, and thus the reimbursement eligibility continues. The nurse would follow the process for approval as outlined in this Agreement and Hospital policy and would still be subject to the continuing work requirement from (a) (2) above. The Hospital would seek to recoup any payments should the nurse not return to work after her/his leave.
c.	If a nurse is on an extended leave of any kind, either personal or beyond FMLA eligibility, then she/he is not eligible for the reimbursement program as this nurse is not considered to be regularly scheduled to work.
(b)	Schedule Accommodations:
(1)	A nurse making satisfactory progress toward completion of a nursing or related degree may temporarily reduce hours in a manner that is mutually agreed between the Hospital and the nurse in order to accommodate completion of the degree. A nurse may also be granted scheduling accommodations (without reduction of hours) in a manner mutually agreed between the nurse and the Hospital to facilitate the nurse completing the degree.
(2)	A full-time (1.0) nurse may be granted scheduling accommodations (without reduction in hours) in a manner agreed upon between the nurse and the Hospital to facilitate the nurse attending workshops, courses and other educational programs. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the nurse may work another shift in the schedule, or take flex time, to keep her/himself whole.
4
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
(c)	Workshops, Courses, and Other Educational Programs:
A nurse may use up to four hundred dollars ($400.00) per year of the amount provided in this Section, reimbursed at one hundred percent (100%) for workshops, courses, and other types of educational programs that are:
(1)	Part of a plan to prepare the nurse for a second clinical service. The nature of the program shall be determined by agreement between the nurse and Hospital, taking into account the Hospital’s needs and the nurse’s interest. Nurses participating in such program shall receive reimbursement for approved courses taken thereunder upon satisfactory completion of the workshop, course, or educational program. Nurses so participating shall be given preference in floating to the secondary clinical area and agree to float to such area as needed.
Participation in the program shall be voluntary and completed on the nurse's own time. The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only to nurses regularly working at least thirty-two (32) hours per two (2) week pay period at the time of the agreement between the nurse and the Hospital, or
(2)	Preparing for national certification for the nurse’s area of practice. (A list of currently recognized certification programs is attached as Appendix B), or
(3)	Related to complementary therapies that may enhance the nurse’s skills, or
(4)	Related to the nurse’s clinical area of practice.
(5)	Eligibility for reimbursement during a leave of absence:
a.	If a nurse has received approval for reimbursement according to policy .	and started the program, and then becomes sick and goes out on an
extended medical leave, the nurse will still receive reimbursement.
b.	If a nurse is out on a Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) leave, within the twelve (12) weeks, her/his benefits continue as if she/he were still working, and thus the reimbursement eligibility continues. The nurse would follow the process for approval as outlined in this Agreement and Hospital policy.
c.	If a nurse is on an extended leave of any kind, either personal or beyond FMLA eligibility, then she/he is not eligible for the reimbursement program as this nurse is not considered to be regularly scheduled to work.
(d)	Required Education Subsequent to Employment:
Any education required by the Hospital subsequent to employment shall be provided during hours compensated pursuant to the Contract Agreement, and with the expenses thereof paid by the Hospital.
5
Children’! Minneapolii 2004-2007
Mandatory meetings and required education will be offered or made accessible to the registered nurse during or adjacent to the nurse’s scheduled work shift. Alternate mechanisms, such as video tapes, audio tapes, or self-study, may be used.
(e)	Professional Membership Dues:
A nurse may use the educational monies as provided for in this Section toward professional membership dues.
3.	HOURS:
(a)	Hours of Work and Overtime: The basic work period shall be eighty (80) hours to be worked during a period of two (2) weeks (fourteen [14] consecutive days). The regular work day will be eight (8) hours. A nurse required to work in excess of eighty (80) hours during said two (2) week period or in excess of eight (8) hours in any work day shall be paid at one and one-half (1 1/2) times her or his regular rate of pay for all excess time so worked. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, a nurse required to work in excess of eight (8) consecutive hours will be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times her or his regular rate of pay for the first four (4) hours of such overtime; and will be paid double time (2) for all overtime in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours. Overtime payments shall not be duplicated. Paid sick leave, holiday and vacation hours shall be considered as hours of work for overtime purposes.	.
For a nurse who is employed in a position(s) involving two different hourly rates of pay, the overtime rate of pay for on-duty hours in a bargaining unit position shall not be less than one and one-half (1 1/2) times the nurse's regular rate of pay for on-duty hours in the bargaining unit position.
No nurse shall be disciplined for refusal to work overtime.
No nurse will work more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours, in any combination of shifts and including the work those hours entail, unless replacement staff are not able to report for duty for the next shift because of unusual, unpredictable or unforeseen circumstances. Such circumstances include but are not limited to an act of terrorism, a disease outbreak, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters which impact continuity of patient care.
(b)	Breaks: A nurse shall be entitled to, in any combination if agreed upon mutually, one (1) paid fifteen (15) minute rest break for each four (4) hours on duty. In addition, she or he will be given one (1) thirty (30) minute duty-free meal break for each scheduled shift. This meal break will extend the scheduled shift time by one-half (1/2) hour and if a nurse does not receive this meal break she or he will be paid for the additional one-half (1/2) hour on duty time as provided in Section 3, Hours. If no duty-free meal break is included in the scheduled time for any specified shift, that scheduled shift time will not be extended. The Hospital will plan for break relief for nurses in units where staffing is not conducive to duty-free breaks. A regular review of the ability for nurses on the unit to take their breaks will be included in the quarterly dialogue between the manager, unit Association representative(s) and Association chairperson. A nurse will not be required to remain on the unit during any unpaid
6
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
meal break, and may choose whether or not to take technological equipment with her/him while on break.
(c)	Scheduling: The general pattern of scheduling will be as follows:
(1)	Nurses will have two (2) consecutive days off and alternate weekends (Saturday and Sunday) off. For those nurses regularly scheduled to work weekends, Friday shifts shall be defined as part of the scheduled weekend to work. On her/his weekend off, a nurse shall not be required to work from 7:00 am Friday through 7:00 am Monday. When staffing patterns allow for nurses to work less than every other weekend, preference for additional weekend time off will be given to nurses by seniority on the unit. If necessary to allow for flexibility in scheduling, nohconsecutive days off during weekdays (Monday through Friday) may be utilized. The scheduled work week need not correspond to the calendar week, and the pattern of scheduling may be such that more or fewer than five (5) days of work are scheduled in one (1) week
■	provided that not more than ten (10) days of work are normally scheduled in
any two (2) work weeks.
(2)	Nurses normally shall not be required to work more than days and reliefer days and nights.
(3)	Normally there shall be at least twelve (12) hours between assigned shifts (days, relief or nights) except on days prior to scheduled days off.
(4)	Unless it would result in a nurse not being able to fulfill her/his FTE and weekend commitments, the following will apply:
a.	A nurse working eight (8) or ten (10) hour shifts will not be required to work more than five (5) consecutive days without the nurse’s consent.
b.	A nurse working twelve (12) hour shifts will not be required to work more than three (3) consecutive days without the nurse's consent.
c.	A nurse working a position that combines both eight (8) and twelve (12) hour shifts will not be required to work more than forty (40) hours on consecutive days without the nurse's consent.
d.	A nurse rotating days and nights will not have less than twenty-four (24) hours off between rotations without the nurse’s consent.
If these provisions conflict with a nurse's holiday obligation, the conflict will be resolved in accordance with SAC policies for that site.
(5)	Nurses with confirmed work agreements of .8 -1.0 will have blocked/fixed schedules.
(6)	A nurse working in a unit open twenty-four hours in a day/seven days,a week (24/7) shall not be scheduled for more than three (3) starting shift times per four (4) week period.
Exceptions to the general pattern of scheduling may be made by agreement between the Hospital and the nurse concerned or in cases of emergency or unavoidable
7
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
situations where the application of the general patterns would have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service.
(d)	Weekend Assignments: Insofar as practicable, weekend assignments will be made equally among the nurses employed on each unit. Assistant Nurse Managers will not be required to work weekends; they will, however, share Monday and Friday shifts equally with the staff nurses on the unit.
Nurses with confirmed work agreements of .8 - 1.0, straight nights, will not be required to work more than every third (3rd) week-end. These nurses may work with their managers to create unique week-end schedules which include every third (3rd) week-end.	'
(e)	Bonus for Extra Unscheduled Weekend Shifts: Full-time and regularly scheduled part-time nurses who work more weekend shifts than the alternate weekends as authorized under Section 3 (c) (1) of this Contract Agreement shall be paid an additional seventy-five dollars ($75.00) for each full nonscheduled weekend shift on days and/or evenings, and one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each full non-scheduled weekend shift on nights. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all shifts worked between 3:00 p.m. Friday and 7:00 a.m. Monday. This weekend bonus will apply to Operating Room nurses who voluntarily work additional non-scheduled weekend shifts above scheduled call. The weekend bonus payment shall not be paid if additional shifts are worked as a result of nurses voluntarily exchanging hours.
(f)	Split Shifts: The Hospital agrees that there will be no split shifts unless it is mutually agreeable to both the nurse and the Hospital.
(g)	Unscheduled Shift: A nurse who is called to work an unscheduled shift and who is called not later than one-half (1/2) hour after the commencement of that shift shall be paid for the entire shift if she or he arrives within a period of time objectively determined to be reasonable.
(h)	Flexible Work Positions Greater Than Eight (8) Hours: For patient care needs, the Hospital may post positions of greater than eight (8) hours in length. Positions established pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be subject to the following conditions:
(1)	The Hospital will post positions of greater than eight (8) hours in length, subject to the following:
a)	If a position of greater than eight (8) hours in length is vacated, it will be
•	posted house wide.
b)	In the case of newly created positions of greater than eight (8) hours in length where the number of positions is less than or equal to the number of open FTEs on the particular unit, these positions will be posted house wide.
c)	In the case of newly created positions of greater than eight (8) hours in length where the number of positions is greater than the number of
8
Children’s Minneapolis 2004-2007
open FTEs on the particular unit, these positions will be posted on the unit.
d)	There will be no involuntary changes in the number of hours per pay period, shift rotation, shift length, or unit of a currently employed nurse as a result of flexible positions of greater than eight (8) hours in length.
In order to vacate a flexible position of greater than eight (8} hours in length, a nurse must bid on, and be awarded, another position.
(2)	Unless it would result in a nurse not being able to fulfill her/his FTE and weekend commitments, a nurse in a flexible position of greater than eight (8) hours in length shall not be scheduled to work more than five (5) consecutive days often (10) hour shifts, or three (3) consecutive days of twelve- (12) hour shifts without her/his consent. If these provisions conflict with a nurse’s holiday obligation, the conflict will be resolved in accordance with SAC policies for that site.
(3)	The basic work period shall be forty (40) hours per week. A nurse shall be paid time and one-half (1 1/2) for work in excess of forty (40) hours per week rather than the overtime provisions set forth in Section 3, Hours, (a). Further, even though the total hours worked during a week may not exceed forty (40), a nurse working in excess of her or his scheduled work day shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) for all excess time so worked over eight (8) hours, except that hours in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours in a work day shall be paid at the rate of double time. The Hospital shall retain written documentation that a nurse has agreed to a flexible work position and of the type of flexible position to which the nurse has agreed.
(4)	Shift differential shall be paid for the entire shift for any shift where the majority of the hours worked occurs after 3:00 p.m.
(5)	Sick leave shall be accrued at a rate proportionate to that specified in Section 9, Time Off Plan, for registered nurses who are not working a flexible position. Sick pay will be paid for the total scheduled hours lost and shall be deducted from accumulated sick leave at the same rate.
Flex time shall accrue at the rate proportionate to that specified in Section 9, Time Off Plan, for registered nurses not working a flexible position and shall be granted in a manner to provide a registered nurse an equal amount of calendar time off as provided in Section 9, Time Off Plan.
Holiday pay shall be based on the number of hours regularly scheduled under the flexible position. Personal holidays will be credited in the following manner: a nurse whose position consists of one (1) shift length shall be credited with hours equal to that shift length for each personal holiday; a nurse whose position is a combination shift lengths shall be credited with hours for each personal holiday equal to an average of the confirmed position (e.g., a combination of eight- (8) and twelve- (12) hour shifts would equal ten (10) hours of credit).
9
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
In no event will the occurrence of a holiday, paid sick leave or flex time have the effect of diminishing the number of hours normally paid to a nurse in a payroll period.
(6)	The Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association shall meet periodically during the term of this Agreement to review and discuss and consider the effect of flexible positions.
There shall be no discrimination by the Hospital against any nurse because she or he declines to volunteer for flexible work positions. It is the intention of this Section that flexible positions are to be a supplement and not a replacement for the basic 80 and 8 patterns.
(i)	Flexible Work Positions, Less Than Eight (8) Hours: For patient care needs, the Hospital may post positions of less than eight (8) hours in length. These positions will be a minimum of four (4) hours in length.

c)	In the case of newly created positions of less than eight (8) hours in length where the number of positions is greater than the number of open FTEs on the particular unit, these positions will be posted on the unit.
d)	There will be no involuntary changes in the number of hours per pay period, shift rotation, shift length, or unit of a currently employed nurse as a result of flexible positions of less than eight (8) hours in length.
In order to vacate a flexible position of less than eight (8) hours in length, a nurse must bid on, and be awarded, another position.
(2} Unless it would result in a nurse not being able to fulfill her/his FTE and weekend commitments, a nurse in a flexible position of less than eight (8) hours in length shall not be scheduled to work more than-five (5) consecutive days without her/his consent. If these provisions conflict with a nurse’s holiday obligation, the conflict will be resolved in accordance with SAC policies for that .	site.

A nurse required to work in excess of eighty (80) hours during said two (2) week period or in excess of eight (8) hours in any work day shall be paid at one and one-half (1T4) times her/his regular rate of pay for all excess time so worked. The Hospital shall retain written documentation that a nurse has agreed to a flexible work position and of the type of flexible position to which the nurse has agreed.

Holiday pay shall be based on the number of hours regularly scheduled under the flexible position. Personal holidays will be credited in the following manner: a nurse whose position consists of one (1) shift length shall be credited with hours equal to that shift length for each personal holiday; a nurse whose position is a combination of shift lengths shall be credited with hours for each personal holiday equal to an average of the confirmed position (e.g., a combination of eight (8) and four (4) hour shifts would equal six (6) hours of credit).
Nurses in positions of less than eight (8) hours In length shall have the same obligation to work holidays as other nurses on their particular unit, pursuant to Sections 6, Part-Time Nurses, and 8, Holidays.
In no event will the occurrence of a holiday, paid sick leave, or flex time have the effect of diminishing the number of hours normally paid to a nurse in a payroll period.
(6)	The Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association shall meet periodically during the term of this Agreement to review and discuss and consider the effect of flexible positions.
There shall be no discrimination by the Hospital against any nurse because she or he declines to volunteer for flexible work positions. It is the intention of this Section that flexible positions are to be a supplement and not a replacement for the basic 80 and 8 patterns.

Children*! Minneapolis 2004-2007
G)
Shifts of Less Than Eight Hours on Units in Operation Less Than 24 Hours a Dav:
A nurse shall not be required to work a shift of less than eight (8) hours unless her or his assigned unit or service is in operation less than twenty-four (24) hours a day. Assigned shifts of less than eight (8) hours may be utilized on such units if a nurse voluntarily agrees to such shifts or, in the absence of volunteers, no reasonable alternative exists to provide needed nursing care. If no nurse agrees to a shift of less than eight (8) hours and no reasonable alternative exists, the short shift on such a unit will be assigned to the least senior nurse on the unit or service.
Shift differential shall be paid for the entire shift for any shift where the majority of the hours worked occurs after 3:00 p.m.
(k)	Alternative Weekend Schedules: The Hospital may establish flexible scheduling plans providing work schedules of only two twelve (12) hours shifts every weekend.

(4)	A nurse working two (2) twelve (12) hour weekend shifts on an Alternative Weekend Schedule shall be credited with thirty-six (36) hours per weekend (seventy-two (72] hours per payroll period) toward accumulation of all contractually provided benefits, including pension and seniority. A nurse will receive one (1) hour of credit toward benefits for each additional hour the nurse agrees to work.
(5)	For purposes of Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff, (d) a nurse on an Alternative Weekend Schedule shall be considered to be regularly scheduled for seventy-two (72) compensated hours per payroll period. If a nurse agrees to take a voluntary low need day for a portion of her or his scheduled twelve (12) hour weekend shift, the nurse will receive one and one-half (1 1/2) hours of pay for each hour worked on the partial shift and, in accordance with Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff, (b), will be given one and one-half (1 1/2) hours credit toward benefits for all hours lost.
12
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
(6)	Flex time and sick leave used shall be paid and be deducted from the nurse's accumulated flex time and sick leave at the same rate as it is accrued. A nurse will, therefore, receive eighteen (18) hours of pay for each twelve (12) hour weekend shift taken as flex time or sick leave.
(7)	A nurse electing an alternative weekend schedule may be scheduled to work on each holiday falling on a weekend.
(8)	Holiday pay shall be based on the number of hours regularly scheduled under the Alternative Weekend Program.
(9)	Section 3, Hours (e) relating to the Weekend Bonus and Section 4, Salary.

(10)	The basic work week for nurses on the Alternative Weekend Program shall be forty (40) hours per week. A nurse shall be paid time and one-half (1 1/2) for all hours in excess of forty (40) hours per week. For purposes of determining eligibility for overtime only, a nurse will be credited with thirty-two (32) hours of work for each twenty-four (24) hours worked under this Alternative Weekend Program. Further, a nurse working in excess of her or his scheduled work day shall be paid time and one-half (1 1/2) for all excess hours so worked except that hours in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours in a work day shall be paid at the rate the double (2) time.
(11)	Nurses on the Alternative Weekend Program may elect permanent assignment to the night shift. The remaining night shifts shall be shared proportionately by nurses electing to work twelve (12) hour shifts on weekends under this Program or other schedules including twelve (12) hour shifts on a weekend developed in accordance with Section 3, Hours, (h) above.
(12)	A nurse electing to work schedules under this Section may revoke such election by giving the Hospital written notice of at least four (4) weeks prior to the effective date of the Hospital's next posted schedule of work hours.

(Ex: four (4) semester credits equal six (6) quarter credits, and eight (8) semester credits equals twelve (12) quarter credits.)
Workshops and/or institutes may be substituted for one-half (1/2) of the credit requirements of the three (3) and six (6) year educational increments. One (1) day at a workshop will be equal to one-half (1/2) credit providing an acceptable written report is made to the Director of Nurses. One-half (1/2) of the credits required for each of these educational increments must be earned in college work.

♦	consistent variance between budgeted FTEs and actual FTEs
The increases or decreases shall be addressed at the unit level between the nurse and the nurse’s manager. If they are unable to agree, the issue may be brought to a mutually agreeable labor-management group such as Staffing Advisory Committee or other appropriate groups at the facility for consultation. This group shall use an interest-based, problem-solving approach to address the issue.
If resolution does not occur within a pre-determined period of time, the nurse may use the grievance process.
(f)	Relieving Nurse Manager: When a staff nurse performs the duties of a Nurse Manager, she or he shall receive the rate of pay of an assistant nurse manager (at the same increment level that the staff nurse is presently receiving) for any shift of work consisting of at least eight (8) hours of work.

The plan is composed of accrual amounts for vacation, sick, and an annual credit for personal holiday/s and the birthday holiday. The accrual of hours from each of these benefits will be combined in the following ways:
•	Flex Time Bank - includes accrued hours of vacation, personal holiday/s and the birthday holiday. Also includes a partial accrual of sick leave hours (the remaining sick leave hours accrue to the “sick bank" as outlined below). Hours in this Flex Time Bank may be used as they are accrued.
•	Sick Time Bank - includes a partial accrual of sick hours (the remaining sick bank hours accrue to the “Flex Time Bank” as outlined above). Guidelines for the Sick Time Bank are the same as outlined in Section 9, Time Off Plan, (d), Sick Leave.
(3)	Part-Time Sick Leave: Regularly scheduled part-time nurses as described in part (c) of this Section 6 who have averaged thirty-two (32) compensated hours or more per two (2) week payroll period will be entitled to sick leave with pay for personal illness. The Hospital may request reasonable evidence of such illness. Sick leave will be granted for absences from work only on a day scheduled as a work day.
Regularly scheduled nurses averaging 32 hours per pay period or more will be entitled to sick leave with pay for personal illness, not to exceed the accumulated amount. Nurses may choose one (1) of two (2) accrual rates based on her/his selection of short term disability. The following rates apply:
24
Chi Wren's Minneapolis 1004-2007
a)	If Short Term Disability (STD) is not selected during open enrollment, seven (7) days per year will accumulate to the Flex Time Bank and five (5) days will accumulate to the Sick Time Bank on a prorated basis.
b)	If Short Term Disability (STD) is selected during open enrollment, six (6) days per year will accumulate to the Flex Time Bank and two (2) days per year will accumulate to the Sick Time Bank on a prorated basis.	.
The accrual rates for full-time and regularly scheduled part-time nurses averaging 32 hours per pay period or more shall be determined by dividing the annual number of sick hours based on the above schedule by 2,080 hours and shall be as follows:
a)	Seven (7) days (56 hours) - .0269 flex hours accrued for each compensated hour.
b)	Five (5) days (40 hours) - .0192 sick hours accrued for each compensated hour.
c)	Six (6) days (48 hours) - .0231 flex hours accrued for each compensated hour.
d)	Two (2) days (16 hours) - .0077 sick hours accrued for each compensated hour.
(d)	Transfer between Part-Time and Full-Time: A change in status from full-time to part-time or from part-time to full-time shall not work a forfeiture of earned benefits. A change in status from full-time to part-time or from part-time to full-time shall not work a loss of credited standing to earn benefits, which benefits are contractually provided in the status to which the nurse has changed. Credited vacation standing earned as a part-time nurse who has changed to a full-time nurse status will be determined on the basis of credit for one (1) year's service for each two thousand eighty (2,080) compensated hours.
(e)	Casual: There shall be established and maintained within each Hospital, a pool of casual nurses employed by the Hospital to be utilized to supplement the full and regularly scheduled part-time staff. A casual nurse shall be called or scheduled to work in a manner mutually agreeable between the nurse and the Hospital. A casual nurse is not assured the availability of work on a regular continuing basis; but a casual nurse is not obligated to report to duty each time she or he is requested to work. Casual nurses may be assigned a station unit or may be utilized to float among station units. A casual nurse will not be granted a leave of absence to exceed six (6) months, unless such leave is a personal illness, injury or disability leave of absence, ora maternity/paternity leave of absence, as set forth in Section 13, Leave of Absence.
If a nurse transfers to a casual nurse status, she or he shall accrue no additional vacation or sick leave benefits. Such benefits or credited time toward these benefits shall be maintained on the nurse's record and restored to the nurse at such time as she or he transfers back to full-time or regularly scheduled part-time status.
25
Children'! Minneapolis 2004-2007
Casual nurses shall receive salary increments as described in attached Salary Charts on the basis of one (1) year's service for each two thousand eighty (2,080) compensated hours.
In order to maintain casual status, casual nurses are required to work two (2) shifts per month, and one (1) of those shifts must be either a weekend shift or a night shift. Casual nurses who are receiving a Twin City Hospitals - Minnesota Nurses Association Pension Plan monetary benefit may meet these work requirements on an annual basis. Casual nurses who do not meet these requirements will be terminated. If a casual nurse has a shift canceled by the Hospital, such shift shall count toward the two (2) shift minimum. A casual nurse shall be given a minimum of two (2) hours advance notice of the cancellation of any shift of work for which the nurse has agreed to work.
Following the staff adjustment period of schedule development, casual nurses may voluntarily be pre-scheduled.
Any casual nurse who works greater than four hundred sixteen (416) hours as a casual nurse in the previous calendar year will be eligible to be awatded position(s), pursuant to Section 16, Schedules and Postings, before casual nurses who have worked less than four hundred sixteen (416) hours in the previous calendar year. To qualify for this benefit, a casual nurse needs to have been in the casual status for a minimum of one (1) full calendar year.
(f)	Application of Other Contract Provisions: Except as otherwise expressly limited or qualified by this Section 6, or another section of this Contract Agreement, a parttime nurse shall be entitled to the benefit of the other sections of this Agreement.
(g)	Eligibility and Accumulation of Benefits: For purposes of this Section 6 and Section 24, Insurance Benefits, compensated hours shall include all hours for which a nurse is paid except off premises on-call hours. An overtime hour shall be counted as a compensated hour on the basis of one (1) hour per each overtime hour paid. In addition, compensated hours shall include hours which Section 13, Leave of Absence, subparagraphs (a), (d), (g), (h) and (i) provide are hours worked or hours for which length of service increments accrue.
(h)	Increase in Part-Time Hours: A regularly scheduled part-time nurse who, over a six (6) month period, is consistently scheduled for or consistently works more shifts than the number confirmed pursuant to Section 4, Salary, (e), or the most recent amendment to that employment understanding, shall, upon request of the nurse, have her or his confirmed number of work shifts increased up to the average number of shifts actually worked in the preceding six (6) months. If there are nurses holding recall rights to available hours, confirmation of increased work shifts to a nurse under this provision shall be delayed until qualified nurses holding recall rights to available hours have been offered recall. The above notwithstanding, no nurse shall be regularly scheduled for greater than full-time hours.

Children'a Minneapolis 2004-2007
7.	ROTATION AND SHIFT OF CHOICE:
Nurses with ten (10) or more years of seniority, as defined in Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff, will be afforded the opportunity to work a permanent shift assignment of the nurse's choice subject to the need to provide proper staffing on all shifts. In order to provide greater opportunities for nurses to select a shift of choice, the Hospital will create more straight shifts. The parties recognize that complete implementation of this provision will need to be phased in, and that the period of implementation will be governed by the following:
(a)	The Hospital will review the current schedules on each unit in order to determine if additional straight shifts may be offered. It is recognized that to the extent that permanent day shifts are created on a unit, the balance of the staff on such units may be required to work additional relief and night shifts occasioned by the establishment of the permanent day shifts. Provided that any change in schedules to create additional straight day shift positions will not require nurses with less than ten (10) years of service to rotate to more than a total of fifty percent (50%) reliefs or nights.
(b)	No confirmed work agreement, as provided in Section 4, Salary, (e), specifying the number of hours per payroll period and shift rotation of a currently employed nurse, will be involuntarily changed.
(c)	Eligible full-time nurses in seniority order on the unit will first be offered their shift assignment of choice: thereafter eligible part-time nurse on the unit in seniority order will be offered their shift assignment of choice.
(d)	In order to maintain consistency in implementation and interpretation, the Staffing Advisory Committee (SAC) will review Staffing Advisory Committee policies related to Shift of Choice (SOC) and develop a program to educate staff and directors. The first review and education will occur within six (6) months following implementation of this agreement. Thereafter, the review and education of current as well as new Staffing Advisory Committee policies regarding Shift of Choice will occur periodically as determined by Staffing Advisory Committee,
Each unit will develop and provide a specific plan for development of Shift of Choice nursing positions to Staffing Advisory Committee. On a semi-annual basis, managers will communicate the Shift of Choice availability to unit RNs. Questions regarding the Shift of Choice plan may be forwarded to the unit director or Staffing Advisory Committee.
(e)	The nurse may elect an assignment of days, reliefs, nights or a rotating assignment including days and either reliefs or nights. A nurse may also elect a shift length of choice of greater than or less than eight (8) hours’ duration, exclusive of start and end times. The nurse electing to fill an available flexible work position or an alternate weekend schedule may not require the creation of a new flexible work position or alternate weekend schedule position. Election of a shift of choice, and/or a shift length of choice, may be granted concurrently or separately. Shift designation will be determined by where the majority of hours fall. Rotating shift positions will be decreased but not eliminated.
27
Children'! Minneapolis 2004-200?
(f)	If a permanent shift assignment becomes available because of changes in the schedules of nurses currently employed on a unit which has no open unfilled positions, the available permanent shift assignment will be first offered to nurses on that unit. Otherwise all openings, including those offering permanent shift assignments, will be offered and filled in accordance with Section 16, Schedules and Posting.
(g)	Nurses at the date of this Agreement who have a 7:00 a.m. starting time shall not have such shift time changed without the consent of the nurse.
(h)	A nurse electing a rotating shift of choice shall not be scheduled for more than three (3) starting shift times per four (4) week period. A nurse electing a straight shift of choice shall not be scheduled for more than two (2) starting shift times per four (4) week period. The foregoing provisions shall be modified to the extent necessary if the number of ten (10) year nurses on a unit would mean an inability to cover the required shifts.
(i)	Evening and night Shift of Choice nurses, including those with shift lengths of greater than or less than eight (8) hours’ duration will be afforded the option to work every fourth (4th) weekend if matched with another Shift of Choice nurse, if unmatched, unit management will attempt to accommodate. If one nurse of the match discontinues the schedule, the schedule may be posted for another Shift of Choice match. If Shift of Choice match is not found, then the nurse reverts back to every other week end if management cannot accommodate continuing the schedule.
(j)	When evaluating the ability to offer Shift of Choice to an eligible Shift of Choice nurse, office day FTE’s for Assistant Nurse Managers and Clinical Educators will not be counted in the unit staffing numbers. Instead, the office day FTE’s will be awarded to an eligible Shift of Choice nurse in one of two (2) ways;
(1)	If the Assistant Nurse Manager or Clinical Educator has been granted their Shift of Choice, the office day FTE will be awarded to another eligible Shift of Choice nurse on a temporary basis.
(2)	If the Assistant Nurse Manager or Clinical Educator has not been granted their Shift of Choice, the office day FTE will be awarded to an eligible Shift of Choice nurse.
(k)	Evening and night shift of choice nurses will be the last to be scheduled for Christmas. Evening and night Shift of Choice nurses will never be scheduled more than every other Christmas.
Insofar as practicable, rotating shift assignments will be made equally among the nurses employed on each unit.

31
Children's Minneapolis 2004-1007
•	Sick Time Bank - includes a partial accrual of sick hours (the remaining sick bank hours accrue to the “Flex Time Bank” as outlined above). Guidelines for the Sick Time Bank are the same as outlined in Section 9 (d), Sick Leave.
(a)	Vacations (Flex Time Bank):
(1)	Vacation Accrual: On a prorated basis staff nurses who have completed one (1) full year of continuous service in the Hospital will be granted two (2) calendar weeks' vacation with pay; after completing two (2), three (3) or four (4) full years of continuous service will be granted three (3) calendar weeks’ vacation with pay; and after completing five (5) or more full years of continuous service will be granted four (4) calendar weeks' vacation with pay.

Vacation shall be accrued based on compensated hours as such hours are
.	defined in Section 6, Part-Time Nurses, (g). The accrual rate for full-time and
regularly scheduled part-time nurses shall be determined by dividing the annual number of hours of vacation to which a nurse would be entitled based on the above schedule by 2,080 hours and shall be as follows:

Office days for Assistant Nurse Managers and Clinical Educators will not be included in the numbers of staff granted vacation each day. If two or more nurses on a station unit request concurrent vacation times and staffing for patient care does not allow granting of all requests, and such conflict is not resolved on a mutually agreeable basis between the nurses involved, the vacation shall be given to the nurse making the earlier request for such vacation. In the case of simultaneous requests, the nurse on a station unit having greater length of employment in the Hospital as defined in Section 14, Low Need Days and Layoff, shall be given preference. Where a Hospital utilizes an annual defined vacation signup period, all requests submitted during such period shall be considered as simultaneous requests. Consistent with the foregoing, the Hospital may maintain and reasonably enforce a nondiscrim I natory policy specifying the way in which requests for the same or overlapping periods of vacation time shall be given consideration.
By mutual agreement between the nurse and nurse manager, a nurse may convert accrued flex time hours to pay.
No other qualifications on the scheduling of vacations shall be applied except as set out in this Agreement or as required by unavoidable situations in which granting of requested vacation time would have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service.
Vacation (flex time) may be used as it is accrued. There is no maximum balance.

•	Personal holidays’ credit will be calculated in the following manner: a nurse whose position consists of one (1) shift length shall be credited with hours equal to that shift length for each personal holiday; and a nurse whose position is a combination of shift lengths shall be credited with hours for each personal holiday equal to an average of the confirmed position (e.g. a combination of eight (8) and twelve (12) hours shifts would equal ten (10) hours of credit.)
(c)	Birthday Holiday (Flex Time Bank):
•	Part-Time nurses who are regularly scheduled four (4) hours per pay period to forty-eight (48) hours per pay period, will be provided with three (3) hours of pay per year.

(d)	Sick Leave:
(1)	Sick Time Bank and Maximum Accrual: Nurses will be entitled to sick leave with pay for personal illness, not to exceed the accumulated amount. So long as a nurse has ninety (90) days of accumulated and unused sick leave to her or his credit, she or he will earn and accumulate no further sick leave. If and when any of the accumulated sick leave is used, then the nurse will accumulate sick leave at the rate herein specified until she or he again has reached an accumulated credit of ninety (90) days of accumulated and unused sick leave.
,	Sick leave accrual will be based on the following:
Regularly scheduled nurses averaging 32 hours per pay period or more will be entitled to sick leave with pay for personal illness, not to exceed the
QJ.	Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
accumulated amount. Nurses may choose one (1) of two (2) accrual rates based on her/his selection of short term disability. The following rates apply:
a} If Short Term Disability (STD) is not selected during open enrollment, seven (7) days per year will accumulate to the Flex Time Bank and five (5) days will accumulate to the Sick Time Bank on a prorated basis.
b) If Short Term Disability (STD) is selected during open enrollment, six (6) days per year will accumulate to the Flex Time Bank and two (2) days per year will accumulate to the Sick Time Bank on a prorated basis.
The accrual rates for full-time and regularly scheduled part-time nurses averaging thirty-two (32) hours per pay period or more shall be determined by dividing the annual number of sick hours based on the above schedule by 2,080 hours and shall be as follows:	’
a)	Seven (7) days (56 hours) - .0269 flex hours accrued for each compensated hour.
b)	Five (5) days (40 hours) - .0192 sick hours accrued for each compensated hour.

b)	Nurses with 119 hours or less of accumulated sick leave must use one '	(1) day of their Flex Time Bank before accessing their Sick Time Bank.
Sick Time Bank may continue to be accessed as long as the illness is continuous. A continuous illness is one in which either:
1)	The nurse misses consecutive scheduled days due to the same illness. Once a nurse returns to work, the illness is no longer considered continuous.
2)	Or, the nurse needs to miss single days of work because of a serious health condition which requires therapy/therapies. This type of continuous illness would be considered an intermittent leave of absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act.
(3)	Verification of Illness: The Hospital may request reasonable evidence of illness. General requirements of a physician's certificate for proof of sickness shall not be made, but individual nurses may be required to furnish such
35
Children's Mlcreapolls 2OW-2W7
	certificates, provided that such nurse is given advance notice that the certificate will be required. A nurse shall not be required to explain an illness at the time sick call-in is made. Such explanation may be required at a later time based on a review of a pattern of sick leave use. Sick leave will not be granted for absences from work on the day immediately preceding or following a holiday, weekend or days(s) off when the nurse is not scheduled to work unless reasonable evidence of such illness is presented to the Hospital. No nurse shall be penalized for legitimate use of sick leave, or be subject to discipline based solely on the number of sick leave days used. The preceding sentence shall not prevent the use of counseling relating to sick leave. (4> Sick Leave When Eligible for Long Term Disability: Sick leave shall be paid up to the accumulated amount or until the nurse is eligible to receive long term disability benefits pursuant to Section 24, Insurance Benefits, (b) of this Agreement. A nurse who has unused sick leave available at the time of eligibility for long term disability payments shall retain such sick leave. (5) Sick Leave While Receiving Workers' Compensation: A nurse receiving workers' compensation may elect to use that amount of accumulated sick leave necessary to make up the difference between income received from workers' compensation and from any alternate employment at the Hospital and the regular and current rate of pay for her or his position in the bargaining unit at the commencement of her or his leave.
10.	ADDITIONAL FLEX TIME ACCRUAL (PREVIOUSLY PPTP): Regularly scheduled full-time and part-time nurses with fifteen (15) years through nineteen (19) years of continuous calendar service with the Hospital in the bargaining unit shall accrue additional flex time at the rate of .0115 hours accrued for each compensated hour, excluding off-premise call hours. Regularly scheduled full-time and part-time nurses with twenty (20) years or more of continuous calendar service as defined in this Section, shall accrue additional flex time at the rate of .0192 hours accrued for each compensated hour. As used In this Section, continuous service with the Hospital in the bargaining unit means continuous calendar service including any period of layoff but excluding any period of service in a classification not included in the bargaining unit. Service shall be continuous for nurses who have transferred from another Hospital and credited with seniority earned at the other Hospital pursuant to the Contract provisions or other agreements made at that time. Continuous service for nurses affected by a merger, consolidation, or other restructuring shall be based on the seniority arrangement made or in effect at the time of such event.
■	11.	CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY: The Hospital and the Association are committed to a belief that early recognition and intervention of chemical abuse and dependency are in the best personal and professional interest of the nurse, of the Hospital, and of the public. To this end, chemical dependency shall be treated for all purposes under this Contract as a personal illness. (a) Chemical Dependency Evaluation: If the Hospital has reasonable cause to believe that a nurse is chemically dependent, or the Hospital had documentation of counseling the nurse regarding previous behavior patterns, the Hospital will refer the nurse to the Hospital Employee Assistance Program. The nurse may, in the
36
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
alternative, elect to secure a required evaluation by a professional qualified in chemical dependency of the nurse's choice. A nurse may be placed in a paid leave of absence status for work time lost during a period of investigation, chemical dependency assessment, or in the period during which the results of a drug or alcohol test are pending in instances where it is believed to be in the best interest of patient care for the nurse not to continue in active on-duty status. The foregoing is subject to a maximum of five (5) days of paid leave.
(b)	Drug and/or Alcohol Testing: Any Hospital that elects to engage in drug and/or alcohol testing for registered nurses shall provide sixty (60) days’ notice to the Association and shall provide the Association with copies of (1) Supervisory Guidelines for Drug and Alcohol Testing of Employees in Reasonable Suspicion Cases, (2) Hospital Guidelines for Post-Treatment Program Testing for Alcohol and Drugs, and (3) behavioral observation checklists for use by supervisors. Other relevant information concerning the drug and alcohol testing process will be available to the Association upon request. The policy under which such testing is conducted is that policy which has been agreed upon between the Association and the Hospital and is incorporated into this Agreement as Appendix C. That policy shall not be changed during the term of this Contract except by the express written mutual agreement of the parties.
No drug or alcohol testing will be requested by the Hospital solely based on a pattern of previous workplace behaviors. A request to the nurse to take a drug or alcohol test as part of an assessment may be made only in the event of observable work-related behavior that is documented at the time the request is made. A decision to request a test from a nurse shall be made by two nonbargaining unit Hospital representatives who have received training regarding implementation of the Hospital's Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy, except where only one such person is available. Under normal circumstances, the request for testing will not be attended by Hospital security personnel.
At the time that a request for a drug or alcohol test is made, the Hospital will advise the nurse in writing of her or his rights to the presence of an Association representative, and if the nurse so chooses, will make a prompt, reasonable effort to secure a representative for the nurse, and will document those efforts.
The occurrence of a workplace accident or injury will not be considered reasonable cause fortesting unless the accident, injury, or the circumstances surrounding either, is significant rather than routine.	.
(c)	Treatment: If, following an assessment or evaluation, it is recommended that the nurse receive treatment for chemical dependency, she or he may use the benefits provided by Section 9, Paid Time Off. 13, Leave of Absence, (a), Personal Illness, Injury and Disability, and 24, Insurance Benefits (a) and (b),. At conclusion of the leave, the nurse will be returned to work in a position as provided in Section 13 (a); except that a nurse shall not be returned to a position on a chemical dependency treatment unit until completion of two (2) years of being chemically free. This nurse will be returned to a position of like classification, hours, and pay, and may return to
37
Ch fWren's Mfnneapolfs 2004-2007
the first available position on the chemical dependency treatment unit after the two (2) year period has passed.
(d)	Return to Work: The conditions of the individual nurse's return to work shall be jointly developed by the nurse, Hospital representatives, and unless declined by the nurse, Association representatives. A professional involved in a nurse's treatment program may also participate. An agreement setting forth return to work conditions shall be in writing and shall be retained for protection of the nurse's rights under this Contract. This return to work agreement may include the testing for drugs and alcohol without prior notice for a period of up to a maximum of two years during and following any referral for chemical dependency counseling or treatment.
The Hospital may notify the Minnesota Board of Nursing in instances where the nurse exhibits behaviors suggesting chemical dependency. The Hospital will fully cooperate with any conditions of practice imposed by the Board of Nursing and with requirements for supervision and reporting made by the Board. The Hospital will continue the nurse in leave of absence status during any period in which the nurse's license to practice is under suspension.
(e)	Discipline: A nurse shall not be disciplined solely for being chemically dependent nor will a nurse be disciplined solely for refusing a request for which there is not reasonable cause for requesting the test. A nurse may, however, be subject to discipline for action related to the chemical dependency. Any such discipline shall be for just cause as provided in Section 17, Discipline and Termination of Employment, and shall include consideration of all relevant facts including the relevant facts of the symptoms of chemical dependency. The Hospital will agree to defer any investigatory and disciplinary meetings with the nurse until it is determined, in consultation with the treatment professionals, that the nurse is able to fully participate on her or his own behalf.
(f)	Confidentiality: Any referral and related records and discussions of the Hospital, the Hospital’s Employee Assistance Program (including any agency with whom the Hospital contracts for employee assistance) shall be completely confidential and not disclosed without authorization of the nurse. Throughout all steps of the drug or alcohol testing procedure, the right to confidentiality of the nurse will be maintained. Information provided by the nurse at the time a request for testing is made may not be disclosed except as permitted by law, or used for any purpose other than evaluating the propriety of testing for drugs and alcohol and evaluating the testing results. A specially trained physician utilized by the Hospital to evaluate positive test results, whether employed by the Hospital or an outside source, shall only report to the Hospital the physician's determination whether or not the positive test results are explainable for reasons other than drug or alcohol use and, if requested, the level of drugs or alcohol present in the sample. Information upon which the physician bases this determination shall be available only to the physician and the nurse. By written authorization, the nurse may agree to release the information to a specified Association representative.
(g)	Training for Designated MNA Representatives: The Hospital shall make the training program it provides to "trained supervisors" or "trained resource persons”
38
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
prior to implementation of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy available to MNA designated members, or provide a similar training program to MNA designated members. In either event, the training program shall be made available for up to twenty MNA designated members at each Hospital. The training will be provided on work time and at no cost to the nurse.
The Hospital will advise the Association if subsequent training concerning the Hospital's Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy is provided to its "trained supervisors" or "trained resource persons," and the Association may designate up to twenty (20) members per Hospital who did not receive the prior training to attend. The Association will provide to the Hospital the names of its members who have received training provided by the Hospital and who may be contacted by a registered nurse in conjunction with a request for drug or alcohol testing.
Any controversy arising over the interpretation or application of this provision shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 21, Grievance Procedure.
(h)	Information Requests: The Hospital shall provide to the Association summary information regarding the number of nurses tested, the number of positive tests and the reasons giving rise to the testing. Such information will be provided in such a way to not disclose the identity of the nurses tested. The Hospital will also provide such information with respect to a grievant whose alleged drug or alcohol use or abuse is the subject of a grievance or arbitration proceeding, upon receipt of a written authorization to this effect from the grievant. The Hospital will provide employee information which is relevant and necessary to the Association for the proper performance of its duties as bargaining agent, to the extent such information does not violate the confidentiality and privacy safeguards of applicable laws.
12.	HEALTH PROGRAM:
(a)	Employment and Annual Physical: A physical examination including chest X-ray and Mantoux test, if indicated, will be given a nurse within one (1) week of her or his employment and repeated annually without cost to the nurse. The nurse will be given a report of the examination and a confidential record will be kept by the Hospital.
(b)	Hepatitis B Vaccinations: The Hospital will provide, without cost to the nurse, Hepatitis B vaccine to all nurses desiring such vaccine. Following completion of the vaccination series, the Hospital will, if requested by the nurse, perform a serum antibody titer to verify that immunity has been attained.
In the event a nurse experiences a job-related exposure to Hepatitis B virus (HBV), the Hospital will continue the practice of providing Hepatitis B immune globulin, if appropriate, at no cost to the nurse.
(c)	Paid Time Off After Exposure to Infectious Agents: A nurse who has suffered an exposure in the workplace to an infectious agent, and as a result is not permitted to work during an incubation period or other period of time as determined by the Hospital or other agency, shall be kept whole for loss of salary and benefits including pension and seniority. The nurse will not be required to use her or his sick leave during this period of absence from work.
39
ChiMrecTs MitifieapoHs 2004-2007
(d)	Exposure to Blood or Body Fluids: Following a job-related exposure to blood or body fluids, the Hospital will provide, upon request of and without cost to the affected nurse, screening for AIDS/HIV. Such screening shall be done by a reputable independent laboratory and confidential results shall be provided to the nurse. Results shall not be a part of the nurse's personnel or employee health record.
Results of the HBV and AIDS/HIV testing shall be communicated to the Hospital and shall be maintained by the Hospital in a confidential fashion. .
(e)	Post-Exposure Management: Any policy developed by the Hospital relating to the post-exposure management of blood-borne disease shall be consistent with the following:
(1)	The affected nurse shall be responsible to notify the designated department or personnel as soon after the exposure as is feasible. If consent to test from the patient has not been previously obtained, the Hospital policy shall identify the individual or position of the individual responsible to attempt to obtain consent from the patient who was the source of the exposure. The exposed nurse shall not be required to attempt to obtain the consent.
(2)	If the HIV and/or HBV status of the source patient is not known, consent and testing shall be accomplished as soon as possible.
(3)	Testing of the nurse for HIV and HBV antibodies shall be voluntary except as may be required by law. The confidentiality of the exposed nurse will be maintained at all steps throughout the procedure set forth in the policy. All laboratory work will be obtained, tested, and reported in such a manner that the identity of the exposed nurse is protected to the maximum extent. Test results will be communicated promptly to the exposed nurse, and any result will be communicated privately.
(4)	If the source patient is determined to be HIV and/or HBV positive, refuses to be tested, is high risk, or is unknown, follow-up testing shall be made pursuant to CDC guidelines.
(5)	The policy and any procedure developed for its implementation shall recognize the potential for significant stress associated with the exposure. The affected nurse shall receive the same support and consideration as would be provided to any other patient or client of the Hospital.
(6)	The policy shall provide for presentation of information relating to treatment options available. The nurse will be advised at the time of reporting of the exposure of her or his right to utilize the nurse's personal physician.
13.	LEAVE OF ABSENCE:
(a)	Personal Illness, Injury and Disability: A leave of absence without pay will be granted to nurses for personal illness, injury or disability (including work related illness, injury or disability) for a maximum period of twelve (12) months. The
40
Children’s Minneapolis 2004-2DOI
maximum period of absence includes any time during which paid sick leave is utilized by the nurse. Such leave will be granted as follows:
(1)	For a period of up to three (3) calendar months of the leave after the period of accumulative sick leave has expired, during or at the conclusion of which the nurse will be returned to her or his previous position.
(2)	For the remainder of the leave during or at the conclusion of which the nurse will be returned to her or his previous position if it is open and, if not, to her or his previous classification and scheduled number of hours.
(3)	For an additional period as may be agreed between the Hospital and the nurse.
(4)	Vacation and length of service increments will continue to accrue during the first ninety (90) days of this unpaid personal illness leave, including any portion of the ninety (90) days when a nurse on workers’ compensation is working in an alternate position having fewer hours than the nurse's previous position.
A nurse on a personal illness, injury or disability leave and receiving workers' compensation may agree to accept a temporary alternate position different from the nurse's previous position. Agreement to such alternate position shall not constitute a forfeiture of the nurse’s right to return to her or his previous position or classification as provided in this Section 13 (a).
Except as provided in Section 13 (a) (4), all hours worked by a nurse covered by this Contract in a temporary alternate employment position not otherwise covered by this Contract, shall, nevertheless, be considered compensated hours toward accrual of seniority as provided in Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff. Such hours shall also be credited toward eligibility for and accrual of benefits provided by this Contract. Benefits accrued and provided will be based on the compensated hours of the nurse when working in the alternate employment position.
(b)	Critical Illness or Death in the Immediate Family: A leave of absence without pay will be granted to nurses for critical illness or death in the immediate family (parents, parents-in-law, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, grandparents, grandchildren, husbands, wives, step-parents, step-sons, step-daughters, foster children, foster parents, life partners, and such others as may be agreed upon between the nurse and the Hospital) for the period of up to ninety (90) calendar days.

The Hospital will not permanently fill the nurse’s position during the period of leave of absence.
(c)	Bereavement Leave: A leave of absence of three (3) days without loss of pay will be granted to nurses in case of death in the immediate family (parents, parents-in-law, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, grandparents, grandchildren, husbands, wives, step-parents, step-sons, step-daughters, foster parents, foster children, life partners, and such others as may be agreed upon between the nurse and the Hospital) for the purpose of attending the funeral/memorial or other service as
41
Children’s Minneapolis 2004-1007
appropriate to the culture or religion. If a nurse has been court-appointed as a legal guardian or conservator, and is legally responsible for another individual’s medical or financial decisions, that person will be considered appropriate for invoking this paid bereavement leave language. Such leave shall be the day of the funeral/memorial or other service, the day prior thereto, and the day after, unless different days are agreed to between the nurse and the Hospital. If a question arises concerning the application of this provision, Human Resources will be consulted.
(d)	Matemitv/Paternity: Leave of absence without pay will be granted to nurses for maternity/paternity for a period of up to one (1) calendar year as follows:
(1)	For a period of up to four (4) calendar months of the leave commencing at or after the date of delivery, or an earlier date if requested by the nurse for a nonmedical reason, including the period of accumulated sick leave, during or at the conclusion of which the nurse will be returned to her or his previous position. In the event a nurse is disabled for a period in excess of four (4) calendar months following delivery, the nurse will retain her or his right to her or his previous position for four (4) calendar months, or three (3) calendar months plus accumulated sick leave used by the nurse, whichever is greater.

(4)	Vacation and length of service increments will continue to accrue for the first ninety (90) unpaid calendar days of this maternity/paternity leave.
If a nurse desires to return to the hospital at a date different than the date of return specified at the beginning of the leave, she or he shall notify the Hospital two (2) weeks in advance of the earlier of the specified return date or the desired return date. A nurse who desires to return to a different'position at the conclusion of the leave must make such request at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the leave.
This subparagraph (d) shall be fully applicable in instances of adoption.
(e)	Jury Duty and Subpoenaed Witnesses: A nurse called to serve on a jury, or subpoenaed to serve as a witness in any court on a subject arising out of the nurse's employment at the Hospital, shall be reimbursed for the difference between the amount paid for such service (exclusive of travel pay) and his/her compensation for regularly scheduled work hours necessarily lost because of such service. Regularly
42
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
scheduled work hours necessarily lost because of jury service or serving as a witness will be considered as hours worked except for purposes of computing overtime. If a nurse has four (4) or more consecutive weekdays of jury duty during a week, he/she may be relieved of duty at his/her request for one (1) previously scheduled weekend shift, such shift to be agreed upon between the nurse and the Staffing Office. The nurse may use accrued benefit time for this weekend shift. The nurse will notify the Staffing Office as soon as possible of the need for a weekend shift off.
(f)	Educational Leave of Absence: A nurse who has been employed by the Hospital for a period of two (2) years or more shall be granted an educational leave of absence totaling up to twenty-four (24) months. Any extension of an educational leave of absence shall be at the discretion of the Hospital. In order to qualify for such leave, the nurse must be a full-time student at a college or university, working toward a degree having reasonable relation to professional employment in nursing or enrolled in a nurse-practitioner program.
Upon obtaining such additional degree or completing such practitioner program, and after returning to work at the Hospital granting the educational leave and completing an additional one (1) year of service at such Hospital, the nurse will be given credit for purposes of vacation, length of service and salary increments in an amount equal ' to fifty percent (50%) of the length of the educational leave. Regular credit will be earned by the nurse for time worked before and after her or his educational leave of absence.
(g)	Voluntary Leaves Before Layoff: Before resorting to any layoff procedure, the Hospital will offer the nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request leaves of absence without pay of not more than ninety (90) calendar days. During such leave of absence, vacation and length of service rights shall continue to accrue. The Hospital will not permanently fill the nurse's position during the period of leave of absence.
(h)	Military Leave of Absence: A nurse who is a member of the military reserve or National Guard shall be granted leaves of absence without pay to enable the nurse to fulfill obligations for one weekend per month plus two weeks per calendar year for temporary military duty. The nurse will be credited with hours towards benefits, including seniority and pension, and length of service salary increments, for this one weekend per month plus two weeks per calendar year of temporary military duty. Earnings lost will be credited toward W2 earnings for pension purposes in accordance with the terms of the Pension Plan. The nurse may be offered the opportunity to, but may not be required to, work extra unscheduled weekend shifts in place of normally scheduled weekend shifts missed because of military duty. A nurse electing to do so will be entitled to the weekend bonus.
In addition, a nurse who serves on active duty and who returns to work within ninety (90) days after discharge from military service will be returned to her or his previous position or to the position of like classification and pay to which the nurse would have been entitled but for the absence due to military duty. The nurse will be credited with hours towards benefits, including seniority and pension, and length of service salary increments for the period of active duty (including the ninety (90) days post discharge) based on the authorized number of hours per payroll period, or the
43
Children’s Minneapolis 2004-2 007
average number of hours worked per payroll period during the thirteen (13} payroll periods preceding the active duty, whichever is greater. Earnings lost will be credited toward W2 earnings for pension purposes in accordance with the terms of the Pension Plan.
(i)	Other Leaves of Absence: Leaves of absence for reasons other than above will be granted to nurses at the discretion of the Hospital and on an individual basis. Such leaves without pay may be granted for a period of up to one (1) calendar year as follows:
(1)	For a period of up to four (4) calendar months of the leave, the nurse will be returned to her/his previous position.
(2)	For a period of an additional four (4) calendar months, the nurse will be returned to her/his previous position if it is open, or, if not, to her/his previous classification and scheduled number of hours.
(3)	For a period of an additional four (4) calendar months, the Hospital may permanently fill the nurse’s position. Upon returning from the leave, the nurse will be given the first opportunity to return to a position and classification for which she/he is qualified, and will be given an opportunity to return to her/his former position if and when the position is open.
Length of service benefits will continue to accrue for leaves of absence of fourteen (14) calendar days or less. For leaves of absence of more than fourteen (14) calendar days, length of service benefits will not continue to accrue, but will remain the same as at the time of beginning the leave.
(j)	Association Activities: Leaves of absence without pay of reasonable duration shall be provided nurses for the purpose of attending meetings, conferences and conventions of the Association on a local, district, state or national level. The number of nurses attending such functions shall not exceed a reasonable number at any one time and the granting of such leaves shall be predicated on the Hospital's staffing requirements. For the purpose of attending the Minnesota Nurses Association convention, delegates, and alternate delegates, to this convention will be given priority in the granting of flex time requests. For the purpose of attending the American Nurses Association convention, delegates, as well as alternate delegates whose status is upgraded to delegate, will be considered separately from the vacation requests.
In addition, nurses elected to serve as a regular or alternate member of the nurses' Negotiating Committee for the Employment or Pension Contract shall be given credit toward eligibility for and accumulation of benefits for all hours spent serving in this capacity.
Nurses serving on MNA committees will notify schedulers of all meetings dates/times as soon as such meetings are scheduled.

44
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
have been made. If accommodations have not been made, the nurse shall notify the scheduler.
14.	LOW NEED DAYS AND LAYOFF:
Reduction of registered nurse staff may be made only in the event of a diminished number of needed nursing care hours. Unanticipated declines in patient needs may result in the need to temporarily reduce hours, but it is recognized by the parties that the basic policy shall be to use the layoff procedures of this Contract to accomplish staff reductions when a reduction in patient needs is reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time. Nonbargaining unit personnel shall not be utilized to replace any bargaining unit nurse whose hours are so reduced.
(a)	Definitions: As used in this Section 14, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
(1)	"Clinical Group" means a unit or group of units which require similar nursing skills.
(2)	"Qualified" means the ability to independently provide safe, direct patient care for the standard case load on the unit within a reasonable period of orientation not to exceed four (4) weeks; but said term does not require proficiency in all technical skills or the performance of leadership roles.
(3)	"Seniority" means the total compensated hours accrued by a nurse since her or his most recent date of employment into the bargaining unit at the Hospital. Compensated hours, as qualified in this paragraph, shall include all hours for which a nurse is paid. Each overtime hour worked shall be counted as one (1) compensated hour. Off-premises on-call shall be counted at the conclusion of each W2 year at the rate of one-fourth (1/4) of the on-call hours paid. In addition, compensated hours shall include hours which Section 13, Leave of Absence, subparagraphs (a), (d), (g), (h) and (i) provide are hours worked or hours for which length of service increments accrue.
The above notwithstanding, seniority for a nurse who transfers to a non-supervisory and non-managerial nursing position that is not covered by the Contract Agreement and is in the same hospital in which the nurse is employed in a bargaining unit position, shall accrue no further seniority. The nurse’s accrued seniority shall be maintained on the nurse’s record and shall be restored to the nurse if she or he transfers back to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year. The nurse may not exercise frozen seniority for any purpose under this Contract while in the non-bargaining unit position. If the nurse does not return to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year from the date of the transfer out of the bargaining unit, all bargaining unit seniority is lost.
A revised and up-to-date listing of the seniority for each nurse in the bargaining unit will be posted by the Hospital each six (6) months and provided to the Minnesota Nurses Association.
45
Children') Minneapolis 2004-2007
(b)	Voluntary Low Need Davs and Leave: Before resorting to Part (d) of this Section or any layoff procedure, the Hospital will offer the full-time and part-time nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request a low need leave of absence without pay for up to ninety (90) calendar days. The Hospital will not permanently fill the nurses' position. In addition, the Hospital may, on a day-to-day basis offer individual low need days to full-time and part-time nurses. A nurse taking low need days pursuant to Parts (b) and (d) of this Section shall be given credit toward all benefits provided by this Contract and the Pension Plan for the hours lost.
Whe"n a clinic is closed on a normal business day, the nurse(s) will choose from the following options:
1.	Taking a voluntary low need day (HRLOA)
2.	Performing RN work within the clinic if agreed upon by the manager
3.	Taking flex time
(c)	Floating in Lieu of Mandatory Low Need Days: If additional low need reductions are needed, nurses will be given the opportunity to float to available assignments in other units for which they are oriented or otherwise qualified. Nurses with greater than or equal to 41,600 hours of seniority will not be required to float.
(d)	Mandatory Low Need Davs: If additional reductions are indicated, low need days shall be taken by the least senior regularly scheduled part-time nurse scheduled for the particular unit and shift where the reduction is necessary.
No regularly scheduled part-time nurse shall be required by the Hospital to take more than three (3) low need days per year, with the year defined as November 1 through October 31. If the least senior part-time nurse on a particular unit and shift has been assigned three (3) low need days, the next least senior part-time nurse scheduled for the particular unit and shift may be assigned the low need day. In any case, the total of low need days under Part (d) of this provision shall not exceed three (3) per year for any regularly scheduled part-time nurse.
A part-time nurse with a confirmed work agreement of .75 FTE or more shall be considered as a full-time nurse for purposes of this Section and shall not be assigned low need days. Nurses with 41,600 or more hours of seniority will not be subject to mandatory low need days.
A nurse to be assigned a low need day pursuant to this Part (d) shall be given a minimum of two (2) hours advance notice before the beginning of the shift.
A nurse who receives a mandatory low need day on a holiday will have the choice of the following options:
1.	She/He may request and be granted flex time on an additional non-holiday weekend during the year. This request shall be granted separately from the vacation requests for that particular weekend.
2.	She/He may have that holiday count as two holidays for the purposes of being scheduled holidays for that year.
46
Children's Minneapolis 20M-2007
Casual or temporary nurses shall not be assigned to work on units for which the nurse receiving low need days is oriented or otherwise qualified. Part-time nurses having hours reduced shall be given first opportunity for subsequent additional work hours that may become available to replace work hours lost.
(e)	Layoff: In the event that it is necessary to lay off nurses due to lack of work, the least senior nurse(s) in the employ of the Hospital shall be laid off first. The layoff shall continue in order of least seniority toward most seniority until the needed reduction in nursing care hours has been accomplished. Any reduction in the number of scheduled hours shall be considered a layoff except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (d) above. It is specifically agreed that less senior nurses are to be completely laid off before more senior nurses are to be affected by a layoff except as expressly provided as follows:	.
(1)	It is agreed that the operation of this Section 14 shall not have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service. A nurse may be retained out of seniority, however, only if nurses with greater seniority do not have the ability to become qualified.
(2)	A reduction of hours rather than a complete layoff may be used if necessary to provide appropriate coverage for weekends or for operating rooms, visits or procedures. Reductions shall be made by reducing the hours of the least senior nurse remaining on the unit to thirty-two (32) hours per pay period and proceeding in that manner in reverse order of seniority until the necessary reduction has been achieved. Reductions in reverse order of seniority to less than thirty-two (32) hours may be made at the discretion of the Hospital.
Before effecting a reduction of nursing care hours on any unit, all nurses shall be offered voluntary leaves of absence as provided in Section 13, Leave of Absence, (g) of this Agreement. In effecting a reduction of nursing care hours on one or more units, the Hospital shall use a system whereby all affected nurses in order of greater seniority shall be offered all of the following choices:
(11) Vacant positions for which they are qualified.
(22)	Qualified nurses will be offered an opportunity in order of seniority to replace less senior nurses within the clinical group.
(33)	Qualified nurses will be offered an opportunity in order of seniority to replace less senior nurses in other clinical groups.
(44)	Nurses may accept complete layoff and retain full rights to recall.
A nurse displaced by a more senior nurse under (22) and (33) above would then, In seniority order, be offered option (11) through (44).
In exercising seniority rights under steps (11), ( 22), and (33) the nurse will be offered a position for which qualified according to the step selected, such position to be
47
Children'! Minneapolis 20M-2007
determined on the basis of the nurse's position preference, greater seniority and the need to minimize multiple displacement of nurses.
Concurrently with the offering of steps (11) through (44), nurses shall be offered the option of accepting reduced hours in their unit. A nurse accepting such reduction shall be considered on layoff and retain all recall rights. Before or at the time a nurse is offered vacancies or replacement opportunities, the nurse will be provided a description of available positions which includes the unit assignment, shifts and number of scheduled hours.
As long as any nurse remains on layoff, the Hospital shall not newly employ nurses into the bargaining unit and shall not transfer or temporarily assign nonbargaining unit nurses into the bargaining unit until all nurses holding recall rights who are qualified shall have been recalled. After a full or partial recall of all qualified nurses on complete layoff who retain recall rights, this provision shall not prevent the new hire of nurses needed to provide appropriate coverage for weekends or for operating rooms, visits or procedures. Such newly hired nurse shall be limited to not more than thirty-two (32) scheduled hours per pay period as long as any more senior nurses on the unit have not been fully restored to her or his number of scheduled hours before layoff.
Scheduled hours on a unit shall not be increased for non laid off nurses without offering such hours to nurses from that unit who are on partial layoff. If a nurse from a unit has been completely laid off, scheduled hours of thirty-two (32) or more per two-week pay period shall not be added for non laid off nurses until nurses on complete layoff have been recalled.
Nurses on layoff who are presently qualified, shall be given first opportunity to work intermittent shifts that are available, before such shifts are offered to casual or nonbargaining unit nurses. To the greatest extent feasible, such shifts shall be offered to nurses on layoff in order of seniority up to but not exceeding the number of scheduled hours per pay period before layoff. Intermittent shifts reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time shall not be used in lieu of recall of nurses who retain recall rights.. An offer for intermittent shifts shall not be considered a recall.
When floating is needed, the Hospital will endeavor to take into consideration a nurse's interest in becoming qualified in another unit of the Hospital.
As part of on-going communication between the Association and the Hospital, the Hospital will notify the Association as soon as it determines that a layoff may occur. The parties will meet to review relevant data and to jointly develop the procedures for applying this Section 14 (e) to the specific situation.
A nurse and the Association will be given two (2) weeks' written notice in advance of any layoff.
Involuntary transfers of nurses shall not be used to circumvent the layoff provisions of this Section 14.
48
Children’s Minneapolis 2004-2007
A nurse who is laid off shall have the right at the time of layoff to receive appropriate prorated vacation with pay upon written request to the Hospital therefore.
A nurse on layoff status who has been benefit eligible and has worked an average of .4 FTE for the first four pay periods following layoff, shall continue on a benefit eligible status so long as she or he continues to work an average of at least ,4 FTE per four pay periods either through intermittent shifts or because of recall. In the event that the nurse refuses a recall to a regularly scheduled benefit eligible position for which she or he is qualified, the nurse shall lose the benefit eligible status. Exceptions to the loss of benefit eligible status may be made in cases of extenuating circumstances.
In the event of a pending layoff or major restructuring, in addition to other contractual options, each senior nurse in affected or related clinical areas will be given the option of early retirement with the employer portion of health insurance (single coverage) continued until attainment of age 65. For purposes of this paragraph, senior nurses are defined as nurses (.7 or above FTE) at age 58 or above who have attained the monthly salary increment for twenty (20) years employment.
(f)	Recall: Notice of recall shall be in writing to a nurse, with simultaneous copy mailed to Minnesota Nurses Association. Recalls shall be in order of seniority with the most senior nurse in layoff status recalled first. Recall shall continue in order of most seniority to least seniority until all nurses have been fully restored to their number of scheduled hours before layoff. A nurse shall be allowed up to one (1) week to report to work after receipt of a notice of recall. A nurse who has been recalled or offered a position different than the position from which the nurse was laid off may accept or reject such different position without loss of recall rights under this Contract Agreement. A different position means either a different unit or shift or number of scheduled hours. A nurse recalled to the same position who declines the offer of recall shall lose all seniority rights.
A nurse unable to respond to notice of recall to the same position due to a reason justifying a leave of absence, shall be transferred to appropriate leave of absence status.	'
Seniority shall be lost if the nurse is not recalled from layoff within one (1) year. Provided, however, a nurse may have seniority rights extended for an additional period of one (1) year by giving written notice to the Hospital within thirty (30) days before the expiration of the first year of layoff.
15.	JOB PROTECTION, MERGERS AND REDUCTION OF BEDS:
Determinations or actions by a hospital or by a government, community or hospital's agency or agencies which recommend or require the elimination or reduction of patients’ beds or facilities presently in operation are determinations made and actions taken with the stated intention of serving the welfare of the community. Determinations or actions by a Hospital include actions by parent or affiliates or entities which have the power to effectively direct such determinations or actions in a contracting Hospital. Consequently, it is the policy of the Hospital and Minnesota Nurses Association that determinations made and actions taken to
49
Children's Minneapolis 2004-1007
serve the community and patients should not be at the expense of individual registered nurses employed at an affected institution. In the event that such determinations or actions including corporate merger, consolidation, or reorganization of services, directly or indirectly will cause an elimination or a reduction in the number of registered nurses in present, or if greater in future bargaining unit positions in any classification on a station unit, the following principles shall apply:
(a)	Notice of Merger, Consolidation or Reorganization: The Hospital shall give the Association written notice of such action or determination immediately upon any notice to the Hospital whether said notice is preliminary, tentative or final. The Hospital will also give the Association immediate written notice of any decision to authorize a corporate merger, consolidation or reorganization of services involving the Hospital. In these connections, the Hospital will cooperate in providing the Association with relevant background information and alternative courses of action available. The individual nurses who will be affected shall receive written notice with a copy to Minnesota Nurses Association as soon as the action to be taken is ascertained.
(b)	Offer of Reassignment within the Hospital: Nurses from an affected area which is being reduced or eliminated shall be offered reassignment, along with other affected nurses, to other vacant or new registered nurse positions in the same classification (an "opening”) within the Hospital for which they are reasonably qualified. The term "reasonably qualified" means the ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period of orientation and in-house training not to exceed four (4) weeks. Such orientation and training shall be at no cost to the nurse. Reduction of nurses on an affected area and the offering of reassignment in the Hospital shall be made on the basis of seniority in the Hospital as defined in Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff, of the Agreement.
The Hospital will not promote or employ new nurses or use casual or temporary nurses until all affected nurses have been placed or given the opportunity to qualify for registered nurse openings which are available or become available in their respective classifications. A nurse may voluntarily choose to exercise her or his length of employment rights for an opening in a lower registered nurse classification.
(c)	Reductions to Follow Layoff Procedure: If there are not sufficient registered nurse openings to place all nurses employed at the time of the change, or if nurses are not able to qualify for such positions, as the same are described in the foregoing paragraphs, the reduction of registered nurse positions in the Hospital shall be made according to the procedure of layoff and recall established by Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff.
(d)	Offer of Employment in Hospitals Controlled by the Same Corporation: If a nurse cannot be offered placement under paragraph (b) and (c) above, offers for employment shall concurrently be made by Contracting Hospitals controlled by the same corporate body as the Hospital which employed the nurse who was laid off or who received notice of layoff. Offers of employment under this paragraph (d) shall be made during the period that the nurse retains recall rights under Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff.
50
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
Any offer of employment under this paragraph (d) shall be treated for all purposes, including seniority, as a transfer within the same Hospital and not a re-employment.
(e)	Offer of Employment in Other Contracting Hospitals: If there are not sufficient openings in Contracting Hospitals controlled by the same corporate body, an affected nurse will concurrently be offered employment in the bargaining unit at any other Contracting Hospital which has openings for which the nurse is reasonably qualified during the period in which the nurse retains recall rights under Section 14, Low Need Davs and Layoff. Employment of a nurse under the provisions of this paragraph (e) shall be with full credit for all length of service credited by the former Hospital employer for purposes of salary, educational increments and vacation eligibility.
The Hospital having the reduction of beds or services shall use its best efforts to assist displaced nurses in finding suitable registered nurse positions with other hospitals or health care facilities. Such efforts shall include continuing investigation of potential job openings and communication with other facilities as to availability, training and experience of affected nurses and advising nurses of such information received.
(f)	Negotiation on Application of this Section 15: The parties recognize that the provisions of this Agreement may not fully anticipate the nature of such changes as they are occurring or may occur in the future. It is agreed, therefore, that for any action for which notice may be required under the foregoing paragraph (a), Minnesota Nurses Association and the affected Hospital(s) will meet for negotiation and mediation of the application of this Section 15 and relevant Contract provisions to the then instant situation.
Any unresolved dispute arising from such negotiations and mediation will be determined in accordance with the arbitration procedure set forth in Section 21, Grievance Procedure, of this Contract Agreement.
a
(g)	Removal from Bargaining Unit: No action by a Hospital(s) or an affiliated entity shall result in a unit, service or group of nurses being removed from the bargaining unit earlier than thirty (30) days after Minnesota Nurses Association and the nurses to be affected have been provided written notice of the action and any change tn Contract coverage the Hospital(s) or affiliated entity will effect. The Hospital(s) will cooperate in providing the Association with relevant background information.
(h)	The provisions of this Section shall in no way limit, circumscribe, modify, or reduce rights or benefits of a nurse under other sections of this Contract Agreement.
(i)	At the time of major work place changes, the Hospital will extend to a nurse, who is within one (1) year of anticipated retirement, accommodations to allow the nurse to continue her or his same or similar work until retirement.
51
Children’s Minneapolis 2004-2007
16.
SCHEDULES AND POSTING:
(a)	Posting of Work Schedules: Time schedules shall be posted fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the nurse's scheduled work. The posted schedule of hours shall not be changed without consent of the affected nurse(s).
(b)	Requested Additional Hours: A regularly scheduled part-time nurse desiring more work hours may request such additional hours prior to posting of each time schedule. Regularly scheduled part-time nurses so requesting shall be scheduled for available non-overtime shifts before such shifts are offered to casual nurses. For nurses working less than sixty-four (64) hours per payroll period, the extra shift(s) shall, with four (4) hours’ notice to the nurse, be cancelled prior to the implementation of Section 14, Low Need Days and Layoff, (d) but such cancelled shift shall be counted as one of the three (3) allowable low need days.
(c)	Posting and Filling of Positions: If a nursing position is or will be open, the Hospital will post on the bulletin board a notice for a period of at least five (5) days before permanently filling the position. Said notice shall include a listing of the station unit, the number of shifts per payroll period, the shift rotation, the required qualifications for the position and the person to whom to apply.
In filling any such bargaining unit position, other than an Assistant Nurse Manager and/or Clinical Educator position, the primary consideration shall be whether the applicant meets the required qualifications to perform the duties of the open position. The transfer of a nurse to the position for which the nurse has been accepted may be postponed for a period not to exceed three (3) months if it is necessary to provide the proper skill level on the unit from which the nurse will be transferring. Subject to the foregoing, nurses meeting the required qualifications shall be given preference over nurses not currently employed by the Hospital, and as between nurses employed by the Hospital, preference shall first be given to the most senior regularly scheduled nurse within the bargaining unit. Preference shall then be given in seniority order to any casual nurse who has worked greater than four hundred sixteen (416) hours as a casual nurse in the previous calendar year. To quality for this benefit, a casual nurse needs to have been in the casual status for a minimum of one (1) full calendar year. Should there be no nurses in the previous two categories, preference shall then be given in seniority order to casual nurses who have worked less than four hundred sixteen (416) hours in the previous calendar year. Should there be no nurses in this last category, preference shall then be given in seniority order to perdiem nurses.
A nurse will be limited to two (2) transfers to two (2) different units in two (2) years, unless the nurse and the manager mutually agree to a different timeframe. Any transfer to a newly-opened unit will not be subject to the foregoing limitation.
The Association will have input into the qualifications for any Assistant Nurse Manager and any Clinical Educator positions, before such positions are posted. In filling any Assistant Nurse Manager and/or Clinical Educator position, the primary consideration shall be the qualifications to perform the duties of the position. When the qualifications of two (2) or more nurses are equal, preference shall be given to a nurse employed by the Hospital over nurses not currently employed, and as between
52
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
nurses employed by the Hospital, preference shall be given to the nurse most senior within the bargaining unit.
17.	DISCIPLINE AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT:
No nurse shall be disciplined except for just cause. Except in cases where immediate termination is appropriate, the Hospital will utilize a system of progressive discipline. A nurse's participation in the Economic and General Welfare Program or eligibility for longevity benefits will not constitute just cause for discharge or other discrimination.
If an Oral Warning is given, it shall be confirmed in writing, identified as disciplinary action, and a copy shall be given to the nurse. A copy of any Written Warning shall be given to the nurse and the Hospital shall simultaneously send a copy to the Minnesota Nurses Association. Whether or not a Warning is grieved, a nurse has the right to make a written response which will be maintained by the Hospital with any copy of the Warning.
No Assistant Nurse Manager will be directed by the Hospital to do investigations or disciplinary actions.
A nurse participating in an Investigatory meeting that reasonably could lead to disciplinary action shall be advised in advance of such meeting of its purpose. The nurse shall have the right to request and be granted Minnesota Nurses Association representation during such meeting. At any meeting where discipline is to be issued, the Hospital will advise the nurse of the right to have Minnesota Nurses Association representation at such meeting.
Upon request of the nurse or the Association, all written documents relating to any oral or written disciplinary warning will be removed from the nurse’s personnel file at any time after three (3) years from the date of the most recent incident providing no further warnings or other disciplinary action have been given in the intervening period. Warnings and other documents may be removed sooner by mutual agreement between the Hospital and the Association. In no case will a warning which would, if requested, be removed from the nurse’s file be considered in future discipline or in arbitration proceedings.
Demotion from the classification of Assistant Nurse Manager to a lower classification for disciplinary reasons, or on the basis of the nurse's performance, shall be for just cause.
The Hospital will give a nurse two (2) weeks' written notice (exclusive of terminal leave) prior to termination of employment or suspension unless said termination or suspension is for misconduct. The previous sentence notwithstanding, during the first one hundred (100) days of a nurse’s employment by the Hospital, the point in a progressive disciplinary process where such nurse is notified in writing of performance issues constitutes the written notice for a possible suspension should this progressive disciplinary process continue. Such written notice must occur at least two (2) weeks prior to the suspension, and any suspension given during this progressive disciplinary process would be for a period of one -	(1) paid day. Minnesota Nurses Association will be given written notice of any termination
or suspension at the same time the affected nurse is given written notice.
The nurse will give the Hospital two (2) weeks’ written notice for termination of her or his employment in any event, and a nurse claiming terminal leave will give one month’s notice as provided in Section 9, Time Off Plan.	.
53
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
18.	PROMOTIONS, TRANSFERS AND NEW POSITIONS:
(a)	Notice of Promotion or Transfer: The Hospital will give a nurse and Minnesota Nurses Association two (2) weeks' written advance notice of any promotion or transfer out of the bargaining unit. Said written advance notice shall indicate specification of the position from which and to which the nurse will be promoted or transferred. Upon request, the Hospital will promptly provide the Association with the written position description for either such position.
(b)	New Non-Executive Position: The Hospital shall give the Association written notice of the establishment of any new non-executive position requiring a registered nurse. Said written notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the position description, whether such description be preliminary or final, and shall be mailed to the Association fourteen (14) days before such position is posted. Said notice will include the Hospital’s initial determination as to whether such position will be included in the bargaining unit.
Upon request of either party, the Hospital and Association representatives will meet to discuss and consider the bargaining unit status of the position in question. Considerations will include, but not be limited to, the relationship of the position to existing bargaining and nonbargaining unit positions and the workability of including the position in the bargaining unit including, but not limited to, compensation, work schedules, and seniority. The Hospital and the Association may make such mutual agreements as they deem appropriate which involve terms and conditions of employment related to identified barriers. In arriving at any agreement which would constitute an exception to the then existing seniority provisions of the Contract Agreement, Minnesota Nurses Association shall establish a process for consultation with the Association leadership of the local facility nurses, and any recommendation by Minnesota Nurses Association after such consultation will be given due consideration by the Hospital in attempting to arrive at an agreement on the seniority matters.
The Hospital agrees to provide the Association with any additional relevant available information.
If the parties are unable to agree on including or not including the new position in the Contract, either party may request the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in any attempt to resolve the issue. If no agreement is reached as a result of the assistance of FMCS, the unit clarification procedure of the National Labor Relations Board may be used by either party.
(c)	Notice of New Program or Business Venture: The Hospital, or its parent or affiliate, shall give the Association prompt written notice of any new program or business venture as soon as a decision to initiate the program or venture is made,, Such notice shall describe the anticipated registered nurse positions in the new program or venture, and the Hospital’s initial determination as to whether such positions will be included in the bargaining unit.
54
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
The Hospital, its parent or affiliate, will meet upon request with the Association to explore questions of Association representation. The procedure set forth in the foregoing subsection (b) of this Section 18 will be used to process such questions.
(d)	Inclusion of Other Nurses in Bargaining Unit: The Hospital will meet with the Association upon request to determine the interest associated with including certain groups of nurses in the bargaining unit. If mutual interests exist, the parties will meet at the local level to apply the process described in the foregoing subsection (b) of this Section 18.
(e)	Transfers between Contract and Non-Contract Positions: When a nurse transfers between Contract and Non-Contract positions at Children's Hospitals and Clinics, any benefit accruals she/he has at the time of transfer are transferred with the nurse into the new position. The benefit accruals must be calculated to fit into whatever system the nurse is transferring, e.g. PTO versus flex time/sick leave.
If a nurse transfers from a Non-Contract position at Children's Hospitals and Clinics into a Contract position, she/he will accrue flex time based on her/his years of service at Children's Hospitals and Clinics. For purposes of Additional Flex Time Accrual (previously PPTO), however, she/he must be in a bargaining unit position for the required number of years (fifteen (15) or twenty (20)) to achieve this benefit.
If a nurse has previously approved vacation time, this time off will be honored upon transfer between positions.
For purposes of a nurse’s date of hire, including eligibility for the longevity bonus in the Contracts, the date of hire remains the same.
Nurses transferring into Contract from Non-Contract positions do not bring any bargaining unit seniority with them, unless they have maintained casual status in the Contract while working in the Non-Contract position.
If a nurse has severed employment with Children's Hospitals and Clinics, and then returns to a Contract position, she/he brings no previous date of hire or seniority with her/him into the bargaining unit.
19.	COMMITTEES:
The Hospital and the Association agree that there are mutual interests which need to be addressed in a timely fashion in order to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. The Association, through its members, is recognized as instrumental to the success of the Hospital and as the communication link to and from those members. The Association recognizes that the success of the Hospital is necessary in order to improve organizational effectiveness, enhance Job satisfaction and provide job security.
When the Hospital and the Association determine that a task force or committee needs to be established to address an issue, the estimated number of meetings to be held, length of meeting time, days of the week/time of day the meetings will be held, and task force or committee’s level of authority will be identified prior to the Association's selection of nurses
55
Children'* MEnneapnlii 20(M-2007
to serve on the task force or committee. Unit Association representative(s) will work in collaboration with the manager to select the nurses. Selection of nurses to serve on Contract Committees as identified below will be governed by Association Local Unit Rules.
Structured dialogue between the manager, unit Association representative(s) and Association chairperson, to discuss unit activities and implications for nursing practice, will occur at least quarterly. A regular review of the ability for nurses on the unit to take their breaks will be included in this dialogue.
(a)	LABOR MANAGEMENT GROUP (LMG):
In an effort to encourage and support the collective bargaining process, build trust and understanding and manage mutual interests and interactions, the Hospital and Association agree to establish a Labor Management Group (hereinafter referred to as the LMG). Its purpose will be to provide a maximum exchange of information, increased communication throughout all levels of the Hospital and to increase employee understanding of and input into decisions that affect them and their jobs.
The Hospital and the Association will agree upon the total number of members which shall constitute the LMG. It will meet regularly as determined by the Committee. Nurses selected to serve on this Committee will be paid for meeting time spent in serving on this Committee.
Issues brought to LMG may include but not be limited to:
(1)	Any issue that could potentially involve disciplinary action toward nurses, i.e. required education, required attire, performance issues, sick time, working the work agreement
(2)	Any change/perceived change in contract benefits
(3)	Any issue involving layoff or recall
(4)	Flex up or flex down plan for changes in census
(5)	Issues of job security
(6)	Issues mandated by the Contract to be discussed by LMG i.e. issues at the unit level that are not resolved by staff and managers (nurses wanting to decrease FTE)
The LMG may work with these issues directly or establish short-term or long-term subcommittees to address them.
(b)	SYSTEM LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (SLMC):
The charge for the System Labor Management Committee (SLMC) will be to address issues related to working with two (2) Contracts, as well as differing past practices, within the same hospital system.
The Hospital and the Association will agree on the total number of members which shall constitute the SLMC. it will meet regularly as determined by the Committee. Nurses selected to serve on this Committee will be paid for meeting time spent in serving on this Committee.
Issues to be addressed by the Committee could include, but are not limited to, mandatory subjects of bargaining. The Committee will develop a plan to deal with these issues, including a timeline for discussion and implementation of any decisions. The Committee will
56
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
develop guidelines for securing ratification and/or endorsement from bargaining unit nurses, as well as endorsement from Administration on actions.
The Committee will evaluate its work compared to other collaborative committees currently in existence, in order to avoid duplication of work by these other groups.
(c)	STAFFING ADVISORY COMMITTEE (SAC):
(1)	Philosophy—Staffing and Scheduling Practices: The Hospital and the Association are committed toward collaboratively addressing issues surrounding staffing and scheduling practices at the Hospital. While patient care needs drive staffing and scheduling practices, the Hospital and the Association will continually strive to balance the needs and interests of bargaining unit nurses with the broad interests of Children’s Health Care as an organization.
Staffing and scheduling practices will be thoroughly evaluated, including their origins as well as impact within the current environment. While the goal will be to adopt staffing and scheduling practices which are consistently applied throughout the Hospital, the effects of any changes in such practices will be considered on an Individual unit basis.
(2)	Staffing Advisory Committee: The Staffing Advisory Committee (SAC) will be the committee designated to address staffing/scheduling issues and past practices on an ongoing basis. This committee will have authority to make decisions relative to these issues, within parameters of the Contract.
The Hospital and the Association will agree upon foe total number of members which shall constitute the SAC. It will meet regularly as determined by the Committee. Nurses selected to serve on this Committee will be paid for meeting time spent in serving on this Committee.
(d)	NURSING CARE DELIVERY:
(1)	. Nursing Practice:
Management will recognize the ethical obligations inherent in the nurse/patient relationship and the accountability and authority of the registered nurse related to her or his individual practice. No disciplinary action shall be taken against a nurse for following the “Authority to Intervene to Restore Patient Safety - Stop the Line" policy.
Only a registered nurse will assess, plan, and evaluate a patient’s or client's nursing care needs.
The charge nurse, in collaboration with the nurse manager and/or supervisor, will decide the unit's ability to take admissions, considering census and acuity.
No nurse shall be required or directed to delegate nursing activities to other personnel in a manner inconsistent with the Minnesota Nurse Practice Act, the standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the ANA Standards of Practice, or Hospital policy. Consistent with the preceding sentence, foe individual registered nurse has the autonomy to delegate (or not delegate) those aspects of nursing care the nurse determines appropriate based on her or his assessment.
When a nurse floats, a reasonable attempt will be made to assign foe nurse to an assignment that meets the patient’s nursing care needs and is similar to the nurse’s clinical
57
Children's Minneapolis 20W-Z007
area of expertise. However, if a nurse is floated to a unit or area where the nurse receives an assignment that she or he feels she or he cannot safely perform independently, the nurse has the right and obligation to request and receive a modified assignment, which reflects the nurse’s level of competence.
The Association and the Hospitals recognize that changes in the health care delivery system have and will continue to occur, while recognizing the common goal of providing safe, quality patient care. The parties also recognize that registered nurses have a right and responsibility to participate in decisions affecting delivery of nursing care and related terms and conditions of employment. Both parties have a mutual interest in developing delivery systems which will provide quality care on a cost efficient basis which recognizes the accountability of the registered nurse in accordance with the Minnesota Nurse Practice Act and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations,
(2)	Nursing Care Delivery Committee: There shall be established in each Hospital a joint committee of labor and management representatives. The Hospital and the Association will agree upon the total number of members which shall constitute this Committee. There shall be co-chaIrs--one designated by the Association and one by the Hospital. The senior nursing executive shall be one of the Hospital representatives. The Minnesota Nurses Association chairperson of the bargaining unit shall be one of the Association representatives. Association representatives selected by the bargaining unit to serve on this Committee will be paid for meeting time spent in serving on this Committee.
This Committee shall meet on a regular basis to consider issues of mutual interest to the Hospital and the Association as may be agreed upon by the parties. The Committee may appoint a task force as it deems appropriate. Such task force shall include staff nurses with knowledge and expertise in a particular subject being considered. The Committee may also refer issues for consideration to existing Hospital committees. Minutes of meetings of the Committee, minutes of any task force established by the Committee, and minutes of internal Hospital committees, including committees at department levels or unit levels, that relate to the type of changes referred to in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) below, shall be routinely shared with all members of the Committee. The Committee will have two areas of focus:
(a) Authority of Committee: The Committee, through use of a joint decision-making process, has the authority and accountability to specify the role implementation of the registered nurse in the patient care delivery system of the organization and the application of the nursing process in that delivery of patient care.
The scope of the Committee’s work in this area may include, but not be limited to, the development of a data set to understand patient outcomes related to nursing care. In addition, the Committee will consider utilization of nursing research findings to evaluate current practices, introduce innovations in practice and create an environment to facilitate excellence. In the event of a dispute regarding changes in the role of the registered nurse or the application of the nursing process, changes will not be implemented until conflict resolution process is observed.
The provisions of this Section have been established for the discussion and good faith consideration of the subjects included within the scope of this Section. It is the intent and desire of the parties that mutual agreement be reached on these subjects.
58
Children's Minneapolis 2IXM-2OO7
	If the Committee is unable to reach agreement, a mediator with background and experience in health care matters shall work with the Committee in attempting to find solutions to areas of disagreement. The mediator may be chosen from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or from other sources as the Committee may determine.
(b)	Changes in the System for Delivery of Nursing Care: If the Hospital is considering a change affecting the system for delivery of patient care that may affect how the nurses practice, the environment of practice, the interaction with assistive personnel, or the interface with other department and disciplines, it will notify the Committee in a timely and proactive manner. The parties will jointly review, discuss, and consider possible consultants to work with the Hospital and bargaining unit nurses regarding any changes in the system for delivery of nursing care, use of assistive personnel, or job responsibility of the registered nurse. Upon receipt of the notice referred to, the Committee shall review, discuss, and analyze the change for which the notice was given. If the Committee, upon exploration of the issue, identifies that changes proposed will impact implementation of the role of the registered nurse or application of the nursing process to delivery of patient care, it is the intent that those aspects will be considered under the guidelines in (a) above. The Hospital shall provide the Committee relevant information necessary to evaluate the impact of any proposed change being considered and to make any recommendations relating thereto. The Committee will jointly analyze proposed changes and consider possible options to work with the parties regarding the change. The Committee will jointly review plans for evaluation of changes proposed. Nurses appointed by the Association and Hospital representatives will review the following on a unit basis, annually or more frequently if necessary: 1.	Staffing patterns and ratios 2.	Budgeted census and acuity 3.	Comparative benchmark data (i.e., NACHRI, CHCA, CHA) 4.	Concern for safe staffing data (patterns of difficult shifts, by day of the week as well as by shift) 5.	Gap analysis of staffing targets versus actual Results and action plans/solutions will be forwarded to the System Labor . Management Committee for review. In the event of planned changes to current RN staffing patterns and ratios, proposed changes will be discussed at Care Delivery Committee.
(c)	Patient Acuity System: At each Hospital there shall be maintained and used to determine needed nursing staff, a system of patient classification based on demonstrated patient needs and appropriate nursing interventions. Such system shall provide for the assessment of patient care needs by staff nurses on each station unit. In applying such system equal consideration will be given to immediate needs for staffing based on the judgment of the nurse on the station unit. Patient classification system issues to be covered by the Nursing Care Delivery Committee will include determination and modification of the system, inclusion of nurse judgment as criteria, receipt and review of information describing the process of how
59
Children's Minneapolis 20 tM-2 007
the system translates into staffing for nursing care, and a review of the system at least annually.
The Hospital will make reasonable and continuing efforts to minimize the need for bargaining unit nurses to perform non-nursing functions supportive to nursing care such as housekeeping, dietary, clerical functions or the transport of supplies or stable patients.
The Care Delivery Committee will evaluate and address issues surrounding existing and future technology, including present and future impacts on nursing practice, safe patient care and patient confidentiality. Ways of adequately increasing staffing numbers as needed during implementation of new technology will be evaluated. The Committee will also address complexity of care.
Pilot programs involving the type of changes referred to in paragraph (a), (b) and (c) that are being discussed shall be reviewed and considered prior to the initiation of the program. An evaluation of the pilot program shall be submitted to the joint committee prior to the extension or further continuation of the pilot program.
The Committee shall have no power to modify the terms of the Agreement nor to adjust grievances.
(e)	HEALTH AND SAFETY:
(1)	Safety Policy: It shall be the policy of the Hospital that the safety of the nurses, the protection of work areas, the adequate education, and necessary safety practices, and the prevention of accidents are a continuing and integral part of its everyday responsibility.
Further, the Hospital is committed to providing employees a work environment that is free from hostile, abusive, and disrespectful behavior.
It shall also be the responsibility of all nurses to cooperate in programs to promote safety to themselves and to the public, including participation on committees, and compliance with rules promulgated to promote safety and a violence-free workplace. This nurse responsibility shall include the proper use of all safety devices in accordance with recognized safety procedures.
A nurse is allowed to decide if fatigue prevents her/him from delivering safe patient care.
(2)	Report of Injury: All nurses who are injured during the course of their employment shall file a report no matter how slight the injury, according to Hospital policy. The nurse may submit a copy of the report of injury to the Association.

32.	BREAKAGE:
It is not the policy of the Hospital to charge nurses for breakage of Hospital property.
33.	TEMPORARY NURSES:
The parties agree that full and part-time registered nursing staff employed by the Hospital are most likely to provide the desirable level of nursing care, to provide care to patients at an economical cost and to provide the necessary balance in assignment of shifts. It is understood that Hospital employed full and part-time float nurses are also Hospital nursing staff. The Hospital's basic policy shall be to use its registered nursing staff to the exclusion of temporary registered nurses from outside agencies except in unavoidable situations where no other means of providing necessary staffing are available.
72
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
	Such temporary nurses shall be used only as a supplement to and not in lieu of Hospital registered nursing staff. Prior to utilizing a temporary nurse, the Hospital shall take all steps available to cover a shift or partial shift with its own nursing staff. Before making any use of a temporary nurse, the Hospital shall offer each shift or partial shift to the members of its own registered nursing staff who are qualified to perform the work. These offerings shall be made as soon as any schedule opening is discovered by the Hospital, and shall be immediately communicated to the qualified Hospital nursing staff by written notice posted on the nursing service central bulletin board and on appropriate station bulletin boards. If the discovery is first made by the Hospital less than twenty-four (24) hours before the opening, the Hospital shall communicate such offering by telephone calls to the qualified Hospital nursing staff. No Hospital staff registered nurse will be denied available work because such work would incur overtime premium. A temporary nurse shall be required to have education, prior experience, and adequate advance orientation to the clinical service and station unit in the facility to which assigned to satisfactorily perform as a staff nurse on that station unit. A temporary nurse shall not be assigned leadership or charge nurse responsibilities but shall be expected to otherwise perform substantially the same functions as Hospital registered nursing staff members.	■ The Hospital shall insure that there will not be increased assignment of any of its nursing staff to night, evening, holiday or weekend duty as a result of the use of temporary nurse personnel. The Hospital shall maintain all necessary steps to reduce and minimize reliance on temporary registered nurses from outside agencies. The Hospital, upon request of the Association, will furnish information with respect to the number of day, relief, night, holiday and weekend shifts worked by temporary nurses. If the Hospital, its parent corporation, or affiliated entity establishes or maintains a common float pool with another Contract Hospital or Hospitals to provide registered nurses to work in bargaining unit positions at any of said facilities, such nurses shall be covered in all respects by the terms and provisions of this Contract Agreement. Seniority and the bargaining unit to which such nurses will be attached will be agreed upon by the parties.
34.	LEGALITY: To the best knowledge and belief of the parties, this Contract Agreement contains no provision which is in violation of Federal or State law or regulation. Should, however, any provision of this Contract Agreement at any time during its life be finally and effectively determined by a court or administrative agency to be inoperative because of any conflict with present or future Federal or State law or regulation, then such provision shall continue in effect only to the extent permitted and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In the event that any provision of this Contract Agreement is rendered inoperative as described in the foregoing paragraph of this Section 34, the parties shall enter negotiations for the purposes of insofar as possible retaining the original intent and effect of any provision affected by such law or regulation.

ADDENDUM TO CONTRACT AGREEMENT between MINNESOTA NURSES ASSOCIATION and CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE Amended 2004
In connection with the negotiation for the successor to the 1992*1995 Contract Agreement between Minnesota Nurses Association and Minneapolis Children's Medical Center and Children’s Hospital, Inc., the Association and Children’s Health Care have agreed to the following related to seniority at the respective campuses:
1.	SENIORITY-DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS: The definition of seniority accrual, and how seniority is utilized, will be consistent across Children’s Health Care system, as well as consistent with Children's Health Care-Minnesota Nurses Association Contracts’ language.
The following guidelines will apply to nurses employed at only one (1) Hospital within Children’s Health Care: (a) Two (2) separate seniority lists will be maintained: one (1) for Children's Health Care-Minneapolis and one (1) for Children's Health Care-St. Paul. A system to track hours worked at both Hospitals will be developed. A nurse employed at one (1) Hospital will accrue all hours worked at either Hospital onto the . seniority list for her/his home Hospital.
(b)	A nurse employed at one (1) Children’s Health Care Hospital who successfully bids on a bargaining unit position in the second Children's Health Care Hospital will transfer her/his seniority to the second Hospital.
The following guidelines will apply to nurses employed at both Children’s Health Care Hospitals simultaneously:
(a)	Nurses can continue to be employed simultaneously at both Hospitals. Hours worked will accrue on the seniority list for the Hospital where the hours were worked.
(b)	If a nurse who is simultaneously employed at both Hospitals successfully bids on a position in one (1) Hospital, and terminates employment at the other Hospital, her/his seniority hours will be calculated as follows:
•	The highest of her/his number of seniority hours will be identified from the two (2) Hospital seniority lists.
•	Any hours accrued at the other Hospital after June 1,1995, will be added to this highest number.
■	•	The resulting new number will appear on the seniority list for the Hospital at which she/he has taken a
position.
(c)	If a nurse who is simultaneously employed at both Hospitals successfully bids on a position in one (1) Hospital, and maintains employment at the other Hospital, she/he would remain on the seniority lists for each Hospital. No seniority hours would transfer between the two (2) lists.
Seniority will be considered in all opportunities for nurses, even if such opportunities do not involve open positions.
Clear communication will be made to the bargaining unit nurses and managers concerning any changes being made related to seniority issues. Specific start dates of any implemented options will be identified.
2.	POSTING AND AWARDING OF BARGAINING UNIT POSITIONS: An open bargaining unit position will be posted within Children's Health Care for seven (7) days. After seven (7) days, the position will be awarded in a manner consistent with Children’s Health Care - Minnesota Nurses Association Contracts’ language regarding qualifications and seniority.
The following sequence will be used in filling the position:
a) The position will be awarded to a bargaining unit nurse currently employed at the Hospital with the open position.
.	b) If no such candidate exists, the position will be awarded to a bargaining unit nurse currently
employed elsewhere in Children's Health Care.
75
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
c) If the position is not able to be filled using steps one (1) and two (2) above, the position will be awarded to an external candidate.
3.	SENIORITY - LAYOFF, CONSOLIDATION, CLOSURE: Definitions of terms as used in the following provision shall be:
1.	Consolidation:
• two (2) similar units are moved to one (1) Hospital
■ a specialty patient group is moved from two £2) Hospitals to one (1) Hospital
2.	Closure:
■ a department/program is eliminated
3.	Layoff:
• an involuntary, mandatory reduction in FTEs
■ reasons for layoff may include:
(a)	decreased volume
(b)	reduction of beds
(c)	change in acuity	'
(d)	budget
(e)	decreased length of stay
4.	Reduction of beds:
■ permanent or episodic reduction of staffed beds that would result in reduction (layoff) of nurses
5.	System-Wide:
■ affecting a majority of nursing departments in both Hospitals	■
The Children’s Health Care-Minnesota Nurses Association Merger Committee will develop a clearly defined process for the use of seniority during any consolidations, closures, and/or layoffs. This process will be consistent with Children’s Health Care-Minnesota Nurses Association Contracts’ language, and will include the following points:
1.	An individual nurse’s seniority will be preserved during transfers between Hospitals due to consolidation, closure, and/or layoff.
2.	In the event of a consolidation, closure, and/or layoff at either Hospital, open positions at both Hospitals will be made available to nurses affected by the consolidation, closure, and/or layoff.
3.	In the event of a consolidation, seniority lists of the affected units will be merged.
4.	While the term "core staffing” will not be used during any consolidation, each manager, with input from nursing
staff, will define the skills, and the minimum number of nurses with these skills, required to maintain a station’s, unit’s, or clinical area’s standard for safe, specialized care, The concept of quality care will be maintained.
5.	A layoff in a single Hospital will affect only nurses employed at that Hospital.
6.	The seniority hours for an individual nurse who is employed simultaneously on two (2) units which are being
consolidated will be calculated as follows:
•	The highest of her/his number of seniority hours will be identified from the two (2) unit seniority lists.
■	Any hours accrued at the other Hospital after June 1, 1995, will be added to this higher number.
■	The resulting new number will appear on the seniority list for the Hospital where the consolidation is
located.

APPENDIX C	- DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY FOR REGISTERED NURSES
Purpose: Children's Hospitals and Clinics is committed to maintaining a work environment which is free from the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs to protect the health, safety and well being of our patients, employees and visitors. Children’s Hospitals and Clinics has therefore adopted this Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy for Registered Nurses.
Policy: Children’s Hospitals and Clinics prohibits the use, possession, transfer, and sale of alcohol and/or illegal drugs while working, while on all premises owned or operated by the Hospital, and while operating any Hospital vehicle, machinery, or equipment. It also prohibits reporting for work, and working anywhere on behalf of Children's Hospitals and Clinics under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs.
Violation of this policy may result in discipline, up to and including discharge. "Illegal drugs” means controlled substances, and includes prescription medications which contain a controlled substance and which are used for a purpose or by a person for which they are not prescribed or intended.
This policy does not prohibit: (a) the moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages at Hospital-sponsored events, if any, where the Hospital has authorized alcoholic beverages to be served, and (b) the possession of sealed bottles or cans of alcoholic beverages in employee vehicles on Hospital premises so long as this possession would be in compliance with state law if the vehicle were on a public street.
Procedure
Voluntary Disclosure: Registered nurses are encouraged to voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol related discipline or proceedings. An individual who does so will be granted needed time off for treatment, rehabilitation, or counseling in accordance with the current contract agreement. Registered nurses who voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol related discipline or proceedings will not be discriminated against because of this disclosure nor will any information which is disclosed be used as the sole basis for discipline.
Scope: This policy is applicable to all registered nurses of Children’s Hospitals and Clinics and its subsidiaries, except those employees subject to mandatory drug testing by federal law or regulation. Except as to the sale and transfer of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, this policy does not apply to a registered nurse while on Hospital premises solely for the purpose of receiving medical treatment or visiting a person who is receiving medical treatment.
Grounds for Testing: Testing will be requested or required only under the circumstances described below. No test will be sought for the purpose of harassing a registered nurse. All tests are conducted by a laboratory certified in accordance with state law. No test will be conducted by a testing laboratory owned or operated by Children’s Hospitals and Clinics. The laboratory will notify the Hospital only of the presence or absence of controlled substances and their metabolites and/or alcohol in the sample tested.
80
Children's Minneapolis 2004-2007
Reasonable Suspicion: A registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo a drug and/or alcohol test if there is a reasonable suspicion that the registered nurse:
-	> is under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs
-	> has violated the policy statement above,
-	> has caused himself/herself or another employee to sustain a personal injury
-	> has caused a work related accident, or
-	> has operated or helped operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work related accident.
Treatment Program: A registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing if the registered nurse has been referred by Children’s Hospitals and Clinics for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation. The registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period. In addition, any employee who is referred for chemical dependency treatment may be requested or required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing without prior notice for a period of up to two years from the time of the referral for chemical dependency treatment.
Notification: Before requesting or requiring a registered nurse to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing, the Hospital will provide the registered nurse with a copy of this Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy and provide the registered nurse with an opportunity to read the policy.
Right to Refuse To Undergo Drug Testing and the Effect Thereof: Any registered nurse has the right to refuse to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing. A registered nurse who refuses to be tested or whose behavior prevents meaningful completion of drug and/or alcohol testing will be subject to discharge or other disciplinary action in conformity with the current Contract Agreement. If a registered nurse refuses to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing, no test will be administered.
Rights in Case of a Positive Result: If the initial result on the drug and/or alcohol test is positive, the sample which was tested will be subject to a second, confirmatory test. No registered nurse will be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation solely on the basis of an initial test result which is positive.
If the confirmatory test result is also positive, the registered nurse may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, in accordance with the current Contract Agreement and the following:
First Positive Test Result on Confirmatory Test: A registered nurse will not be discharged based on a first time positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital unless he or she has been given the opportunity to participate in a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program and has refused to participate or has failed to successfully complete the counseling program.
Subsequent Positive Result on Confirmatory Test: Ari employee who receives a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital and who has previously received a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital may be discharged, so tong as a previous positive result occurred within the three (3) preceding years.
81
Children's Minneapolis 20M-2(M)7
If the result of the confirmatory test is positive, a registered nurse has the right to explain the reasons for the positive test and to request a confirmatory retest of the sample, to be conducted at the registered nurse's expense. Any registered nurse wishing to exercise these rights must do so within five (5) working days. Additional internal appeal mechanisms may be available.
If the initial result of the drug and/or alcohol test is negative or the confirmatory test result is negative, the registered nurse is considered to have satisfactorily completed the drug and/or alcohol test.
Additional Rights of Employees: A registered nurse who is requested or required to undergo drug testing will be provided with a copy of the test results upon request. A registered nurse who is suspended without pay will be reinstated with back pay if the outcome of the confirmatory test or requested confirmatory retest is negative.
Confidentiality: The fact that a registered nurse has been requested or required to take a drug and/or alcohol test, the result of the test, and information acquired in the alcohol and/or illegal drug testing process shall be treated in a manner consistent with the Hospital’s treatment of other private, confidential information concerning employees. Voluntary disclosure by a registered nurse of the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohoi related discipline or proceedings will also be treated in a manner consistent with the Hospital's treatment of other private and confidential information concerning employees. This information will not be communicated by the Hospital to individuals inside or outside of the Hospital without the registered nurse’s consent except to those who need to know this information to perform their job functions, and as permitted or required by law or regulation.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING I HEALTH AND SAFETY 1995
(a)	Health and Safety standards will be established taking into consideration workplace assessments set forth in the Action Plan related to this issue. Data.and resources from NIOSH, Occupational Health Organizations, and recognized standards and guidelines identified by the parties may be considered. Over the first year of the Contract, both parties will work aggressively to mutually identify and prioritize areas based on relevant data which the parties have collected, analyzed, and evaluated. Over the second year of this Contract and based on the data, appropriate standards and engineering controls will be mutually developed and implementation begun in a concerted and mutual desire to reduce workplace injury and illness.	'
(b)	The Hospital and the Association have identified shared interests that relate to maintaining an injured, ill or disabled nurse’s ability to continue meaningful productive work in a professional role which accommodates the nurse’s disability and/or restriction(s). To that end, the parties further agree to the following:
1.	In all situations where there is a need to make accommodation to disability and/or restriction (s), the nurse will be advised of the nurse's right to Minnesota Nurses Association representation. If the nurse rejects representation it will be documented in writing and signed by the nurse. A copy of said document will be provided to Minnesota Nurses Association before any scheduled meeting. If representation is rejected, the Hospital will, nonetheless, review options for accommodation with the Minnesota Nurses Association in order to facilitate mutual problem solving and consistency prior to a decision in all situations.
2.	The Association will be provided with all relevant information requested related to the accommodation of the Registered Nurse. Medical information will be released subject to written authorization of the nurse. Consistent with their status as employer and bargaining representative, respectively, the Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association will respect any confidential information being considered or disclosed.
3.	Nurses will be accommodated on an individual basis, with a focus on the nurse’s ability, rather than disability.
4.	In evaluating the ability to accommodate a disability and/or restriction(s), the Hospital will not rule out increasing the number of staff scheduled on a unit as a method of achieving accommodation.
5.	As part of these discussions and upon request of the Hospital, Minnesota Nurses Association will waive the posting requirements of Section 16, Schedules and Postings, relative to selected new or existing open positions which would allow the Hospital to accommodate a nurse who is currently a member of the bargaining unit in a bargaining unit position.
83
Children's Minotipoiis2004-2007
6.	A nurse who has not been, or in the future may not be, accommodated in a bargaining unit position, retains bargaining unit seniority for all purposes for as long as the nurse is accommodated outside the bargaining unit. The nurse shall be given preference in returning to any new or existing open bargaining unit position within four (4) years where the nurse is qualified and can be accommodated.
7.	The parties agree to use the processes set forth in Section 19, Twin City Contract and Section 20 of the Mercy Contract, Promotions, Transfers and New Positions, relating to the inclusion of new or existing positions into the bargaining unit for any and all new or existing positions where nurses currently or previously in the bargaining unit have been transferred.
8.	The Hospital and the Association will jointly develop and periodically present education regarding the A.D.A.

The Pension Plan is funded by the Hospitals without nurse contributions. The instruments for the Plan are kept for your inspection at each Participating Hospital and at the Minnesota Nurses Association office. A summary plan description will be available for every nurse as soon as it is completed.
The Plan as amended provides for certain rules relating to when a nurse becomes a participant in the Plan, how benefits are accrued under the Plan, how benefits may be lost by a break in service, and how benefits may be vested.
When considering dates for a leave of absence or termination of employment, it is important that your specifically check with one of the offices listed below to determine the effect that a leave of absence or termination may have on your eligibility for benefits under the Plan. This Pension Plan Note and the summary plan description represent only a summary of Plan provisions. In all events, the legal documents are controlling.

ACTION PLANS
During the 2004 negotiations, the parties reaffirmed the following significant actions which are to occur during the term of the Contract. An Action Plan is a statement of agreed future actions and usually involves a general versus a specific process. It differs from Contract provisions in that is relies on the good faith of the parties for development and implementation. Action Plans may have a time schedule and are usually adaptable to the individual Hospital and Minnesota Nurses Association Labor Management process. Although these Action Plans are not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the Contract Agreement, the Hospital remains committed to following through on them.
The following are the agreed Action Plans to be worked on during the term of the 2004 - 2007 Contract Agreement:
SECURITY ACCESS CONTROL TASK FORCE
The Security Access Control Task Force, as lead by the Children’s Safety Officer, will include Association bargaining unit members. The Task Force wili address as a part of its agenda metai detectors, secure entrances, and identification issues. The Task Force’s objective will be to review, audit and create a proposal for Hospital leadership around these issues by year-end 2004.
MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FOR NURSES NEWLY TRANSFERRING INTO A UNIT
A formalized mentorship program for nurses newly transferring into a unit will be established. This program will include the following:
1.	The newly transferred nurse will identify a mentor after completion of her/his orientation to the unit.
2.	The mentor will have regular check-ins with the nurse.
3.	In addition to regular check-ins, the nurse, mentor and clinical educator will meet on a quarterly basis for the first year following orientation.
4.	Unit nurses agreeing to function as mentors will receive education specific to that role.
The goals of this program will include provision of a supportive environment for purposes of socialization and learning.
CONFORMATION OF CONTRACT LANGUAGE
During the 2004 Contract negotiations, the parties agreed that, while it was premature to combine the Minneapolis and St Paul Contracts, there was benefit to reviewing the Contracts for similarities.
A Task Force of 2004 negotiating committee memberswill review the Contract language during the Contract term. Where possible the Contract language will be conformed. There will be no changes of a substantive nature.
