on the time out slip. Officers who are part-time employees shall carry out the duties provided for in this section on their own time.
C.	Union stewards and officers will not use City vehicles to conduct union business.
D.	Problems in the administration of this Section with Union representatives of Local 1220 may be taken up through the Consultation provision and may be pursued through the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure starting at Step 2 by either party.
Section 6. Pool Time
Pool time is annual leave time donated by ASEU represented employees for the purpose of providing ASEU stewards and officers the opportunity to be absent from work without loss of pay for the following reasons:
1.	Union meetings
2.	Union training classes/seminars
3.	Attendance at Union conventions
4.	Preparation for contract negotiations with the City
5.	Contract negotiations with the City
ASEU representatives who are either officials or stewards as defined by this Article and are recognized by the Employer may be granted time off by departmental management to conduct business in connection with the Administrative Services Employees Unit, Local 1220, St. Petersburg Unit. Time off for ASEU business will be without loss of straight time pay by using available pool time provided the following:
A.	A written request for the use of pool time, using the Pool Time Request form contained at the end of this Article, is submitted through the employee's supervisor to the section or division manager at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the time off, or shorter notice in the case of unforeseen circumstances. The Pool Time Request Form will be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation (e.g., announcement of Union convention with dates and location, description of course time, location and content).
B.	Sufficient staffing is available to properly carry out the work of the department/section during the absence of the ASEU representative(s) as determined by the appropriate manager.
C.	Approval is given by the appropriate manager in advance of the use of pool time. The manager shall, prior to approval, take into account staffing problems, possible emergency situations, possible overtime obligations and pool time use conflicts with vacation time schedules. In all cases, the goal of providing efficient and superior service to the community is of paramount importance.
D.	No more than five (5) Union representatives and stewards shall be off at any one time. Each individual representative and steward shall not use more than ten (10) hours of pool time per month, and no more than a total of forty (40) hours of pool time shall be used by the Union per month. An exception will be made to these limits once a year for each Union officer and Union steward to attend a seminar or conference for up to forty (40) hours. Union representatives and stewards who are on pool time agree to remain off City premises unless the pool time is being used for contract negotiations with the City; failure to do so will result in the loss of pool time privileges for those individuals who violate this provision.
The Employer retains the right to restrict time off for ASEU business when insufficient notice is given or an emergency condition exists and such time off from work would create a hazard to the public. The Employer may also call employees on pool time back to work when emergency conditions exist.
Employees covered by this agreement may donate, on the donation form contained in this Article, a minimum of two (2) hours of their annual leave time, but cannot donate extended illness time toward the pool time account. Hours will be converted to dollars as will the hours utilized by the ASEU representatives, so that the running balance of the account at any given time will be a dollar and cents amount. Donations can be processed anytime during the term of this agreement.
Charges against the ASEU pool time account, as provided in this Article, shall only be made when approved by the President of Local 1220 prior to the employees utilizing requested pool time. Whenever the pool time account has been depleted, the time off may be without pay or annual leave may be used. When an officer or steward is absent from work and being covered by pool time, he or she shall continue to accrue benefits such as annual leave and extended illness leave. However, such hours will not count towards the computation of overtime.
For the purposes of this Article, annual leave time requests have priority over requests for the use of the ASEU pool time.
ASEU representatives using pool time shall not be on duty and shall not be eligible, during the time of utilization, for workers' compensation benefits.
Unused time (i.e., dollars) in the ASEU pool time account will be carried into the next fiscal year.
Section 7. The Union, as representative of the employees covered by this agreement, shall have the right to present its views to Management on matters of concern either orally or in writing.

Requests for access must be received by the Office of Labor Relations at least 24 hours in advance. Visits may be temporarily deferred so as not to interfere with work operations or maintenance of service to the community. City work hours shall not be used by employees or Union representatives for the purpose of conducting Union meetings.
Section 9.	The Employer will not negotiate individually with employees covered by this agreement concerning matters that are within the prerogative of this collective bargaining agreement. Informal discussions between an employee and supervisor, which are of a personal nature or concern problems personal to the employee, do not normally fall into this category.
Section 10.	During the term of this agreement, Management will provide the Union with a requested copy of notices and materials posted on the City's bulletin boards.
Section 11.	Solicitation of any and all kinds by the Union including solicitation of grievances, membership, and the collection of Union monies, shall not be engaged in during working hours.

Section 2.	The Employer will not discriminate against any employee covered by this agreement because of membership in, or legitimate activity as required in this Agreement on behalf of the members of the Union.
ARTICLE 8

Section 1.	Strike Definition
"Strike" means the concerted failure to report for duty, the concerted absence of employees from their positions, the concerted stoppage of work, the concerted use of sick leave, the concerted submission of resignations, picketing in furtherance of a work stoppage, the concerted abstinence in whole or in part of any group of employees from the full and faithful performance of their duties of employment with the City of St. Petersburg, the Employer, for the purpose of inducing, influencing, condoning or coercing a change in the terms and conditions of employment or the rights, privileges, or obligations of their employment or participating in a deliberate and concerted course of conduct which adversely affects the services of the Employer, the concerted failure to report for work after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement.
Section 2.	Strikes Prohibited
Employees covered by this agreement, the Union or its officers, agents and representatives, agree that Section 447.505, of the Florida Public Employees Collective Bargaining Statute prohibits them individually or collectively as public employees or the Union from participation in a strike against the City of St. Petersburg, the Employer, by instigating or supporting in any manner, a strike. Any violation of this Section shall subject the violator(s) to the penalties as provided for by this agreement, law, and the rules and regulations of the Employer.

ARTICLE 9
BASIC WORK WEEK AND OVERTIME
Section 1. The basic work week for all full-time employees covered by this labor agreement shall consist of forty (40) hours unless otherwise specified or scheduled by management to meet particular requirements of individual departments or sections of a department. Individual departmental management shall establish the basic work week and hours of work best suited to meet the needs of the

1/13/06 1:47 PM
department and provide superior service to the community. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as a guarantee or limitation of the number of hours to be worked per week.
Section 2. The basic work week of forty (40) hours for full-time employees shall be from Monday through Friday of each week unless specified or scheduled differently by management to meet particular requirements of individual departments, divisions or sections of a department. When management deems it necessary, work schedules may be established other then the basic Monday through Friday schedule. In this connection if a schedule change is made which affects a major segment of this bargaining unit, management will notify the Union as far in advance as possible.
Section 3. All authorized and approved work performed in excess of forty (40) hours in any one work week shall be considered as overtime and shall be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular hourly rate of pay, as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. If an employee works in excess of his scheduled daily hours, he shall not suffer any reduction in his remaining daily hours during that work week to preclude the payment of overtime. Each department may permit use of compensatory time in accordance with the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the City's Personnel Management System Rules and Regulations.
Section 4.	For purposes of overtime computation, annual leave, extended illness leave, funeral leave, jury duty, annual military leave and other absences from duty on active pay status shall not be considered as time worked, with the exception that holiday hours shall count towards the computation of overtime.
Section 5.	Employees shall be required to work overtime when assigned unless excused by supervision. In the event any employee in the Unit is assigned to work approved overtime, he will not be required to use annual leave nor be placed in a "leave without pay" status during the basic work week in order to compensate or off-set the overtime hours worked or to be worked.
An employee desiring to be excused from overtime work assignments for good and sufficient reasons shall submit, in writing, a request to his immediate supervisor. The written request, if approved, shall remain in force until rescinded in writing by the employee to his immediate supervisor or until it becomes required and necessary to assign and schedule this employee to overtime work. At the time overtime work is required and necessary, the work shall be performed by employees who have not requested, in writing, to be excused from such assignment. In the event overtime work is required and the department, division or section cannot schedule the required numbers of employees, then those employees who have approved requests on file excusing them from overtime work shall be assigned and required to work such overtime.
Section 6.	Overtime opportunities are intended to be equitably distributed among full-time employees in their particular job classification, in their organization units (i.e., major work areas, department, shift, section, etc.), as far as the character of the work permits. Although temporary imbalances in the distribution of overtime may occur, nothing in this section shall be construed as alleviating the continuing intent of departmental management to distribute overtime fairly and equitably over an extended period of time. Management, however, retains the right to determine when work will be performed by full-time employees on an overtime basis or by part-time or pool employees.
Section 7.	When a full-time employee is assigned to work overtime as distinguished from a call back in excess of five (5) hours before or after his regular shift hours, his immediate supervisor will schedule a paid lunch period during the overtime assignment unless the employee's overtime work assignment requires his constant attention or availability or, at the employee's option, he does not desire a lunch period.
Section 8.	Call Back
Call back pay is provided to compensate full-time employees required to return to work after completing a regularly assigned shift. Eligibility for call back pay for full-time employees is as follows:
A. Any employee who is off duty and required to return to
work on an unscheduled basis
shall be eligible
for call back pay.
B.	Any employee required to return to work three (3) hours or less prior to his regularly scheduled starting time shall be paid for the actual time worked plus one hour inconvenience pay.
C.	Any employee who is on duty and is instructed and assigned to return to work shall be ineligible for call back pay but may be eligible for compensation at the overtime rate of pay.
D.	Any employee required to continue working after completion of his regular scheduled shift shall be ineligible for call back pay but may be eligible for compensation at the overtime rate of pay.
E.	An employee who is off-duty and is called and given the opportunity to work voluntary overtime is not eligible for call back pay but may be eligible for compensation at the overtime rate of pay.
F.	Any employee eligible for call back pay shall be paid for the actual hours worked, plus one (1) hour bonus for the call back inconvenience. A minimum guarantee of four (4) hours pay which will include the one (1) hour inconvenience bonus shall be paid. The maximum any employee may receive the call back inconvenience pay is twice in a twenty-four (24) hour period. If the employee is called back to work more than two (2) times in a twenty-four (24) hour period he shall be paid at his applicable rate from the time of notice to the time the employee returns home. All hours worked on a call back shall be counted toward computing the

1/13/06 1:47 PM
weekly overtime.
G.	When an employee is contacted at home and is able to address a work-related problem by phone or via computer from home, he shall not be paid in accordance with Paragraph F. above. Instead, he will receive payment for actual time worked, subject to a minimum of one (1) hour. Departments will be responsible for determining the reasonableness of time claimed, particularly in situations where the employee was not logged on to the computer system for the entire time he was working on the problem, in cases where a computer was used. An employee who is contacted off-duty and required to report to a City work site to address a problem via computer or an employee contacted off-duty who has to return home in order to address a problem via computer will receive call-back pay in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph F.
Section 9.	Standby Time
A.	In order to provide coverage for services during off-duty hours, it may be necessary to assign and schedule employees to standby duty. A standby duty assignment is made by a supervisor who requires an employee to be available for work due to an urgent situation on his off duty time which may include nights, weekends, or holidays. Employees shall be required to be on standby duty when assigned unless excused by supervision.
B.	Employees assigned to standby duty by their supervisor are guaranteed standby pay of two (2) hours pay at their regular straight time hourly rate for each eight (8) hour increment of standby time assigned and scheduled. Standby time shall not count as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay.
C.	Employees while on standby duty when called to work will, in addition to the standby pay of two (2) hours for each eight (8) hours assigned, be paid for the actual time worked with a minimum guarantee of one (1) hour's pay for each call to work. For pay purposes, actual time worked starts at the time of notice and ends when the employee returns home. In the event any employee who is on standby duty fails to respond to a call to work, he will forfeit the standby pay and may be subject to possible disciplinary measures as provided in the Code of Conduct Rules.
D.	Employees shall not be assigned to standby duty if excused in advance by management. In the event management cannot schedule the required number of employees for standby duty then employees shall be assigned by management.
E.	When an employee who is on standby is required to return to work, he shall not qualify for call back pay.
Section 10.	The Employer agrees that the present departmental policies concerning rest periods and meal periods for employees covered by this labor agreement shall not be arbitrarily changed. Should a change be necessary due to operational needs, the City will meet and consult with the Union prior to said change being implemented. In this connection, employees will normally have a scheduled paid or non-paid lunch period.
In the event an employee is required by management to forego a scheduled non-paid lunch period, and the lunch period is not rescheduled later in the shift, the missed lunch period shall be added to the hours worked for the week for the determination of overtime to be paid. The provisions of this section pertaining to missed lunch periods shall not apply to employees who are normally paid for their lunch period and/or assigned to a continuous shift of work.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit an employee from taking his unpaid lunch period away from his work location, as long as the employee returns to work in a timely fashion.
Section 11.	Nothing contained in this agreement shall be interpreted as requiring a duplication or a pyramiding of premium payments involving the same hours worked.
ARTICLE 10
SENIORITY, LAYOFF AND RECALL
Section 1. Basis of Seniority
A. Probationary Periods
1.	Regular Probationary Periods
All newly hired full-time employees except those covered by special probationary periods shall be placed on probation for the first six (6) months in the classification. In the event the employee accepts another position before his initial probationary period is satisfactorily completed, his initial probationary period begins at the time he starts working in the new position. All employees on probationary status shall be eligible for membership in the Union and shall be entitled to the benefits outlined in this agreement except that the City may, at its sole discretion, terminate any employee during his initial probationary period. Employees serving an initial probationary period are ineligible to file appeals or grievances.
2.	Special Probationary Periods
Employees in classifications for which special licenses, certificates, or training are required which require a time period longer than six months shall have as their probationary period the same time as required by the applicable local, State, or Federal
http://webmail.stpete.org/servlet/webacc/rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc/GWAP/AREF/1?action=Attachment.View&Item.Attachment.id=1&User.context=rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc&Item.drn=53627z2z0&Item.Child.id=

1/13/06 1:47 PM
certificate or license requirement, or designated training period to satisfactorily pass the probationary period. Employees affected by this special probationary period shall be advised of the requirement by their supervisor. Employees in this category of special probationary periods shall be eligible for membership in the Union and shall be entitled to all benefits in this agreement as any other regular initial probationary employee. After the completion of the first nine (9) months of the special probationary period, full-time employees may file grievances and appeals on matters concerning the interpretation and application of this labor agreement, excluding cases involving demotion or discharge.
3.	Employees transferred between departments in the same classification will serve a three (3) month probationary period. However, if the transfer is due to a layoff, no probationary period will be served, although a department may still conduct a performance evaluation after the first three (3) months if it so chooses.
4.	Any classified employee promoted to a new classification shall serve a six (6) month probationary period or special probationary period if applicable. At any time during this probationary period, if management or the employee determines that the employee is unable to perform the job or he does not obtain the necessary license or certification, the employee shall be returned to his previous classification providing a position is available.
5.	Employees who are promoted due to a reclassification or are otherwise reclassified as a result of a position audit, shall not be required to serve a probationary period.
6.	Any classified employee demoted to a new classification shall serve a six (6) month probationary period or special probationary period if applicable. If the employee is demoted to a classification previously held in that department for which the probationary period had been completed, then no probationary period will be served.
7.	Cumulative absences of thirty calendar days or more, any suspensions from scheduled work, and time spent on light duty when the work performed on light duty does not encompass a significant part of the employee's regular job duties shall be added to a probationary period.
8.	The probationary period may be extended up to a maximum of three (3) additional months by the Department director at his discretion. In this connection, departmental management will inform the probationary employee of the reasons for the extension.
B.
City Seniority
1.	City seniority is understood to mean length of time since an employee's most recent date of employment or re-employment. Seniority will continue to accrue during all types of leave except for Leave of Absence Without Pay of more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days which shall cause this date to be adjusted for an equivalent amount of time. Leaves of Absence Without Pay for periods of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less shall not cause the City seniority date to be adjusted.
2.	City seniority shall be used for purposes of computing vacations, service awards and other matters based on length of service.
3.	City seniority for the purposes of layoff and recall shall be defined as in Section B.1 above except that only full-time employment in a classified status in any classification shall be counted in calculating length of City service.
C.
Classification Seniority
1.	Classification seniority shall be understood to mean length of time in classification. After successful completion of the probationary period, length of time in classification reverts to date of entry, transfer or promotion to present classification. Seniority will continue to accrue during all types of leave except for Leave of Absence Without Pay of more than thirty (30) consecutive calendar days which shall cause this date to be adjusted for an equivalent amount of time. Leaves of Absence Without Pay for periods of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less shall not cause the classification seniority date to be adjusted.
2.	Classification seniority as defined above in C.1 shall be used for all matters based on seniority except for layoff and recall.
3.	Classification seniority for the purposes of layoff and recall shall be defined as in Section C.1 above except that only full-time employment in a classified status in a classification covered by this labor agreement shall be counted in calculating length of service.
D.
Seniority Date Adjustment Exception
Full-time employees having a minimum of five (5) years of City seniority shall suffer no loss of either City or classification seniority if on a leave of absence without pay for illness of the employee for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months.
E. Loss of Seniority
Employees shall lose their seniority as a result of the following:
1.	Resignation
http://webmail.stpete.org/servlet/webacc/rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc/GWAP/AREF/1?action=Attachment.View&Item.Attachment.id=1&User.context=rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc&Item.drn=53627z2z0&Item.Child.id=
Page 14 of 41
43c7afc2.CMC
1/13/06 1:47 PM
2.	Retirement
3.	Termination for cause
4.	Layoff exceeding twelve (12) months
5.	Failure to report to the Human Resources Department intention of returning to work within fourteen (14) calendar days of return receipt verification of certified mail of the recall offer notice.
6.	Failure to return from Military Leave within the time limits prescribed by law.
Section 2. Layoff Procedure
A.	Notification
Management will notify and consult with the Union in advance of a pending layoff action affecting employees covered by this agreement.
B.	Order of Layoff
When it becomes necessary to lay off employees in any classification covered by this agreement, the following shall apply:
1.	Temporary employees
2.	Initial probationary employees
3.	Classified employees
If a position has been eliminated from the City's budget, or has been selected to be eliminated at some future time, the employee in the targeted position will be laterally transferred to a vacant position of the same classification, should said vacancy occur. The layoff process will not take effect (i.e., employees either "bumping" other employees or accepting the layoff) if a lateral transfer of the affected employee is possible.
Classified employees will be laid off in the inverse order of their length of time in their classification. In the event two or more affected employees have the same amount of seniority in a classification, City seniority will be the determining factor and the least senior employee would be laid off first. In the event two or more employees have the same classification and City seniority, the employee with the lowest identification number will be deemed to be the senior employee unless one is eligible for Veterans' Preference in accordance with applicable state or federal laws.
Temporary and initial probationary employees in affected classifications will be laid off first and shall not have recall rights. In addition, employees in a trainee classification will be laid off before any employees in the classification to which the trainee is promoted upon completion of the training program will be laid off. (Example: All Emergency Complaint Writer Trainees would be laid off before any Emergency Complaint Writers were laid off.) Unless the trainee has previously held another City position and has the seniority to be placed in that classification, the trainee will have no recall rights.
Promotional probationary employees having more than six (6) months service with the City shall be returned to the previously held classification from which promoted and placed on that seniority list in line with their classification seniority, except that employees cannot be returned to trainee classifications.
C. Return to the Bargaining Unit
1.	Employees returning to the bargaining unit within the prescribed probationary period shall retain all former classification seniority plus the time spent in probationary status.
2.	Employees returning to the bargaining unit as a result of demotion, layoff or transfer shall retain
all classification seniority in a classification series for purposes of layoff.
3.	Employees returning to the bargaining unit shall slot-in to their appropriate position on the seniority list in accordance with classification seniority and be considered for layoff under the terms of this Article.
D. Classified Employees
1.	a. A classified employee who loses his position as a result of a layoff shall have the right, seniority permitting, to any job he has previously held (except for trainee classifications) and for which he has completed the probationary period.
b.	Classified employees who are affected by a layoff shall have their seniority from the laid off classification in a classification series added to their lower classification seniority for determination of holding in the lower classification if the employee had previously held jobs in the series.
c.	Any classified employee who is eligible for a lower classification in a
http://webmail.stpete.org/servlet/webacc/rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc/GWAP/AREF/1?action=Attachment.View&Item.Attachment.id=1&User.context=rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc&Item.drn=53627z2z0&Item.Child.id=
Page 15 of 41
43c7afc2.CMC
1/13/06 1:47 PM
classification series and also another previously held position not in the classification series may accept the job in the higher pay grade.
2.	Classified employees who are in a classification which is not part of a classification series or who have not held any of the other positions in a classification series shall be laid off in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
3.	Classified employees affected by any layoff action may:
a.	Exercise the option of accepting the layoff and being removed from the active payroll or,
b.	Accept a position in a previously held classification (except trainee classifications), seniority permitting.
4.	An employee who accepts or is placed in a lower classification as a result of demotion, layoff or transfer, shall receive an hourly rate not to exceed the maximum rate for the lower classification or his current hourly rate whichever is lower.
5.	Any movements in connection with the layoff procedures shall not result in an increase in the basic hourly rate for any employee, unless a previously held position is in a higher pay grade.
6.	All layoff placements shall be made in accordance with these provisions providing the employees are able to perform the essential functions of and meet the qualifications for the classification to which placed.
7.	Classified employees who bump back to a temporary position shall maintain their union-represented status for the duration of the period they remain in "layoff" status, i.e., twelve (12) months.
8.	Any employee who is affected by a layoff must determine whether the layoff or a bump back, seniority permitting, will be the option he chooses to accept. If the employee accepts the bump back position and then subsequently decides not to accept the bump back, he will be considered to have voluntarily resigned.
Section 3. Recall
A.	Classified employees in layoff status either working in a previously held classification or off the active payroll shall retain recall rights for twelve (12) months to the classification from which they were originally laid off. Laid off employees recalled within twelve (12) months shall have the seniority they had accrued when laid off restored. If re-employed after twelve (12) months, the employee shall be treated as a new employee.
B.	Employees on layoff status shall be recalled for openings in the classification from which originally laid off over applicants on any eligibility list.
C.	Employees will be recalled in the inverse order from which they were laid off. The last employee laid off from a classification will be the first employee recalled if a vacancy should occur in that classification.
D.	Recall to laid off employees will be made by certified mail to the last address as shown in the Employer's official personnel file. Laid-off employees have the sole responsibility for maintaining their current address on file.
E.	Within fourteen (14) calendar days of the certified receipt date, laid off employees must signify their intention of returning to work to the Employment Office or forfeit their seniority and recall rights.
F.	Recall will be offered to laid off employees provided they are able to perform the essential functions of and meet the qualifications for the job. A laid off employee, when offered recall, who is temporarily unable to accept due to medical reasons as certified by an attending physician, may request a leave of absence not to exceed thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, unless eligible under the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act for a longer recuperation period.
G.	The Employer reserves the right to require a physical examination prior to any recalled employee being placed back on the active payroll. Recalled employees must further successfully pass any related basic skills tests for the affected classification.
H.	Upon recall to fill vacancies in their laid off classification, employees shall receive the same hourly rate they held at the time of layoff and, in addition, any negotiated increase that may be applicable. Further, all extended illness leave which employees may have had credited to them at time of layoff shall be restored, unless they exercised their extended illness leave payoff option, in which case only the hours not paid off will be restored.
ARTICLE 11
FUNERAL LEAVE
Section 1.
Full-time employees covered by this agreement will be granted time off with pay at their
straight time hourly rate, not to exceed three (3) of their scheduled working days, if needed, to attend the funeral or handle related activities in the event of a death in the employee's immediate
http://webmail.stpete.org/servlet/webacc/rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc/GWAP/AREF/1?action=Attachment.View&Item.Attachment.id=1&User.context=rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc&Item.drn=53627z2z0&Item.Child.id=

1/13/06 1:47 PM
family. Up to three (3) days may be taken prior to and including the day of the funeral or immediately following, but all days taken for funeral leave must be taken within the seven consecutive calendar days surrounding the date of the funeral. Full-time employees will be granted time off with pay from their regularly scheduled work hours not to exceed seven (7) consecutive calendar days if the funeral is held outside the State of Florida and is attended by the employee. Otherwise one day off with pay will be granted in the event an employee is not attending the funeral but is involved in making funeral arrangements or handling the deceased's affairs.
Section 2.	The employee's immediate family shall be defined as the employee's spouse, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, grandparents, greatgrandparents, stepparents, stepchildren, grandchildren, and spouse's grandparents.
Section 3.	Funeral leave shall not be charged to annual or extended illness leave.
Section 4.	Should an employee require additional time other than provided in Section 1 of this Article, he shall request the additional time from the department director or his designee. Upon approval by the department director, or his designee, any additional time used shall be charged to annual leave if the employee has hours accrued that can be charged.
Section 5.	The employee may be requested at the discretion of the department to provide the
Department Director with proof of death in his immediate family as defined in Section 2 of this Article before compensation is approved.
ARTICLE 12
JURY DUTY
Section 1.	In the event full-time employees are summoned for jury duty, they shall receive straight time pay for the hours required to be absent from their currently scheduled work hours due to such jury duty. Employees who perform jury duty for only a portion of their regular scheduled workday are expected to report to work when excused or released by the court.
Section 2.	Employees called for jury duty shall promptly notify their immediate supervisor so that arrangements may be made for their absence from work.
Section 3.	Full-time employees on jury duty while on scheduled vacation shall be allowed jury duty pay for that time served provided satisfactory evidence of the time served on such duty is presented to the Department Director.
Section 4.	In the event a holiday occurs during the period of the employees' jury duty, eligible full-time employees shall receive pay for such holiday.
Section 5.	Full-time employees shall provide the Department Director with proof of jury duty service before compensation is approved, to include a signed statement from the Court Clerk noting each day spent on jury duty. In the event the employee participates on a jury which is sequestered, and he is unable to provide his Department Director with proof of jury duty service, a telephone call by the employee to the appropriate department-designated representative will suffice until such time as the employee can provide the necessary documentation. When a full-time employee serves on jury duty for an entire workweek and is unable to provide the department with the appropriate documentation until the following scheduled workday, he will still be compensated for his hours of jury duty.
ARTICLE 13
LEAVE WITHOUT PAY
Section 1.	Full-time employees may request a leave of absence without pay. Such requests require the approval of both the department director or his designee and the Human Resources Director. The Human Resources Department reserves the right to determine if said leave is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and therefore counts towards the twelve weeks per year of leave which must be granted to eligible employees by the City. (The "year" is defined as the twelve months prior to the requested absence, as opposed to a fiscal or calendar year.) In cases where the leave period exceeds twelve (12) months, the action will not be final until the Mayor or his designee also approves. A Personnel Action Form covering the employee's absence and the consent of the Human Resources Director is necessary only if the leave exceeds thirty (30) consecutive calendar days with the form to be dated from the first day of leave without pay. Initial probationary employees (fulltime employees who are serving, upon initial employment, a trial working period, usually for six months) may not be granted a leave of absence which exceeds thirty calendar days. The employee's probationary period will be extended by the amount of time granted for leave.
Section 2.	The decision to grant leave without pay (a leave of absence) is a matter of administrative discretion except that requested leave which is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 shall be granted for employees with at least 12 months of service who have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours during that period. It will be incumbent upon the department director or his designee to weigh each request and determine each case on its own merits after taking into consideration the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. If the request for leave without pay is denied, the reason for denial shall be given in writing to the employee within five (5) working days from the date of the request.
Section 3.	An employee granted a leave of absence shall be required to utilize all accrued annual leave prior to being removed from the active payroll except that an employee may, upon request, reserve up to forty (40) hours of his annual leave providing the leave is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Section 4.	An employee granted a leave of absence must keep his department informed, every three (3) months, of his current activity (school, medical, military, etc.). In addition, he must keep his department advised of his current address at all times. Also, an employee who is out due to the

Regular part-time employees begin accruing hours on a prorated basis after the first six months of employment.
Section 5.	General Provisions
A.	The maximum number of annual leave hours which may be accrued shall be twice the employee's yearly rate of accrual.
B.	Annual leave may be taken in increments of tenths of an hour.
C.	Requests for annual leave shall be scheduled in advance of use. In emergency cases, the department director may waive this requirement. Certain requests for annual leave may be qualified and be covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. If such leave is covered by this Act, it counts towards the twelve weeks per year of leave which must be granted to eligible employees by the City. (The "year" is defined as a rolling twelve month period which is the twelve months immediately preceding the latest FMLA event.) An employee granted leave may, upon request, reserve up to forty (40) hours of his annual leave providing the leave is covered by the FMLA.
D. An employee incapacitated and/or otherwise unable to work shall notify his department, in accordance with the reporting procedures as determined by the operational procedures and directives of the department concerned, stating the nature of his illness and expected period of absence. This procedure shall be followed for each day the employee is unable to work, unless prior approval is given by the Department. In the event that the employee is unable to call due to personal illness and can, in fact, substantiate that he was sick to the satisfaction of the Department Director before returning to work, the absence without authorization will be removed from his record and the employee shall receive annual leave with pay if he has hours in his annual leave account that can be applied.

G. Employees shall not be granted paid annual leave for annual leave in excess of their accumulated leave hours. In the event an employee should for some reason take time off from work which exceeds his available accrued annual leave hours, he shall not receive pay for the hours for which he has no annual leave accumulated.
H. The nature of an employee's job and the operational requirements of a department, division or section may cause the director to limit the scheduling of annual leave for vacation purposes during certain periods of the year. Based on operational requirements and when practical and in the best interests of the City, the director may require the use of annual leave for vacation purposes in amounts of forty (40) or more hours. When a written request for annual leave (40 hours or more) is denied, the employee will be notified in writing.
Section 6.	Advance Pay
Employees may request advance pay prior to going on annual leave providing the leave request is forty (40) or more hours. This shall be strictly at the employee's option. Requests shall be honored when submitted at least two (2) weeks in advance of going on annual leave.
Section 7.	Pay Off of Account
Upon separation from City employment, employees shall be entitled to compensation for all earned but unused hours to their credit at their basic straight time hourly rate, as of the effective date of separation. This provision does not apply to employees having less than six (6) months service.

An employee failing to comply with such written notice shall not receive paid annual leave for the day(s) in question. Use of annual leave for medical reasons will not relieve an employee of his attendance obligations and shall not excuse excessive absenteeism as defined in the Code of Conduct of the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System. The City reserves the right in all cases of reported illness to require an employee to furnish the illness/injury report completed by a physician as defined in Section G. below. Chronic use or abuse of leave for illness shall constitute grounds for discipline and/or review of an employee's fitness for duty.
G. Only statements on forms signed by physicians recognized by the Florida Department of Labor in the current Florida Workers' Compensation reimbursement manual issued by the Office of Medical Services, shall be accepted for leave benefits.

ARTICLE 16
EXTENDED ILLNESS LEAVE
Section 1.	Purpose
The purpose of the extended illness leave program is to provide regular full-time employees with basic salary during periods of extended illness in which they are medically incapacitated and unable to perform their job assignments.
Section 2.	Definition
Extended illness leave shall apply for periods in excess of two (2) consecutive scheduled working days. Hours in the employee's account shall be applied starting with the third (3rd) consecutive working day of absence and so on until his return to work. If an employee leaves the job for reasons of illness during his normal duty shift and continues to be absent for the next several days, eligibility for extended illness account usage will begin at the same (mid-shift) point in the second consecutive duty shift after the employee left for illness. For the employee who works five eighthour days per week, extended illness time will begin after the employee has missed sixteen consecutive hours of regular scheduled duty time. For the employee who works four ten-hour days per week, extended illness time will begin after the employee has missed twenty consecutive hours of regular scheduled duty time.
Section 3.	Accrual Rate
Employees shall accrue four (4) hours of extended illness leave for every eighty (80) regularly scheduled work hours they work or are on active pay status.
Section 4.	Accrual Maximum
Unlimited extended illness leave may be accrued.
Section 5.	Notification of Extended Illness
A.	An employee medically incapacitated to the extent that he is unable to work shall notify his Department in accordance with the reporting procedures as determined by the operational procedures and directives of the Department concerned, giving the reason for the requested extended illness leave and the expected duration of the absence. This procedure shall be

followed for each day the employee is unable to work, unless prior approval is given by the Department. In the event that the employee is unable to call due to personal illness and can, in fact, substantiate that he was sick to the satisfaction of the department director before returning to work, the absence without authorization will be removed from his record and the employee shall receive extended illness leave with pay if he has hours in his extended illness leave account that can be applied.
B.	The daily reporting requirements will be waived by the department/division in the event the illness/injury report reflects a specific period of time. Failure to properly report absences shall cause an employee to be charged with an absence without leave.
C.	Certain requests for extended illness leave may qualify and be covered by the Family and Medical leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. If said leave is covered by this Act, it counts towards the twelve weeks per year of leave which must be granted to eligible employees by the City. (The "year" is defined as a rolling twelve month period which is the twelve months immediately preceding the latest FMLA event.) In cases involving leave protected by FMLA, the medical health care provider's verification of the employee's illness/injury must be provided using the Certification of the Health Care Provider Form.
Section 6.	Approvals
A.	Unless the department specifically waives the re-quirement, an employee requesting extended illness leave for an absence shall be required to submit an illness/ injury report verifying the reported illness or injury prior to receiving authorization for the absence or be eligible for paid extended illness leave. An employee who fails to comply with this requirement shall not receive paid extended illness leave for the day(s) in question.
B.	Only statements on forms signed by physicians recognized by the Florida Department of Labor in the current Florida Workers' Compensation reimbursement manual issued by the Office of Medical Services, shall be accepted for leave benefits. These include M.D.'s, Osteopaths, Chiropractors, Podiatrists, Optometrists, Dentists, and Psychologists who work under the direct supervision of Psychiatrists.
C.	Extended illness leave shall be paid by the actual hours and tenths of hours used. An employee shall not be compensated for extended illness hours in excess of the amount of such leave accumulated to his credit.
D. An employee who utilizes excessive extended illness leave for reported illnesses or injuries, or is otherwise frequently absent from duty for stated medical reasons, may, at the department's discretion, be required to document his future absences for medical reasons with a completed illness/injury report from a doctor prior to being authorized an absence from duty on paid extended illness leave. An employee failing to comply with such written notice shall not receive paid extended illness leave for the day(s) in question. Use of extended illness leave for medical reasons will not relieve an employee of his attendance obligations and shall not excuse excessive absenteeism as defined in the Code of Conduct of the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System. The City reserves the right in all cases of reported illness to require an employee to furnish the illness/injury report completed by a physician as defined in Section 6.B. Chronic use or abuse of leave for illness shall constitute grounds for discipline and/or review of an employee's fitness for duty.
E.	Department management will use discretion in determining whether or not a visit is required to verify an employee's illness and a report made of the reasons for absence from duty.
F.	Should an employee be absent, claiming illness and fail to comply with the provisions of this Article, such employee shall then be charged with "leave without pay" and may be subject to disciplinary action.
Section 7.	Illness Recuperation
A. Employees granted extended illness leave shall assist in promoting their recuperation by remaining at either their residence or another location approved in advance by the department director or his designee and the attending physician. An employee authorized to be absent from work for illness reasons shall not engage in any recreational or work activities except upon receiving prior approval from his physician and Department Director or his designee.
B. Other places of recuperation shall be permitted under the following conditions:
1.	Pre-authorization by a physician must be in writing with specifics.
2.	Pre-authorization must be on file with the employee's immediate supervisor and is to include the address and phone number, if applicable, where the employee is recuperating.
C. Employees recuperating from an illness in which there was no involvement with doctors may request, through department management, another place of recuperation. Approval will be required in advance with the address and phone number, if applicable, where the employee is recuperating to be part of the request.
Section 8.	Workers' Compensation
An employee sustaining a workers' compensation covered lost-time injury may request the Department Director to apply any extended illness leave (for full-time employees) or annual leave hours in his account in order to obtain full basic take home pay (as defined in Article 24, Section 6.B.3. of this agreement) while absent from duty from injury. In no case shall the amount of workers' compensation
http://webmail.stpete.org/servlet/webacc/rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc/GWAP/AREF/1?action=Attachment.View&Item.Attachment.id=1&User.context=rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc&Item.drn=53627z2z0&Item.Child.id=
Page 22 of 41
43c7afc2.CMC
1/13/06 1:47 PM
and the amount of extended illness or annual leave pay be more than the employee's base net pay for that period. If light duty, as described below, is offered to an employee receiving workers' compensation benefits and the injury is covered by FMLA, the employee may decline the light duty but will not receive any further workers' compensation salary replacement monies. The employee could use annual leave or extended illness leave if eligible. (See also Article 24, Section 6.A.7.)
Section 9.	Light Duty
Many slight injuries and sickness may prohibit the performance of regularly assigned duties; however, there may be other duties that such employees may be able to perform without aggravating such injuries or sickness. Providing the physician states that 'light duty' work is acceptable, and light duty is available as determined by the department director or his designee, the employee may, at management's option, report to his supervisor for assignment within the department. The department may assign such duties as the health and condition permit of the involved employees. The parties agree that light duty work is temporary in nature and is in no way to be construed as an alternative form of employment for an employee who is either permanently or on a long term basis unable to perform the essential functions of his job.
Section 10.	Pay Off Provision
Upon separation of employment for reasons of either normal or disability retirement, the death of an employee who would otherwise be eligible for normal retirement, or upon removal from the payroll of the employee due to a layoff, employees or their survivor, shall be entitled to receive a payment of 25% of the unused accrued extended leave hours credited to their account up to a cap of 300 hours. This payment shall be determined on the employee's basic straight time hourly rate at the time of retirement.
Section 11.	Miscellaneous Provisions
A.	Employees may not use extended illness leave for sickness or injury sustained while engaged in outside employment.
B.	Serious and/or chronic extended illnesses requiring follow-up medical visits shall continue to receive the extended illness benefit under this Article, providing the employee meets the two-shift deductible each fiscal year, and providing the Department Director or his designee has approved the usage in accordance with the guidelines in the City's Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System.

Memorial Day - Last Monday in May Independence Day - July 4 Labor Day - First Monday in September Veteran's Day - November 11 Thanksgiving Day - Fourth Thursday in November Day following Thanksgiving - Friday
Christmas Day - December 25
Section 2.	The provisions which follow regarding holiday pay are applicable to full-time employees.
Section 3.	Whenever possible, employees will be granted time	off to	observe the holidays.	Holiday
pay is an	employee's straight time hourly rate for the number of	hours the employee is	normally
scheduled to work for that day. For example, an employee normally scheduled to work a ten-hour day on the day	the holiday falls would receive holiday pay for ten	hours.	An employee normally	scheduled
to work a	four-hour day on the day the holiday falls would	receive holiday pay for four	hours.
Schedules shall not be changed the week during which a holiday falls for the purpose of providing more holiday pay than the employee would normally be eligible for. Some operations require employees to work the holiday; an employee who is required to work the holiday or whose normal day off occurs on any such holiday shall be paid an additional eight (8) hours, and may be eligible for premium pay, depending upon the number of hours worked that week, since holidays count towards the computation of overtime.
Section 4.	An employee must be on active pay status or work his normal schedule of hours, either on his regularly scheduled working day immediately prior to a holiday or his regularly scheduled working day immediately following a holiday in order to be eligible for holiday pay.
Section 5.	Employees who are scheduled and required by their supervisor to work on the day observed as a holiday must work that day to be eligible to receive holiday pay. An employee who is scheduled to work on the day observed as a holiday and is absent for medical reasons will be charged with the holiday for that day. (Section 4 of this Article will not apply to employees scheduled and required to work on the day observed as a holiday).
Section 6.	Employees on annual leave, military leave, jury duty, extended illness leave, funeral leave and all other absences from duty and on active pay status on the day the holiday is observed must use the holiday on the day that it is earned.
Section 7.	When a holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be designated as a substitute holiday and observed as the official holiday for that year. When the holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be designated as a substitute holiday and observed as the official holiday.
Section 8.	The Mayor or his designee will determine which departments or operations will be closed in observance of the holiday.

Section 2.	General Wage Increase
A. Employees covered by this agreement shall receive a 3% general wage increase for FY 06, a 3.5% general wage increase for FY 07, and a 3.5% general wage increase for FY08. The increases shall be effective the payroll period beginning dates as shown below.
The parties agree to reopen the agreement to negotiate a revised general wage increase for the FY 08 if the local Tampa, Clearwater, St. Petersburg Consumer Price Index published for the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007 exceeds 5%.
B.
The appropriate pay period start dates are as
follows:
Payroll Group
			A	B	D
Fiscal	Year	2006	9/26/05	9/19/05	9/26/05
Fiscal	Year	2007	9/25/06	9/18/06	9/25/06
Fiscal	Year	2008	9/24/07	10/01/07	10/01/07
C. Retroactivity pay will be calculated and paid as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after ratification by both parties, to those employees on active pay status on the payroll as of the effective date of this agreement.
Section 3.	Progression in the Pay Plan
Employees are eligible for a pay adjustment/merit increase of three percent (3%) after each year in classification, contingent upon the employee receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation, which is defined as an evaluation with an overall rating score of "3.0", with no more than one factor rating below "3". The employee is eligible to receive this increase on his classification anniversary date until such time as he reaches the maximum pay rate established for his classification. In the event a 3% increase would put the employee's pay beyond the maximum pay rate for his classification, he shall only be eligible for an increase which would place him at the maximum. If an employee does not receive a satisfactory performance evaluation, he shall not receive an increase at that time but shall be informed in what performance areas he needs to improve and given ninety (90) days to improve. Another performance evaluation shall be done at the end of the ninety days and if the employee has corrected his deficiencies, i.e. he has improved his performance and achieved a satisfactory rating, then the 3% increase shall be given at that time, although there will be no retroactive effective date.
For employees who have provided exceptional performance during the year, the department manager may recommend an increase in accordance with Human Resources and Budget Department guidelines of greater than 3% but no higher than 5% for approval by the Human Resources Director or his designee.
Section 4.	Promotional Increase
An employee promoted to a higher paying classification shall receive a promotional pay increase of at least five (5) percent or the entry pay rate of the classification to which promoted, whichever is greater. If the employee is within three (3) to six (6) months of qualifying for his annual merit increase before being promoted, he can at the discretion of the Department Director, receive up to an additional two (2) percent merit increase. If the employee has less than three (3) months before qualifying for the annual merit increase, he can receive up to an additional three (3) percent merit increase.
Section 5.	Shift Differential
Full-time and part-time employees who work a continuous shift of at least eight (8) hours starting between 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. are not considered to be working a normal shift schedule and will be paid a shift differential of seventy-five (.75) cents per hour for all hours worked.
Police Department Communication Center employees who work a continuous shift beginning between the hours of 1:00 pm and 9:00 p.m.(evening shift) shall receive a shift differential rate of eighty cents (.80)per hour for all hours worked. Police Department Communication Center employees who work a continuous shift beginning between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.(night shift), shall receive one dollar ($1.00) per hour for all hours worked.
If an employee is scheduled to work at least an eight-hour shift which would qualify him for shift differential but uses annual leave, extended illness leave, funeral leave, or other leaves which continue the employee on active pay status for a portion of the shift, shift differential will be paid for the hours of the shift actually worked.
Employees who work a normal day shift and continue to work beyond their regular scheduled hours are not eligible for shift differential.
Section 6.	Acting Supervisor
A full-time employee who is required and assigned by management to serve as an acting supervisor for a minimum of one full shift of at least eight (8) hours shall be compensated for each hour worked in an acting capacity at the same hourly rate of pay he would have received if actually promoted to the supervisory classification, except that employees assigned to the Parking Enforcement Division of the Billing and Collection Department scheduled to work extra hours in addition to their normally scheduled hours of work may receive acting supervisor pay for the hours so assigned, i.e., when working these additional hours, the eight hour minimum does not have to be met.

Section 7.	Development Review Services
Employees in the classifications of Plans Examiner and Sr. Plans Examiner shall receive certification pay for each additional State of Florida Standard Certification as Plans Examiner earned in the Building, Electrical, Mechanical and Plumbing disciplines, beyond the one certificate required. For each additional certification held, the employee will receive $50.00 on a biweekly basis. Current employees who are receiving the pay for the one certification required for the position shall be "grandfathered" and shall continue to receive the pay for the term of this agreement.

ARTICLE 19
EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM
The parties agree that the City will maintain the current benefit provisions of the Employees' Retirement System (ERS), Ordinance No. 986-A, as amended, for the duration of this agreement.
ARTICLE 20
SAFETY AND HEALTH
Section 1.	Departmental management will make every reasonable effort to provide and maintain safe working conditions. To this end, the Union will cooperate and encourage the employees to work in a safe manner. Management will also receive and consider written recommendations with respect to unsafe conditions or other safety ideas from any employee or the Union. Within thirty (30) days of receipt, departmental management shall give a written reply to the employee/Union regarding the disposition of the recommendation.
Section 2.	Departmental management will provide proper and necessary safety equipment and devices for employees engaged in work where such special equipment and devices are necessary. Such equipment and devices where provided, must be used. Employees who fail to utilize provided equipment or devices will be subject to disciplinary measures. All safety equipment shall be kept in proper working order.
Section 3.	In the event an employee leaves the employ of his department, he shall return all uniforms and safety equipment to the department.
Section 4.	Employees purchasing industrial prescription safety lenses with safety frames or safety shoes will be reimbursed as set forth in Section 5 of this Article for that purchase upon presentation of proof of purchase and a memorandum from the department director indicating that the item was required in the performance of the employee's duties to maintain proper safety standards.
Section 5.
A.	The parties agree that the purpose of the safety glasses and safety shoe program is to encourage the use of industrial prescription safety lenses and safety shoes for the protection of employees and to prevent serious injuries and in this connection, appropriate Federal and State Standards shall apply to these items (ANSI and OSHA).
B.	Employees will be reimbursed for the cost of industrial prescription safety lenses with frames up to $125.00 no more frequently than once every two fiscal years, although reimbursement for single vision lenses up to $75.00 or reimbursement for bifocal or "no line" lenses up to $100 may be approved no more frequently than once a year.
C.	Employees will be reimbursed for the cost of safety shoes up to $85.00 no more frequently than once a fiscal year on a "fair wear and tear" basis, except that employees in the Environmental Compliance Division of Water Resources may receive reimbursement up to twice per year for safety shoes.
ARTICLE 21
GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
Section 1. Discipline
A. All employees are subject to the Rules and Regulations of the Personnel Management System except where this agreement differs; in those cases, the agreement governs. Employees are specifically subject to the Personnel Management System Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Measures which the City agrees not to change without first giving the Union President written notice and/or bargain the impact of said change and provide input for the City's consideration.
B. In imposing progressive discipline on a current charge, the supervisor will not take into consideration any prior infractions of the City or departmental rules and regulations which occurred more than eighteen (18) months previously. In a situation where an incident occurred longer than eighteen months ago but has just become known by supervision, disciplinary action may be pursued if the incident involved the commission by the employee of a Group III level offense. An employee's entire personnel file may be considered in cases involving termination.
Section 2.
General
A. The purpose of this Article is to establish a process for the fair, expeditious, and orderly adjustment of grievances between the City and an employee or group of employees. Only disputes involving the interpretation or application of this labor agreement shall be grieved using this negotiated process. Other disputes involving disciplinary action may be grieved either through this negotiated procedure or the grievance procedure described in the Personnel Management System Rules and Regulations, but not both. Part-time employees who are represented by this Union may, after the first six months of initial employment, grieve non-disciplinary issues only.

Page 30 of 41
43c7afc2.CMC
1/13/06 1:47 PM
The Union shall be ineligible to file a general or class action grievance on matters that have already been filed by individual employees with or without the assistance of the Union.
B.	An employee covered by this agreement shall have the right to be represented or refrain from exercising the right to be represented in the determination of grievances arising under the terms and conditions of employment covered by this agreement. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent any employee from presenting at any time his own grievances, which allege violation of a specific Article and Section of this agreement, and having such grievances adjusted without the intervention or assistance of a Union representative. Adjustment of grievances shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this labor agreement.
When presenting his own grievance, an employee shall bear the full costs of time lost from work for an arbitration hearing, expense of his own counsel, preparation, presentation and the fees, services or other costs of an arbitrator, costs of transcripts, meeting/hearing room or other facility or any other appeal.
C.	Normally grievances are filed at the first step in either the City or negotiated procedure; however, in disciplinary appeals concerning an involuntary demotion not due to layoff, dismissal or suspension in excess of eighty (80) consecutive work hours, an employee may file at Step 2 of the negotiated procedure or with the City's Civil Service Board in accordance with the procedures described in the Personnel Management System Rules and Regulations.
D.	A grievance may be submitted by the Union, as the exclusive representative of employees covered by this agreement, as a general or class grievance. A Union general or class grievance shall be initially submitted at Step 2 within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of occurrence. A grievance regarding the concerns of one employee or disciplinary action involving one employee will not be considered a class grievance. Any Employer grievance will be filed with the Union President at Step 2.
E.	A grievance not submitted within the time limits as prescribed for every step shall be considered untimely and deemed null and void. A grievance not appealed to the next step within the time limits established by this grievance procedure shall be considered settled on the basis of the last answer provided by Management. A grievance not answered within the time limits prescribed for the appropriate Management representative at each step shall entitle the employee or the Union to advance the grievance to the next step. The time limits prescribed herein may be extended for good and sufficient reason by mutual agreement of the Union and Management. If the time limits are extended, the appropriate Management representative and the Union representative and/or grievant will be so advised.
F.	The requirements in Steps 1 and 2 for written grievances and answers shall not preclude the aggrieved employee, the Union, and appropriate Management representatives from orally discussing and resolving the grievance. Oral discussions up through Step 2 shall not cause the aggrieved employee and the Union steward to suffer any loss of straight time pay and shall normally be held during regular working hours.
G.	In advancing grievances through Step 2, the employee and/or the Union representative may call a reasonable number of witnesses to offer testimony from direct knowledge only. Employees shall suffer no loss of pay while serving as witnesses. No loss of pay means that the employee will be paid as if he were at work for his normal schedule of hours. For example, if a grievance hearing begins at 3:00 p.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m., and the employee's normal schedule is 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. with one half hour for lunch, the employee will receive eight hours of pay for the day. The same concept applies for the Union representative who will be coded as being on leave as shown on the time out slip contained in Article 5 of this labor agreement. They shall be excused to testify during working hours provided such absence from their places of work in no way interrupts, delays, or otherwise interferes with proper and effective service to the community.
If a grievance is pursued beyond the Civil Service Board or Step 2, each side shall be responsible for any expenses incurred.
H.	The Union steward shall be allowed reasonable time off without loss of pay during his regularly scheduled work hours in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 for investigating, presenting, and appealing grievances up to and including Step 2 of this procedure. The pay status of Union officers investigating or presenting grievances will be as shown in Article 5 (See the Time Out Slip). The performance of this function by the Union steward or officer shall in no way interrupt the normal functioning of the department. The Employer and the Union agree that maintenance of superior service and adherence to schedules are compelling commitments which may at times create delays and necessitate postponements. The Union agrees to guard against the use of excessive time for grievance activities which are authorized by this Article.
I.	Stewards or Union officers shall provide advance notice to supervision to allow planning arrangements to enable the steward or Union officer time off for grievance investigative activity.
Prior to leaving their assigned work site to conduct grievance investigative activities, stewards and officers shall obtain written permission from their immediate supervisor utilizing the Time Out Slip provided by management. The steward or Union officer will contact the supervisor of the employee to be visited prior to leaving his own work site to ensure that the employee is available and determine a convenient meeting time. In the event the employee's supervisor denies permission to contact the employee at that time, the supervisor shall explain the reason for the denial and advise him as to when he can
http://webmail.stpete.org/servlet/webacc/rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc/GWAP/AREF/1?action=Attachment.View&Item.Attachment.id=1&User.context=rv3ts2Wecfv9ke6Duc&Item.drn=53627z2z0&Item.Child.id=
Page 31 of 41
43c7afc2.CMC
1/13/06 1:47 PM
reasonably expect to meet with the employee. At the request of the Union representative, the reason for denial shall be put in writing and sent to the appropriate Union steward or officer. When the steward or Union officer arrives and the supervisor summons the employee in response to the request, the supervisor will designate an area for conducting the meeting. Upon returning to his work site, the steward or Union officer will notify his supervisor of his return and turn in his completed Time Out Slip.
J.	For an employee or the Union submitting an initial or class grievance and appealing the grievance up through the various steps, the time limits described in this Article shall be the work days of Monday through Friday, excluding days observed as holidays.
K.	Employees will follow all written and verbal directives, even if such directives are allegedly in conflict with the provisions of this agreement. Compliance with such directives will not in any way prejudice the employee's right to file a grievance within the time limits contained herein nor shall compliance affect the ultimate resolution of the grievance. No employee or group of employees may refuse to follow directions pending the outcome of a grievance.
Section 3. Grievance Procedure
(Application or interpretation of this Labor Agreement; see also Section 2.C. of this
Article.)

STEP 2 If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the aggrieved employee may submit a written appeal to the Labor Relations Office within ten (10) working days after the Department Director's or his designee's written answer. The Labor Relations Manager or his designee shall meet with the aggrieved employee, departmental management, and Union representatives, if applicable, within ten (10) working days of receipt of the written appeal to discuss and seek a resolution of the grievance. Within ten (10) working days after this meeting, the Labor Relations Manager or his designee shall give his written recommendation to the grievant and a copy to the Union representative, if applicable. A grievance response postmarked within the ten (10) day time period shall constitute a timely response.

Section 4.
Arbitration Referral
A.	If the employee or class grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the aggrieved employee or the Union may, within ten (10) working days after receipt of the Step 2 written response, submit a request for arbitration to the Labor Relations Office.
B.	In general grievances, either the Union or the Employer may request to take the grievance to arbitration.
C.	Within ten (10) work days after the date of receipt of the arbitration request, the aggrieved employee and/or the Union representative, if applicable, and the Employer may meet for the purpose of preparing a joint arbitration agreement whereby the parties will attempt to define the issue or issues to be submitted to the arbitrator and jointly select an arbitrator.
D.	If the parties fail to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within ten (10) work days after the date of receipt of the arbitration request, a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals shall be jointly requested from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). The party requesting the list shall be responsible for whatever fee may be charged. Should the parties determine that the issue in dispute requires an arbitrator with special expertise, it shall be indicated in the request. Within ten (10) work days after receipt of the list, the parties shall meet and alternately cross out names on the list, and the remaining name shall be the arbitrator. If, for a Union or employee initiated Arbitration, the Union or employee fails to appear to strike names with the Employer within twenty-one (21) calendar days from receipt of the list, the request for arbitration will be deemed to be withdrawn. A coin shall be tossed to determine who shall cross out first. If the selected arbitrator is not available within sixty (60) days, another list may be requested by the moving party and the above described procedures will be followed for selection from the list. Upon selection of the arbitrator, the parties shall jointly notify the Office of Arbitration Service (FMCS) of the selection.
If the grievant is not represented by the Union, the list of arbitrators shall be requested from the American Arbitration Association with the moving party paying whatever fees may be charged. Once a list has been obtained, the procedures detailed above shall be used for selecting an arbitrator.
E.	The date, time, and place of the hearing shall be established by consultation between the arbitrator and the parties concerned. The hearing on the grievance shall be informal and the rules of evidence shall not apply; however, to assure an orderly hearing, the rules of judicial procedure should be followed as closely as possible.
F.	The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, modify or alter the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in arriving at a decision of the issue or issues presented, and shall confine his decision solely to the interpretation or application of this agreement. The arbitrator shall not have authority to determine any other issues not submitted to him.
G.	The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the aggrieved employee or the Union and the Employer.
H.	The arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be borne by the losing party. In the event of a compromise or split award where the arbitrator does not fully uphold the position of either party, the arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be borne equally by the parties to the arbitration.
The expenses in connection with attendance of participants and witnesses for either side shall be paid by the party requesting and producing such participants and witnesses.
I.	The arbitrator shall be requested to render his decision as soon as possible, but in any event, no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the hearing.
J.	In case of a grievance involving any continuing or other money claim against the Employer, no award shall be made by the arbitrator which shall allow any alleged accruals for more than one pay period prior to the date when such grievance shall have been submitted in writing.
K.	Upon receipt of the arbitrator's award, corrective action, if any, will be implemented as soon as possible, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the arbitrator's award.
L.	Either party to this agreement desiring transcripts of the arbitration hearing shall be responsible for the cost of such transcripts, if available.

ARTICLE 23
DRUG FREE WORKPLACE
Section 1.	The City and Union agree that providing a drug-free work place is not only desirable from the perspective of the Employer, but also from the perspective of the employees and citizens of St. Petersburg. Both the Employer and employees are interested in a safe and efficient work force which provides the citizens with the best service possible. The policies and procedures contained in this Article are for the purpose of achieving those goals.
Section 2.	Any employee covered by this bargaining unit will be subject to competent medical examination if there is reasonable suspicion on the part of the employee's immediate supervisor and the Department Director, or his designee, that the employee is using or under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or other controlled substances when taken without a prescription or without being under the care of a physician, while on duty.
"Reasonable suspicion" means observable signs that indicate to a reasonable person that an individual is using or under the influence of illegal or controlled substances or alcohol. Examples of observable signs are bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils, slurred speech, lack of coordination, the smell

of alcohol about a person, radical mood shifts, possession of drug paraphernalia, and related behavioral patterns. In addition to the physical signs, a supervisor may observe performance problems as well. Anonymous phone calls will not constitute reasonable suspicion. Random testing is to be strictly prohibited under the terms of this Article except that any employee of this unit who is required to have a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) as a condition of employment, shall be subject to random, post-accident, return to work and follow-up alcohol/controlled substance testing under the applicable provisions of the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act as amended and mandated by federal law. Also, unannounced testing will be permitted as detailed in Section 5.
Section 3.	The procedure for drug testing will include the following:
A.	A urine sample will be taken at a medical facility licensed by the State of Florida. The sample will be sealed, and chain of custody procedures followed in transporting the sample to the testing facility. The testing will be done at the City's expense and will be conducted by a laboratory licensed by the State of Florida. The initial screening test will be the EMIT test. In the event that the first test is positive (indicates the presence of a drug), a Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry test using the initial sample will be conducted to ensure accurate results.
B.	An employee who is tested on a reasonable suspicion basis will be placed on an administrative leave-with-pay status pending the outcome of the test(s).
C.	If the first test result is negative, a second test will not be conducted and the employee will be returned to work. If the first test is positive and the second test is negative, the employee will be returned to work. In the event either the first or second test is negative, no disciplinary action related to drug use will be taken, and no record will be placed in an employee's file that the drug testing occurred.
D.	When an employee is suspected of using or being under the influence of drugs, as opposed to alcohol, a test will be conducted for the presence of drugs only.
Section 4.	Employees suspected of using or being under the influence of alcohol will be subject to undergoing a breathalyser examination only. This test will be administered by qualified Police Department personnel.
Section 5.	An initial probationary employee who admits to illegal drug use or tests positive may be terminated at the discretion of the Department Director or designee and no appeal shall be permitted. A classified employee who informs the Director or designee that he will seek assistance for drug/alcohol use or abuse either voluntarily or prior to reasonable suspicion testing will not be disciplined for being under the influence while on duty. Successful completion of an approved rehabilitation program shall result in no disciplinary action against the employee for the first offense only. The City retains the right to discipline employees for other serious offenses that have been committed or for the results of the drug test. The City will not pursue criminal prosecution as a routine part of its substance testing procedures. In addition, the employee who admits prior to testing that he has a drug problem shall be subject for one year from the declaration of a problem to unannounced drug testing.
In the event the Employee Assistance Program is no longer available, the employee must seek assistance through the services of his personal physician or any licensed medical facility or agency established to provide evaluation and rehabilitation to individuals with substance usage problems. The rest of this section will continue to be applicable.
Section 6.	In recognition of the importance of having a drug free workforce worthy of the respect and trust of the public, the following shall be the policy for employees who are guilty of misconduct related to the use, possession, or sale of drugs:
A.	Employees who sell illegal drugs or controlled substances, either on or off duty, shall be terminated from employment.
B.	Employees who are in possession of or using illegal substances or are consuming alcohol while on duty, including meal and rest periods, shall be terminated from employment in accordance with the City's Code of Conduct, (Group III offense), unless the Department Director can document mitigating circumstances and obtain the approval of the Human Resources Director not to terminate.
C.	With the exception of Police Department employees covered in paragraph F. of this section, all other employees who are under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol while on duty shall be disciplined in accordance with the City's Code of Conduct, (Group II offense), although other misconduct occurring at the same time may result in more severe discipline, depending upon the nature of the misconduct. (An exception to discipline for being under the influence on duty is contained in Section 5.)
D.	Employees who are in possession of illegal substances or drug paraphernalia while off-duty and said possession constitutes a felony, shall be terminated from employment.
Employees who are in possession of illegal substances or drug paraphernalia while off-duty, and said possession constitutes a misdemeanor shall be disciplined (guideline: Group II offense) for the first offense and terminated for the second offense, unless a nexus exists between the employee's position and the drug possession, in which case the employee shall be terminated for the first offense.
E.	The policy contained in the City's Rules and Regulations regarding the procedures to be followed in the event an employee loses his driver's license shall apply. Failure to report the revocation or suspension of a driver's license by employees required to drive while on duty shall result in discipline (Guideline: (Group II offense) for the first offense and termination for the second offense.)

F.	Employees covered by this agreement who are employed in the Police Department are required to conform to the standards of that department due to the sensitive nature and potential liability incurred by employees' use of any controlled substance on or off duty, or being under the influence of alcohol while on duty. Consequently, these employees who are under the influence of illegal substances or alcohol while on duty may be terminated on the first offense. Likewise, these employees who are in possession of illegal substances or drug paraphernalia while off duty, even if said possession constitutes a misdemeanor, shall be terminated.
Section 7.	An employee who refuses to be tested when so ordered is guilty of insubordination, a Group III offense, and shall be terminated.
Section 8.	At the time of implementation of this contract, all employees shall be put on notice that the City is committed to employing a drug-free work force. Said notice will also include encouragement for employees who may have a substance use or abuse problem to seek professional assistance on a confidential basis from the City's Employee Assistance Program or a source of their own choosing. The penalties for both on or off-duty use, possession, or sale of illegal substances, controlled substances, or alcohol contained in this Article shall also be communicated to employees.
Section 9.	When an employee requests Union assistance, the City agrees to make a reasonable effort to contact a Union steward or officer. In no instance will the City delay the substance test for more than one-half hour, while attempting to contact a Union official.
Section 10.	In the event of invalidation of this Article, or Section of this Article, both the Employer and Local 1220 agree to meet within thirty (30) days of such determination for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for said Article or Section.
ARTICLE 24

Section 6. On-Duty Injuries and Benefits
A. General Provisions
1.	An injury shall be determined to have been incurred while on duty only if such injury is a compensable injury under the Florida Workers' Compensation Law. Employees who are incapacitated due to injury while on duty shall be entitled to benefits as specified under the Workers' Compensation Law for the State of Florida.
2.	Full-time employees when absent from work due to an on-duty injury and ineligible for on-duty injury benefits may elect to utilize extended illness leave first and then annual leave accrued to make up the difference between Workers' Compensation payments and their basic take home pay. (See B.3 for the definition of basic take home pay.)
3.	While absent from duty due to a work-related injury and receiving Workers' Compensation benefits, the extended illness leave and annual leave accruals shall continue up to a maximum of twelve (12) continuous months for employees eligible to receive these benefits.
4.	In the event a full-time employee uses all of his extended illness leave and annual leave accruals as per Section 6.A.2. of this Article, the Department shall place the employee on a medical leave without pay status. Such medical leave of absence shall be for a maximum of twelve (12) months from the first day of disability.
5.	Extensions for a Workers' Compensation leave of absence beyond twelve (12) consecutive months may be granted under special circumstances upon approval by the appropriate Department Director and the Human Resources Director.
6.	The restoration of pension credits when an employee returns to work from a Workers' Compensation leave shall be governed by the rules of the Pension Plan, as administered by the Board of Trustees through the City Benefits Office.
7.	An employee who is able to work a light duty job as determined by the attending physician may decline the offer of light duty work if the injury is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Should an employee choose not to work light duty, his workers' compensation salary replacement benefit would cease, although the employee could use accrued annual and/or extended illness leave, if eligible.
B.	On-Duty Injury Benefit
1.	The Employer agrees to compensate full-time employees covered by this agreement for on-duty injuries sustained by an employee while acting within the scope of their employment and not as a result of the employee's negligence as determined by the appropriate Department Director. Compensation shall be paid as a result of a work-related injury to an employee according to the provisions of this Article for the purpose of supplementing the wage benefit provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law of the State of Florida.
2.	On-duty injury pay shall be paid starting with the employee's first scheduled work shift following the date of injury. The length of disability shall be determined by the Employer's physician in accordance with the Workers' Compensation Law.
3.	The amount of on-duty injury pay shall be the amount of the employee's basic salary up to the time that Workers' Compensation wage benefits begin. When Workers' Compensation wage benefits begin, the on-duty injury pay shall be the difference between the Workers' Compensation wage benefits and the employee's current basic take home pay.
Basic take home pay is defined as basic salary after it has been reduced by normal federal withholding taxes (Social Security and income tax). Basic salary is the employee's straight time hourly rate times his basic work week hours (normally 40 for most full-time employees covered by this Labor Agreement).
4.	In the event the disability extends beyond twenty-one (21) calendar days, the amount of on-duty injury pay paid by the Employer for the first seven (7) days shall be adjusted to equal the employee's basic salary, less the Workers' Compensation wage benefits payments.
5.	The maximum for this on-duty injury pay shall be twelve (12) calendar weeks from the first scheduled work shift following the date of the injury. Payments made by the Employer during this period shall not be charged against the employees' accumulated extended illness leave or annual leave.

6.	An employee granted this on-duty injury benefit shall be required to comply with the extended illness leave provisions of this labor agreement as pertains to substantiation of medical conditions and the performance of light duty as applicable. An employee who is released by his attending physician for light duty work who chooses not to work light duty will no longer be eligible for on-duty injury pay.
7.	In the event that the disability extends beyond twelve 12) calendar weeks, the appropriate Department Director may request a Workers' Compensation Supplemental Committee meeting. Upon approval of this Committee, an extension may be granted but will in no case be approved beyond a maximum of twelve (12) months from the first scheduled work shift following the date of the injury. Until such time as the Committee meets, or if the extension is not approved by the Committee, the employee shall be allowed to utilize accumulated extended illness leave or annual leave to make up the difference between Workers' Compensation payments and basic salary
Section 7.	Group Insurance
A.	The City agrees to provide employees covered by this agreement the opportunity to participate in a City group health insurance program, subject to the eligibility criteria established by the provider(s) selected by the City.
B.	The City reserves the right to change carriers if and when deemed appropriate and to determine the plans offered. The parties agree that the City may, at its option, request a consultation of this Section of this Article of the contract in order to consult over the proposed changes to group health insurance coverage as currently specified in paragraphs E through K of this Section. If the parties agree to changes in one or more of those paragraphs, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will be executed between the parties. The provisions of the MOU may alter and/or replace the language currently contained in each paragraph and will be effective for the term of this agreement. Should the City choose to exercise the option to request a consultation with the Union regarding the provisions of this Section as noted above, the City will notify the Union in writing.
The City further reserves the right to self-administer group health insurance claims if and when deemed appropriate.
C.	The City agrees to pay 75% of the premium cost for employee participation in the City group health insurance program. If the employee elects any form of dependent coverage, the City will pay 75% of the total premium for the employee and dependents. The rates paid by both the City and the employee shall be adjusted whenever increases become effective as the City is notified by the provider.
D.	The City recognizes the importance of sharing information regarding the health insurance market and obtaining information from employees or their representatives as to needs and preferences. The City will establish insurance advisory groups, one of which will be composed of union representatives from the City's bargaining units. Quarterly meetings will be scheduled to provide up to date insurance-related information from the City's Benefits Office and discuss issues related to new plans, carrier issues, and market forces.
Information received from the advisory groups will be considered by the City in making decisions regarding carriers and plans.
E.	The following provisions within the current City group health insurance program shall not be changed during the term of this agreement without negotiation with the NCF&O/ASEU, Local 1220:
1.	lifetime maximum benefit - $1,000,000
2.	annual deductible - $200
3.	waiver of co-insurance level - $4,000
F.	It is agreed that the City group health insurance program will incorporate a cost-control mechanism commonly known as Utilization Review. In order for Utilization Review to effectively control costs on behalf of both the employee and the City, an additional deductible of $200 will be charged on a per-admission basis for all hospitalizations; this additional deductible shall be waived, however, in those cases where the employee advises the provider via toll-free number of a pending hospitalization at least five (5) days prior to such hospitalization taking place. This additional deductible shall further be waived in the event of urgent and/or emergency hospital admission, as documented by the attending physician, provided that notice of such hospitalization is provided to the provider within twenty-four (24) hours of the admission taking place.
G.	It is agreed that the City group health insurance program shall pay hospital room and board charges on the basis of the respective institution's standard semi-private room rate.
H.	The fee schedule and benefit program to be offered through an HMO provider shall be as determined and published by the respective HMO. The City has no involvement with, nor any control over, any fee schedule or benefit program provided by an HMO. All questions or concerns related to fees, benefits, service delivery, or other subjects shall be resolved between the employee-member and the respective HMO, without involvement on the part of the City.
I.	The City agrees to share the premium expense on the same basis for employee participation in

J.	Those individuals participating in City coverage who are covered by this agreement but who subsequently retire shall be offered the option at the time of retirement of selecting coverage with a lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000 or the lifetime maximum benefit offered to current employees. The City will pay 75% of the cost of the coverage with a lifetime maximum benefit of $50,000 or the same dollar amount towards coverage with the higher lifetime maximum benefit. The rates paid by both the City and the employee shall be adjusted whenever increases become effective as the City is notified by the provider.
K.	Those individuals participating in HMO coverage who are covered by this agreement but who subsequently retire shall be eligible for continued coverage as determined by the guidelines established by the applicable HMO.
L.	The City shall provide, at no cost to the employee $10,000 life insurance with the option of purchasing additional life insurance based upon annual salary currently as shown by the following chart:
