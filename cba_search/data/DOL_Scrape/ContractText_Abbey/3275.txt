Section 4.
General increases shall apply to the titles and on the effective dates indicated in this Article. When an employee has been promoted or otherwise advanced to a title on the same date as a general increase, the employee shall be paid the general increase applicable to his or her former title, not that of the new title, subject, however, to the range and advancement increases of the new title.

ARTICLE V - PRODUCTIVITY, PERFORMANCE, TRAINING AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES
Introduction
Delivery of University services in the most efficient, effective and courteous manner is of paramount importance to the University and the Union. Achievement of this goal is recognized to be a mutual obligation of both parties within their respective roles and responsibilities. To achieve and maintain a high level of effectiveness, the parties hereby agree to the following terms:
Section 1.	Performance Levels
(a)	The Union recognizes the University's right under Article 14 of the New York State Civil Service Law and Article 125 of the New York State Education Law to establish and/or revise performance standards of norms notwithstanding the existence of prior performance levels, norms or standards. Such standards, developed by usual work measurement procedures may be used to determine acceptable performance levels, prepare work schedules and to measure the performance of each employee or group of employees. Notwithstanding the above, questions concerning the practical impact that decisions on the above matters have on employees are within the scope of collective bargaining. The University will give the Union prior notice of the establishment and/or revision of performance standards or norms hereunder.
(b)	Employees who work at less than acceptable levels of performance may be subject to disciplinary measures in accordance with Article XXV of this Agreement.
Section 2.	Supervisory Responsibility
(a)	The Union recognizes the University's right under Article 14 of the New York State Civil Service Law and Article 125 of the New York State Education Law to establish and/or revise standards for supervisory responsibility, in achieving and maintaining performance levels of supervised employees, for employees in supervisory positions listed in Article I, Section 1 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, questions concerning the practical impact that decisions on the above matters have on employees shall be within the scope of collective bargaining. The Employer will give the Union prior notice of the establishment and/or revision of standards for supervisory responsibility hereunder.
(b)	Employees who fail to meet such standards may be subject to disciplinary measures in accordance with Article XXV of this Agreement.
Section 3.	Training for Improved Effectiveness and Efficiency
The parties agree to cooperate in the development and implementation of a training program to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of employees and enhance their
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 28
job satisfaction with particular emphasis on the upgrading of work skills, and also including:
a.	Preparation for advancement and upgrading;
b.	Supervisory responsibilities and techniques;
c.	High School equivalency training.
A maximum of twenty (20) hours per year of training in an approved training course may be required of each employee by the University. One-half of any required time shall be during working hours and one-half outside of working hours on the employee's own time. Approved courses shall be those conducted by an Education Fund of a respective Union or those conducted by the University for which the employee is eligible.
Training fund contributions provided in Article III of this Agreement shall be utilized by any respective Union training funds to assist in achieving the above goals for employees covered by such funds.
Failure to complete a required training course without just cause may be deemed a failure to meet performance standards for the purpose of Section 1 of this Article.
Section 4.	Orientation and Training
The parties recognize the University's right to give any permanent employee appointed or assigned to new duties, consistent with his or her job specifications, orientation and training during working hours as to the duties and responsibilities of his or her new position or assignment.
Section 5.	Educational Opportunities
Employees shall be exempted from the payment of tuition fees for courses offered at colleges of The City University, as defined in Article I, pursuant to the following conditions;
(a)	Each employee, to qualify for tuition fee exemption, shall:
1.	be a full-time active employee, and
2.	have served full time for at least twelve months prior to the first day of classes, and
3.	meet the academic requirements for the course. (It is not necessary for the employee to be a candidate for a degree; the employee may be a non-degree student).
(b)	Tuition fee exemption shall be offered for courses which are:
1.	in an associate degree program,
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 29
2.	in a baccalaureate degree program.
(c)	Exemption from payment of tuition fees shall not apply to adult education courses or to other courses supported solely by fees except as provided herein.
(d)	Exemption from payment of tuition fees does not include exemption from payment of non-instructional fees.
(e)	Selected employees who are recommended by their supervisor for training in stenography, typing, and other special work skills, after consultation with the administrative head of the Division in which the course is offered, for example, a Dean of a School, shall be exempt from payment of tuition fees for such courses.
(f)	Other conditions of tuition fee exemption:
1.	There must be an available vacancy in the course at the time of enrollment and such enrollment shall not be used to determine if the course is to be given.
2.	The course shall not be taken during employee's normal working hours.
3.	An employee may choose to take a course during his/her lunch hour which is designated as the period between the hours of 11:45 a.m. and 2:15 p.m., provided that when an employee elects to take a course during the lunch hour he/she will automatically be charged, at the beginning of the semester, at the rate of 15 minutes of annual leave per contact hour. Therefore, on a semester basis, an employee will be charged one-half (%) day of annual leave for each classroom period per week (a classroom period is not to exceed sixty (60) minutes). If at the end of the semester, the employee can reasonably demonstrate to his/her College Human Resources Director that the time charged was not used, all such time will be restored to the employee's annual leave balance.

The date of original appointment shall be the first date of appointment followed by continuous service up to the time of the abolition or reduction of positions.
An employee who had been terminated from a class of positions and who was reappointed in the same class of positions within one year thereafter, shall be deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of this Section.
For the purposes of this Section, neither a period of an authorized leave of absence without pay nor any period during which an employee is suspended from the employee's position pursuant to this Section shall constitute an interruption of continuous service.
Layoff shall be made from among employees in the same class of positions in a layoff unit (retrenchment unit) in the University. The University may determine the layoff unit in accordance with the New York State Civil Service Law and the Rules of the CUNY Civil Service Commission and the Regulations of the Vice Chancellor for Faculty and Staff Relations.
Employees in affected titles in the layoff unit shall be laid off in the following order:
a.	All employees in probationary status in the same title. Among them, layoff shall be in inverse order to date of original appointment.
b.	All employees who have satisfactorily completed their probationary periods in the same title. Among them, layoff shall be in inverse order to date of original appointment.
In the event of layoff the University shall place the names of such employees on a preferred list together with others who have been suspended from the same class of positions. The University shall certify such list for filling vacancies in the same class of positions in the layoff unit from which the suspensions were made.
Persons on the list shall be called for reinstatement in the order of their original date of appointment and, upon the occurrence of a vacancy in an appropriate position in the layoff unit, shall be certified in seniority order.
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 65
The eligibility for reinstatement of a person on such a preferred list shall not continue for a period longer than four years from the date of separation.
Any person suspended or demoted prior to completing his or her probationary term shall be certified for reinstatement only after all other eligibles on the preferred list. A reinstated employee shall be required to complete his or her probationary term upon reinstatement.
Failure or refusal to accept reinstatement from a preferred list to any vacancy in the same class of positions shall be deemed a relinquishment of the employee’s eligibility, and the employee's name shall be removed from the list.
A person reinstated from a preferred list to his or her former class of positions shall receive at least the same salary he or she was receiving at the time of suspension.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, the University may disqualify for reinstatement and remove from a preferred list the name of any eligible who is physically or mentally disabled for the performance of the duties of the position for which such list is established, or who has been guilty of such misconduct as would result in dismissal.
Section 5.	Applicability to Labor and Non-Competitive Class Positions
Pursuant to Section 8 of the Letter of Agreement dated November 21, 1989 and attached hereto as Appendix B, and pursuant to the letter from District Council 37 dated July 10, 1997, attached hereto as Appendix C, qualified employees in the title City Custodial Assistant and CUNY Custodial Assistant shall be subject to applicable provisions of this Article. Moreover, in accordance with appendix B herein, it is the understanding of the parties that the move to amend the title of “City Custodial Assistant,” to “CUNY Custodial Assistant,” whereby the said title was moved from the labor class to the non-competitive class, will not reduce the rights of “City Custodial Assistants” and the current rights will carry over to the new “CUNY Custodial Assistant” title. The layoff procedure and disciplinary rights entitlement currently incorporated in Appendix B will apply to the “CUNY Custodial Assistant” title.
Section 6.	Job Security
University employees represented by District Council 37 shall have job security through September 30, 2002; and University employees represented by IBT Local 237, and SEIU Local 300 shall have job security through June 30, 2002. The job security provisions herein will sunset on the dates specified above as applicable, unless an extension is mutually agreed to by the parties. The job security provisions are as follows:
a.
Except for cause, or due to the movement of the civil service list, no fulltime per annum employee covered under this agreement shall be
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 66
displaced or involuntarily separated from service during the term of this agreement through June 30, 2002, or September 30,2002, as set forth above.
b.	Part-time employees who have two years of continuous service and who work at least 20 hours per week, shall be covered under this job security provision.
c.	The above job security provisions shall not be apply in the event of a declaration of fiscal exigency by the Board of Trustees of The City University of New York.

ARTICLE XVIII - VOLUNTARY INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS
The voluntary transfer of a full-time permanent employee from one College to another shall be accomplished through the following procedure, and pursuant to the provision regarding voluntary Transfer Roster of the CUNY Civil Service Rules and Regulations:
Section 1	Application for Transfer, Establishment of Roster
(a)	Application for transfer shall be made by an employee by completing four copies of the transfer request form and distributing them to:
1.	The University Human Resources Director for Management Services Office of Faculty and Staff Relations 535 East 80th Street
New York, New York 10021, and
2.	The Human Resources Director of the current college, and
3.	The respective Union.
One copy is to be retained by the employee for his or her records.
(b)	The University Office of Human Resource Management Services of the Office of Faculty and Staff Relations shall establish a transfer roster, by title and by level within each title, for each College. Employees shall be listed in order of receipt of the request by the University Director of Human Resource Management Services. In case of ties, the listing shall be made in order of seniority as a permanent employee of the University. All applications for a newly established College, if applicable, received by the University Director of Human Resource Management Services within 30 days of a Board of Trustees resolution to establish that College, shall be considered on the basis of seniority alone.
All applications for transfer by employees in titles not previously covered by a transfer policy, which are received within 60 days of the signing of this Agreement shall be considered on the basis of seniority alone.
(c)	An employee shall be listed on the appropriate title/level roster if:
1.	He or she has served at least two years at his or her present College:
a)	after appointment from a list, or
b)	after a voluntary transfer, or
2.	He or she has served for at least one year after a promotion. Advancement to a higher assignment level, through designation by the College, shall be considered as a promotion for purposes of this Article
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 68
and require an additional year of service unless transfer is at the previously held level, pursuant to Section 2(b). Where advancement to the higher level is mandatory upon the attainment of a specified period of service, such advancement shall not be a bar to immediate placement on the transfer roster; and
3.	There is no disciplinary action pending or in process against him or her and no disciplinary penalties were imposed in the preceding 3 years; and
4.	He or she did not have an unsatisfactory service evaluation during the immediately preceding 2 year period.
(d)	An employee may have on file requests for transfers to up to three Colleges at the same time. Acceptance of a transfer to any one College shall automatically remove an employee from the roster of all other Colleges. Refusal to accept transfer for whatever reason shall automatically remove the employee from that College's roster for eighteen (18) months.
(e)	An employee who has been transferred from one borough to another because of layoff, and has applied for transfer back to his or her previous College, shall be given priority over employees who are at their present location for reasons other than layoff and over employees who are on a preferred list of employees who were laid off from the College to which transfer is sought.
(f)	The existence of a promotion list with the names of three or more candidates in active service in the subordinate title at a College shall bar the use of a transfer roster to that College for that title. A promotion list established by merging college lists on a borough or university basis may be used interchangeably with a transfer roster, at the discretion of the College Director of Human Resources.
The existence of a preferred eligible list shall bar the use of a transfer roster for that title for transfer to the College from which any employee on the preferred eligible list was laid off, except as provided in Section 1, subsection (e).
(g)	The existence of a transfer roster shall not be a bar to the reinstatement of a person at the college from which he or she has resigned. Persons seeking reinstatement at a College other than that of last employment shall not be considered ahead of any employee who was on the transfer roster for that College at the time the reinstatement was requested.
(h)	An employee who is on a transfer roster at the time of taking a leave of absence shall be considered for transfer in roster order provided that the employee is able to return to active employment within the time limitations established in Section 2, subsection (e).
(i)	An employee seeking transfer on the basis of hardship may request consideration of special placement on the transfer roster by letter to the respective
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 69
Union and the University Office of Faculty and Staff Relations. Such a request shall be subject to a joint labor-management review by the University and the respective Union. Decisions in such matters shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 2.	T ransfer
(a)	Except as provided in Section 1, subsections (f) and (g) and except as provided in Section 2, subsections (b), and (g) below, each College shall be required to consider the transfer roster for a title to that college, if any, prior to filling any vacancy in the title. Transfer shall be made of one of the first three employees on the appropriate transfer roster, consistent with the provisions of this Article.
(b)	When a vacancy is to be filled, those employees whose names have been reached shall be interviewed by the Human Resource Director of the receiving College, in order to make the selection pursuant to Section 2 subsection (a), and to establish such "mechanics" as the date of transfer and to help determine a specific assignment. It is understood, however, that the Human Resource Director may not be able to indicate the specific assignment prior to the actual reporting date. An employee shall not be entitled to choose his or her assignment in the receiving College. Intra-college transfers shall continue to have preference in the filling of particular assignments.
(c)	An employee may decline transfer to a particular College for any reason within the 24 hour period immediately following an offer of a position. Such declination shall be in writing, but a telephone refusal or verbal refusal given to his or her College Human Resource Director and to the interviewing Human Resource Director shall be sufficient to permit the interviewing Director to continue to recruit and hire for the position in question.
(d)	Use of the existing transfer roster for a College shall not be mandatory to fill vacancies in positions identified as confidential pursuant to Article I, Section 3 of this Agreement.
(e)	The transferring employee shall start working at the new location no later than 5 weeks from the date of interview unless an unusual situation requires an extension. An extension shall be permitted only with the consent of both Human Resource Directors, the transferring employee and the respective Union.
(f)	A transfer need not be made pursuant to this section if:
1.	the sending College is barred from refilling the position by the State of New York, the City of New York or the University; or
2.	more than 5% of the employees at the sending College in the title involved, or two employees at such College in that title, whichever is greater, have transferred from the College within that fiscal year; or
3.	the employee has received an unsatisfactory service evaluation during
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 70
the two year period immediately preceding the reaching of his or her name on the transfer roster.
4.	If a College has been granted permission to use a civil service list prior to using a CUNY transfer roster, such permission shall be in accordance with Regulation 7.1.4 (b) (Voluntary Transfer Roster) of the Regulations of the Vice Chancellor for Faculty and Staff Relations which permits prior use of a Civil Service list during a period, not to exceed 90 days, following the establishment of the civil service list, when use of such list would enhance implementation of the college's affirmative action plan, or when 10% of the vacancies in a title have been filled through the use of the transfer roster following the establishment of the Civil Service list.
Section 3.	Trial Period
(a)	There shall be a three month trial period for transferred employees.
(b)	At the end of that period (or earlier if acceptable to all parties) the employee may be returned to his or her previous College either at the employee's own initiative or that of the Human Resource Director of the receiving College without penalty. The trial period may be extended for 30 days or more if acceptable to all parties concerned, as enumerated in Section 2, subsection (e).
(c)	If an employee returns, the previous College shall restore the employee to his or her title/level and salary but not necessarily to the shift or assignment held before transfer.
(d)	In any instance where an employee is returned by the receiving College and upon the written request of the employee which is made within 15 work days of notice of the decision to return the employee, the College Human Resource Director shall furnish to the employee a statement of the reason(s) for the return. The employee and/or the respective Union may request a joint Labor-Management review of the decision by the University and the respective Union.
(e)	A decision to return an employee to his or her previous College shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002

ARTICLE XIX - LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
(a)	There shall be a Labor-Management Committee for all employees.
(b)	The Labor-Management Committee shall consider University developments and consider and attempt to resolve University problems related to the terms and conditions of employment and shall, when appropriate, recommend to the Chancellor, through the Vice Chancellor for Faculty and Staff Relations, changes in working conditions of employees.
(c)	The Labor-Management Committee shall meet monthly when practical, except during July and August, or at the call of either the Union members or the University members, at times mutually agreeable to both parties. Minutes of agreements and formal actions shall be kept and copies supplied to all members of the committee.
(d)	For purposes of voting, the Labor-Management Committee shall consist of ten (10) members. The Union shall designate five (5) members and the University shall designate five (5) members. The position of Chairperson of the committee shall alternate between the members designated by the University and the members designated by the Union. The committee shall make any recommendations to the Chancellor, through the Vice Chancellor for Faculty and Staff Relations, in writing.
(e)	Nothing contained herein shall preclude a respective Union from meeting separately with University representatives.

ARTICLE XX - SPECIAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO CUSTODIAL ENTRY LEVEL TITLES
This Article shall be applicable to employees in titles included in the Custodial Entry Level Group in Article III Section 7.
Section 1.	Seniority
(a)	Seniority shall be defined for the purpose of this Article as the status that shall be secured by the length of service at a work location in a specific title subject to the following conditions:
i.	Seniority shall start with the employee's date of appointment or transfer provided he passes all probationary requirements, except in the case of a mandatory transfer within the University where the employee shall carry his seniority from one work location to another.
ii.	All time on payroll shall be included as time served.
iii.	Time served in a provisional capacity in the title Custodial Assistant prior to reclassification to the title City Custodial Assistant shall be counted. Time served in the title City Custodial Assistant prior to reclassification to the title CUNY Custodial Assistant shall be counted.
Time served in a provisional or probationary capacity in a different custodial staff title shall be counted, providing the employee was a permanent or probable permanent employee prior to the date of the provisional promotion or appointment in a higher title.
iv.	A Custodial Assistant, City Custodial Assistant or CUNY Custodial Assistant who was appointed as a Custodial Assistant from a competitive list shall be deemed to have greater seniority than any employee in either title who was not appointed from a Custodial Assistant list.
v.	Except as identified above, time in provisional employment shall not be counted in determining seniority.
(b)	A separate listing for each title and each work location of employees in order of seniority shall be promulgated annually by management. For the purpose of this paragraph, the titles Custodial Assistant, City Custodial Assistant and CUNY Custodial Assistant shall be considered to be the same title. The list shall be posted on the employee's bulletin board and at the same time a copy will be sent to District Council 37. The list shall stand unless a question is submitted to the College Director of Human Resources of the work location within 10 days after the initial posting of the list.
(c)	The seniority provisions discussed herein in Article XX are not applicable to the hourly CUNY Custodial Assistant title. The Colleges, however, may in their sole
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 73
discretion and based on the needs of their respective campus, assign hourly CUNY Custodial Assistant employees to shifts by way of selection in seniority order. Preference in selecting vacation times shall be given to hourly CUNY Custodial Assistant employees with the greatest seniority. The College, however, will determine the appropriate staffing levels at a particular campus and will determine the number of hourly employees who may be on annual leave at any particular period of time.
Section 2.	Shifts
Transfers to shifts within a work location shall be made in order of seniority for personnel as vacancies occur, provided:
a)	the employees' performance and work records are equal, and
b)	there is no "bumping" of an employee already on that job, and
c)	permanent employees shall have priority over probationary employees.
Section 3.	Vacations
Among employees serving in specific titles and assigned to a particular shift, preference in selecting vacation times shall be given to employees with the greatest seniority. The Administrative Superintendent or other authorized Supervisor shall determine the number of employees in each title who may be on annual leave at any particular period of time. Vacations may be scheduled at any time of the year.
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 74
ARTICLE XXI - NONDISCRIMINATION
Section 1.
Neither the University nor the Union shall discriminate with respect to the hours, wages or any terms or conditions of employment of any employee because of sex, sexual orientation, race, marital status, age, creed, religion, national origin, disability not related to essential job activities, color, political belief or membership in, or lawful activity on behalf of the Union or a respective Union. Sexual harassment shall be considered discrimination because of sex.

Section 3.
Except by agreement between the University and a respective Union to the contrary, a grievance alleging a violation of this Article shall not be processed under this Agreement on behalf of any employee who files or prosecutes or permits to be filed or prosecuted on his or her behalf in any court or governmental agency, a claim, complaint or suit, complaining of the action grieved, under applicable federal, state or municipal law or regulation.
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 75
ARTICLE XXII	- MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
All management rights and functions, except those which are clearly and expressly abridged by this Agreement, shall remain vested exclusively in the University. It is expressly recognized, merely by way of illustration and not by way of limitation, that such rights and functions include but are not limited to (1) full and exclusive control of the management of the University, the supervision of all operations, methods, processes, means and personnel by which any and all work shall be performed, the control of the composition, of assignment, direction and determination of the size and type of its work force; (2) the rights to change or introduce new and improved operations, methods, means or facilities; (3) the right to determine the standards to be met by employees covered; (4) the right to hire, establish work shifts, establish job classifications, promote, demote, transfer, and lay off employees; and (5) the right to determine the qualifications of employees, and to discipline employees for cause, and otherwise to maintain a orderly, effective and efficient operation.
Notwithstanding the above, the University shall negotiate with the Union on questions concerning the practical impact that decisions on the above matters have on employees. The terms of this Article shall be subject to applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement.
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 76
ARTICLE XXIII	- NO STRIKE PLEDGE
The University and the Union agree that disputes which may arise between them during the term of this Agreement shall be settled without resort to strike or lockout and that the requirements of the law in this regard shall not be violated.

ARTICLE XXIV	- LEGISLATIVE ACTION

BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 78
ARTICLE XXV	- DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURE
Section 1.	General
(a)	No permanent employee in the bargaining unit who has completed the probationary period and no provisional or non-competitive employee who has earned disciplinary rights in his or her provisional or non-competitive position shall be disciplined except for incompetency or misconduct.
(b)	The forms of discipline shall include, but not be limited to, a written reprimand, a fine not to exceed $200, demotion, suspension not to exceed 60 days without pay, termination.
(c)	The procedures in this Article shall be the exclusive procedures for disciplinary action and resolving disputes relating to such disciplinary action.
(d)	Effective January 1, 1991, for titles represented by District Council 37, and effective November 12, 1992 for titles represented by Local 237, IBT and effective 3 months from such date thereafter as a respective union, other than DC 37, or Local 237, IBT, has become a signatory to the agreement to so extend disciplinary rights, provisional full-time employees who have served at the same college of The City University of New York (CUNY) continuously for two years in the same or similar titles listed in Article I, Section 1 of this Agreement, or in titles which are in a related occupational group, shall be subject to the procedures of this Article. In determining if a provisional employee has completed two years of continuous service, the following additional terms shall apply:
Any period off payroll of more than 31 days shall break continuous service. No periods off payroll shall count towards the two-year eligibility. Time on an official leave without pay or time off payroll for fewer than 31 days shall not count towards the two year requirement, but will not break continuous service. An employee appointed to and serving in a different title in a different occupational group shall not be entitled to the disciplinary rights set forth herein by virtue of service in a prior title. Provisional rights acquired in another civil service jurisdiction shall not apply to an employee hired by The City University of New York. Disciplinary rights can only be obtained in a subsequent permanent appointment after serving the established probationary period.
(e)	Extension of disciplinary rights to certain provisional or non-competitive employees shall not diminish the right of a College to reassign employees or terminate the employment of a provisional or non-competitive employee for reasons other than incompetency or misconduct.
(f)	These procedures supersede any preexisting procedures and forums.
(g)	For the purpose of this Article, the term "Union" shall mean respective Union.
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 79
Section 2.	Initiating a Disciplinary Action
Other than in exceptional situations requiring immediate action, such as, but not necessarily limited to, those involving potential injury to persons or property or unreasonable disruption of University operations, if a College has cause to believe an incident has occurred or circumstances may exist warranting disciplinary action, it shall investigate such incident or circumstances prior to taking disciplinary action. As part of the investigation, the College shall make reasonable efforts to interview any employee(s) who may be subject to disciplinary action. In those exceptional situations requiring immediate action, as described above, an employee may be immediately suspended. Such a suspension without pay pending a decision of the hearing officer may not exceed 30 days except where the charges relate to the alleged commission of a criminal offense relating to employment, in which case the suspension may continue until completion of the Criminal Court procedures, and in which case the suspension will be reviewed periodically at the request of the employee and/or the Union.
An employee who is being interrogated concerning an incident or action which may subject him or her to disciplinary action shall be notified of his or her right to have a Union representative present upon request. This provision shall be applicable to interrogation before, during, or after filing a charge against an employee. The provisions of this Section shall not be interpreted to prevent a supervisor from questioning an employee in relation to his or her employment nor to preclude the questioning of an employee during or immediately following an incident.
Section 3.	Disciplinary Charges
Following an investigation, if it is necessary in the judgment of the College to charge an individual employee with incompetency or misconduct, the College official vested with such responsibility shall furnish the employee with a written statement of the charges, specifications and possible penalties. An informational copy shall also be sent to the Union. The statement shall be hand-delivered to the employee or sent by "Certified Mail -- Return Receipt Requested" to the employee's last address on file at the College. The statement shall indicate the date, time and place, within ten days, for the first step hearing at the College. The statement shall also indicate the employee's right to representation at such hearing.
A.	First Step
The hearing officer shall issue a written decision with regard to the charges and shall state the disciplinary penalty, if any, within ten working days of the conclusion of the hearing, or record closed by the Hearing Officer, whichever is applicable. The College may implement a penalty, other than termination, upon issuance of the Step I decision.
The decision shall inform the Respondent employee that he or she may accept the penalty or appeal to the Chancellor’s Designee for a Step II hearing within 10 calendar days of the receipt of the Step I decision. Unreturned mail shall be
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 80
presumed to have been received on the date following transmittal. The appeal must state what choice the employee has made between the two final review options: a) review by an arbitrator, or b) review by the City University Civil Service Commission. Choice of arbitration as a final step may be made only with the concurrence of the Union.
In the event such a request is not filed within the time limit, the Step I decision shall be deemed to have been accepted and except as otherwise provided in Section 4 of this Article, no issue stemming from or relating to the disciplinary action shall be subject to any further appeal.
A Step I decision to terminate employment shall be effective upon failure to appeal to Step II.
B.	Second Step
A Step II hearing shall be scheduled within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of a request by the Chancellor's Designee. A written decision shall be delivered to the Union and the Respondent employee within fourteen working days from the conclusion of the Step II hearing, or record closed by the Hearing Officer, whichever is applicable.
A Step II decision to terminate employment shall be effective upon issuance of the Step II decision by the Chancellor's Designee.
Within thirty (30) working days of receipt of the Chancellor's Designee's written decision at Step II, the Union may make a written request for arbitration, or within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of the Chancellor's Designee's written decision at Step II, the Union may make a written request for review by the CUNY Civil Service Commission, or the employee may make a written request for review by the CUNY Civil Service Commission, in accordance with the choice indicated when the appeal of the First Step decision was filed. Unreturned mail shall be presumed to have been received on the date following transmittal.
Any disciplinary decision at or above step two and any appeal of a disciplinary decision may be resolved by settlement agreement only if agreed to in writing by The University Office of Faculty and Staff Relations and the employee or an authorized representative of the respective union.
C.	Third Step (Arbitration)
A request for arbitration shall be made to the American Arbitration Association with a copy of such request sent to the Chancellor's designee by Certified mail.
The Association shall designate an arbitrator from a panel agreed to by the parties and shall notify the Union and the Chancellor's designee of the arbitrator named. In cases involving termination of employment, the date of the arbitration shall be within fourteen calendar days of receipt of notification by the arbitrator of his or her
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 81
appointment.
The arbitrator is authorized to make awards as to arbitrability.
All arbitrations shall be based upon the official rules of the American Arbitration Association.
In cases involving termination of employment, the arbitrator shall issue his or her award within 14 calendar days of the termination of the arbitration proceedings.
The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any appropriate tribunal in accordance with Article 75 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. An arbitrator may provide for and direct such relief as the arbitrator deems necessary and proper, subject to the limitations of this Agreement and any applicable limitations of law.
In any arbitration under this Section, the arbitrator may apply either the standard of "preponderance of the evidence" or the standard of "clear and convincing evidence" in determining whether the University has met its burden of proof.
D.	Third Step (Civil Service Commission)
Appeal to the CUNY Civil Service Commission shall be on the basis of the record at Step II and decisions established at Step I and Step II. The employee and/or the Union may state the basis for their appeal in their request or within 15 working days following their request unless otherwise provided by the rules of the commission. A copy of such communication shall be sent to the Chancellor's Designee. The University may respond in writing within 10 additional working days.
The CUNY Civil Service Commission, at its discretion, may consider oral or written arguments based on the record and the Commission, or its designated Hearing Review Officer, shall hear and consider any new evidence not in existence at the time of the Step II hearing which may effect its determination. The Commission may provide for and direct such relief as it deems necessary and proper, subject to the limitations of this Agreement and any applicable limitations of law.
Section 4.	Disciplinary Procedure for Job Abandonment
1.	In addition to the established procedures of this Article XXV as related to absences from work, an employee who is absent without authorization and fails to notify or communicate such absence in the manner prescribed by the College Human Resources Director for a period of ten (10) or more consecutive work days shall be subject to disciplinary action which may result in termination of employment.
2.	Such employee shall be brought up on disciplinary charges of job abandonment prior to the imposition of any disciplinary penalty. Upon filing disciplinary charges for job abandonment, the matter will proceed directly to a Step II hearing before the Chancellor’s Designee. Prior to the Step II hearing, the employee
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 82
and/or union on the employee’s behalf, must indicate in writing to the Chancellor’s Designee what choice has been made between the two final review options: a) review by an arbitrator, or b) review by the CUNY Civil Service Commission. Choice of arbitration as a final Step may be made only with the concurrence of the Union.
3.	Notification of such disciplinary action must be hand delivered to the employee or sent by regular and certified mail to the last address on file in the College Human Resources Office, in accordance with Section 3 of this Article. As is true of all disciplinary hearings, the hearing may be conducted as scheduled even if the employee fails to attend such hearing, provided that the required procedures have been followed to notify said employee of the scheduled date, time and location of the Step II hearing.
4.	In the event the employee fails to appear at the Step II hearing, the decision rendered at Step II shall be final and binding and will not be subject to any further appeal, except for the limitations set forth below. The Hearing Officer shall, however, have the discretion to reopen the Step II hearing in the event of compelling circumstances established by the employee or the union within two (2) weeks of the date of the Step II decision, substantiating with documentary evidence that the subject employee was prevented from attending the Step II hearing and/or from communicating his or her inability to attend based upon his or her incapacitation due to serious mental or physical illness or similar unforeseen circumstances. In the event the Hearing Officer determines not to reopen a Step II hearing, despite the submission of such documentary evidence, the union may appeal the reopening issue to the CUNY Civil Service Commission for final determination. For purposes of said appeal, the only issue before the CUNY Civil Service Commission will be whether the Step II hearing should be reopened. During the pendency of a request to reopen or to appeal said issue, the underlying decision on the merits will remain in full force and effect.

(d)	a claimed improper holding of an open competitive rather than a promotional examination.
For purposes of this Article the term "Union" shall mean "respective Union."
Section 2.	Filing
Grievances may be filed by an employee on his or her own behalf (subject to the provisions of this Article), by the Union on its own behalf or by the Union on behalf of any employee or group of employees. Grievances involving employees in more than one College may be filed by the Union initially at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.

BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 85
Section 3.	The Grievance Steps
Employees may at any time informally discuss with their supervisors a matter which may become a grievance. If the results of such discussions are unsatisfactory, or if such a discussion does not occur, the employee may present the grievance at Step I.
STEP I
The employee and/or the Union shall present the grievance in the form of a memorandum or on a grievance form used by the Union, to the person designated for such purpose by a President no later than 120 days after the date on which the grievance arose. The employee may also request an appointment to discuss the grievance. The person designated by the President to hear grievances shall take any steps necessary to a proper disposition of the grievance and shall issue a decision in writing to the grievant and the Union by the end of the tenth work day following the conclusion of the grievance discussion or record closed by the Hearing Officer, whichever is applicable.
STEP II
An appeal from an unsatisfactory decision at Step I shall be presented in writing to the Chancellor's designated representative who shall not be the same person designated in Step I. The appeal must be made within seven (7) work days of the receipt of the Step I decision and shall include a copy of the Step 1 decision. The Chancellor's designated representative shall meet with the employee and/or the Union for review of the grievance and shall issue a decision in writing by the end of the fourteenth work day following the date on which the grievance discussion was concluded, or record closed by the Hearing Officer, whichever is applicable. The party (union or individual grievant) who files at the second step shall be deemed the primary representative of the grievance for purposes of such Step II procedural matters, namely, correspondence, scheduling, settlement discussions, etc.
STEP III
An appeal from an unsatisfactory decision at Step II shall be brought solely by the Union for impartial arbitration, within thirty (30) work days of receipt of the Step II decision or within thirty (30) work days of the expiration of the time limit for transmission of the Step II decision, by serving notice to the American Arbitration Association. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the Chancellor's designee by certified mail, return receipt requested. In addition, the University shall have the right to bring directly to arbitration any dispute between the parties concerning any matters defined herein as a "grievance.” The University shall commence such arbitration by submitting a written request therefor to the American Arbitration Association. A copy of such notice shall be sent to the Union by certified mail, return receipt requested. An arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Consolidated Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The costs and fees of such arbitration shall be borne equally by the Union and the University. Consistent
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 86
with Article IX Section 20 of this Agreement, expenses of witnesses shall be the responsibility of the party calling such witnesses. The decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding in accordance with applicable law and the arbitrator shall not add to, subtract from or modify any contract, rule, regulation, written policy or order mentioned in Section I of this Article.
Section 4.
As a condition to the right of the Union to invoke impartial arbitration set forth in this Article, including the arbitration of a grievance involving a claimed improper holding of an open-competitive rather than a promotional examination, the employee or employees and the Union shall be required to file with the Vice Chancellor for Faculty and Staff Relations a written waiver of the right, if any, of the employee or employees and the Union to submit the underlying dispute to any other administrative or judicial tribunal except for the purpose of enforcing the arbitrator's award.
Section 5.
A grievance filed pursuant to this Article may be resolved by settlement agreement only if agreed to in writing by The University Office of Faculty and Staff Relations and an authorized representative of the respective union.
Section 6.
If a determination satisfactory to the Union at any level of the grievance procedure is not implemented within a reasonable time, the Union may re-institute the original grievance at Step II of the grievance procedure; or if a satisfactory Step III determination has not been so implemented, the Union may institute a grievance concerning such failure to implement at Step III of the Grievance Procedure.
Section 7.
If the University exceeds any time limit prescribed at any step in the grievance procedure, and there is no agreement between the parties for a waiver of such time limit, the grievant and/or the Union may invoke the next step of the procedure, except that only the Union may invoke impartial arbitration under Step III.
Section 8.
The University shall notify the Union in writing of all grievances filed by employees, all grievance discussions, and all determinations. The Union shall have the right to have a representative present at any grievance hearing and shall be given fortyeight (48) hours notice of all grievance discussions.
Section 9.
Each of the steps in the grievance procedure, as well as time limits prescribed at
BLUE COLLAR AGREEMENT 2000 - 2002
PAGE 87
each step of this grievance procedure, may be waived by mutual agreement of the parties.
Section 10.
The parties agree that Section 1(c) of the grievance procedure shall be available to any employee who claims to be aggrieved by an alleged assignment of any person in a classified title in the University’s employ, whether within or without this bargaining unit, to duties consistent with the job specification for the title of the grievant but substantially different from the duties stated in the job specification for the title held by such person in University employ. Light duty assignments of permanent classified persons in University employ, within or without such designated unit, who have been certified by the appropriate procedures, shall be excluded from this provision. Such grievance may be taken directly to the third step of the grievance procedure upon the election of the respective Union.

Dear Vice Chancellor Malone:
The Union will not oppose the City University's proposal to amend the current title "City Custodial Assistant" to "CUNY Custodial Assistant" and move it from the labor class to the noncompetitive class in order to allow incumbents to take promotional examinations for Custodial Supervisor.
It is the Union's understanding that this change will not reduce the rights of "City Custodial Assistants" and their current rights will carry over to the new "CUNY Custodial Assistant" title. The layoff procedure and disciplinary rights currently incorporated in Appendix B of the 1990-1995 Blue Collar Contract will apply to the new "CUNY Custodial Assistant" title.
