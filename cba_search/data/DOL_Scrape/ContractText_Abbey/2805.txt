Section 2.	Preventive Vehicle Maintenance Program.
The City shall ensure that all police vehicles assigned to the officers are in safe condition and shall maintain a preventive maintenance program for police vehicles. The Chief shall assign a supervisor to the vehicle maintenance shop for the purpose of inspecting the safety of police vehicles. The Chief may assign either a sworn officer or civilian to this position, except that in the event that a civilian is assigned, there shall be no reduction or loss of sworn positions in the Police Department as a result of the assignment of a civilian. If at the discretion of an officer, an assigned vehicle is not in safe condition, said officer shall notify the supervisor assigned to the vehicle maintenance shop that the vehicle is not in a safe condition. The supervisor assigned to the vehicle maintenance shop shall make the decision as to the safety of the police vehicle. In the event that the supervisor assigned to the vehicle maintenance shop deems the police vehicle to be in a safe condition, and the employee disagrees with the supervisor’s decision, said officer may protest the supervisor’s decision in writing. The supervisor assigned to the vehicle maintenance shop shall acknowledge the officer’s protest in writing and forward all copies to the officer’s division commander for final disposition.
The Vehicle Maintenance Supervisor shall maintain records on the maintenance of all police vehicles. When a vehicle reaches the 30,000 miles odometer reading, a review of the vehicle’s maintenance record will be conducted. If deemed necessary, the Vehicle Maintenance Supervisor may request an exhaustive mechanical evaluation be performed on the vehicle. Any officer may request an exhaustive mechanical evaluation of police vehicle when the vehicle reaches the 30,000-mile mark. This inspection will be accomplished in a timely manner or another vehicle will be provided for the officer.
Marked vehicles having 60,000 miles on their odometers and assigned to the Uniform Division, must be retired from the Uniform Division fleet.

An eligible officer may initially opt for a City-provided, unmarked vehicle (with less than 10,000 miles on its odometer) and/or the allowance as previously noted. During the period of June 1 to July 1 of each calendar year, the officer may elect to change from his car or car allowance. If an eligible officer opts for a vehicle, and the same is unavailable, such officer may draw the $300.00 car allowance until the vehicle is furnished. The use of a City vehicle by an officer may be revoked by the Chief if the individual assigned the vehicle is not insurable per state minimum requirements. Each officer assigned a vehicle shall be required to use the vehicle in a manner consistent with Department policies. Any officer assigned a vehicle shall not be eligible to receive any car allowance, as otherwise provided by the City. The Chief has the sole discretion whether to assign or not assign or to remove a vehicle from any other officer in any rank below Lieutenant. Assignment by the Chief of a vehicle to another officer below the rank of Lieutenant shall not be grounds for filing of a grievance based upon the equal pay standards of Chapter 143 Local Government Code or any provision of this Agreement.
Section 4.	Radios.
The City shall provide to each employee so requesting, one (1) permanently assigned hand-held police radio. A charger will be issued if necessary. These radios will be replaced in accordance with Department policies and regulations. However, in the event the radio needs to be replaced or repaired due to negligence or intentional abuse on the part of the officer to whom the radio is issued, the officer shall be required to reimburse the City for the costs. The cost of said radio shall be, for purposes of the Section, based upon its actual value at the time of loss. Negligence or intentional abuse and the actual value considering replacement costs, depreciation, utility value, and market value of the radio shall be determined by the Labor Relations Committee outlined in Article 9.
Until the City acquires a new radio system, officers residing outside of Bexar County shall not be eligible to request an issued radio. The City shall make available to officers, working approved police functions, a radio. If no radios are available for permanent issuance, the City shall have three hundred and sixty five (365) days to provide the necessary radios to conform to the request.
“Permanently issued or assigned radios” are those issued pursuant to an eligible officer requesting to have one issued to them and does not imply that the officer cannot later turn in their radios.

Vests shall be provided to all new officers prior to the end of their first week as officers. Vests shall be replaced every five (5) years by making a proper request to the Division Commander, or at any time when obvious damage to the vest requires replacement. However, if it is determined by the Labor Relations Committee outlined in Article 9, that the damage done to the vest was caused by neglect or misuse on the part of the officer, then the officer shall pay the actual value considering replacement costs, depreciation, utility value, and market value of the vest as determined by the Labor Relations Committee at the time of the loss. One free fitting per year will be provided by the City. Additional fittings will be paid for by the officer.

A.	The Labor Relations Committee as outlined in Article 9, in addition to its other duties, shall serve as the Equipment Advisory Committee. This committee shall meet for the purpose of reviewing specifications, testing, and making recommendations to the Chief as to the purchase of all police-related equipment. For purposes of this Section, police-related equipment includes, but is not limited to, communications equipment, vehicles, vehicle light bars, weapons, specialized or technical investigative equipment, training aids, and computer-related equipment and materials. Police-related equipment does not include chairs, desks, office supplies, maintenance supplies, or other non-specialized equipment or materials purchased on a Citywide basis for all departments.
B.	When an officer loses and/or damages equipment assigned for purposes of employment the Labor Relations Committee shall cause to be conducted an investigation surrounding the facts causing the loss or damage. Upon completion of its investigation, the committee will make a determination as to the cause of the loss or damage and to what extent the officer is responsible for such loss and/or damage. The committee shall write a report of its findings which shall be forwarded to the Chief. An officer who disagrees with the findings of the committee may appeal the committee’s recommendation to the Chief. The Chief may adopt, in whole or in part, or reject the committee's recommendations. The actions of the Chief in this regard shall not be subject to grievance and arbitration as provided for herein, if the Chief concurs in the recommendation of a majority of the committee or reduces the officer’s responsibility for such loss or damage below the recommendation of the majority of the committee.
Section 8.	Reimbursement Procedures.
A.	Officers may utilize payroll deductions to reimburse the City for lost or damaged equipment. Payroll deductions must be set at fifty dollars ($50.00) per payday unless the officer agrees to higher payments. It shall be the obligation of the officer to coordinate such repayment with the Police Department Accounting Office.
B.	Officers desiring to reimburse the City for lost or damaged equipment outside of payroll deductions may do so as long as such mandatory payments are no less than fifty dollars ($50.00) per pay day. Nothing herein prohibits the officer from agreeing to higher payments. All reimbursements paid outside of payroll deduction are due within five (5) calendar days of the payday.
C.	Regardless of the method of payment, all payments must begin not less than the second pay day after the final ruling by the Chief.

B.	Promotional Text Materials - The City shall limit the promotional material for all ranks to two hundred (200) pages of text except for text taken from the Texas Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedures, the General Manual, and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

An officer may not file any grievance or appeal based on the limitations involving pages of text and words. The City shall attempt to obtain the publisher’s permission to duplicate and distribute to the candidates the study materials without incurring any fee, cost, penalty or liability to the publishers, and if it does obtain this permission, the City will bear the expense of the printing or reproduction of the study materials for distribution to eligible candidates. However, the City will not be required to perform the aforementioned printing, reproduction, and dissemination of the study materials if the permission of the publishers to do so cannot be obtained at any cost, or penalty, or liability to the publishers. Where the City cannot obtain such permission, the City will make arrangements to ensure that all of these study materials (e.g., textbooks) are available at one or more locations within the city for purchase by the candidates. Candidates who purchase study materials and who score seventy percent (70%) or higher on each of the examinations applicable to the promotion sought will be reimbursed for the price of the study materials.
After the Chief has made his selections, the City Human Resources Department will pick up the study materials.

No question will be included in the examination unless it derives its source from the study material.
The date and location that the study materials will be made available for candidates to pick up or the location where the study materials may be purchased will be announced in the Daily Bulletin for five (5) consecutive working days, in accordance with this Section, the study materials shall be either announced as to location for purchase or provided to eligible candidates during a period which is not more than twenty five (25) nor less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the examination.

All of the questions asked on the examination must be prepared and composed in a manner that the grading of all examination papers can be completed immediately after the examination is held. All examination papers shall be graded as they are completed, at the place where the examination is given, and in the presence of any candidates who wish to remain during the grading. Examination grading may be performed within fifty (50) feet of any entrance or exit from the examination room in open view of all candidates. A score of seventy percent (70%) (out of a possible 100%) on each examination applicable to the rank to which the officer seeks promotion shall be considered a minimum passing score.
Each eligible promotional candidate shall have the opportunity to examine test source materials and their own graded examination paper and answers within five (5) working days after the examination. The candidate may see the above material, but may not remove the graded examination paper from the Human Resources Department.
Candidates arriving after the appointed starting time of the examination will not be admitted or allowed to participate in the examination.
All questions formulated by the outside consultant (and their correct answers) shall be derived from the materials selected by the Chief as study materials in accordance with this Section.

Officers appointed to this rank shall be subject to overall City policies and regulations and while appointed to this rank shall not be subject to the provisions of Chapter 143, Local Government Code, or any provision of this Agreement, unless specifically so provided in this Article.
For clarification purposes, effective upon execution of this agreement and effective with the promotion of any officer to the rank of Assistant Chief after October 1, 2002, those officers appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief shall be required as a condition of maintaining the appointed rank to obtain a Master’s Degree from an accredited college or university within twenty four (24) months after being appointed. Effective October 1, 2005, as to officers appointed thereafter only, officers appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief shall be required as a condition of maintaining the appointed rank to obtain a Master’s Degree from an accredited college or university within thirty-six (36) months after being appointed. Assistant Chiefs appointed after October 1, 2002, who have already obtained a Masters Degree prior to being appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief, shall present proof of completion to the Chief of Police within seven calendar days of being appointed to the rank. Assistant Chiefs who have not obtained a Masters Degree must complete and make a passing grade on at least one-half of any Masters Degree requirements they have left to obtain in an approved Masters Degree program every twelve (12) months after being appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief until such time as a Masters Degree is awarded. Effective October 1, 2005, Assistant Chiefs who have not obtained a Masters Degree must complete and make a passing grade on at least one-third of any Masters Degree requirements they have left to obtain in an approved Masters Degree program every twelve (12) months after being appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief until such time as a Masters Degree is awarded. Assistant Chiefs will submit proof of the completion of the required hours to the Chief of Police and the Association on their annual promotion date until such time a Masters Degree is obtained. Assistant Chiefs who fail to complete this requirement within the specified time periods shall be demoted within ten calendar days after verification by the Chief of Police of the Officer’s non-compliance. Officers shall be demoted to their previous civil service rank and seniority. Officers who were grandfathered as Deputy Chief’s in Section 5 shall be additionally grandfathered under this section.
Any officer appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief may be demoted to the civil service rank from which he was promoted at the sole discretion of the Chief of Police without appeal to the Commission and/or Arbitration. Any officer appointed to this rank may, further, voluntarily return to the rank from which he was promoted at any time. Upon demotion or voluntary return to the previously-held rank pursuant hereto, the officer shall receive thereafter the full benefits provided in Chapter 143, Local Government Code, and this Agreement as if he had served in that rank on a continuous basis throughout his tenure as Assistant Chief. An officer appointed to the rank of Assistant Chief may be terminated for cause, provided that such termination shall be subject to appeal in the same manner as applicable to all classified uniformed officers in the Department.
Assistant Chiefs appointed by the Chief of Police pursuant to Article 11, Section 6 of this Agreement, may receive administrative leave for work performed in excess of their regularly scheduled duties. Said leave time may be granted at the discretion of the Chief of Police, subject to the scheduling and manpower contingencies that may arise.
Officers appointed to the Assistant Chief position by the Chief of Police as provided for in Article 11, Section 6, supra, of this Agreement, shall be compensated at an annual salary of not less than eight percent (8%) above the rate of a Deputy Chief’s base pay plus longevity( a 30 year Captains base pay + . 18 times that base pay). The officers so assigned shall be entitled to all benefits as contained in the following specified Articles of this Agreement: Articles 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 9; 10 Section 3; 11 Section 5 and 7; 14 Section 1; 16 Sections 1 and 2; 17; 19; 20 (without premium pay); 21; 22 Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11; 23; 28; 29; 30; 31; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36 Sections 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; and 37.
The City agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Association and its officers, agents, representatives,
21
and officers from any action, at law or in equity, brought by any Assistant Chief or other member(s) of the unit regarding this Section.
Section 7.	Evergreen Limitations.
Effective October 1, 2006, should a new Agreement between the City and the Association not have been reached, and the parties are operating under Article 1 of this Agreement, and should a position in the rank of Assistant Chief or Deputy Chief become vacant, the Chief of Police shall not permanently promote any officer to the rank of Assistant Chief or Deputy Chief until ninety (90) calendar days after a new Agreement between the parties is signed.
It is understood and agreed however, that the Chief of Police may, at his discretion, temporarily appoint or pay higher classification to an eligible officer until such time a new Agreement is finalized and the vacant position permanently filled. Additionally, should such a situation arise as outlined above, no vacant position in the rank of Assistant Chief or Deputy Chief shall revert to any lower position and such position shall remain vacant, unless at the Chief’s discretion temporarily filled or higher classification paid, regardless of any time limitations outlined in this Article or Civil Service Law.
Effective with the date of signing of a new Agreement, the Chief of Police shall have ninety (90) calendar days to fill or abolish the vacant position. Should the Chief of Police choose to abolish the position, the vacated position shall revert to the rank of Captain.
ARTICLE 12 Seniority
Section 1.	Seniority Defined.
Seniority in this Article shall be defined as the length of service by an officer within his civil service classification. All other factors being equal, seniority is the determining factor in the assignment of relief days and vacation days and operates within a section, unit, or detail for purposes of this Article. Assignment of sections or districts shall not be subject to the provisions of this Article, except in Section 6.
Section 2.	Six-Month Requirement.
When an Officer transfers from one section, unit, or detail to another, there shall be no bumping of a less senior officer out of relief days or vacation days to which the less senior officer has been assigned. However, when prime relief days become open, the incoming officer, including officers newly-promoted, may, after serving in the section, unit, or detail for six (6) months, then exercise his seniority in bidding for the prime time. Vacation shall be handled in the same manner in that no officer shall be denied vacation already scheduled; but, during the next round of vacation assignments, the senior officer chooses before the junior officer. In the event of a simultaneous transfer, i.e., one officer is moved out at the same time another officer is moved in, the incoming officer is not entitled to assume the relief days and vacation days of the outgoing officer, even though his seniority is greater than other officers in the section, unit, or detail; otherwise, the incoming officer is placed in his respective position as to date of rank and bids with others as the next days and dates become available.
Section 3.	“All Other Things Being Equal” Defined.
"All other factors being equal" is intended to relate to the total performance of an officer. In the event an officer is denied prime time because of "unequal factors", it shall not be for an isolated instance of poor or substandard performance, but it may come about because of a consistent pattern of overall substandard performance.
Section 4.	Military or Duty-Connected Disability.
Time spent in the Armed Forces on military leave of absence and other authorized leaves and time lost because of duty-connected disability shall be included in length of service.
22
Section 5.	Seniority Tie-Breaker.
Seniority shall be a factor in promotions and layoff or recall consistent with State law and City ordinances and regulations. In the event of a tie in the seniority of two or more officers, the officer placing highest on the hiring or promotional list shall be the senior.
Section 6.	Certain Officer Transfer Rights.
This Section applies only to those officers holding the rank of Patrol Officer assigned to the Day (A Shift), Evening (B Shift), or Dog Watch (C Shift) shifts of the Uniformed Patrol Division. To the extent that this Section differs with Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 above, this Section shall prevail so far as the affected shifts are concerned.
When an assignment is declared vacant in a section of the Day (A Shift), Evening (B Shift), or Dog Watch (C Shift) shifts of the Patrol Division, the opening shall be awarded to the most senior officer on that shift of the applicable rank who voluntarily requests that assignment. In the event no officer of the applicable rank from that shift requests the assignment, any officer of applicable rank from the remaining two shifts may request the position and it shall be awarded to the most senior officer.
Once an officer has been transferred, he will then be able to exercise his seniority based on the next available opening on that shift; provided, however, that officers transferring from outside the three affected shifts shall not be eligible to exercise their seniority rights until six months have expired from entry into the affected shifts with the sole exception that officers transferring into or out of one of the Uniformed Patrol shifts shall be entitled to use his seniority in bidding on vacancies in conformance with this Section immediately.
Officers transferring from one of the Uniformed Patrol shifts to another shift or to another unit or division shall lose their vacation request time and will have to put in for a new vacation schedule based on available openings on that shift.
Any officer covered by this Section may be removed from a position he occupies to another position within the three specified shifts, provided such is done on the basis of reverse seniority (i.e., beginning with the least senior person). Probationary officers have no protection under this article. The Human Resources Unit or the FTO Coordinator controls probationary officer assignments.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit in any fashion any right currently vested in the City by virtue of this Agreement, except as explicitly modified by this Article and such modification shall be limited solely to the specific provisions of this Article. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to determine when a vacancy exists, to determine the number of positions to be assigned to a division or shift, to transfer any person from the three shifts covered by this Article to any position outside of those three shifts, to make assignments of officers not covered by this Article, and to make assignments of officers affected by this Article in conformance with the provisions contained herein.
Section 7.	Personnel Career Activity System.
All officers requesting transfers to positions outside of the three uniform patrol shifts will utilize the Personnel Career Activity System (PCAS).
All officers who hold the rank of patrol officer or detective investigator who apply for a position through PCAS and who are not selected, and who request same in writing through the chain of command to the Captain of the Unit to which the officer was not selected, shall be given the true reason for rejection in writing within ten (10) working days of the date the request was received by the non-selecting Captain.
Within ten (10) working days of receiving a written rejection, an affected officer may submit a written appeal to the Deputy Chief who supervises the non-selecting Captain. The Deputy Chief shall affirm the rejection or overturn the rejection in writing within ten (10) working days of receipt of the appeal.
23
Appeals and responses under this section are not subject to Article 15 (Grievance Procedure) of this Agreement, nor may be used in any official proceeding, unless such response includes a violation of Article 4, Section 2 (Management Duties to the Association) of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 13 Hours of Work
Section 1.	General Provisions.
A.	Work Period. Officers will continue to work a seven-day work period in accordance with past practice, as opposed to other work periods under the Fair Labor Standards Act. A “work period” means a regularly repeating seven day calendar cycle that consists of five, 8 hour or four 10 hours days.
B.	Contractual Overtime Provision. By past practice and through this Agreement, the City has established a pay pattern that allows officers to receive overtime payment in pay or compensatory time for any hours outside of the officer’s regularly scheduled shift or workday. Nothing in the Agreement including Section 1(C) below is intended, designed, or will change this practice. The City agrees it will continue to pay officers for overtime in pay or compensatory time in accordance with this Agreement for any hours outside of the officer’s regularly scheduled shift or workday.
C.	FLSA 207k Partial Exemption. The City and the Association agree, that under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the City is entitled to the 43-hour exemption from payment of FLSA statutory overtime compensation. This means that the City is not required by federal law to pay overtime to officers until after the officer has worked 43 horns in a workweek. Within the context of this Agreement however, the City shall continue to pay all contractual compensation in accordance with Article 8 Maintenance of Standards, and in accordance with Section B above, which is enforceable by the grievance procedure of this Agreement. However, the City retains the right under Article 7, Management Rights, to change any process, accounting procedure, forms, periods, or other aspects of accounting practices if it reasonably determines that such change is necessary to comply with state or federal overtime law. The City and the Association agree that the City shall not be obligated in any FLSA enforcement lawsuit to pay overtime until a 43-hour threshold is reached.
Section 2.	Local Government Code Section 142.0015 Override.
Section 142.0015 of the Texas Local Government Code provides among other things, that officers may not be required to work over 40 horns in a week unless an “emergency” has been declared. Texas law, including but not limited to Section 174.006(a) of the Texas Local Government Code, allows the parties to this Agreement to override and change that standard, and the parties expressly agree to override it. Accordingly, the Chief or any supervisor shall continue to be entitled to require work by officers beyond the regularly scheduled shift hours in a day, and over and above the 40 regularly scheduled hours within a seven-day work period. This practice, which the parties agree is both legal and proper without the need for a declaration of “emergency,” will continue as a benefit to both the City and the Association, as a contract provision which has been continuously in effect under all previous collective bargaining agreements. Any claim for additional wages based upon Section 142.0015 is expressly waived in consideration of the finalization of this agreement.
Section 3.	General Provisions .
Officers who are not subject to shift work shall work eight (8) consecutive hours except for interruptions for lunch periods. The workday shall conform to those hours set by the City Manager for the other City employees who work regular non-shift work. The hours presently prescribed are from 7:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with forty-five (45) minutes for lunch.
City policy has for some time permitted two fifteen (15) minute coffee and/or rest breaks per day when they can be taken without serious interference with the work at hand. Such breaks are normally taken mid-morning and mid-afternoon for officers working non-shift, and for shift workers at comparable time during the shift. This policy shall continue to apply to the Department; however, the missing of any coffee and/or rest breaks because of
24
the press of business shall not be grounds for overtime payment or for a grievance.
If an officer requests a thirty (30) minute meal break and is denied such request because of press of business a second time within such shift, and as a result thereof requests thirty (30) minutes of compensatory time or pay at straight time, said officer must submit an "incident report" to the Section Sergeant as to the reasons why the officer could not take said meal break. The granting of or the refusal to grant the compensatory time or pay at straight time by the Section Sergeant shall be final and binding on the officer, with no rights of appeal to the Commission and/or grievance and arbitration as provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
The City will continue to compensate officers who work shifts for the thirty minute lunch, coffee and/or rest breaks; however, the time permitted by this article for those time periods shall in no event constitute time actually worked by an officer unless that officer is ordered by a supervisor to resume duties, or obtains supervisory authorization to do so. Notwithstanding this provision for compensation as to lunch, coffee, and/or rest breaks, officers remain within full coverage and benefits, not limited to life insurance, health insurance, and Texas Workers’ Compensation Act, if the officers are traveling to or from lunch or breaks or during lunch or break time and are performing activities that are in furtherance of the affairs or business of police work. This shall apply unless the activities are specifically excluded by the provisions of the Texas Worker’s Compensation Act and the rules of the Texas Workers’ Compensation Commission, or are excluded by the standards set forth in Article 34 of this Agreement.
Officers who have by practice worked an eight (8) or ten (10) consecutive hour workday, which included a thirty or forty-five minute lunch break, and are not specifically covered by the sections below will continue to do so.
Section 4.	Hours for Certain Patrol Division Units.
Officers working on the Daylight (A Shift), Evening (B Shift), or Dog Watch (C Shift) Shifts of the Patrol Division or the daylight or night shift of CID shall work a seven (7) day work period, with daily hours compensated at straight-time according to assignments as follows:
The Patrol Daylight “A” Shift shall work from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. or from 6:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., with thirty (30) minutes for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks.
The Patrol Evening “B” Shift shall work from 2:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. or from 2:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., with thirty (30) minutes off for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks.
The Patrol Dog Watch or Night “C” Shift shall work from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. or from 10:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m., with thirty (30) minutes off for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks.
The Downtown Foot/Bicycle Patrol Unit officers shall be assigned to work one of two (2) ten-hour shifts per day, daylight shift 7:30 a.m. to 17:30 p.m. or 17:30 p.m. until 3:30 a.m., with thirty (30) minutes off for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks.
Section 5.	Hours for Certain Units.
Officers working on the daylight or night shift of CID or who are assigned to positions equivalent to those assigned to CID and who investigate criminal cases, fde charges and dispositions, or who work in an undercover capacity shall work a seven (7) day work period with daily hours compensated at straight-time as follows:
A.	Officers below the rank of Lieutenant assigned to the daylight shift in CID or equivalent as described above may work from 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., with thirty (30) minutes off for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks.
B.	Officers below the rank of Lieutenant assigned to the night shift in CID or equivalent as described above may work from 7:00 p.m. to 5:30 a.m., with thirty (30) minutes off for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks.
C.	Officers above the rank of Sergeant in the units operating under the ten (10) hour work day shall
25
continue to work a tour of duty consisting of eight (8) hours and forty-five (45) minutes, with forty-five (45) minutes for lunch and two fifteen (15) minute coffee breaks, and shall be entitled to Saturday and Sunday as their regularly assigned relief days.
D.	Officers subject to the ten (10) hours, four (4) day workweek shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
Off-Duty Employment
Property Crimes
Homicide
Robbery
Sex Crimes
Night C.I.D. Detectives
Repeat Offenders Program
Surveillance Detail
Financial Crimes
Vehicle Crimes
Wrecker Service
Officers assigned to the above units will continue to work the hours currently prescribed for those units and with lunch and break hours currently provided. It is not the intent of either the City or the Association to delete any unit currently operating under a four (4) day workweek as of the effective date of this Agreement.
Breaks are normally taken midway through the first half and midway through the second half of a tour of duty. The missing of any coffee and/or rest breaks because of the press of business shall not be grounds for overtime payment or for a grievance.
Section 6.	Adjustment of Working Hours.
The Chief shall have the right to adjust the working hours, and starting and ending time of any shift, or the units of C.I.D. covered by the ten (10) hour work day provided that such change does not cause an employee to work in excess of an average forty (40) regularly scheduled hours in a work period. In no case shall any changes in starting and ending times of shifts covered by Section 4 and 5 above exceed one hour in each calendar year. In the event the Chief decides to exercise his rights pursuant to this section, he shall notify the President of the Association in writing of the anticipated adjustment at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to implementation. The Association shall have fourteen (14) days from the date so notified to submit any comments or objections to the proposed change in writing to the Chief. If objection is expressed by the Association, representatives of the Association and the Chief shall meet to discuss the anticipated adjustment within the next succeeding five (5) days. This right shall not be subject to appeal pursuant to the grievance procedure contained in Article 15 of this Agreement, with the sole exception that the issue of regularly scheduled work in excess of the average forty (40) hours in a workweek may be appealed pursuant to the grievance procedure. Nothing in this section shall be construed in any fashion to limit the Chiefs right to establish the working hours of units not covered by Sections 4 and 5 above.
ARTICLE 14
City Property/Off-Duty Employment Office
Section 1.	Introduction
The existing policies for off-duty employment shall prevail, except that on matters involving jurisdiction or conflict of interest, the Chief shall have the right to amend the existing policies, subject to grievance procedure outlined in Article 15 of this Agreement. Provided, however, this article shall no longer permit a distinction between public and private events nor between for-profit and non-profit entities.
Section 2.	Off Duty Office
The City shall establish an office under the Chief staffed with a minimum in rank of one Sergeant, sworn support
26
personnel, on-duty transportation and office equipment necessary to handle requests of officers to work at City facilities. Such office shall be located in the Convention Center complex. Office space only, without additional staffing, shall be provided at the Alamodome.
Section 3.	Use of Sworn Personnel at City Facilities.
A.	The City shall utilize only sworn officers for the purposes of providing security, crowd control, and other police-related activities at all City facilities. This shall not include ticket takers, badge checkers, or individuals whose duty is to enforce house rules. The Association recognizes that the City has legitimate reasons to work with performers or entertainer’s special security needs. The City shall include in every contract for the use of City facilities that any vendor or lessee using said facility shall use only sworn officers procured through the off-duty employment office for security, crowd control and other police-related activities while using the facility, and that number of officers determined to be necessary by the off-duty employment office shall be paid by the vendor or lessee.
For the purposes of this article, City facilities shall include only the following:
(1)	The Convention Center Exhibit Halls and Banquet Halls or future expansions
(2)	The Lila Cockrell Theater
(3)	Market Square
(4)	Market Square’s Centro de Artes Ballroom; Fiesta Room; and Farmers Market
(5)	La Villita
(6)	The Alamodome
(7)	Municipal Auditorium
B.	All officers assigned to work at City facilities on an off-duty basis shall be compensated as follows. Police Officers, regardless of seniority or other compensation, shall be paid at 1.2 times the officer’s straight time rate (not including longevity) for an officer at Step C of the salary schedule found in Attachment 2 of this agreement. All supervisors, regardless of rank or seniority, shall be paid at 1.2 times the straight time hourly rate for a Sergeant (not including longevity). The straight time rate shall be computed by multiplying the officer’s appropriate monthly rate from Attachment 2 by twelve (12) months and dividing that product by 2080 hours in a work year. All payments will be made utilizing the officer’s bi-weekly payroll check.
C.	The office of the Chief of Police shall have the responsibility of staffing all City facilities with sworn officers. The number of officers needed at any one such property or facility shall be within the exclusive prerogative of the Chief. The Chief shall establish and maintain a Department Procedure for administering this Section. The special order shall include sign-up, notification on a rotating basis, and other policies necessary for the administration of this Section.
D.	The City agrees to pay officers who work any Fiesta events and related activities in an off-duty capacity at double their base pay plus longevity. The City agrees to maximize the use of off-duty personnel who have signed up on the volunteer roster, and to minimize the use of on-duty personnel, subject to the other provisions herein. Fiesta activities and events will be those that are defined in the Official Fiesta Calendar published each year by the City and the Fiesta Commission. Events such as basketball games, concerts, or trade shows unrelated to Fiesta during the calendar days of Fiesta shall be paid at the regular overtime rate unless insufficient volunteers sign up for such events, then all volunteers whether or not from Fiesta volunteer roster shall receive Fiesta pay. Easter Sunday will not be covered under this Section but is covered under Article 20, Holidays, Section 1.
E.	The City and the Association shall not grant any exceptions to this Article, with the sole provision being that officers who “volunteer” their time without remuneration, of any type, may work events for charitable events. “Volunteers” are not exempt from the requirements for off-duty employment of City facilities, even where such volunteers under this paragraph are working on City facilities, and written permission for volunteers to work on City facilities must be approved by the Office of the Chief or his designee.
F.	Nothing in this Article precludes the City from utilizing personnel from private security companies to provide day-to-day security for any of the facilities listed paragraph A, above.
27
G.	The City shall first be required to call or otherwise make available the opportunity for off-duty placement to SAPD personnel, and then to non-SAPD certified peace officer City employees. After having done so, the City may fill any remaining need for certified personnel with employees of other agencies outside the City organization.
H.	The Association, on behalf of the Department, will apply and coordinate any paperwork necessary to comply with the Private Security Act of Texas.
I.	Section 7(p)(l) of the Fair Labor Standards Act makes special provisions for officers of public agencies that, at their own option, perform off-duty employment. This FLSA section provides that the City may facilitate the employment or affect the conditions of the officer’s off-duty employment. Additionally, the City may keep a roster and select from the roster, negotiate the officers pay, retain a fee for administrative expenses, require the individuals who are hiring the officers to pay the costs directly to the City and establish procedures for the officers to receive their pay, and require officers to observe normal standards of conduct during their off-duty employment and enforce such requirements through disciplinary action.
Since the off-duty employment provision was placed into the Agreement in 1988, the City and the Association have worked together to assure compliance. The Agreement of 1988 established an off-duty employment office and established off-duty compensation at the rate of 1.5 times an officers overtime rate in accordance with the officer’s rank. This was renegotiated in 1994 and reduced to 1.2 times the straight time for an officer at Step C. Additionally in 1994, the City agreed to provide officers the opportunity to take compensatory time instead of pay for off-duty purposes. This was considered a pass through of the pay benefit and was not intended or designed to impugn the separate and independent employer relationship outlined in Section 7. This Agreement removes the compensatory time payment allowance to eliminate any challenge to that relationship. In furtherance of the Agreements, the City has paid officers in the rare instances where vendors did not pay. This was considered an important benefit to officers and not designed or intended to alter the separate and independent status of outside interests utilizing city facilities. The City and the Association have a continued relationship within the scope of the Agreement that allows the City to negotiate officer pay rates and conditions of off-duty employment while maintaining a separate and independent status from the individuals contracting to utilize city facilities and off-duty police officers.
J.	Officers participating in the off-duty employment opportunities provided through this Agreement are working off-duty for the lessees of city facilities and not for the City or the Department. In the event of any ruling or holding by a Court or any determination by the Department of Labor that non-payment by vendors makes the City liable for FLSA overtime as the employer of officers, the City may require that officers sign an agreement agreeing to look solely to the vendor for payment; provided, however, that the City will implement reasonable practices for collection of accounts in order to achieve collection of such amounts in a commercially reasonable manner.
K.	In the event of any ruling or holding by a Court or any determination by the Department of Labor that results in altering or changing the benefits provided by this Agreement under this Article or challenges the ability of the City to determine compensation under this Article, the Association agrees that the City shall not be subject to provide additional wages, compensation, or incentives of any kind beyond that which is specified in this Article for purpose of off-duty employment at city facilities. To assure this outcome, the City and the Association agree to meet within 10 days of the ruling, holding, or determination in an effort to resolve any conflicts with this Agreement. In the event that a compromise cannot be reached within the 10 day window period, the City and the Association will submit all unresolved issues within 30 days before a neutral arbitrator selected by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the parties will each submit the name of a qualified neutral person with DOL, judicial, or litigation experience in overtime and FLSA compliance in matters involving law enforcement officers. The two neutrals will select a third qualified neutral with the same experience who shall serve as the chairman of the arbitration panel. The dispute shall be submitted to the arbitration panel within 10 days of their appointment. The hearing shall be conducted under Rules 5-10 of the Expedited Labor Arbitration Rules appended hereto as Attachment 1. The arbitration panel shall determine a decision within 30-days of their appointment. The arbitration panel’s authority is limited to all claims or issues under this section, however under no case shall the arbitration panel issue a ruling that has the effect of changing compensation rates provided by this section. The
28
decision shall be final and binding on all parties, and this process shall be exclusive for all claims or issues relating to the ruling, holding or determination which initiates the process. Officers seeking redress for off-duty employment grievances not relating to such issues shall do so on an individual basis and in accordance with the Grievance procedure of this Agreement.
L.	Officers shall be paid, in addition to the compensation for hours worked for lessees using City facilities, the City “special event” parking rate, which shall be an additional cost charged to the lessee as a part of total officer security costs. This parking reimbursement shall be paid for one parking rate per day.
ARTICLE 15
Grievance Procedure
Section 1.	Scope of Procedure.
The City and the Association agree that the purpose of this grievance procedure is to provide a just and equitable method for resolving disagreements between the parties regarding the interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement. Only matters involving the interpretation, application, or alleged violation of a specific provision of this collective bargaining Agreement shall be subject to this grievance procedure. Disciplinary matters which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission pursuant to Chapter 143 Local Government Code are not subject to this procedure but are covered in Article 27 of this Agreement. Where a statutory claim is asserted before any administrative agency or court, which claim(s) arises from the same factual occurrence made the basis of a grievance, the grievance shall be abated until final disposition or settlement of such claim(s), unless the officer agrees with the employer and the Association to submit all claims arising from the same factual occurrence, including statutory claims, to the grievance procedure herein. Any alleged violation(s) of Article 4., Section 2(F), of this Agreement shall not be the subject of a grievance unless there is an Agreement between the parties hereto and the officer to submit such issue(s) to the grievance procedure.
Section 2.	Time Limits.
The parties shall adhere to the time limits as set forth in the procedure. In the event the officer or Association fails to meet the time limits at any step of the procedure, the grievance shall be considered satisfied and no further action shall be taken. Failure by the City to meet the time limits at any step shall be considered an unsatisfactory response and shall automatically allow the grievance to proceed to the next step. Such time limits may be waived, however, by mutual consent of the parties in writing.
Section 3.	Steps.
A grievance within the scope of this procedure as defined in Section 1 above shall be handled as follows:
Step 1. Any officer having a matter which is felt to be a grievance, first will verbally discuss the problem with his immediate supervisor. This discussion must be within ten (10) working days of the officer’s actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence or the event causing the problem. The supervisor will render a decision within three (3) working days.
Step 2. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the officer shall submit the grievance, in writing, to his intermediate supervisor within five (5) working days. The grievance shall be submitted on a form to be provided by the City and shall include (1) a statement of the grievance and all facts on which it is based; (2) any and all sections of the Agreement which have allegedly been violated; (3) the remedy or adjustment, if any, sought; and (4) the officer’s signature. The intermediate supervisor shall respond to the officer’s grievance and shall render a decision, in writing, within five (5) working days.
Step 3. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the matter shall be submitted in writing by the officer to the Division Head within five (5) working days of the decision of the intermediate supervisor. The Division Head shall meet with the grievant in an effort to resolve the grievance if the grievant makes such a written request and shall render a decision in writing within fifteen (15) working days.
29
Step 4. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 3, the Association shall determine if a grievance exists. Said determination shall be made by an association grievance committee. The Chief may appoint one (1) nonvoting member of the committee. The committee may exclude the Chief’s appointed member from deliberations. The grievance committee shall meet and render its decision within twenty (20) working days of the Step 3 ruling, including presentation of the grievance at Step 5, if such be the committee's determination. If the Association exercises this right, the Chief of Police shall be entitled to exclude Association representatives from any administrative meeting, procedure, or process, where their presence or participation has been allowed, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.
In the event that the grievance committee decides that a grievance exists, the Association, representing the aggrieved officer, shall proceed to Step 5. In the event that the grievance committee decides that no grievance exists, there shall be no further action taken under this procedure.
Step 5. If a grievance is believed to exist, it shall be presented in writing to the Chief. The Chief shall have seven (7) working days to act on the grievance and render a decision in writing.
Step 6. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 5, the matter shall be submitted in writing to the Human Resources Director within five (5) working days from the decision at Step 5.
The Human Resources Director shall within three (3) working days submit the matter to the City Manager who shall review the matter and shall render a decision in writing within ten (10) working days. The Human Resources Director shall obtain the response from the City Manager or his representative and contact the Chairman of the Association's Grievance Committee and/or the President of the Association of the response and results within three (3) working days.
If the grievance has not been settled at Step 6, the parties shall have five (5) working days from the date the Budget and Employee Services Director notified the President and/or grievance committee chairman of the Association, in which to appeal the grievance to arbitration for adjustment. An appeal from the Association shall be submitted in writing to the Human Resources Director. Since the City may also grieve against the Association, any grievance by the City against the Association will be filed directly with the President of the Association; and, if not settled within five (5) working days, may be submitted to arbitration for adjustment.
A grievance contesting action by the City Council or City Manager may be initiated at Step 4 within thirty (30) calendar days of the officer’s actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence or event causing the problem.
The President of the Association may file a class action grievance on behalf of bargaining unit members similarly situated at Step 4 above within thirty (30) calendar days of the officer’s actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence or event causing the problem.
With the exception of all grievances filed prior to the date of the execution of this Agreement, if at Step 2 or Step 3, it is determined by the responder that the current grievance or an issue of the current grievance has already been addressed and resolved in a previous grievance or arbitrator’s ruling, the responder may forward the previously resolved grievance or arbitrator’s ruling to the Grievance Committee without further response. Taking into consideration the previously resolved grievance or arbitrator’s ruling, the Grievance Committee will review the current grievance within sixty (60) calendar days from the city’s response and if it is determined that specifics which are material to the current grievance were not addressed by the previously resolved grievance or arbitrator’s ruling, the current grievance will be returned to the appropriate Step and the process continued from the date forwarded to the Grievance Committee for review. If the current grievance, or an issue of the current grievance, is determined by the Grievance Committee to have been previously resolved, the current grievance, or the issue of the current grievance, will be deemed as denied by the Grievance Committee and the grievant will be bound by the previous resolution.
With the exception of all grievances filed prior to the date of execution of this Agreement, if a grievance has not been finally resolved within three hundred and sixty five (365) calendar days from the date of appeal to arbitration, and no mutually agreed time extensions exist or are requested by either party to the grievance, the grievance will be deemed to have expired. Grievance extensions will not be unreasonably denied under this paragraph.
30
Section 4.	Arbitration.
If a grievance is submitted to arbitration, within five (5) working days, the City and the Association shall agree upon an arbitrator. For this purpose, the parties may agree in writing to utilize one or more arbitrators for a specified period of time, provided that either party may request selection on any specific matter as follows: If the parties fail to agree upon an arbitrator, a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals shall be requested from the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Within five (5) working days from receipt of the list, the Association and the City shall alternately strike names on the list and the remaining name shall be the arbitrator.
The conduct of the hearing shall be governed by the standard rules of the American Arbitration Association. The parties, by mutual agreement, may request that the hearing be held in accordance with the Expedited Labor Arbitration Rules which are found as Attachment 1 to this Agreement and are incorporated herein by reference.
Upon written request delivered at least three (3) working days prior to the date of the hearing, a party to the proceeding shall provide to the opposing party the names and addresses of witnesses expected to be called at the hearing. In the absence of good or excusable cause, the arbitrator may exclude the testimony of a witness upon the failure of a party to disclose such a witness. The parties, in writing, may request discovery from each other concerning the grievance. Should the opposing party not agree to provide the requested information within three (3) working days of the request, the request shall be deemed denied. The requesting party may then apply to the Arbitrator, who shall order such discovery as is appropriate to the nature of the case, consistent with, but not bound by, the rules of discovery in Texas civil cases. In considering the application, the Arbitrator, shall consider the burden and expense of producing the information, the need of the requesting party, the amount of time available prior to the hearing, and such other matters as he may deem material. In no event shall discovery be requested within three (3) working days prior to the hearing.
The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, amend, modify, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement in arriving at his decision on the issue or issues presented and shall confine his decision to the interpretation of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall confine himself to the precise issue submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to determine any other issues not so submitted to him. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the City and the Association.
The City shall bear the expense of any witnesses called by the City. The Association shall bear the expense of any witnesses called by the Association. The City and the Association shall share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrator.

Section 4.	Longevity Pay.
In addition to wages as set forth in the pay schedule, each officer's base pay shall be increased by three percent (3%) for each five (5) years of his longevity, to a maximum of thirty (30) years, i.e., a thirty year veteran would receive an additional eighteen percent (18%). On each officer's anniversary date which is not a multiple of five, he shall receive an eight dollar ($8.00) increase in his longevity pay per month, provided, however, that he shall no longer receive monthly longevity pay of $4.00 per year of service, to a maximum of twenty-five (25) years as is set forth in State law, and that the eight dollar ($8.00) interim monthly adjustments will not increase any fifth year level.

No discipline may be imposed for differences in the exercise of such judgment.

All officers who are assigned to the Blue E.A.G.L.E. helicopter unit shall be compensated at One Hundred FiftySeven Dollars ($157.00) per month of active assignment.

The Chief may at his discretion cancel (or reactivate) the Volunteers in Policing assignment pay at any station should the number of civilian volunteers actively participating in the program drop to a number no longer justifying the Volunteers in Policing assignment pay.
Section 9.	Overtime, Regular Rate, and other Pay Calculations
A.	Overtime, pension, Fiesta pay, court and call-back pay, holiday pay, longevity, education, shift differential, FTO, incentive pay i.e. SWAT, helicopter, VIP, crisis negotiation, K-9, instructors and bomb tech, certification pay and language skills pay will be paid in accordance with this Agreement and past practice.
B.	The Association agrees that, for the term of this agreement (including any extension period), all past pay practices under the terms “regular rate of pay,” “rate of pay,” or “regular pay” in the previous agreement, including those which have been calculated and paid based on base pay or base pay plus longevity (examples below) are deemed as proper pay practices under the prior agreement and will remain proper under this agreement. Should any grievance contesting the definition or calculation of pay or “regular rate of pay” be filed after August 1, 2003, contesting such “regular rate of pay” issues, it is the position of the Association that said grievance is without merit and will be immediately resolved in accordance with the agreed and accepted past pay practice. This provision is intended to assure that the City will have no such retroactive liability for such pay practices, and has been relied upon by the City in accepting and approving this agreement. This agreed condition is essential to this agreement.
C.	Therefore, in the event of any successful officer(s) claims, by grievance or lawsuit, under the terms “regular rate of pay,” “rate of pay,” or “regular pay’” the Association agrees to share in the liability by special assessment and pay for such claims at the ratio of 50% Association, 50% City. To the extent that any such matters are asserted by suit, the Association shall provide and pay for cooperating joint defense counsel, or pay 50% of the City’s cost of defense.
D.	Notwithstanding this agreement the City and the Association agree that “regular rate of pay” is negotiable, and that during the next contract negotiations between the parties, the way pay is calculated for longevity, Fiesta Pay, and court and call back pay will be subject to the negotiation process.
E.	In accordance with arbitration rulings, sick leave buy back and sick leave upon separation pay shall be calculated to include all incentives as used in that calculation for an individual officer. For purposes of Section 9 of this Article, incentives are defined as those pay additions that apply to an individual officer. This would include but not be limited to the various assignments pays such as FTO, SWAT, helicopter, SAFFE, and VIP. Also included
33
would be any applicable educational pay, shift differential pay, language skills pay, and certification pay.
F.	Should this Agreement create any new pay categories, such categories shall be included for overtime, pension, and leave upon separation computation unless specifically excluded by wording within the applicable section.
G.	This section does not have the effect of altering the duty to pay overtime when required by the FLSA at 1.5 times the “regular rate of pay” as defined by federal law; the parties recognize, however, that this agreement, portions of which predate the FLSA, has not used the term “regular rate of pay” in the manner defined by the statute.
H.	The computation for the calculation of longevity pay will be base pay at the officer’s appropriate step multiplied by the percentage increase of the officer’s longevity position plus $8 for each additional year up to a maximum of 4 years.
5 years	3%
10 years	6%
15 years	9%
20 years	12%
25 years	15%
30 years	18%
I.	Pay Examples
Longevity: A 22-year patrol officer in step E would make $3,985 for base pay times 12% for longevity plus an additional sixteen dollars total foryears 21 and 22. (($3,985 * . 12)+16 = $494.20)
Fiesta Pay shall be double time: Base plus longevity times two (2)
All Past Pay Practices in relation to Court and Call-Back shall continue.
Court and Call back shall continue to be paid at one and one-half (1.5) x “regular rate of pay” for actual time worked. However, Court and Call back shall never be paid in an amount less than 3 hours x 1.5 x base pay plus longevity. The officer will be given whichever amount of pay is higher but not both.
All Past Pay Practices in relation to Holiday Pay shall continue until January 1, 2006 (See Below).
Holiday Pay shall continue to be double time for non-premium days at base plus longevity times two (2) and for premium holidays at base plus longevity times double time and one half (2.5). On January 1st 2006, the Holiday and Premium Holiday rate of pay shall be increased to be paid as follows: Holiday pay shall begin to be compensated at the regular rate of pay (inclusive of all the subject officer’s incentives or add-on pays) times double (2) time (on regular holiday) or double time and one half (2.5) (on premium holiday) depending on which type of Holiday worked. This is inclusive of all incentive pays for calculation of regular rate of pay for this article.
EXAMPLE: On January 1, 2004, a step E patrol officer making $3,985 per month base with 20 years would receive $478.20 per month in longevity. $3,985 + $478.20 = $4,463.20 per month times 12 months = $53,558.40 divided by 2080 hours worked per year = $25.75 per hour.
In this example for a premium holiday, the officer would receive 20 hours (8 hrs. X 2.5 rate) compensation for an 8 hour day. (20 X $25.75 = $515.00)
AFTER January 1st, 2006, a similar step E patrol officer on dogwatch with a Bachelors degree making $4,279 per month base with 20 years would receive $513.48 per month in longevity. He will receive $350 per month for shiftdifferential and $300 per month for a Bachelors degree. $4,279 + $513.48 + $350 +$300 = $5,442.48 per month times 12 months = $65,309.76 divided by 2080 hours worked per year =$31.40 per hour.
In this example for a premium holiday, the officer would receive 20 hours (8 hrs. X 2.5 rate) compensation for an 8 hour day. (20 X $31.40 = $628.00)

A police officer who leaves the classified service for any reason shall receive a lump-sum payment in the full amount of his ending salary for the period of his accumulated compensatory time, holidays, sick leave (in accordance with entitlements as provided for by statute), bonus days, and vacation time, provided that such payment, in the case of vacation time, shall be based upon not more than ninety (90) days of accumulated vacation leave. The beneficiaries of any police officer who loses his life as the result an injury or illness in the course and scope of employment shall be paid the full amount of his salary for the total number of his days of accumulated leave.
Section 3.	Sick Leave Buy Back.
The City will buy back or convert either in “pay” or in “other forms of leave,” at the officer’s discretion up to ten (10) unused sick leave days for the preceding year (October 1 to September 30) on a one-for-one basis provided that the officer requests same in writing on a form provided by the City by the end of the first pay period in October; and the officer has a balance after the buy back of not less than fifty (50) accumulated sick days. In addition, the City will buy back or convert either in “pay” or in “other forms of leave,” at the officer’s discretion up to five (5) remaining unused sick leave days for the preceding year (October 1 to September 30) on a two-for-one basis, provided that the officer requests same in writing, on a form provided by the City, by the end of the first pay period in October; and the officer has a balance after the buy back of not less than fifty (50) accumulated sick days. Sick leave buy back will be paid at the regular rate of pay which includes the incentive pays used in overtime calculations.
For the purposes of this section, “other forms of leave” shall not include Bonus Leave days.
The City shall distribute funds in cash or as other forms of leave. The City agrees to allow officers to adjust their paycheck the pay period before or after the sale of sick leave days in order for the officer to make contributions to their deferred compensation plan.
The Accounting Unit will run in the Daily Bulletin during the month of September notification to the officer to file, in writing, for the buy back. An officer may not "sell" back sick leave accumulated prior to the year (October 1 to September 30) and may only "sell" back those unused days of the fifteen (15) days currently accumulated. The City will pay the officer his amount due at the same time as other City employees are paid for their sick leave buy back but not later than Christmas Eve day.
Section 4.	Bonus Days Leave.
Each officer shall be entitled to one (1) additional day of leave for each quarter of a calendar year (beginning January 1) of "perfect attendance". Officers off from duty for one of the following reasons are not eligible to receive the one (1) day perfect attendance bonus: time off for sick leave; off-job injury leave; military leave in excess of fifteen (15) days in a calendar year; leave without pay; stress leave; and suspensions. Full vacation days, holidays, and/or compensatory time usage that has not been scheduled and documented by the supervisor prior to the end of that officer's preceding day's shift will disqualify an officer from receiving the perfect attendance bonus. Holidays, relief days, special assignments, administrative leave (with or without pay), and time restored by the Commission or an Arbitrator shall not affect the officer's entitlement to the perfect attendance bonus.
A day as used in this Section of this Article shall equate to eight (8) hours, regardless of the number of hours in an officer's daily work schedule. An officer may accumulate no more than 400 hours of perfect attendance bonus day time. This increase shall be effective January 1st, 2004.

Each officer may accumulate 480 hours of compensatory time.
Section 6.	Holiday Leave Accrual.
Each officer may accumulate up to a maximum of three hundred and twenty (320) hours of holiday leave at the rate of eighty (80) hours per year.
Section 7.	Leave Conversion
For purpose of clarification only, the following chart details the type of leave and what amounts over the accumulated maximum may be converted into at the discretion of the officer. Officers who have maximum accumulation in leave accrual that cannot be converted into other categories because of maximum accumulation in those categories are subject to Section 8 of this Article.
Holiday (320 maximum hours) into Vacation
Vacation (720 maximum hours) into Holiday
Bonus Day (400 maximum horns) into Vacation/Holiday
Sick (1:1) (as applicable per Section 3 above) into Compensatory Time/Holiday/Vacation
Officers who as per Section 3 above and who have a remaining total of ninety (90) or more sick days after the sale or conversion on a 1:1 basis, may at the discretion of the officer convert up to the five (5) remaining sick days accumulated during the annual period at 2:1. Officers who desire to convert sick time to compensatory time may convert only up to the maximum 480 hours of compensatory time.
Section 8.	Savings Clause.
No officer covered by this agreement shall lose any holidays, vacation, or compensatory time he accumulated during the duration of this agreement that exceeds the maximum permitted accrual amount allowed by this Agreement, unless, after being given written individual notice to take the holidays, vacation, or compensatory time within a specified period not less than thirty (30) days, the officer fails to do so.
Section 9.	Injury-on-Duty Leave.
Any officer may be granted Injury-on-Duty (IOD) Leave by the Chief of Police after three hundred and sixty-five (365) calendar days from the original date of injury if:
A.	Medical documentation from the officer's physician is provided showing additional medical treatment or procedures are needed and are as a result of the original injury.
B.	When presented with such medical documentation, the Chief shall have the right to require the officer to be evaluated by a physician as designated by the City for confirmation of the findings of the officer's physician. Should the determination of the City's designated physician be different than that of the officer’s designated physician, the two of them shall select a third physician who shall be supplied all pertinent and relevant records of the officer. This third physician shall evaluate said records and, if necessary as determined by him, conduct an additional medical evaluation of the officer involved. The determination of this third physician shall be final and binding on parties and not subject to appeal to the Commission and/or grievance and arbitration as provided for in this Agreement. Should the determination of the third, independent physician agree with the officer's physician, the City shall bear the cost of this third physician's evaluation.
If this third physician's evaluation agrees with the evaluation of the City's designated physician, the cost of the third physician's evaluation and examination shall be borne by the officer.
C.	The officer will not be charged any sick leave during any second or other occurring period of an original IOD incident, but will be granted immediate IOD leave.
39
D.	If it is determined by licensed physicians and reviewed by the Chief of Police that the second or subsequent treatment period is not a result of the original injury, the officer will have the IOD time rescinded and charged sick time. In the event the officer has no sick time on the books, he will forfeit any other type of accumulated leave on the books to equal this IOD time taken off. In the event the officer has no time on the books, he or she shall pay back the time at one-half of all vacation, holiday, and sick time accumulated until all IOD leave is satisfied.
E.	The Chief of Police shall have the final authority and it will no longer be necessary to submit such requests to the City Manager's office, or City Council, for approval and extended IOD leave. In the event such additional IOD leave is denied, the employee will retain the right to appeal the denial to the City Manager and City Council.
Section 10.	Jury Duty.
A leave of absence, without loss of regular pay, for a period not to exceed two (2) work weeks shall be granted to an officer upon his actual jury duty service, unless excused therefrom; provided, however, that such officer waives or remits to the City his jury fee and provides proof of jury service verified by the court liaison section and submitted to Police Accounting.
Section 11.	Sick Leave Pool.
Each officer shall accumulate fifteen (15) days of sick leave, with pay, per calendar year.
When the total number of sick leave pool days drops below seven hundred (700), one (1) day of sick leave with pay from each officer participating in the program shall become part of the sick leave pool, and any remaining days shall continue to be credited to the individual officer.
Officers having opted not to participate will not, under any circumstances, be allowed to enter the pool at any later date. Any officer who voluntarily drops out of the pool may not, under any circumstances, be allowed to re-enter the pool. Notification to the Accounting Unit must be provided, in writing, by the officer who drops out of the pool. The Accounting Unit shall include a copy of this report in the officer's file, and must forward a copy to the Chiefs office for inclusion in the officer's permanent "201" file. A copy must also be sent to the Association within thirty (30) days of the date the officer requests to drop out of the sick leave pool. No officer shall be eligible to draw sick leave pool days until one (1) of his sick days is credited to the pool.
Any officer not currently a member of the sick leave pool, as outlined by this Article, shall be given a two (2) week grace period to enter into this sick pool. Officers entering the program under this grace period will be required to forfeit eleven (11) days of accumulated sick leave to the pool prior to entry. The beginning and ending date of the grace period will be mutually agreed to by the Chief and the President of the Association within ninety (90) calendar days after this Agreement is executed.
Upon completion of the initial two-month period of employment after graduation from the Academy, each officer shall have one and one-half (1.5) days of sick leave credited to the pool. In the event of separation from employment prior to completion of the probationary period, the City may adjust the pool for any sick leave credits not actually earned by the contributing probationary officer.
The Chief of Police and the President of the Association shall each appoint an equal amount of officers to a committee in rank to administer the sick leave pool. The committee shall then elect a chairman. The resulting vacancy will be filled by the opposite appointing officer from that receiving the chairmanship. Example: If the Chief of Police appointee is elected chairman, the Association President shall appoint for the created vacancy.
The Chief of Police will select one sergeant, one detective and one patrol officer. The Association President will select one detective and two patrol officers. In cases where an officer applies for sick leave pool benefits and holds a rank higher than sergeant, the Chief and President of the Association will each appoint one person of rank equal to or higher than held by the requesting officer.
40
All committee members shall be appointed on or before October 1 of each year and shall serve one-year terms. Any vacancies occurring during the course of the term shall be fdled within fifteen (15) working days. No person shall be allowed to serve more than one (1) consecutive term. The City shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each committee member.
The following requirements determine when a committee may consider when sick leave pool days may be drawn. A decision by the committee shall be final.
A.	Officers may be considered for sick leave pool days after taking off fifteen (15) consecutive
working days (or comparable hours) of continuous non-job-related illness or injury. The fifteen (15) consecutive working days used for eligibility shall not be refundable by committee or otherwise.
B.	No officer shall be permitted to use more than 180 pool days for a single illness or injury.
C.	Pool days may not be used for injuries or illnesses sustained in the line of duty.
D.	The number of days in the pool shall be solely for the benefit of officers with extended injuries or
illnesses, and such days shall not revert to the accumulated sick leave of individual officers.
E.	Pool time may only be used for disability, which is defined as a non-job-related injury or illness, which prevents an officer from fully performing assigned duties in all major divisions of the department.
F.	The committee chairman may at any time or at the request of the Chief of Police reconvene the committee for further consideration should evidence come forward that would affect the outcome of a committee decision after a decision has been reached. The committee by majority vote may extend, reduce, approve, cancel, or deny a pool usage, as the evidence requires.
G.	Officers desiring consideration for pool usage may be required to submit to medical examination by a City doctor and may be required to produce medical records, doctor's orders, and any other material necessary to render a decision by the committee.
H.	Upon any officer being absent from duty ninety (90) working days as a result of a single illness or injury, the Chief may require the officer to submit to a medical examination to determine whether the officer is permanently disabled. When it is determined that an officer is permanently disabled, the Chief shall be entitled to terminate or retire the officer, whichever is applicable, according to law existing as of October 1, 1988.
Section 12.	Leaves of Absence.
The Chief may grant a leave of absence, without pay, to a maximum of five (5) officers, which granting shall not be unreasonably withheld. The primary purpose of which shall be to provide to the officer with additional education in law enforcement-related areas. Request for leave under this section for the purpose of the officer continuing fulltime formal education at an institution of higher learning shall be given priority. The duration of the leave shall be for a period of time as determined by the Chief, but in no event for a period to exceed three (3) calendar years. Should the leave be for the purpose of pursuing continued formal education at an accredited college or university of higher learning, the leave shall be granted on a semester-by-semester basis.
A leave of absence under this Section shall not be considered a break in service for promotional or seniority purposes. Officers on leave of absence shall not be eligible to apply for or take promotional examinations while on such leave.
An officer on an approved leave of absence under this Section must return to regular assignment with the City for a period at least equal to the length of his leave. Should an officer fail to return to his regular assignment for such period, the leave taken shall be considered as a break in service for purposes of promotion, seniority, pay, and/or pension.
The Chief of Police may recall an officer from a leave of absence granted under this Section in the case of an
41
emergency for the duration of the emergency.
Officers on leave of absence may continue pension payments, and the City shall match such payments according to the requirements of state law. However, all other forms of compensation shall be withheld until such officer returns to full-time status with the Department.

If it be determined that an absence will continue in excess of fourteen (14) calendar days, and said position is determined by the Chief to be of critical importance, he may, at his sole discretion, fill said absence by appointing from the first day of absence. If another officer of the equivalent or higher rank is in a position to assume the responsibilities of the absent officer’s position, then the Chief is not required to assign an officer to such position. During service in the acting capacity, the officer, so assigned, shall be compensated at the base salary of the higher position, plus his or her own longevity or seniority pay beginning on the date of such acting assignment by the Chief. Excepted from this provision is any absence created by operation of Article 3 of this agreement.
If a vacancy is not filled within thirty (30) calendar days in the rank of Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Deputy Chief or Assistant Chief, and the position is not eliminated, then the Chief shall appoint temporarily from the next lower rank some officer to fill that position until a permanent officer is assigned to fill said vacancy.

The Chief shall continue the Field Training Officer Program (FTOP) as a section of the Police Academy. The FTOP function will be to reinforce and update training given in the Academy in field operations. The primary purpose of the Program is to complete the education and training of probationary officers. Additionally, the program may be used to conduct continuing or remedial education or training for other Department personnel. While patrol officers may be used as Field Training Officers (FTO's) to conduct such training and education, they may not be used to supervise, investigate, or perform other duties performed by higher-ranking officers.

Salary, benefits and seniority within the promotional rank commences the date the officer was eligible for the promotion pursuant to this Agreement and Chapter 143. During the promotional probationary period, an officer may be demoted by the Chief to the rank from which he was promoted on the basis of the officer’s inefficiency, incompetence, or inability to supervise.
Section 2.	In the event that an officer is demoted under Section 1 above, said officer may file a grievance pursuant to the grievance procedure in this Agreement. If the grievance proceeds to Section 4 of the grievance procedure, the officer shall only raise to the arbitrator the issue of whether or not the officer was demoted for some reasons other than inefficiency, incompetency, or inability to supervise. The burden of proof shall be on the officer to demonstrate that the demotion was for some reason other than inefficiency, incompetency, or inability to supervise. In the event that the arbitrator mles that the demotion was for some reason other than incompetency, inefficiency, or inability to supervise, the arbitrator shall rescind the demotion and restore the officer to the promotional rank from which the officer was demoted.

Section 1.	The Chief shall have authority to demote, suspend not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, or indefinitely suspend (as provided for in Chapter 143 of Local Government Code) any officer for the causes set forth in the Rules and Regulations of the Commission. The officer may appeal such actions, if any, as provided for herein.
Section 2.	Prior to any such disciplinary action, the officer shall be given notice of contemplated disciplinary action by personal service, stating the action or actions contemplated and the reasons therefor, and notifying the officer that he may rebut the charges to the Chief, either orally, or in writing, within five (5) working days. If the Chief should be unable to secure personal service after due diligence, service may be made by placing the notice in the mail addressed to the officer’s last known address along with delivery of the statement to the Association, and proof of such service shall be sufficient to support any disciplinary action.
Section 3.	After the notice and opportunity for rebuttal provided in the preceding paragraph, the Chief may demote, suspend, or indefinitely suspend an officer by personal service on the officer of a written statement of charges. If the Chief should be unable to secure personal service after due diligence, service may be made by placing it in the mail addressed to the officer’s last known address along with delivery of the statement to the Association, and proof of such service shall be sufficient to support any disciplinary action. Service of notice in accordance with this section shall constitute suspension or other disciplinary action for purposes of adherence to any contractual or statutory limitations period. A copy of such statement shall be promptly filed with the Human Resources Director of the City.
Section 4.	The written statement shall point out the particular rule or rules alleged to have been violated by the officer and the specific act or acts alleged to be in violation. In the event of demotion, suspension, or indefinite suspension, the statement informing the officer of disciplinary action and the reason(s) therefor shall also inform the officer that an appeal may be had by filing same in writing with the Human Resources Director, within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of said written statement, or, if alternate service is had as provided herein, within ten (10) calendar days from service upon the Association.
Section 5.	For the purposes of this Article, the term arbitrator shall mean the same as a third-party hearing
45
examiner as referred to in Chapter 143 Local Government Code. Appeal from demotion, suspension or indefinite suspension shall be decided by one arbitrator, selected according to this agreement. Upon receiving an appeal from the officer, the Human Resources Director shall act immediately to notify the Association, the Chief, and the City Manager of the appeal.
Section 6.	If the appeal is for arbitration, the officer and the Human Resources Director (the parties) shall attempt to mutually agree on an arbitrator. If the parties fail to agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) working days after the appeal is filed, the Director shall immediately request a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals from the American Arbitration Association.
The parties may mutually agree on one of the seven (7) neutrals. If they do not so agree, the parties shall alternately strike the names on the list within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of the list, and the remaining name shall be the arbitrator. All parties shall act to complete the selection process at the earliest possible date. The arbitrator shall be immediately notified of his selection.
Section 7.	The hearing shall be commenced, but need not be completed, within sixty (60) calendar days of the arbitrator's selection. Delay in commencement of the hearing within these time periods may occur due to unavoidable conflicts with the arbitrator's schedule, or by mutual agreement of parties and for no other reason. If the arbitrator selected cannot commence the hearing within sixty (60) calendar days from his selection, and if the parties cannot agree upon a substitute within one (1) work day of so learning, another arbitrator shall be selected from a new list of seven (7) names immediately requested from the American Arbitration Association, according to the procedure set out herein. The arbitrator shall make an award within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of evidence or after receipt of brief’s if any in standard arbitration hearings, and within five (5) working days of the close of evidence in expedited arbitration hearings.

Section 9.	The award of the Arbitrator shall state which particular factual charges he finds to be true, if any, and the particular rules he finds such conduct to have violated, if any. Where the charges are upheld, the award shall state whether the discipline imposed is upheld, or whether some lesser discipline is substituted.
Section 10.	The following rules shall govern the conduct of arbitration hearings under this Section, and of certain preliminary matters.
A.	Upon written request delivered at least three (3) working days prior to the date of the hearing, a party to the proceeding shall provide to the opposing party the names and addresses of witnesses expected to be called at the hearing. In the absence of good or excusable cause, the arbitrator may exclude the testimony of a witness upon the failure of a party to disclose such a witness. The parties, in writing, may request discovery from each other concerning the case. Should the opposing party not agree to provide the requested information within three (3) working days of the request, the request shall be deemed denied. The requesting party may then apply to the Arbitrator who shall order such discovery as is appropriate to the nature of the case, consistent with, but not bound by, the rules of discovery in Texas civil cases. In considering the application, the Arbitrator shall consider the burden and expense of producing the information, the need of the requesting party, the amount of time available prior to the hearing, and such other matters as he may deem material. In no event shall discovery be requested within three (3) working days prior to the hearing.
B.	The Arbitrator shall have the power to subpoena witnesses. Where the subpoena request
is not opposed by a party, the Human Resources Director shall issue the subpoena in the name of the Arbitrator and such issuance shall be considered the act of the arbitrator. If the subpoena is opposed, the moving party shall apply to the arbitrator for issuance of the subpoena.
C.	In all hearings under this Section, the City shall prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence.
46
D.	All hearings shall be public unless it is expressly agreed in writing by the parties that the hearing shall be closed to the public. In any event, the final decision of the arbitrator shall be public, although public announcement may be reasonably delayed upon request of the parties.
E.	Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the conduct of the hearing shall be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Section 11.	Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Arbitrator shall have all those powers and only those powers vested in the Commission under Chapter 143 Local Government Code and the Commission Rules, with respect to suspensions, terminations, and demotions, with the sole exception of the power to amend such rules.
Section 12.	Any notice or statement required to be filed by the Chief of Police or the officer in a disciplinary proceeding under Chapter 143 Local Government Code, under Commission Rules, or under this Agreement, shall be filed with the Human Resources Director of the City.
Section 13.	Hearings conducted by the Commission shall be in accordance with Chapter 143 Local Government Code.
Section 14.	With respect to suspensions, indefinite suspension, temporary suspensions as defined in Chapter 143 Local Government Code and demotions, the officer shall have such right to appeal the arbitrator's decision to district court as he is given in Chapter 143 Local Government Code to appeal the Commission's decision, and no greater right.
Section 15.	Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, in cases of conflict, the provisions of this Agreement will control over Chapter 143 Local Government Code, and any other civil service provision, and American Arbitration Association Rules; and Chapter 143 Local Government Code, and any other civil service provision, and Civil Service Rules promulgated pursuant to it shall control over American Arbitration Association Rules.
Section 16.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Chief shall have authority to temporarily suspend an officer for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days nor more than ninety (90) calendar days, where the officer agrees to the suspension in writing. The officer shall have no right to appeal such agreed suspension, and no administrative or judicial body shall have power to review such a suspension or alter the terms of the Agreement.
Section 17.	Any deadline or time restrictions set out in this Agreement with respect to disciplinary proceedings may be modified by written agreement of the parties. However, neither party may be compelled to waive its right to insist upon the deadline and time restrictions provided by the Agreement.
Section 18.	Officers suspended up to a maximum of forty-five (45) working days may, at the Chiefs discretion, forfeit either accumulated compensatory time, vacation, bonus time or holiday leave equal to the suspension. Approval of forfeiting time by the Chief shall not be unreasonably withheld and may only be denied because of a consistent overall pattern of substandard performance. The officer shall have ten (10) calendar days from receipt of notice of the suspension to decide whether or not he wishes to forfeit accumulated leave or exercise his appeal rights pursuant to Chapter 143 Local Government Code or the Grievance and Arbitration Procedures of this Agreement. The provisions of this Article shall apply solely to suspensions which are agreed to by the officer, and no appeal to the Commission or to arbitration may be instituted on suspensions where the officer has forfeited accumulated compensatory, vacation, bonus time or holiday leave pursuant to the terms of this Article.
Section 19.	Except as provided in this section of this Article, the Chief and City are precluded from the introduction of evidence or otherwise complaining of any acts or occurrences earlier than the 180th calendar day immediately preceding the date on which the Chief suspends the officer. The Chief may introduce evidence or otherwise complain of any felony Penal Code violation or a felony violation of the Controlled Substance Act committed by an officer so long as the evidence or complaint is filed within 180 days of the Department’s first
47
knowledge of the act. Provided however, that the statute of limitation for criminal judicial action against the officer involved has not expired. This amendment language shall not be applied retroactively. Only upon written notice in the original written statement of the Chief may any act or occurrence be admissible in a disciplinary hearing in accordance with this section. Solely to aid the Commission or arbitrator in the assessment of appropriate discipline and not to prove a charge of a violation of Civil Service Rules or for any other purpose, the Chief and the City may introduce evidence of prior disciplinary actions which have not been set aside on appeal as follows:
A.	Where the Chiefs original written charges include alleged violations of Civil Service Rules constituting acts of intentional violence, the Chief and the City may introduce prior discipline on such other violations found to have been committed within five (5) years immediately preceding the date of said written charges;
B.	Where the Chiefs original written charges include alleged violations of Civil Service Rules concerning drug or alcohol abuse, any prior discipline on such violations found to have been committed within ten (10) years immediately preceding the date of said written charges;
C.	Where the Chiefs original written charges allege acts of incompetence, all prior discipline for acts of incompetence may be introduced by the Chief or the City so long as adequate records are maintained in accordance with Section 20 below, at the time of the act for which discipline was assessed; and
D.	Where the Chiefs original written charges allege a violation of any other Civil Service Rule, the Chief and the City may introduce prior discipline for a violation(s) of the same rule within two (2) years immediately preceding the date of said written charges, so long as adequate records are maintained in accordance with Section 20 below, at the time of the act for which discipline was assessed.
Section 20.	The City shall develop records, which, to the fullest extent possible, quantify the work done by each officer in each assignment. Such records shall be available by assignment upon specific request of officers appealing disciplinary actions or their representatives.
Section 21.	Section 143.056 of the Local Government Code regarding procedures after felony indictment and certain misdemeanor complaints shall be modified to provide:
A.	Should the Chief fail to charge the officer with a violation of Civil Service Rules within thirty (30) days following acquittal or dismissal of the criminal charges, the officer shall be reinstated with all back pay and benefits; and
B.	In the event an officer has been demoted or suspended, either temporarily or indefinitely, for any action which results in the officer being indicted for a felony or charged with a misdemeanor of Class B or above, no further action may be taken on the officer’s appeal until the completion of trial on the merits on those charges; except that a hearing on an officer’s appeal may be initiated prior to completion of trial on the merits by mutual agreement between the City and the officer. Delay of an appeal pending the results of criminal proceedings as specified above shall apply both to appeals to arbitration and appeals to the Commission pursuant to this Article.
ARTICLE 28
Internal Security Interview Procedure
Section 1.	Internal Investigations.
This procedure shall apply to all non-criminal investigations of misconduct by officers.
A.	An interview of the charged officer shall take place at a location designated by the investigating officer, usually at the police facility to which the officer is assigned or the Internal Affairs Office. The officer may bring his supervisor with him to the interview.
B.	The officer shall be informed of the rank, name and command of the officer in charge of the investigation, and the identity of all persons present during the interview. If an officer is directed to leave his post
48
and report for interview to another command, the officer’s assigned command shall be promptly notified of the officer’s whereabouts.
C.	The officer under investigation shall be informed forty-eight (48) hours prior to being interrogated or asked to otherwise respond to an investigation of the general nature of the investigation, and sufficient information to reasonably apprise the officer of the allegations shall be provided. The officer shall be allowed to review but not copy verbatim or photocopy any complaints, affidavits, or other written statements, which have been gathered as part of the administrative investigation. The officer shall not release the provided information to any person other than his attorney or representative.
D.	The interview shall be completed with reasonable dispatch. Reasonable respites shall be allowed. Time shall be provided also for personal necessities, meals, telephone calls, and rest periods as are deemed necessary.
E.	The officer shall not be subjected to any offensive language, nor shall he be threatened with transfer, dismissal or other disciplinary punishment. No promise of reward shall be made as an inducement to answering questions. Nothing herein is to be construed so as to prohibit the investigating officer from informing the officer under investigation that this conduct can become the subject of disciplinary action resulting in disciplinary punishment.
F.	In all cases where an officer is to be interviewed concerning an alleged act which, if proven, may result in any disciplinary action, the officer under investigation shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity and facilities to contact and consult privately with an attorney of his own choosing or a representative of the Association before being interviewed. An attorney of his own choosing or a representative may be present during the interview. A representative may not be a police officer who is related to the respondent, or a supervisor with involvement in the incident being investigated. Such representative may not participate in the interview except to counsel the officer, or to assert any rights afforded to the officer under this article in a manner which does not impair the ability of the investigator to conduct the interview and obtain information directly from the officer. At any time during the interview the officer under investigation may request to consult with his attorney or representative in private, prior to continuing the interview, provided that the investigator may impose reasonable limits on such conferences in order to complete a meaningful investigative interview and to obtain a written statement or response from the officer in the officer’s own words.
G.	If an officer is or maybe likely to be placed under arrest, that is if the officer under investigation is a suspect or the target of a criminal investigation, the officer shall be given his rights pursuant to the Miranda Decision. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the Chief to conduct administrative investigations nor shall anything in this subsection be construed to relieve the officer of his obligation to fully cooperate with said investigations, to comply with the Rules and Regulations and Procedures of the San Antonio Police Department, or to provide thorough, complete and truthful responses to requests for written statements and written interrogatories in connection with said administrative investigations. In all investigations where the officer is subject to a companion or concurrent criminal investigation, the Department shall ensure that any officer’s statement gathered as part of the administrative investigation shall not be released to the criminal investigating entity, except as required by a subpoena or required to be disclosed by law or Court decision.
H.	The officer under investigation shall be given an exact copy of any written statement he may execute.
I.	The refusal by an officer to answer pertinent questions concerning any administrative matter may result in disciplinary action.
J.	An officer shall have the right to have the interview tape recorded, provided the officer furnishes the tape and the recorder and advises all parties of the recording prior to the beginning of the interview session. The tapes shall remain in the custody of the Internal Affairs Unit of the Police Department but shall be available for review by the officer or the officer’s designated representative in the event the interview may result in disciplinary action, or a grievance.
49
K.	Neither an officer nor a representative of the Chief shall tape record a conversation between an officer and a representative of the Chief without disclosing intent to record prior to the conversation. Possession of a tape recording device within the Internal Affairs Unit, or possession while being interviewed by a representative of the Chief without disclosing its presence at the time of entry into the Internal Affairs Unit or at the time the interview commences outside the Unit shall be prima facie evidence of a violation under this section. Officers violating this section shall be subject to disciplinary action by the Chief.
Nothing in this section is to be construed to limit the authority of the Chief to authorize the wearing of a recording device during the investigation of criminal activity, which may include officer involvement.
L.	A polygraph examination may be required of an officer by the Chief only in the strictest confidence and where the complainant, and any complaining witnesses who give a written statement have been examined and found wholly truthful by a licensed examiner. The fact that an examination is ordered or administered and the results thereof shall not be disclosed by the Chief or the examiner to any person, except following execution of a written agreement between the Chief and the examined officer.
M.	The Chiefs office shall provide written notice, in a sealed envelope, to the individual officer of the final status of any complaint filed with the Internal Affairs Unit where the officer in question had to respond in writing to the complaint.
N.	The results of a formal investigation will be forwarded to the Advisory Action Board for recommendations.

The members to serve at each meeting shall be selected on a rotating basis from a panel of six (6) citizens of San Antonio appointed as set forth below. The Chairman shall be entitled to alter the rotating list in order to coordinate the schedules of the participants. The Chairman may approve agendas for matters not involving the use of force, bodily injury, or unlawful search or seizure, in instances where workload for the Board makes it necessary, which do not require the attendance of the citizen Board members. The Chairman shall schedule any complaint for civilian member participation, upon request by the officer or the complainant; if it is reasonably possible to do so based on the workload and availability of civilian members. Notice shall be given to the President of the Association. It is understood and agreed that the civilian members shall, nevertheless, be required to hear the full range of disciplinary cases and controversies presented to the Board, in order to develop an accurate sense of context and fairness.
2.	Members of the panel for the Citizen Advisory Action Board shall be selected by the City Council, which shall first nominate and submit to the association a list of not less than twenty-two (22), or more than thirty-three (33) individuals for service. The association, or its designated committee, shall have two (2) weeks to strike the list, approving at least eleven (11) individuals. Each party agrees that the selections and the final list shall be representative of the diversity of the community. From the remaining individuals, the City Council shall select the six (6) members to
50
serve on the panel.

3.	Citizens appointed to serve on the panel shall meet the minimum requirements for eligibility established under state statute for service on the Fire and Police Civil Service Commission and shall take an oath of office as members of the panel. In addition, no person shall be appointed to serve on this panel who has been indicted for a felony or a crime of moral turpitude. Members of the panel shall serve at the pleasure of the City Council, which may remove them, or replace them at any time, with or without cause.

The City Ethics ordinance shall apply to all members of the Citizen Advisory Action Board.
4.	Appointment and selection for the meetings of the Board shall be accomplished in sufficient time to be able to provide each appointee with not less than twenty-four (24) hours of training, including orientation work at Professional Standards, and one shift on the ride along program. The responsibility for the training of each new member of the panel shall fall upon the Commander of the Professional Standards Section.
5.	An accused officer has a right to privacy and all members of the CAAB shall respect that right to privacy. Each member of the uniform and citizen Board shall sign a pledge of confidentiality, agreeing to maintain the right of privacy as to privileged matters under applicable law. Any violation of this right shall be grounds for disqualification or removal from the panel, as set forth below. "Right to privacy" shall mean only the right of any accused officer of the department to have the allegations, facts, testimony and evidence brought before the Board held in confidence by the members hearing the case, and shall not extend to include any public information or information imparted to the Board members from public information, or from individuals not officially connected to the Internal Security process. The Chairman shall keep and maintain all records of the Board, and no members shall have or maintain any records other than during the meetings of the Board, or on department premises, in connection with their official duties. This article shall not be interpreted to impair or effect the right of any person, including the citizens on the Board, to make report of facts to the Chief of Police, the District Attorney, or the FBI, or to testily under subpoena, the rules of discovery, or order of any court; nor shall this article be interpreted to impair or affect the rights of any officer under Garrity vs. New Jersey or its progeny and Miranda vs. Arizona or its progeny.
6.	If any member of the Citizen Advisory Action Board is accused by an officer of a violation of the right to privacy, the Civil Service Commission shall convene and if a determination is made that a member of the Citizen Advisory Action Board violated an officer’s right to privacy, then the Civil Service Commission may remove that member. If the breach of privacy involves a direct report of confidential information by the member to the public or the press, removal by the Civil Service Commission shall be mandatory. In any event, the Civil Service Commission shall send a report of its findings and action to the City Council. The purpose of these hearings shall be to protect the interests of accused officers and the complainants, and shall not give rise to any rights on the part of the member accused of a breach of right to privacy.
D.	The CAAB shall meet in the Chiefs Conference Room, or other designated locations as determined by the Chairperson of the CAAB, in advance, at least twice each calendar month. The Chairperson shall prepare an agenda of cases to be considered, which shall be published forty-eight (48) hours prior to the meeting of the Board.

Attendance to these boards meetings where testimony is requested are entirely voluntary and complainants or defendants may elect to remove themselves at any stage of the
51
questioning by either board without fear of reprisal. The Chairperson of the CAAB shall determine the manner in which all meetings shall be conducted and shall be the determining factor as to the hearing of testimony by any person.
H.	Each board shall make independent recommendations and forward these recommendations to the Chief of Police. Such recommendations are advisory only and are not binding on the Chief. The Citizen Advisory Action Board may not conduct a separate independent investigation but may recommend to the Chief of Police that further investigations should be undertaken.
I.	Any matter which is brought before the CAAB, where a final ruling by the Chief of Police has occurred, the Chief of Police shall direct the Commander of the Professional Standards Section to notify the Complainant(s) and accused officers) as to the final disposition of the case within fifteen (15) working days.
“Right to privacy” shall mean only the right of any accused officer of the department to have the allegations, facts, testimony and evidence brought before the Board held in confidence by the members hearing the case, and shall not extend to or include any public information or information imparted to the Board members from public information, or from individuals not officially connected to the Internal Security process. This paragraph shall not impair or effect the right of any person to make a report of facts to the Chief of Police, the District Attorney or the FBI, or to testily under subpoena, the rules of discovery, or order of any court.
Section 3.	Chief’s City Vehicle Accident Advisory Action Board
A.	Effective with the execution of this Agreement, the Chief’s Advisory Action Board as described in Section 2 of this Article will no longer review cases involving city motor vehicle accidents.

The occurrence of two chargeable accidents within a two-year period will serve as a baseline for the Chief or the board to review individual cases and training needs. Ultimately, retraining will be determined on the basis of severity of the accidents, which may drastically differ from one case to another.
ARTICLE 29
Benefits
Section 1.	Active Police Officer Health Benefits*
A.	The City shall provide all active Police Officers who are eligible with family medical benefits and shall pay the full cost of said benefits as agreed upon herein. The minimum benefits provided are those as stated in the Master Contract Document for the City of San Antonio Uniform Employees and Uniform Prefund Retirees Health Benefit Program (hereinafter referred to as “Master Contract Document”) which is attached hereto and incorporated herein as Attachment 6. . Provisions and benefits specified in the Master Contract Document shall not be reduced during the life of this Agreement; however, the City reserves the right to change carriers or plan administrators at any time at its discretion. While the City is prohibited from reducing the provisions and benefits specified in the Master Contract Document during the life of this Agreement, a determination of what medical service is medically necessary for a particular patient or any reduction in the usual and customary allowable charge for that medical service will not be construed as a reduction in benefits; provided that the determination is made in
52
accordance with the procedures and criteria described in the Master Contract Document.
B.	Active Police Officers covered under this Agreement shall be granted the option of entering into or exiting from the flexible benefits program as provided for by the City to substitute for the basic program as outlined in this Agreement. Said option must be exercised by the active Police Officer during the City’s reenrollment period between the dates of October 1, and December 31, of each calendar year.
Section 2.	Retired Police Officer Health Benefits
A.	Retiree Benefits. The City shall also provide all retired Police Officers who are eligible with medical benefits. Retiree medical benefits shall be supplemental to Medicare benefits, only if the retiree is eligible for Medicare. Retirees shall not be required to purchase Medicare coverage if they have not qualified with the full 40 quarters for Medicare Part A. Upon reaching the age and established qualification criteria for Medicare eligibility, medical benefits under the Master Contract Document as primary coverage shall no longer be applicable, and medical benefits provided under the Master Contract Document shall convert to supplemental coverage only in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Master Contract Document. Once the retiree is eligible for Medicare, the retiree is required to apply for purchase and maintain Medicare Part B benefits. The benefits provided prior to Medicare eligibility are stated in the Master Contract Document.
Provisions and benefits specified in the Master Contract Document shall not be reduced during the life of this Agreement; however, the City reserves the right to change carriers or plan administrators at its discretion. While the City is prohibited from reducing the provisions and benefits specified in the Master Contract Document during the life of this agreement, any reasonable determination of what medical service is medically necessary for a particular patient, or any reduction in the usual and customary allowable charge will not be construed as a reduction in benefits, provided that the determination is made in accordance with the procedures and criteria described in the Master Contract Document.
Police Officers who retired on or after October 1, 1989 and before July 1, 1995, who became eligible for retiree medical benefits under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement executed June 1, 1995, between the City and Association shall continue to receive retiree medical benefits in accordance with that prior Collective Bargaining Agreement. Retiree medical benefits for Police Officers, who retire on or after July 2, 1995, shall be determined in accordance with collectively bargained agreements and the Master Contract Document between the City and the Association in effect when the service or treatment is provided.
B.	1. Contributions. The City has established a trust fund for prefunded retiree health care benefits for all eligible retired Police Officers (hereinafter referred to as “the Fund”) and, along with the police officers has increased its contribution levels for the purpose of establishing an actuarially sound retiree health benefit fund, evaluated over thirty years. The parties agreed in principle in 1995 that once an actuarially sound fund was established by current contribution levels, the responsibility for future contributions (made necessary by changes in circumstances, the economy, and the medical care system) would be jointly shared by the parties, and would be quantified and allocated by negotiation in future agreements. The City and the Association agree that “jointly shared” shall be defined as sharing on a 1/3 police officer, 2/3 City total annual contribution amount necessary to satisfy the actuarial needs of the fund.
Until November 1, 2003, the City shall contribute to the Fund a monthly amount equal to 9.4% of base pay plus longevity of all eligible police officers. Until November 1, 2003, all eligible police officers shall continue to contribute to the Fund a monthly amount of $20.00 each and every month.
Effective November 1, 2003, the City will increase its contributions to the Fund by $20.00 per month based on the number of all eligible police officers.
Officers of the San Antonio Police Department will contribute total monthly amounts as follows into the Prefunded Retirement Health Care Fund: beginning November 1, 2003 - (an additional $20) $40; April 1, 2004 -(an additional $10) $50; October 1, 2004 - (an additional $10) $60; and April 1, 2005 -(an additional $10) $70..
B.	2. Actuarial Study. The City and the Associations are conducting an actuarial study with a valuation
53
date of April 1, 2003. The City and the Associations (including the Local 624 IAFF) agree to conduct an additional actuarial study by March 31, 2005.The cost of the studies shall be paid by the City and deducted from its contribution to the Fund. The City and the Association may select any recognized actuarial firm with experience in handling self-funded municipal retiree health benefit programs.
The study shall evaluate the amount of monthly contributions necessary to provide benefits under the Fund and amortize the unfunded contingent liability up to a maximum of forty (40) years. The City and the Associations shall work with the Retiree Health Care Fund Board to obtain such accurate and complete information, as the actuary shall require. The assumptions utilized shall be determined by the actuary, provided that any material change in the assumptions shall be preceded by notice to the City and the Association, and an opportunity for input or conferences prior to completion of the study. Additionally, the City and the Associations shall provide written notice to the Retiree Health Care Fund Board of any meetings with the actuary to enable two (2 ) representatives of the Retiree Health Care Fund Board to attend.
The Association and City may request additional studies, revised assumptions, or develop scenarios, as it may deem necessary from the same firm, by paying for such additional services and deducting said amount from contributions to the fund. In the event that the March 31, 2005 study shows a higher contribution to be necessary (based on the actuarial computation of the normal cost for current employees, together with the additional amounts necessary to amortize the unfunded contingent liability up to a maximum of 40 years) The City and the Association agree to reopen negotiations to determine the contributions, if necessary, for the fiscal year commencing October 1, 2005. The City and SAPOA agree and acknowledge that the Retiree Health Care Fund is the responsibility of the City, police officers, and firefighters and all parties shall be present at any negotiations that occur on this topic in either collective bargaining process. Failure of either party to attend will not preclude the parties to continue negotiations. The City agrees to notify both Associations regarding these negotiations.
B. 3. Fact-finding Panel. The parties have agreed to utilize a fact-finding panel to determine the historic level of overall contributions by the officers and the City. The term “overall” shall mean the contributions, which have been made or agreed to be made since the beginning of the 1988 Collective Bargaining Agreement through the ending date of this Agreement, assuming contributions per its term. After October 1, 2004, the City and the Association shall contact, in writing, the Human Resources Director, who will request a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals experienced in retiree health care fund matters from the American Arbitration Association. The parties may mutually agree on the selection of a fact-finding panel of three (3). If they do not so agree, the parties shall alternately strike up to two (2) names each from the list of seven (7) qualified neutrals within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of the list. The remaining three (3) names on the list shall comprise the fact-finding panel. The fact-finding panel shall be immediately notified of the collective sessions. The parties agree to commence factfinding no later than forty-five (45) calendar days from selection of the panel.
The Association and the City will provide to the panel information to enable the panel to determine the past credits, allowances, and contributions from the Police Officers and City to the Fund. The panel must make a decision based on the contractual agreement and any bargaining history, which is necessary to address ambiguities and to determine concessions not reflected in the agreements. The panel may hear evidence and arguments on all theories of contribution or credit by either party, and shall determine which are relevant or meritorious.
B. 4. Panel Adjustment. The fact-finding process mentioned above in B. 3. may include the IAFF, Local 624, if they agree to reopen negotiations to participate. In such event, the Human Resources Director shall obtain a list of nine (9) qualified neutrals experienced in retiree health care fund matters from the American Arbitration Association, from which the City and each Association, respectively, may strike two (2) names from the list, resulting in a panel of three (3), and the process shall proceed in the same manner as described in B.3. above. A separate determination shall be made regarding the historic level of overall contributions by the firefighters and the City.
B.5. Contribution Adjustments. The City will seek to renegotiate the agreement with the San Antonio FireFighters, IAFF, Local 624, which became effective June 3, 2002 and will expire September 30, 2005,to increase contributions. If the firefighters are not willing to adjust the contributions as necessary, the City agrees to make up the contribution to the 9.4%, together with the lost investment return no later than twelve (12) months after the effective date of the next firefighter agreement.
54
It is understood and agreed, however, that the police officers shall have no duty or obligation to increase contributions as a result of any delay in increasing City or firefighter contributions under their separate Collective Bargaining Agreement.
C.	Nothing herein shall prevent the parties from mutually agreeing to a new schedule of benefits based upon actuarial projections or agreeing to transfer to the PreFund Trust the obligation and responsibility of establishing and maintaining a schedule of benefits based upon actuarial projections. The Association has obtained this provision to meet and confer on the basis of its commitment and agreement that any change, by contract or legislation, which removes any control over contributions and/or benefit levels from the City and the Association shall be subject to collective bargaining. The City and the Association agree that the 1/3 police officer, 2/3 City funding ratio is in the best interest of both the City and the police officers. The City and the Association recognize 1% of the FY2006 base wage increase of 4% is attributable to the agreement by both parties defining “jointly shared” in Section 2.B.I. to mean 1/3 police officer, 2/3 City, in a manner comparable to the pension funding ratio. Any alternation of this definition as defined in 2.B.1 or ratio by future legislation, unless approved or endorsed by the City Council, which departs from or overrides the 1/3 police officer and 2/3 ’s City total annual contribution will result in the discontinuation of that 1% of the base wage level. Both parties agree to work together, in any capacity necessary, to maintain the agreed upon ratio and definition of “jointly shared” and the 1% base wage increase.
D.	Spouses of retired Police Officers shall be eligible to receive the benefits as set forth in the Master Contract Document. Medical benefits shall be supplemental to Medicare benefits once the spouse individually qualifies for Medicare coverage. Spouses of retired Police Officers shall pay a portion of the annual health plan to retain coverage at a rate based on the tenure of the Police Officer to whom the spouse was married. Beginning with a Police Officer, who served 20 years or less, the spousal rate will be 30% of the health plan premium (the COBRA formula premium as enumerated in Chapter 2 of the Master Contract Document). From 21 years to 30 years of tenure, for each year of tenure above 20, the spousal rate will decrease by 3% of the health plan premium until it is 0% for a spouse of a Police Officer with 30 years of tenure. Once the retired Police Officer becomes eligible for Medicare, the spousal rate will become 0% of the annual health plan premium.
E.	Spouses of deceased police officers shall be entitled to benefits provided for spouses of retired police officers, in the event that the deceased officer died in the line of duty, or was eligible for retirement at the time of death. Line of duty shall mean any occurrence wherein the officer was exercising the power and authority of a certified peace officer, whether or not scheduled for duty at the time of death. Spouses of officers not eligible for retirement or acting in the line of duty at the time of death shall be entitled to continue coverage by paying the applicable COBRA formula premium (as enumerated in Chapter 2 of the Master Contract Document), until death or remarriage.
F.	Upon retirement, the Police Officer may elect to cover any other eligible dependents (other than spouse) in accordance with the Master Contract Document. The retiree shall pay 100% of the health plan premium (the COBRA formula premium as enumerated in Chapter 2 of the Master Contract Document) for each other eligible dependent.
Section 3.	Retired Police Officers covered under this Agreement shall be granted the option of entering into or exiting from the flexible benefits program as provided for by the City to substitute for the basic program as outlined in Section 2 above. Said option must be exercised by the retired Police Officer during the City’s reenrollment period between the dates of October 1 and December 31 of each calendar year. Officers who retire from the San Antonio Police Department and who become employed by the City as a full time permanent civilian employee shall have the option of enrolling in the civilian flexible benefits program provided by the City as primary coverage at which time medical benefits provided under the Master Contract Document shall convert to secondary coverage in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Master Contract Document. A retired police officer may choose not to emoll in the civilian flexible benefits program in which case the medical benefits provided under the Master Contract Document shall be primary.
Section 4.	Medical benefits provided for herein as to retirees and their spouses shall be supplemental to Medicare/Medicaid benefits. Once the spouse is individually eligible for Medicare, each such person is required to
55
apply for, purchase, and maintain Medicare benefits. Upon the death of a retiree police officer who became a police officer on or after October 1, 1988, the plan shall pay the applicable Part B Medicare premium for a surviving spouse until death or remarriage. The Plan Administrator may approve any alternate health care coverage provided by the spouse of a retired or deceased police officer, in lieu of Medicare coverage, to comply with this requirement. The health plan will serve as supplemental coverage as benefits or coverage levels not otherwise provided by Medicare, to the extent permitted by federal law.
Section 5.	This agreement, and the Master Contract Document for health benefits adopted herein, shall control the available health benefits during the term of this agreement, for active police officers. The supplemental insurance coverage provisions for retired police officers and spouses shall control available health benefits during the term of this agreement for retired police officers and spouses.
Section 6.	Health care benefits for active or retired Police Officers shall not be terminated, altered, modified or reduced except by amendments or successors to this Agreement.
Section 7.	It is understood and agreed that the provisions of this agreement and the Master Contract Document for health benefits have been drafted in substantial and material reliance upon existing provisions of federal and state law concerning employee health benefits. Any change in federal or state law or regulations which changes the obligations of either party, the applicability or extent of Medicare benefits, or materially alters the assumptions relied upon in negotiations shall entitle the City or the Association to reopen negotiations concerning health benefits.
Section 8.	The City and the Association agree that no less than six months prior to the contractual reopener required in the fourth year of this Agreement, a committee will be jointly convened to discuss the feasibility of inclusion of Hearing Aids in the Master Health Document for officers retiring after October 1, 2003. Consideration will include, but not be limited to, inclusion as part of all benefits provided, inclusion as a separate individually costed benefit; requirements for eligibility; and number of aids provided within a designated year span.
Section 9.	Health Benefits Re-opener - In an effort to coordinate the provisions outlined in this article with the scheduled collective bargaining cycle of the San Antonio Professional Firefighters’ Association, due to begin prior to the expiration of the IAFF agreement in 2005, the City and the Association agree to reopen any portions of this Article during such negotiations in order to facilitate the development of a consistent approach and language in both agreements. The parties shall have the same statutory duty to bargain in good faith as to all issues which relate to the health and retirement health benefits under these agreements.

Section 2.	Commitment to Effective Drug Interdiction Program.
The City and the Association agree that officers may be called upon in hazardous situations without warning, and that it is imperative to the interest of officers and the public to ensure that officers are not substances impaired. In order to further their joint interest in protecting officers and the public, effective January 1, 2000, the City and the Association agree to mandatory drug testing as described in this section.
One Hundred Percent (100%) of officers of all ranks, including the Chief, shall be susceptible to mandatory drug testing during each calendar year on a fair and impartial statistical basis at the City’s expense. The fair and impartial statistical basis (in which each officer has an equal chance of being selected during a calendar year) shall be by a non-discriminatory computerized program operated and certified as non-discriminatory by an independent firm hired by the City, and the officer shall be tested upon being selected by the computer.
The City and the Association have a mutual interest in ensuring that drug impaired officers do not perform law enforcement duties. The City and the Association agree that the purpose of the mandatory drug testing policy is not to punish an officer who has not violated the Police Department’s rules, regulations, policies or procedures. The City and the Association are committed to the principle that the mandatory drug testing policy for officers is designed and shall be administered to result in disciplinary action only against those officers who have violated the Police Department’s rules, regulations, policies or procedures.
Where an officer appears unable or unwilling to give a specimen at the time of the test, testing will document the circumstances surrounding the inability or unwillingness. The officer will be permitted no more than four (4) hours to provide the sample during which time he will remain in the testing area under observation. Reasonable amounts of fluids may be given to the officer to encourage urination. Failure to provide a sample may be considered a refusal to submit to a drug test.
Officers shall have the right to request that their urine sample be stored in case of legal disputes. The urine sample will be submitted to the designated testing facility where a sample will be maintained for a period of one-year. Officers may at their own expense request to have the test administered at a qualified physician’s office or certified testing laboratory, accompanied by the testing personnel provided such testing is administered within five (5) hours after notification by the Chief (and the sample shall be properly handled by a certified testing laboratory)..
Drug testing shall consist of a two-step procedure:
A.	Initial screening test.
B.	Confirmation test.
Should a confirmation test be required, the test procedure will be technologically different and more sensitive than the initial screening test.
The City and the Association will agree within one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days as to a SAMHSA/CAP FUDTP certified laboratory selected to conduct drug testing. The laboratory selected shall be experienced and capable of quality control documentation, chain of custody and have a demonstrated technical expertise and proficiency in urinalysis and shall comply with all requirement of SAMHSA/CAP FUDTP. The City shall require any laboratory selected for collecting samples, to conduct a background investigation on those laboratory personnel involved in the collecting or handling of an unsealed sample. In addition, the City shall require any laboratory selected for collecting samples to use only employees who have not been arrested by officers of the San Antonio Police Department or convicted of a felony or misdemeanor crime involving dishonest conduct or possession of illegal drugs to be involved in the collecting or handling of an unsealed sample collected from an officer. Test results shall be inadmissible in any administrative disciplinary hearing if it is determined that the laboratory collecting samples failed to conduct a background investigation on the laboratory personnel involved in collecting or handling the unsealed sample which resulted in a positive test result.
All records pertaining to the department required drug tests shall remain confidential except to the extent used in a disciplinary process and appeal. Drug test results and records shall be stored in a locked file under the control of the
64
Chief. The Chief will maintain original copies submitted by the laboratory. No access to these files shall be allowed without written approval of the Chief.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Chief from conducting a drug test on an officer based upon reasonable suspicion in accordance with the guidelines as set forth by this section.
For the purposes of this section:
A.	“drug testing” shall be defined as the compulsory production and submission of urine by an
officer for chemical analysis to detect the presence of prohibited drug usage.
B.	“reasonable suspicion” shall be defined as a judgment/conclusion that a person is unable to
safely and/or effectively perform their duties due to the suspected influence of drugs, alcohol, or inhalants. Reasonable suspicion is based on specific, observable facts that an officer may be under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or inhalants.

Section 1.	Police Personnel Unit.
A.	The City shall implement a Police Personnel Unit. Such unit shall be staffed with a minimum of one (1) Sergeant or above, support personnel, and the operational equipment, i.e., computers.

All premium relief days shall be filled or abolished in accordance with current practice within thirty (30) calendar days. For purposes of this section, premium relief days shall be defined as Thursday/Friday, Friday/Saturday, Saturday/Sunday, and Sunday/Monday.
A. Thirty (30) Day Exception.
The thirty (30) day requirement shall be waived from February 24 through the last day of Fiesta each year. Officers having transferred into any assignment and who meet their six month requirement for seniority eligibility during the Fiesta break will be eligible only for premium days that become available after their six month eligibility has been met.
For example, an officer who meets his six-month requirement on March 15th would not be eligible for any premium relief days that become available before that date.
It is agreed and understood that only prime relief days that become available during the waived Fiesta period can be guaranteed to the most eligible officer under this exception clause. All non-premium relief days that would have become available as a result of the guaranteed transfer that would have taken place were it not within the Fiesta period, and that are not premium relief days will be filled in accordance with available openings after the waived Fiesta period ends. All premium relief days being vacated during the Fiesta period shall be filled within thirty (30) days after the last day of Fiesta.
While it is understood that situations may arise when there will be legitimate reasons for eliminating a particular set of relief days, premium relief days shall not be abolished for the purpose of compliance with this section.
Section 4.	Nepotism.
No officer shall be allowed to work under the direct supervision of a relative. Relatives may be co-workers in the same division. No officer shall be allowed to exercise his seniority in applying for positions that would place him under the direct supervision of a relative.

In demonstrating this commitment, officers who participate and meet standards as established in a police academy sponsored wellness program or who score the standards set out in this section during annual in-service training shall be awarded the administrative leave incentives outlined herein.
A.	Academy Sponsored Wellness Program:
67
Officers may elect to participate in a personalized wellness program individually designed for the officer by the staff of the police academy. Officers participating in personalized programs will have administrative leave incentives set by staff members. Personalized incentives will be awarded in accordance with personalized goals and objectives met by the individual officer involved. The Academy Commander will approve all individual wellness programs and award incentives of 1 to 5 days in accordance with this Agreement and the success of the individual officer in achievement of the designed goals and objectives which will be measured by the fitness test.
B.	In-Service Physical Standards -
A PT staff member will monitor each officer’s sit-ups, push-ups, vertical jump, mile and one-half run, dummy drag and stationary or bicycle ride. The sit-ups, push-ups and vertical jump will be monitored on a one-on-one basis.
1.	Sit-ups
Sit-ups are accomplished by placing arms across the chest or behind the head. Knees are raised rather than flat on the ground. A sit-up is counted when the elbows touch the knees, the front of the thigh or break the plane of the upper leg. Officers are allowed to rest between sit-ups. Point value, time limits, and repetitions are set annually.
2.	Push-ups
Lying in a horizontal position and pushing the body off the floor by use of the arms accomplish a push-up. A push-up is counted when the knees are off the floor and the arms extended straight perpendicularly to the floor. There is no disqualification for the body not being straight as it leaves the floor. Officers are allowed to rest between push-ups. Point values, time limits, and the number repetitions are set annually.
3.	Vertical Jump
Standing still and jumping straight up into the air in a vertical manner accomplishes a vertical jump as per Cooper’s standards. The vertical leap is the difference between a person’s extended reach when standing flat on the floor and the apex of his/her extended reach during the jump. Point value and height requirements are set annually.
4.	Mile and One-Half Run and/or Walk
Running, walking, or a combination of the two over a designated time period accomplishes the mn and/or walk. The walk may be conducted indoors or out-doors depending on weather conditions and individual officer preference. The time of the exercise is from the moment the individual leaves the starting point until the time he or she completes one and a half-miles. Point value and in accordance with time is set annually.
5.	Stationary or Bicycle Ride
A stationary or bicycle ride is accomplished when an officer rides a stationary or actual bicycle for a measured 5-mile distance in 20 minutes or less. The ride must be at a steady pace without rest periods. Officers desiring to accomplish an actual ride must provide their own bicycles. Point value in accordance with time is set annually
6.	Sprint, Wall, Drag
The sprint, wall, drag is accomplished by an individual sprinting from a starting line 40 yards, climbing over a 5 foot wall, and dragging a 168 pound dummy 25 feet to a finish line. There are no disqualifications as long as an individual accomplishes the exercise.
7.	Weight Control Program
Officers are weighed each time they elect to take the physical fitness test. One point is given for each pound of weight loss from the previous years test or in cases where officers are close to their ideal weight, one point is given for each pound of weight lost or gained towards his or her ideal weight. For purposes of this section, ideal weight is defined by the Academy Standards in conjunction with the USAF and US Army standards.
68
C.	Physical Fitness Panel (For in-service only):
Beginning December 2003 and during October of each year preceding the starting date of each yearly in-service training, the Chief and the President of the Association shall appoint three (3) members each (six total) to a physical fitness panel. It will be the sole responsibility of this panel to set point values, time limits, and the necessary requirements for achieving incentives for the next years in-service. Through the use of both the most current Physical Fitness Standard number scale criteria, and the previous year testing results, the committee will set standards which best create a performance curve of the department and provide incentives based on performance according to sex and age groupings. Utilizing the performance curve and dividing it into six equal parts, a score of one hundred and fifty (150) being the lowest, 4/6 of the department will be eligible for physical fitness incentives. Five days being the maximum, with four days, three days and two days being the other distribution. Should the panel fail to reach an agreement on any item relating to point values, time limits, or necessary requirements, the item(s) of contention only will be forwarded to the Chief. The Chiefs decision shall be final.
D.	Incentives
Officers who successfully complete any combination of exercises and who score within the predesignated total point range will receive the corresponding physical fitness incentive of two (2) to five (5) administrative leave days.
Officers who participate in the physical fitness program for three consecutive years during inservice and who do not receive an incentive shall receive one-day administrative leave for their participating in the program. For purposes of this section the physical fitness panel shall define participation for each year.
Officers may select five of the six events in which to participate in to achieve their goal. Weight loss is not an event but will be counted towards the officers overall score. No points will be subtracted for not participating in any individual event.
Officers on light duty, that have a documented injury or who miss participating due to departmental business or other emergency may schedule a make-up with the PT staff.
The award of administrative leave or lack thereof shall not be the grounds for a grievance. Decision by academy staff as to the actual individual completion times or individual completion of exercise requirements shall be final. This leave shall be awarded the following January of each year and must be used during that calendar year. There will be no carry over of administrative leave from year to year. There will be no carry-over of administrative leave and it must be used during the year issued. Use of administrative leave will be governed by the same mles as utilized for vacation leave.
E.	Calendar Year 2003 In-service
All officers who participated in the physical fitness testing for calendar year 2003 and who scored a minimum of 150 points during in-service, as determined by the PT staff, shall be eligible for 2 days administrative leave. Any officer who failed to take the PT examine during in-service or failed the physical fitness test may do so prior to December 19th 2003. Posting of times and dates for retesting will be announced in the bulletin. Testing will be conducted on the officers own time. This leave shall be awarded January 1, 2004 and must be used during that calendar year. Awards of leave in subsequent calendar years shall be accomplished during the month of January following the year earned. There will be no carry-over of administrative leave and it must be used during the year issued. Use of administrative leave will be governed by the same rules as utilized for vacation leave.

COPIES TO- file________________________________________________________________________
SUBJECT■.___An Impasse Procedure for Collective Bargaining_____________________________
Background
The proposed ordinance is submitted in accordance with the Council's directive (Resolution of December 13, 1979) to develop an impasse procedure to be utilized during the 1980-'81 Fire and Police Contract Negotiations, in the event the parties fail to reach agreement.
It is felt the procedures outlined offer the best compromise available to insure good faith bargaining for the upcoming contract talks. The ordinance is designed to self-destruct after the 1980 negotiations; and any impasse procedure beyond this time period should be bargained and included in future contracts, if agreement can be reached.
Conclusion and Recommendation
The ordinance provides an impasse procedure which is workable and which is in the best interest of the City. It is recommended for adoption with the understanding that all parties will negotiate in good faith toward agreement on a reasonable and workable procedure to be included in future contracts.

ADOPTING THE CITY’S OFFICER AND EMPLOYEE LIABILITY PLAN POLICY AND REPLACING ORDINANCE NO. 62206, ADOPTED IN JANUARY 1986.
* * * * *
WHEREAS, the current Ordinance adopted as Ordinance No. 62206, in January 1986, lacks procedural detail and clarity, causing concerns as to “acts” covered and excluded under the Indemnification Policy; lacks detail in procedures that officers and employees need to follow in order to be entitled to indemnification; and causes confusion as to when the City will pay for employee’s outside counsel, and
WHEREAS, a new Ordinance is needed to define “acts” and to formalize the procedural process; NOW THEREFORE:
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN ANTONIO:
SECTION 1.	This Ordinance formally adopts the City of San Antonio Officer and Employee Liability Plan Policy (“the Plan”). It replace Ordinance No. 62206, adopted in January 1986. The Plan indemnifies City officers and employees in connection with legal proceedings arising from the performance of their duties.
SECTION 2.	This Policy will clarify the rights and responsibilities of the City, and of the officer or employee, and will simplify the process of responding in a timely manner to the initiation of litigation. The Plan shall consist of the policies, rights, and duties embodied in this Ordinance, and shall be implemented and administered as provided by this Ordinance.
SECTION 3.	The proposed Ordinance defines “acts” that are covered and excluded. If the City denies coverage, the Plan member may seek a determination from the court as to whether they are entitled to coverage; it will formalize the procedural process, in that officers and employees are given specific procedures in order to request indemnification.
SECTION 4.	The City Attorney or his designee will represent the Plan member unless a conflict arises, then the Plan member must select an approved private attorney for representation. The City will not pay for any costs or legal fees incurred by the Plan member if they utilize an attorney not approved by the City Attorney and Risk Manager, unless required by law.
SECTION 5.	The Plan does not affect police/fire personnel under their present labor contracts.

SUBJECT: Indemnification Ordinance__________________________________________________________
Date: March 26, 1996
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
This Ordinance formally adopts the City of San Antonio Officer and Employee Liability Plan Policy (“the Plan”). It replaces Ordinance No. 62206, adopted in January 1986. The Plan indemnifies City officers and employees in connection with legal proceedings arising from the performance of their duties. This Policy will clarify the rights and responsibilities of the City, and of the officer or employee, and will simplify the process of responding in a timely manner to the initiation of litigation. The Plan does not affect police/fire personnel under their present labor contracts. The Plan shall consist of the policies, rights, and duties embodied in this Ordinance, and shall be implemented and administered as provided by this Ordinance.
Staff recommends approval of this Ordinance.
BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
The current Ordinance was adopted as Ordinance No. 62206, in January 1986, but lacks procedural detail and clarity, causing concerns as to “acts” covered and excluded under the Indemnification Policy. The Ordinance also lacks detail in procedures that officers and employees need to follow in order to be entitled to indemnification; and causes confusion as to when the City will pay for employee’s outside counsel.
The proposed Ordinance defines “acts” that are covered and excluded. If the City denies coverage, the Plan member may seek a determination from the court as to whether they are entitled to coverage. In addition, it will formalize the procedural process, in that officers and employees are given specific procedures in order to request indemnification. The City Attorney or his designee will represent the Plan member unless a conflict arises, then the Plan member must select an approved private attorney for representation. The City will not pay for any costs or legal fees incurred by the Plan member if they utilize an attorney not approved by the City Attorney and Risk Manager, unless required by law.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Formal adoption of this Ordinance will not necessitate a current budget amendment, as expenditures will be approved on a case-by-case basis in connection with each individual lawsuit.

SUBJECT:
Vehicles and Uniforms of the ICE Unit
Date: Oct. 26, 1999
On the signing and ratification of the current Collective Bargaining agreement, we agree that within 60 days, the vehicles assigned to the ICE unit, which is currently 14 vehicles, will be modified in their markings so as to not resemble police vehicle markings and done in proportion to the number of Civilian assignments. This change will consist of replacing the light-bar covers and red and blue overhead lights as well as vehicle decals. It is understood that this change will be in place for the duration of this contract. It is understood that on occasion, when a shortage of vehicles may exist either in the Civilian ICE vehicles or in the Sworn ICE vehicles, officers and civilians may have occasion to need to drive a plain vehicle or a marked uniform vehicle. The occasion to necessitate this action, though temporary in nature, will not constitute a grieavable action. We agree that should such a temporary occurrence happen, management will rectify this as soon as possible.
Within the same 60-day time frame, we agree to modify the Civilian ICE Uniform in such a manner as to limit the similarities between uniform and civilian personnel.

This Master Contract defines and provides for coverage and administration for the benefits common to uniform City employees, and retirees. The variations in coverage applicable to such classes are set forth in specific appendices to this Master Contract, including but not limited to Firefighters and Police Officers.

This plan is open to uniform City employees and retired uniform City employees.
The benefits provided and defined in this Master Contract are self-funded by the City of San Antonio at the time this document was drafted, but the City of San Antonio is entitled to reinsure any portion of its obligations hereunder, and additionally may contract for any carrier acceptable to the City Council to assume and administer coverage and benefits under this document.
ANY BENEFITS UNDER THE CITY'S INSURANCE OR SELF FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS DETERMINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL IN ANY BUDGET YEAR, OR BY AMENDMENT OR OTHER LAWFUL CHANGE TO THE APPLICABLE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

CHAPTER 1
GENERAL PLAN COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
Eligible Employee
Full-time City employees (authorized full-time equivalent) are eligible to participate in the Plan on the date their employment begins. Coverage begins on the date of hire, or upon taking office and performing work for the City of San Antonio, whichever occurs later.
A new employee who is not actively at work because of medical disability will not become covered under the Plan until the date the employee is actively at work.
Eligible Dependent
An Eligible Dependent is:
(1)	The Eligible Employee's spouse. A spouse that is legally separated under a court decree under the laws of another state shall not be an eligible dependent,
(2)	All natural children including legally adopted, under legal guardianship of the Covered Employee and who have not yet reached their twentieth birthday, provided the children have never been married and are principally dependent upon the Eligible Employee, as directed by court order, for support and maintenance. Foster children are not Eligible Dependents under this Plan, unless there has been an application for adoption accepted by the Texas Department of Human Services. Stepchildren are Eligible Dependents during the marriage between the Eligible Employee and the natural parent of the child, so long as (a) they permanently reside in the employee's household, and (b) are principally dependent on the employee.
In addition to the above, children will be considered as Eligible Dependents from age twenty (20) through age twenty-three (23), if they are full-time students, have never been married, and are principally dependent upon the Eligible Employee for support and maintenance.
The term "Eligible Dependent" shall not include anyone who is covered as an Eligible Employee. An Eligible Dependent shall not be entitled to any additional benefits or coverage by virtue of the fact that both parents, step parents or guardians are employed by the City.
Eligible Retiree
Any eligible City employee that retires under the rules of the Fire and Police Pension Fund will be eligible for the City's retiree health program.
Retired Employee's Dependents
If you retire and are eligible to receive retirement benefits you may continue your dependents' coverage, subject to the payment of any applicable premiums without lapse. Only Dependents who participate in the Plan at the time of the eligible employee's retirement are eligible. Eligible dependent children shall not include anyone who is covered as an eligible employee under the Plan.
Incapacitated Dependent
An Eligible Dependent child who is physically or mentally incapable of self-support upon attaining the age of twenty (20) years, shall continue to be an Eligible Dependent while remaining incapacitated, unmarried and continuously covered under the Plan. An eligible incapacitated dependent must be solely dependent on the employee, and must be incapacitated by a disability that arose while such dependent was a covered dependent. To continue eligibility under this provision, proof of incapacity must be submitted by the employee at least thirty-one (31) days prior to such child's attainment of age twenty (20).
Effective Date of Coverage
Coverage does not become effective until the Eligible Employee completes the City's enrollment document.
Newborn infants will be covered from the date of birth as long as the employee is covered under this plan and coverage for the newborn child is requested within 31 days of the child's date of birth. If coverage of a newborn is not requested within 31 days of the child's date of birth, then coverage cannot become effective until the next re-enrollment period.
Eligible Dependents who are enrolled after the effective date of this Plan will become covered on the date such dependent is acquired, provided that the covered Employee enrolls such dependent within 31 days of the date the dependent is acquired. If coverage of a dependent is not requested within 31 days of the date the dependent was acquired, the coverage cannot become effective until the next reenrollment period.
If a new employee is not actively at work, coverage shall take effect on the date the individual returns to work.
If an Eligible Dependent (except a newborn child whose mother was covered under the Plan at the time of the child's birth) is confined in a hospital, residential treatment center, nursing home, convalescent hospital or rehabilitation facility at the time of the Eligible Dependent's effective date, the dependent's coverage shall not become effective until he is no longer confined. Confinement shall be construed to continue when the patient leaves the institution for a temporary period for therapeutic reasons or with a reasonable expectation that the patient will return to the institution to resume treatment.
Change of Family Status
If there is a legal change in family status, the employee has thirty-one (31) calendar days to notify the Employee Benefits Office in writing. The notice may be given by personally appearing in the Benefits Office and completing a change of dependent coverage form.
If there is no change in family status or if notice is not given for additional coverage within thirty-one (31) days after the legal change in status, no change can become effective until the next reenrollment period, which shall be not less than thirty -one (31) days, occurring during the months of October or November, as the Plan Administrator shall determine, or as otherwise established by the City Council.
A legal change in family status includes: divorce; marriage; birth or adoption of a child, including a child living with the adopting parents during the period of probation; change in employment status for the employee's spouse; or ineligibility of a child due to age, or change in student status.

The date employment terminates;
(3)	The date all coverage or certain benefits are terminated in a particular class by modification of the Plan; and
(4)	The date an active Eligible Employee is covered under a qualified Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or any other available alternative health care delivery system for the employee or dependents of the employee.
Termination of Coverage for Dependents
Coverage with respect to the Covered Person's dependents shall terminate under the Plan at the earliest time specified below:
(1)	Upon termination of employment for the covered employee;
(2)	On the date dependents cease to be eligible as defined in the Plan.
Termination of Coverage for Failure to Pay Premium
Coverage with respect to any Covered person for which a premium or contribution is required shall terminate 31 days after the due date for such premium, or as soon thereafter as otherwise allowed by law.
Documentation
The Plan Administrator is entitled to require relevant legal documentation to be furnished with any request for coverage or change in status.
CHAPTER 2
COBRA PROVISIONS
Continuation Coverage
On April 7, 1986, a federal law was enacted requiring that most employers sponsoring group health plans offer employees, retirees and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage (called "continuation coverage") at group rates in certain instances where coverage under the plan would otherwise end. This law is called the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, better known as COBRA. This notice is intended to inform employees and retirees, in a summary fashion, of rights and obligations under the continuation coverage provisions of COBRA. The employee, retiree and spouse should take the time to read this notice carefully.
“Qualified Beneficiary" means:
a.	you, as a Covered Employee, for termination or reduced hours;
b.	your spouse or your dependent child if he/she was a dependent under the Plan on the
day before your Qualifying Event occurred; or
c.	a child who is born to a Covered Employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage.
"Qualifying Event for a Covered Employee" means a loss of coverage due to:
a.	termination of employment for any reason other than gross misconduct; or
b.	reduction in hours of employment.
"Qualifying Event for a Covered Dependent" means a loss of coverage due to:
a.	a Covered Employee's termination of employment for any reason other than a gross misconduct or reduction in hours of employment;
b.	a Covered Employee's death; a spouse's divorce or legal separation from a Covered Employee;
c.	a Covered Employee's entitlement to Medicare; or
d.	a dependent child's loss of dependent status under the Plan.
"Timely contribution payment” means contribution payment must be made within 30 days of the due date or within such longer period as applies to or under the Plan.
Continuation of Health Coverage. Continuation of health coverage shall be available to you and/or your Covered Dependents upon the occurrence of a Qualifying Event. To continue health coverage, the Plan Administrator must be notified of a Qualifying Event by:
a.	the Employer, within 30 days of such event, if the Qualifying Event is:
1.	for a Covered Dependent, the Covered Employee's death;
2.	the Covered Employee's termination other than for gross misconduct or reduction in hours;
3.	for a Covered Dependent, the Covered Employee's entitlement to Medicare.
b.	you ora Qualified Beneficiary, within 60 days of such event, if the Qualifying Event is:
1.	for a spouse, divorce, or legal separation from a Covered Employee; or
2.
for a dependent child, loss of dependent status under the Plan.
The Plan Administrator must, within 14 days of receiving such notice, notify any Qualified Beneficiary of his/her continuation right. Notice to a Qualified Beneficiary who is your spouse shall be notice to all other Qualified Beneficiaries residing with such spouse when such notice is given.
Upon termination of employment or reduction in hours, to continue health coverage for 29 months, a Qualified Beneficiary who is determined under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act to be disabled on such date or at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage, must notify the Plan Administrator of such disability within 60 days from the date of determination and before the end of the 18 month period. If a Qualified Beneficiary entitled to the disability extension has nondisabled family members who are entitled to COBRA continuation coverage, the non-disabled family members are also entitled to the disability extension.
Qualified Beneficiaries who are disabled under Title II or Title XVI of the Social Security Act must notify the Plan Administrator within 30 days from the date of final determination that they are not longer disabled.

CHAPTER 11	PREFERRED PROVIDER NETWORK
Preferred Provider Network
The City of San Antonio participates in a Preferred Provider Network of hospitals, physicians and other providers that are contracted to furnish, at negotiated costs, medical care for the City employees and their dependents. The use of a Preferred Provider may result in reduced out of pocket expenses to the Covered Person.
A current listing of the Preferred Provider Network contracting hospitals, physicians and other providers is available in the Employee Benefits Office. A Covered Person may choose any health care provider.
The City reserves the right to terminate or modify the Preferred Provider Network program, or any portion thereof, at any time.
CHAPTER 12	EMPLOYEE SELF-AUDIT PROGRAM
On inpatient hospital bills under $3,000.00 the Plan will make a cash presentation to any employee who (1) detects a billing overcharge made by a hospital as a result of an inpatient confinement to any covered family member and (2) receives a billing adjustment and (3) the Plan realizes a savings.
Upon discharge from the hospital, simply review the bill. If there is any error, it may be in one of the following area:
A Calculation Error
A charge for service the patient did not receive.
The patient received a service but not in the quantity indicated.
Remember, take the original bill and obtain a corrected bill and present both to the City Claims Administrator for review and determination. The Plan will pay the employee 25% of the savings or maximum of $500, whichever is less. As an example, if an employee detects an incorrect charge of $1,200 and this is confirmed, the employee will receive a check for 25% of the savings, or $300 from the Plan.
CHAPTER 13	COORDINATION OF BENEFITS (COB)
The COB provision is designed to correct over coverage which occurs when a person has health coverage for the same expenses under two (2) or more of the plans listed below. Should this type of duplication occur, the benefits under this Plan will be coordinated with those of the other plans so that the total benefits from all plans will not exceed the expenses actually incurred.
If a Covered Person's benefits under another health plan are reduced due to cost containment provisions, such as a second surgical opinion, pre-certification, HMO or preferred provider arrangements, the amount of the reduction shall not be considered as an allowable expense under this Plan.
The benefits provided by the plans listed below are considered in determining duplication of coverage:
1.	This Plan;
2.	Any other group insurance or prepayment plan, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs); Blue Cross/Blue Shield;
3.	Any labor-management trusteed plan, union welfare plan, employer organization plan or
employee benefit organization plan;
4.	Any government plan or statute providing benefits for which COB is not prohibited by law.
Order of Benefit Determination
Certain rules are used to determine which of the plans will pay benefits first. This is done by using the first of the following rules which applies:
1.	A plan with no COB provision will determine its benefits before a plan with a COB provision;
2.	A plan that covers a person other than as a Dependent will determine its benefits before a plan that covers such person as a Dependent;
3.	Any labor-management trusteed plan, union welfare plan, employer organization plan or employee benefit organization plan will determine its benefits before this plan;
4.	When a claim is made for a dependent child who is covered by more than one (1) plan:
(a)	the benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the year will be determined before the benefits of the plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in that year; but
(b)	if both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the plan which covered the parent longer will be determined before those of the plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time.
This method of determining the order of benefits will be referred to as the "Birthday Rule." The Birthday Rule will be used to determine the order of benefits for dependent children in all cases except those described below.
(c)	if the other plan does not have the Birthday Rule, then the plan which covers the child as a dependent of the male parent will pay its benefits first.
(d)	if the parents are legally separated or divorced, benefits for the child will be determined in this order:
(i)	first, the plan of the parent with custody of the child will pay its benefits;
(ii)	then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with custody of the child will pay its benefits; and
(iii)	finally, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child will pay its benefits.
However, if there is a court decree stating which parent is responsible for the health care expenses of the child, then a plan covering the child as a dependent of that parent will determine its benefits before any other plan.
5.	A plan that covers a person as:
(a)	a laid off employee; or
(b)	a retired employee; or
(c)	a dependent of such employee;
will determine its benefits after the plan that does not cover such person as:
(a)	a laid off employee; or
(b)	a retired employee; or
(c)	a dependent of such employee.
If one of the plans does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule will not apply.
6.	If one of the above rules establishes the order of payment, a plan under which the person has been covered for the longer time will determine its benefits before a plan covering that person for a shorter time.
Two successive plans of the same group will be considered one plan if the person was eligible for coverage under the new plan within twenty-four (24) hours after the old plan terminated. A change in the amount or scope of benefits, or a change in the carrier, or a change from one type of plan to another (e.g., single employer plan to multiple employer plan) will not constitute the start of a new plan.
When the COB provision reduces the benefits payable under this Plan:
(a)	each benefit will be reduced proportionately; and
(b)	only the reduced amount will be charged against any benefit limits under the Plan.
The COB provision is applied throughout the calendar year. If there is any reduction of the benefits provided under a specific Benefit Provision of this Plan because of duplicate coverage, similar benefits may be a payable later in that year if more Allowable Expenses are incurred under the same Benefit Provision of this Plan because of duplicate coverage, similar benefits may be payable later in that year if more Allowable Expenses are incurred under the same Benefit Provision. "Allowable Expense" means any necessary, usual and customary item of expense at least part of which is covered under at least one of the plans covering the person for who claim is made or service provided, in no event will Allowable Expense include the difference between the cost of a private hospital room and a semi-private hospital room unless the patient's stay in a private hospital room is Medically Necessary.
Benefits under a governmental plan will be taken into consideration without expanding the definition of "Allowable Expense" beyond the hospital, medical and surgical benefits as may be provided by such governmental plan.
When a plan provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be deemed to be both an Allowable Expense and a benefit paid.
The Plan has the right to release to, or obtain from, any other organization or person any information necessary for the administration of this provision and to pay to any organization any amounts necessary to satisfy the intent of this provision.
If the Plan has paid any amounts in excess of those necessary to satisfy the intent of this provision, it has the right to recover such excess from the person, to or for whom, such payments were made or from an insurance company or organization.
When you claim benefits under the Plan, you must furnish information about other coverage, which may be involved in applying this coordination provision.
A payment made under another Plan may include an amount which should have been paid under this Plan. If it does, the Claims Administrator may pay that amount to the organization which made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this Plan. The Claims
Administrator will not have to pay that amount again. The term "payment made" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case "payment made" means reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services.
Medicare
This Plan covers most of the same kinds of expenses as Medicare, which has two parts (Part A, hospital insurance, and Part B, medical insurance). Mutually provided benefits are coordinated under the double coverage provision.
This Plan will pay 80% after Medicare has paid as primary (which requires that the Covered Person is entitled to or has elected parts A and B of Medicare coverage) and after the deductible under this Plan has been met.
Generally, whether Medicare is the primary payor of benefits is determined under Federal law and regulations. Certain retirees will have coverage supplemental to Medicare benefits, as provided in the Appendix applicable to those retirees. For information on this subject, you may consult the Employee Benefits Office or your Social Security Office.
If a Covered Person has other primary medical insurance other than Medicare, benefits will be paid at 80% of usual and customary charges under this plan, after the deductible is paid. Once the employee or retiree is eligible for Medicare such person is required to apply for and maintain Medicare benefits. Once Medicare is effective, the health plan would coordinate, as secondary coverage to Medicare whereby retirees would meet the health plan's deductible before expenses are covered at 80%, to the extent permitted by federal law and regulations.
Once the retiree or spouse is individually eligible for Medicare, such person is required to apply for and maintain Medicare benefits. Once Medicare is effective, this health plan provides coverage supplemental to Medicare. The covered person must meet this plan's deductible before expenses are covered at 80%.
Compliance with Cost Containment Health Plan Provisions
If the Covered Person's benefits are reduced by a health plan that has cost containment provisions, such as a second surgical opinion, HMO, pre-certification or preferred provider arrangements, the amount of such reduction shall not be an allowable expense.
CHAPTER 14 SUBROGATION/THIRD PARTY CLAIMS
PROVISION FOR SUBROGATION AND RIGHT OF RECOVERY
A third party may be liable or legally responsible for expenses incurred by a Covered Person for an illness or a bodily injury.
Benefits may also be payable under the Plan for such expenses. When this happens, the Plan may, at its option:
1.	Take over the Covered Person's right to receive payment of the benefits from the third party. The Covered Person will:
(a)	transfer to the Plan any rights he may have to take legal action against the third party with respect to benefits paid by the Plan which are subject to this provision; and
(b)	cooperate fully with the Plan in asserting its right to subrogate. This means the Covered Person must supply the Plan with all information and sign and return all documents reasonably necessary to carry out the Plan's right to recover from the third party any benefits paid under the Plan which are subject to this provision.
2.	Recover from the Covered Person any benefits paid under the Plan which the Covered Person is entitled to receive from the third party. The Plan will have a first lien upon any recovery, whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise, that the Covered Person received from:
(a)	the third party; or
(b)	the third party's insurer or guarantor; or
(c)	the Covered Person's uninsured motorist insurance.
This lien will be for the amount of benefits paid by the Plan for the treatment of illness or bodily injury for which the third party is liable or legally responsible. If the Covered Person:
(a)	makes any recovery as set forth in this provision; and
(b)	fails to reimburse the Plan fully for any benefits paid under this provision; then he
will be personally liable to the Plan to the extent of such recovery up to the amount of the first lien. The Covered Person must cooperate fully with the Plan in asserting its right to recover.
CHAPTER 15
GENERAL PROVISIONS

(b)	Misstatements on Enrollment or Claim Form

Upon the discovery of any misstatement, an equitable adjustment of any benefit payments will be made.
(c)	Time Limit for Misstatement
No misstatement made to obtain coverage under the Plan will be used to void the coverage of any person which has been in force for a period of two (2) years or to deny a claim for a loss incurred or disability commencing after the expiration of the two (2) year period. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if any misstatement has been made fraudulently.

And in such case the City shall apply the amount of such payment to or for the benefit of such covered person or former covered person, his/her spouse, parent, adult child, guardian or a minor child, brother or sister, or other relative of a dependent of such covered person or former covered person, as the City may determine, and any such application shall be a complete discharge of all liability with respect to such benefit payment. However, at the discretion of the City, benefit payments may be assigned to health care providers.
CHAPTER 16	CLAIM FILING AND CLAIM PAYMENT

(ii)	type of service;
(iii)	date of service received;
(iv)	amount charged;
(v)	name of patient; and
(vi)	diagnosis.
(c)	Only one (1) detailed claim form must be completed per person per year, even for different claims and/or diagnoses. Any additional claims throughout the year may be filed on a short claim form available through the Employee Benefits Office. If a claim is for an accidental injury, then a detailed claim form must be completed for each accident occurrence. All items on the front of the detailed claim form must be completed. It is not necessary to complete the back of the form. The blocked section regarding secondary insurance coverage must be completed.
(d)	The original claim form with the attached bills shall be mailed to the City's claims
administrator.
2.	Limitation of Liability
The Plan Sponsor shall not be obligated to pay any benefits under the Plan for any claim that is not timely filed.
3.	Time of Claims Processing
Benefits for incurred medical expenses which are covered under the Plan will be processed immediately upon receipt of proper written proof of loss by the Claims Administrator. Any benefits payable will be made within twenty (20) working days.
Periodic Payment: Payment of accrued periodic payments for continuing losses which are covered under the Plan will be made immediately upon receipt of proper proof of loss by the Claims Administrator and at the applicable time period.
4.	Payment of Benefits
All benefits under the Plan are payable to the Covered Employee whose illness or injury or whose covered dependent's illness or injury is the basis of a claim.
In the event of the death or incapacity of a Covered Employee and in the absence of written evidence to the Plan of the qualification of a guardian for his estate, the Plan may, in its sole discretion, make any and all payments to the individual or institution which, in the opinion of the Plan Administrator, is or was providing the care and support of the employee.
Benefits for medical expenses covered under the Plan may be assigned by a Covered Employee to the person or institution rendering the services for which the expenses were incurred. No assignment will bind the Plan Sponsor unless it is in writing and unless it has been received by the Claims Administrator prior to the payment of the benefit assigned. The Claims Administrator will not be responsible for determining whether any assignment is valid. Payment of benefits which have been assigned will be made directly to the assignee unless a written request not to honor the assignment signed by the Covered Employee and the assignee has been received before the proof of loss is submitted.
5.	Discharge of Liability
Any payment made in accordance with the provisions of this section will fully discharge the liability of the Plan Sponsor to the extent of payment.
6.	Recovery of Payments
If the following circumstances apply, the Plan Sponsor reserves the right to deduct from any benefits properly payable under the Plan or recover from the Covered Employee or assignee who received the payment:
(a)	the amount of any payment which has been made in error; or
(b)	pursuant to a misstatement contained in a proof of loss; or
(c)	pursuant to a misstatement made to obtain coverage under the Plan within two (2) years after the date coverage commences.
