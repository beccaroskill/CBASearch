AGREEMENT
1.	This agreement is made and entered into by and between Siegfried USA, LLC.
(the "Company") and Teamsters Local Union 676, affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the “Union”).
ARTICLE 1	— RECOGNITION
1.	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agency
for hours, wages, and other conditions of employment pursuant to the Certification of Representative of the National Relations Board, United States of America, dated June 27,1974 in case No. 4-RC-10889 for all production and maintenance employees employed at the Company's plant in Pennsville, New Jersey and at no other geographical location, but excluding all office clerical employees, guards and supervisors as defined in the National Labor Relations Act.
ARTICLE 2	— TRANSFER OF COMPANY TITLE AND INTEREST
1.	This agreement shall be binding upon the parties thereto, their successors, and
assigns. The Company shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee, etc., of the operation covered by this Agreement or any part thereof. In the event the Company fails to give the notice herein required the Company shall be liable to the Union and the employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to give notice.
ARTICLE 3	— PURPOSES
1.	It is the mutual desire and intent of the Company and the Union, through this
Agreement, to establish a practical and sound industrial and economic relationship between the Company and its employees covered by this Agreement; to promote conditions of employment contributing to the protection of property; to promote economy and profitability of operation and steady employment by improving the quality, quantity, and diversification of products and productions. The Company, the Union and the employees agree that they will individually and collectively cooperate and abide by this agreement in pursuit of these objectives, and to prevent lockouts, strikes, or other interferences with the work of the Company during the life of this Agreement; and to promote harmonious relations between the Company, its employees, and the Union.
ARTICLE 4	— UNION SECURITY
1.	All present employees who are members of the Union on the effective date of this
agreement shall remain members of the Union in good standing as a condition of employment. All present employees who are not members of the Union and all employees who are hired hereafter shall become and remain members in good standing of the Union as a condition of employment on and after the thirty first (31st) day following the beginning of their employment
Page 6 of 40
or on and after the thirty first (31st) day following the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later.
2.	The failure of an employee to become a member of the Union at the required time
shall obligate the Company upon written notice from the Union to such effect and that Union membership was available to such employee on the same terms and conditions generally available to other members, to discharge such employee. The failure of any employee to maintain his Union membership in good standing as required herein shall, upon written notice to the Company by the Union to such effect, obligate the Company to discharge such employee. Good standing is defined as tendering of initiation fee and monthly dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union.
ARTICLE 5	— CHECK-OFF
1.	The Company, upon receipt of a valid, individual and voluntary written
authorization of any employee, in a form acceptable to the Company, will deduct from the wages due a new employee, the initiation fee in equal installments on five consecutive pay days. In addition, the Company will deduct from the wages due any employee, on the second pay day of each month, his regular monthly dues (but not fines and assessments), as are from time to time fixed by the Union, in accordance with the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union, and certified to the Company by the Secretary-Treasure of the Union as being so fixed. The Company will forward the aggregate amount of the initiation fee and the monthly dues deducted promptly each month to the Secretary-Treasure of the Union or other duly authorized representative designated by the Union. Such authorization shall be irrevocable for one (1) year from the effective date of this Agreement or until the termination date of applicable collective bargaining agreement, whichever occurs sooner, and shall automatically be renewed as an irrevocable authorization for successive yearly or applicable collective bargaining agreement periods thereafter, whichever is the lesser, unless the employee gives the Company written notice of revocation at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of each yearly period or of each applicable collective bargaining agreement, whichever comes sooner.
2.	If any change in the amount of initiation fees or regular monthly dues is made by
the Union during the term of this agreement, the Union will give written notice of such to the Company.
3.	The Union shall indemnify, defend and save the Company harmless against any
and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability arising out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Company in reliance upon payroll deduction cards submitted by the Union to the Company or for purposes of complying with any of the provisions of this Article. The Union assumes full responsibility for the disposition of the monies so deducted once they have been turned over to the Union.
Page 7 of 40
ARTICLE 6	— HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES
1.	The Company shall notify the Union when any new employees are to be hired and
the Union shall have the right to send applicants for the job or jobs, and the Company agrees to interview such applicants. This provision shall not be deemed to require the Company to hire Union applicants or to preclude the Company from hiring employees from other sources.
ARTICLE 7	— PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES
1.	An employee shall be considered to be on probation and shall not be entitled to
any seniority rights until after he has been employed one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days after the date of his last hire. If such employee shall be continued in the employ of the Company after the expiration of probationary period, his length of service shall be computed from his date of last hire. The Company retains the right to discharge new employees during or at the end of the probationary period without further recourse and the discharge may not be made the subject of a grievance either by the employee or by the Union, provided that this provision will not be used for purposes of discrimination. In case of discharge within the probationary period, the Company shall notify the Union in writing.
ARTICLE 8	— TEMPORARY OR PART-TIME WORK
1.	The Company may hire part-time or casual employees for the sole purpose of
vacation periods and absenteeism and such employees shall not hold seniority unless by mutual agreement between the Union and Company.
2.	The Company may hire seasonal employees only by mutual agreement between
the Union and the Company. Seasonal employees shall be employed for seasonal periods only and shall not hold any seniority standing. However, if the Company decides to hire full-time regular employees it shall give qualified part-time, casual and seasonal employees first opportunity to become full-time regular employees and their seniority shall start from their first day of full-time regular employment.
3.	Part-time, casual and seasonal employees shall have to become members of the
Union as provided in this Agreement.
4.	The Company may hire students participating in an internship program sponsored
by local technical schools by mutual agreement between the Union and the Company. Wages will be paid at the State and/or federal Minimum Wage Rates and interns are not required to become members of the Union as provided in this Agreement. Participation in the program by Siegfried experienced operators as the intern’s sponsors is voluntary. Interns shall not shadow and/or perform assignments by the sponsors more than one (1) shift per week for the duration of their internship. Interns will be subject to all regular mandatory background, drug screening as well as basic cGMP, SOP and SHE training and will be provided by the Company with the appropriate uniforms and safety equipment.
Page 8 of 40
ARTICLE 9	— SHOP STEWARD AND UNION REPRESENTATIVES
Shop Steward
1.	The Company recognizes the right of the Union to designate one (1) Shop
Steward from the Company's seniority list. The Union may also designate an alternate but only during the absence of the Shop Steward. The Shop Steward so designated by the Union shall be granted super seniority for the purpose of lay-off and recall from lay-off and job preference if qualified. The Shop Steward may leave his work for the purpose of investigating, presenting and processing grievances or other legitimate representation functions under the grievance procedure on the property of the Company. Whenever a Business Agent and the Company agree that the Shop Steward is required to attend any grievance hearing or arbitration attended by representatives of the Company and the Union, whether on or off Company property, he shall be compensated by the Company for time lost (only if he is scheduled to work) with a maximum of eight (8) hours per day unless otherwise mutually agreed to. Such time spent in handling grievances during working hours shall be at the applicable hourly rate and shall be considered working hours in computing daily and/or weekly overtime. The Shop Steward shall record his time and specify to his foreman or immediate supervisor, the purpose of his activity before he leaves the job and, upon entering the area of a supervisor other than his own, he shall notify that supervisor of his presence and purpose.
2.	The provision for the Shop Steward to leave his work during working hours and
be paid as set forth above is based on the understanding that the time will be devoted to the prompt handling of legitimate grievances or other legitimate representation functions, and that the Shop Steward will continue to work at his normal assignments at other times.
Union Representatives
3.	Authorized representatives of the Union shall be permitted to visit the plant of the
Company for the purposes of investigating or handling complaints or grievances. The representative will notify the Company and obtain approval prior to entering the plant or operations, but such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and there shall be no interference of the Company's business or operation.
4.	Whenever a complaint is made concerning the wages, vacations, and/or holidays
of an employee, an authorized representative of the Union shall have the right to inspect the relevant Company's payroll and time cards of the employee during the grievance procedure.
Page 9 of 40
ARTICLE 10	— SUPERVISORY AND NON-UNION EMPLOYEES
1.	Supervisory employees or other employees not in the bargaining unit shall not
perform work on any hourly rated job classification if the result would be to displace an employee in the bargaining unit, but this will not prevent such work (1) in the instruction or training of employees, (2) in testing materials and production, (3) when doing experimental work, (4) in emergencies or (5) in the performance of necessary assistance when production difficulties are encountered.
ARTICLE 11	— MANAGEMENT'S RIGHTS
1.	Except to the extent expressly abridged by a specific provision of the Agreement,
the Company reserves and retains all of its rights to manage the business. Such rights of management shall include, by way of illustration, but are not limited to its right to determine prices of products, volume and scheduling of production and methods of financing; to add or drop a product line; to sell or lease the business, or any part thereof; to determine the number, location, and types of its operations, and the methods, processes, and materials to be employed; to discontinue processes or operations; to determine the number of hours per day or per week operations shall be carried on; to assign work to employees; to establish and change work schedules and assignments; to transfer, promote, or demote employees, or to lay off, terminate, or otherwise relieve employees from duty for lack of work or other legitimate reasons; to make and enforce reasonable rules for the maintenance of discipline; to suspend, discharge, or otherwise discipline employees for cause and otherwise to take such measures as management may determine to be necessary for the efficient and profitable operation of its business.
Sub-Contracting
2.	It is and has been the policy of the Company to utilize its employees to perform
work when they are qualified to do so and the Company will not subcontract or contract out work normally performed by employees in the bargaining unit for the purpose of shrinking the bargaining unit or discriminating against the Union, but it reserves the right to subcontract or contract out any work it deems necessary according to the dictates of good business practice.
ARTICLE 12	— SENIORITY
1.	The term "seniority" as used herein, shall mean the total length of an employee's
most recent, continuous employment by the Company.
2.	After the satisfactory completion of the probationary period as set forth in this
Agreement, such employee shall be considered a regular employee and shall accrue seniority from his date of hire.
3.	In all cases of layoffs or reduction of forces, re-employment, job preferences, shift
preferences and promotions, the Company shall give due consideration to seniority, fitness,
Page 10 of 40
ability and individual qualifications of the employee to perform the work in question and the efficient operation of the plant. Seniority shall prevail only if fitness, ability and individual qualifications of the employee to perform the work are substantially equal.
4.	If an employee is selected to fill a vacancy or new position, he will be given a trial
period of at least fifteen (15) working days. An employee selected to fill a vacancy or new position will be placed in the position within sixty (60) days after the job was first posted.
5.	Employees who successfully bid for an open posted position are not allowed to
bid again for another posted position for a period of one (1) year, starting on the date the bid was awarded. If an employee has successfully bid for a posted open position in either the Utilities or Waste Water Treatment Plant Departments, the employee is not allowed to bid again for another posted position for a period of two (2) years, starting on the date the bid was awarded.
6.	The Company agrees to maintain a seniority list showing each regular, bargaining
unit employee's seniority record. The Company agrees to post and furnish the Union with a complete, up-to-date seniority list every six (6) months.
7.	A regular employee's seniority will be lost whenever such employee quits, is discharged for just cause, accepts other employment during an approved leave of absence, overstays an approved leave of absence, or is laid off for a period exceeding two (2) years without being recalled.
8.	Whenever making seasonal or permanent lay-offs the Company agrees to give
one (1) week's written notice to the Union and the Shop Steward.
9.	The Company, when recalling laid-off employees, shall send a registered letter to
the employee's last known address (as indicated on employee's records) and the employee shall have seven (7) calendar days to respond to such recall notice. After the employee has notified the Company that he will return to work, the employee shall have seven (7) additional calendar days to report for work. If the employee fails to report within said period, he shall lose all seniority rights under the Agreement.
10.	In the event an employee is working for another Company during his layoff
status, he may maintain seniority with such other Company until such time as this Company recalls him back from layoff status; if the employee refuses to report back to work with this Company then such employee shall lose all seniority rights with this Company.
11.	Any employee who is promoted to or transferred to a position outside the
bargaining unit will retain what seniority he had as of the day of his promotion or transfer for a period of sixty (60) days. If the employee returns to the bargaining unit within sixty (60) days, he may do so without loss of seniority rights.
12.	An employee's inability to work because of proven illness or injury shall not
result in the loss of seniority rights.
Page 11 of 40
ARTICLE 13	— WAGES AND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS
1.	The wage rates, job classifications, shift/premium pay differentials set forth in the
"Wage Schedule" annexed hereto as Appendix A and A-l are made a part hereof and shall be effective during the term of this Agreement as set forth therein.
2.	The basic hourly wage rate for any employee classified in one of the job
classifications in the Wage Schedule shall be a rate within the hourly wage rate range of his job classification provided no employee shall receive a reduction in his base rate as a result of the signing of this Agreement.
Minimum Hiring Rate
3.	The minimum hiring rate shall be the starting rate specifically set forth in the
wage schedule annexed hereto as Appendix A-l and made a part of the Agreement.
New Employees With Experience
4.	New employees with experience may be hired in any job classification at rates
above minimum rates, but not in excess of the maximum rates of the classifications for the jobs to which they are assigned.
Promotions
5.	Any employee promoted from a lower job classification to a higher job
classification shall receive the minimum rate for the higher job classification effective the first day he works on the higher classification. However, nothing provided for herein shall prevent the Company from advancing the wage rate of any employee to any wage rate that shall not exceed the maximum wage rate of the employee's job classification. In the event such employee does not perform his work in the higher job classification to the Company's satisfaction, he shall be returned to his prior job classification at the same wage per hour he received in such prior job classification.
Temporary Transfers
6.	Due to the changing character of work in the plant and the variation in work load
between the various operations, the Company shall have the right to shift employees from job to job as required. When an employee is temporarily shifted to a lower paying job for the convenience of the Company he will continue to receive his cun-ent rate of pay.
Pay Day
7.	Pay day will customarily be on Friday and not more than seven (7) calendar days
shall be held back. If a Friday is a bank holiday, the employees shall be paid the previous workday.

itemized statement of all deductions made for any purpose.

shift shall be allowed two (2) fifteen (15)-minute rest periods without loss of pay, one in the first half of the shift and one in the second half of the shift provided that such rest periods shall be taken at times and in areas or places designated by the Company, without any unnecessary interruption to production, and provided further that the number of employees on a rest period at any given time shall be within the exclusive discretion of the Company. In addition, employees are allowed to stop work fifteen (15) minutes at the end of the day's work for the purpose of washing up, without loss of pay.
16.	The provisions of this Article are intended only to provide a basis for determining
the number of hours of work for which an employee shall be entitled to be paid at overtime rates and shall not be construed as a guarantee to such employee of any specified number of hours of work either per day or per week or as limiting the right of the Company to fix the number of hours of work either per day or per week for such employee.
ARTICLE 15	— REPORT-IN AND CALL-IN PAY
Report-In Pay
1.	In the event an employee reports to work as scheduled, without having been
previously notified not to report, such employee shall either be given a minimum of eight (8) hours' work or shall receive a minimum of eight (8) hours' pay in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. However, the foregoing shall not apply in the event that such employee is deprived of work for causes beyond the Company's control, act of God or in the event that such employee for any reason is unavailable to or cannot or will not perform at least eight (8) hours' work.
2.	Report-in pay is not due if the employee has been notified not to report before he
leaves home or if the Company attempts to give such notice at the last address appearing in the Company's records. The Company may offer eight (8) hours work of any type and if the employee refuses such work he receives no report-in pay.
Call-In Pay
3.	An employee who is called in to work after leaving the plant at the conclusion of
his shift shall receive two (2) hours pay at straight time as a “call-in bonus” plus time and one-half for all hours worked. Time and one-half for all hours worked and the ‘call-in bonus” will not be paid when an employee is scheduled to cover for a co-worker or when an employee is
Page 15 of 40
asked to come in at a future time that will occur twenty-four (24) hours or more from the time the call was placed.
4.	An employee shall be deemed to have been "called-in" only when he receives
notice of work to be done after leaving the Company premise. If he receives such notice of work to be done before leaving the Company's premise, but after the close of his preceding regular shift, he shall be deemed to have worked continuously.
5.	If an employee is notified in advance to report for work before his regular starting
time he is not entitled to call-in pay, but if his work continues into his regular scheduled shift he shall not be deprived of work on such regular scheduled shift.
6.	Any employee called in to work on the sixth (6th) and/or seventh (7th)
consecutive day worked in the same work week shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours' work or pay at the applicable overtime rate.
7.	If an emergency job of a called-in employee runs into his normally-scheduled
shift, the employee continues to work his normal shift at the straight-time hourly rate of pay as per the Contract. In cases where the called-in employee has not slept between his normal shift and the call-in event and the emergency job has run into his next normal shift, the employee is allowed to go home before the end of his normal shift to sleep. He will not be charged with vacation or sick time for the rest of that shift and he shall receive two (2) hours of straight-time hourly rate.
ARTICLE 16	— SICK PAY
1.	All employees in the employ of the Company six (6) months, shall be entitled, in
the event of illness or sickness, to sick pay as follows:
During the six (6) months immediately following the six (6) months eligibility period, an employee will be allowed 4 hours of sick pay for each monthly period of service to a maximum of 24 hours, until such employee has been employed for a one (1) year period.
2.	All employees in the employ of the Company for one (1) year, shall be entitled
thereafter, in the event of illness or sickness, to sick pay as follows:
During the twelve (12) month period from January 1st to December 31st a maximum of forty eight (48) hours will be allowed. For employees who complete one year of service during the calendar year, sick pay will be allowed on the basis of eight (8) hours for each two (2) month period of service up to forty eight (48) hours for the year.
3.	The employee must telephone the Company's office not later than one-half hour
before the start of the shift on the first day he stays out for illness or sickness. The Guard (856) 678-3601 will transfer the call to the appropriate supervisor per departmental call out
Page 16 of 40
instructions. Employees assigned to Wet Trains will call the supervisor office (856) 678-8850. A medical certificate will be required from a physician certifying the illness or sickness, if such illness or sickness is for three (3) or more days' duration.
4.	Any sick pay hours accrued during a calendar year that are not used in that year
are accumulated in a sick leave bank for future use at the rate of one and one-half (1 V2) hours for each such unused hour unless the employee elects to receive pay for unused hours as provided in paragraph 5 below. The maximum number of hours that may be accumulated in the sick leave bank is 320. Upon termination of employment, all accumulated sick pay hours will be paid out.
5.	Employees are allowed to use time from the sick leave bank once they have used
up the annual 48-hour sick time allotment, but they will be charged with an absence and will be covered by the Company’s Attendance Practice and disciplinary progression as outlined in the Company Attendance Practice unless:
5.1	The employee produces an original doctor’s note for the duration of the absence;
5.2	The employee requests and gets approval from the direct supervisor 48 hours prior to using time from the sick leave bank.
6.	Employees shall have the option of receiving pay (at the straight time rate) in
January of each year for any sick pay hours accrued during the previous year but not used. Unless an employee elects to be paid for such unused sick pay hours, they shall be accumulated in the employee’s sick leave bank as provided in paragraph 4 of this Article.
7.	The Company agrees to inform each employee within thirty (30) days after the
end of each calendar year as to the number of sick pay hours the employee has accumulated as of the end of the calendar year.
8.	Any injury or illness qualifying for Workmen's Compensation benefits shall not
qualify for any payments under this Article.
9.	An employee absent from work due to illness or injury for a full shift may elect to
be paid accrued sick pay hours for all the hours of his scheduled shift or a minimum of eight (8) hours. An employee absent from work due to illness or injury for less than his full shift must be paid his accrued sick pay hours for all time not worked.
ARTICLE 17—	OVERTIME
1.	The Company shall pay one and one-half (1 14) times an employee's regular,
straight-time hourly rate of pay for each hour worked in excess of their regularly scheduled work hours in any one (1) day or forty (40) hours in any one (1) work week. Employees who have completed their full work schedule for five (5) days in any week (at least forty (40) hours) shall be paid time-and-one-half their regular straight-time rate for work performed on the sixth (6th) consecutive day worked in the same work week and double their straight-time rate for work performed on the seventh (7th) consecutive day within the same work week. Only if an
Page 17 of40
employee is absent any day during the week for just cause shall that day be counted in computing overtime. Just cause for the purpose of this Article shall be employees qualifying for sick pay, recognized funeral leave, jury duty and holidays recognized under this Agreement. Failure of an employee to complete his work schedule on any day for reasons not within the control of the Company shall eliminate that day in counting days worked.
2.	For the purpose of computing overtime to be paid to employees entitled to a shift
differential and/or premium pay as set forth in this Agreement, the overtime shall be computed after adding the shift differential and/or premium to the regular, straight-time hourly rate.
3.	Pay for a holiday not worked shall be considered to be hours worked for the
purpose of computing overtime.
4.	An employee may be required to work overtime, including Saturdays, Sundays, holidays and the sixth (6th) and seventh (7th) consecutive days in the work week.
5.	The Company will inventory and attempt to equalize overtime among qualified
employees. Equalization of overtime within each calendar year shall be based upon overtime hours worked only within said calendar year. The parties recognize that the operation of the plant and production of products is in certain respects unique and that efficient production often requires operation beyond the regularly scheduled shift and that the employee who commences the production of a batch must complete the production run as long as full operation is required.
6.	In no event, shall there be any pyramiding of overtime pay. If, for example,
weekly overtime, holiday overtime and overtime pay for work performed on the sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) consecutive day within the same work week occur on the same day, an employee shall not be paid for all of said overtime rates. He shall receive only one such overtime rate, whichever is greatest.
7.	An employee shall be paid one and one-half (1 rA) times his regular straight-time
hourly rate of pay for all hours he is required to work on his scheduled day off.
8.	Overtime signed up for by an employee will be considered regular scheduled
work with regard to call-offs and sick-time call outs. Employees who are scheduled for overtime will be guaranteed work or compensation for the number of hours accepted unless the Company cancels said overtime at least 48 hours in advance of the start of the overtime. If an employee reporting for overtime finds out that the operation for which he signed up is idle or if the overtime work took less time than originally anticipated, the employee is allowed to leave early with the consent of the supervisor without any penalty or being charged sick and/or vacation time.
Page 18 of 40
ARTICLE 18	— HOLIDAYS
1.	For the purpose of this Agreement, the following days are recognized holidays:
New Year’s Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
Friday after Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Eve Day
Christmas Day
Two (2) Floating Days
2.	Each employee is entitled to one “emergency day” each calendar year. In order to
take an emergency day, the employee must notify his supervisor at least one-half hour before the start of his shift. If an employee does not use his emergency day during a calendar year, he may not carry it over into the next year, but will be paid for it in January following the year not used. The shift the employee is working when the emergency day is taken (or the shift he is scheduled to work during the last week of December if paid for the day) will determine the amount of pay he received for the emergency day, e.g. an employee on an eight (8)-hour shift will receive eight (8) hours pay; an employee on a ten (lO)-hours shift will receive ten (10) hours pay; and employee on a twelve (12)-hour shift will receive twelve (12) hours pay.
3.	Each employee who has been on the active payroll of the Company at least sixty
(60)	days preceding the holiday involved, has worked the full scheduled work day that occurred within twenty-four (24) hours prior to and within twenty-four (24) hours after such holiday shall receive holiday pay at his straight-time hourly rate for each recognized holiday even though no work is performed on said holiday. Exceptions to this are legitimate and documented personal or family medical emergencies and bereavement leave (as per Article 22 - Funeral Leave) that occur on the day immediately before or after the holiday. An employee on an eight (8)-hour shift schedule shall receive eight (8) hours of holiday pay; an employee on a ten (lO)-hour shift shall receive ten (10) hours of holiday pay; an employee in a twelve (12)-hour shift schedule shall receive twelve (12) hours of holiday pay.
4.	If the Company requires an employee to work on one of the recognized holidays,
except on the Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day holidays, such employee shall be paid time and one half his regular straight-time hourly wage rate for each hour worked on the holiday and receive holiday pay at the regular straight-time hourly rate as per the above. If an employee is required to work on the Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day holiday, the employee will be paid two times the regular straight-time hourly wage rate for each hour worked on the said holidays and will receive holiday pay at the regular straight-time hourly rate as per the above. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary, notwithstanding, it is the intention of the parties that an employee who actually works on a recognized holiday, namely 7:00 a.m. on the actual day the holiday is celebrated to 7:00 a.m. on the day immediately following the day the holiday is celebrated, as provided in this Article, and that only an employee who actually works during such period on a recognized holiday shall be so paid.
Page 19 of 40
5.	Any employee who is assigned to work on a holiday recognized by this
Agreement and after being assigned to work refuses or fails to report to work without reasonable cause, shall be subject to disciplinary action.
6.	If a recognized holiday falls during an eligible employee's vacation period, the
Company shall allow the employee an additional day of vacation with pay.
7.	Any employee who is on lay-off, suspension for disciplinary purposes, leave of
absence, or sick leave shall not be eligible to receive holiday pay, except he shall be eligible to receive holiday pay during the first thirty (30) calendar days of sick leave. However, any otherwise eligible employee who is off work and receiving disability benefits or workmen's compensation shall not be eligible to receive holiday pay for any holiday which may fall during the time the employee is off work.
8.	If a holiday occurs on a Saturday or Sunday, said holiday shall be observed at the
option of the Company. For employees on a twelve (12)-hour rotating shift, the holiday shall be observed on the actual day.
ARTICLE 19	— VACATIONS
1.	All employees who were hired in 2012 and forward, who have
successfully completed their one hundred eighty (180) days of probation shall be entitled to seven (7) hours of vacation pay for each monthly period of service to a maximum of forty-two (42) hours, until such employee has been employed for a one (1) year period. In the next calendar year following the employee’s first (1st) full year of employment, he shall be entitled to two (2) weeks of vacation pay.
2.	(a.) All employees who have been employed for at least five (5) years
shall be entitled to three (3) weeks of vacation with pay commencing on January 1 of the fifth (5th) annual anniversary year of employment and similarly shall be entitled to three (3) weeks of vacation pay during each subsequent calendar year.
(b)	All employees who have been employed for at least ten (10) years shall be entitled to four (4) weeks of vacation with pay commencing on January 1 of the tenth (10th) annual anniversary date of employment and similarly shall be entitled to four (4) weeks of vacation pay during each subsequent calendar year.
(c)	All employees who have been employed for at least seventeen (17) years shall be entitled to five (5) weeks of vacation with pay commencing on January 1 of the seventeenth (17th) annual anniversary date of employment and similarly shall be entitled to five (5) weeks of vacation pay during each subsequent calendar year.
Page 20 of 40
(d)	All employees who have been employed for at least twenty (20) years shall be entitled to six (6) weeks of vacation with pay commencing on January 1 of the twentieth (20th) annual anniversary date of employment and similarly shall be entitled to six (6) weeks of vacation pay during each subsequent calendar year.
3.	Vacation pay shall be computed on the basis of forty (40) hours per week for day
workers and forty-two (42) hours per week for other than day workers at the straight-time rate of pay. Vacation time shall be credited on January 1 of each year. Once employees have exhausted their vacation, they cannot go negative in vacation balance in any calendar year. Employees with no remaining vacation time will be required to use sick, sick bank, personal or emergency time (as per each time guideline) when time off above and beyond vacation occurs.
4.	An employee on an eight (8)-hour shift who takes vacation will be paid for eight
(8)	hours and eight (8) hours will be deducted from his credited vacation time for each day taken. An employee on a ten (lO)-hour shift who takes a vacation day will be paid for ten (10) hours and ten (10) hours will be deducted from his credited vacation time. An employee on a twelve (12)-hour shift who takes one (1), two (2) or three (3) vacation days in a work week will be paid for twelve (12) hours and twelve (12) hours will be deducted from his credited vacation time for each day taken. An employee on a twelve (12) hours shift who takes four (4) vacation days in the same work week has the option of either being paid for forty-two (42) hours or forty-eight (48) hours. The number of hours for which the employee is paid will be deducted from his credited vacation time.
5.	Any employee resigning or quitting without giving the Company at least one (1)
week notice, unless there is justifiable cause for not giving such notice, or any employee discharged for cause shall not be entitled to any pro-rata vacation pay.
6.	Vacation time off is considered time worked for purposes of calculating overtime
only in the case of one single or one partial approved vacation day taken during any one work week. The approved vacation can cover up to a maximum of 8, 10, or 12 hours, depending on the shift the employee is working. Vacation hours plus hours worked in any one day must total the number of hours of the normal shift worked. When more than one approved vacation day is taken in any one work week, none of the vacation time will count towards the calculation of overtime and will not be considered just cause in calculating pay for the sixth and the seventh consecutive days worked.
7.	Vacation time or personal time off requests for one (1) or two (2) individual days
need to be requested from and approved by the immediate supervisor at least 48 hours ahead of the absence. Vacation time requests covering a three- (3), four- (4) or five- (5) day shift need to be requested from and approved by the immediate supervisor at least fourteen (14) days ahead of the absence. Vacation or personal time requests for shifts that the Company deems need to be filled will not be approved if voluntary coverage cannot be obtained, except that scheduled overtime, per Article 17, Paragraph 4, may be required for waste water treatment and boiler room
Page 21 of40
operations to satisfy legal obligations for coverage. If an employee is out of sick time and calls out with a request for emergency vacation or personal time, this will result in the employee being charged with an unexcused absence as per the Company Attendance Practice, unless a written doctor’s note is provided. Vacation, personal time or sick bank must be used to cover the shift.
8.	The Company reserves the right to shut down the plant in order that all vacations
may be taken at the same time. The Company also determines the time and length of such shutdown, but such shutdown will customarily be for a consecutive two (2) week period during the months of July or August. The Company will give the employees as much notice as is reasonably possible prior to a shutdown, but in no event less than eight (8) weeks. Employees shall have the right, on a seniority basis, to request a vacation period other than the shutdown period and such request shall be granted unless the employee is needed for the operation or maintenance of the plant. Within one (1) month after the Company posts the announcement of the shutdown period any employee who wishes to take his vacation at a time other than the shutdown period shall so advise the Plant Manager in writing of the period when he wishes to take his vacation. During such shutdown period an employee, if not on vacation, will be assigned work, if available and he is qualified to do the work, on a seniority basis and be paid at the applicable wage rate according to his job classification. The Company shall have the right to operate any portion of the plant during the shutdown period where emergency, production or maintenance requirements warrant such operation.
9.	Employees not on the active payroll, whether laid off, absent or on leave, are not
entitled to vacations.
