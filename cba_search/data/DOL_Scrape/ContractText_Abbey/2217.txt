I	President
!	UFCW Local 1996	'
■	3302 McGinnis Ferry Rd.
Suwanee, Ga. 30024
Dear Mr. Lomax
During contract negotiations between The Kroger Co. and UFCW Local 1996 relative to the agreement between the parties which is effective from May 15, 2005 through May 16, 2009 the parties agreed the following would be covered by letter:
1.	The Union and the Employer can mutually agree upon the reinstatement of grandfathered lead positions if the need arises.
2.	If an appointed Lead File Maintenance clerk, Bakery Manager, or Assistant Grocery Manager has a personal rate higher than the established rate for that position, they will receive the appropriate premium for that position in addition to their personal rate.
3.	In the event of minimum wage changes, we will discuss the impact of the change, if any.
4.	If the Employer leases out space in its stores or uses vendors to supply product to its stores, the Employer agrees that such operations shall not cause any employee represented by Local 1996 to be laid off or to lose hours.	■
5.	Grandfathered Positions
The following positions are considered to be grandfathered positions and all references have been removed from the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
CAO clerks
Lead Night Stock Clerks, except in stores with a total sales volume excluding fuel of $310,000 or above. Cosmetician
Drug/GM Receiver
Lead Cheese
Chefs
Seafood Manager	'
Journeyman/Boxman
Employees in these grandfathered positions will continue to receive the rates of pay outlined in the bargaining agreement and/or premiums as long as the employee remains in the position.
6.	In the event of a change in the hours of a major competitor ora new competitor opens in the market, the Union and the Employer will meet and discuss the Christmas Eve closing time. Any change in the current practice will be mutually agreed upon.
7.	Effective 10/30/05, associates will be given credit for time spent in their current bracket for purposes of determining their next progression increase date.
Meat
1.	If meat coats or meat aprons are removed from the Meat Department, the Employer will discuss suitable alternatives with the Union to ensure cleanliness and sanitation.
2.	If any Meat, Deli/Bakery, or Seafood Department Employee hired prior to October 30, 2005, transfers to any other Department, it is understood that Seniority, Article 12.02 will apply.
40
i
I
|	3. An employee who is promoted to full-time will be reclassified to the full-time rate schedule as follows:
I
i	If there is a full-time rate the same as the employee's part-time rate, the employee would be reclassified to
I"	that rate and will continue to accumulate service necessary for adjustment to the next rate.
I	If there is no identical rate, the employee would be advanced to the next rate which gives the employee an
increase and the employee would begin a new progression from that point.
■	4. Meat Chefs will be grandfathered. Chefs classified as Meat with a Job Date of February 7, 1999 or before
!	will be grandfathered. A Meat Chef currently at the top rate on their scale will receive the same increases as
a full-time top rated clerk.
5.	There will be a Bakery Manager position in stores where the Deli and Bakery are located in separate parts of i	the store.
6.	Seafood Managers as of September 11,1993, are red-circled and will receive future increases in the amount equal to increases received by the Full-time top rate clerks.
7.	Journeyman Meat Cutters and Cutting Room Journeyman (.175 premium) will be Grandfathered and their
!	rate of pay "red circled". In the event a Meat Manager steps down or is demoted from their position, they
I	will be placed in the classification from which they came prior to being assigned as Meat Manager. In the
I	event of a layoff, reduction of hours, and store closing, seniority will apply. (For these purposes, seniority
will be defined to provide Grandfathered Journeyman and Meat Clerks to be in the same classification.) If a Journeyman Meat Cutter is laid off and recalled at a later date, he will be returned to the rate of pay he was at prior to being laid off.
8.	Any employee in the meat department can operate the meat power saw. Meat Clerks {hired priorto 6/28/91) who do not want to operate the meat power saw because of safety and health concerns, will not be required to operate the meat powersaw. Training will be provided to meat clerks regarding the operation of the meat power saw.

8.	Kroger and the UFCW will agree to open the pension article of all participating Kroger Collective Bargaining Agreements in the Plan for the sole purpose of increasing the employer contribution rates with respect to covered employment on or after the effective dates shown below:
Effective Date	Increase Per Hour
First Month after 2010 Actuarial Certification	15C

9,	Appropriate actions shall be taken so that the surcharges on employer contributions, if any, required by IRC Section 432 will be "netted out" of the contribution Increases specified in Item 8 above.
10.	The Board of Trustees hereby directs the plan actuary to apply for a ten year amortization extension under IRC Section 431(d) for all charge bases in existence for the 2009 Plan Year.
11.	The Board of Trustees will continue to explore alternative means of improving the Plan's funding status such as single sum contributions and transfers of unfunded liability out of the Plan in lieu of some or all of any remaining contribution increases specified in Item 8 above, or Item 12 below, on an actuarially equivalent basis as defined below. Any action taken will apply to all collective bargaining agreements between Kroger and the UFCW which require that contributions be made by Kroger into the Fund.
12.	In the event the above actions, reflecting annual 2009 investment returns and legislative relief enacted on or before November 25, 2010, are not sufficient to enable the Plan to emerge from Critical Status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, then further adjustments will be reflected in the Preferred Schedule of the Rehabilitation Plan in accordance with the following:
a.	If there are optional provisions in such legislative relief, the Board of Trustees will elect those options which would minimize any required contribution increases described in Item 8.
b.	Contribution increases benefit accrual rates, or both, as agreed upon by the Board of Trustees, will be changed to satisfy the requirements of a valid schedule for the Preferred Schedule of the Rehabilitation Plan.
As a further clarification of the proposal, the Trustees agreed that an actuarial certification should be made by January 4 or 5, 2010 and that the notice should be mailed on February 2, 2010 in order that participants retiring with an effective date of February 1, 2010 can retire with and receive a level income option if they should so elect.
