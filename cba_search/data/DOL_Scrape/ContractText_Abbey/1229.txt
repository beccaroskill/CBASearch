continuous active service in a regular full-time status, shall be entitled annually to three (3) weeks of vacation (120 hours) with pay, to be taken during the next twelve (12) months of employment.
(D)	Vacation pay shall be computed at the straight time hourly rate of pay of the employee in effect at the time the vacation is taken. Pay for a “day of vacation” will be eight (8) times the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate of pay. Pay for a “week of vacation” will be forty (40) times that hourly rate. Hours of vacation pay (hours that are not worked) will not count towards overtime qualification calculations.
(E)	An employee shall not be entitled to a vacation or vacation pay under any of the following circumstances:
a)	If an employee is classified as a part-time or temporary employee (all time served in a part-time or temporary status does not count towards qualification for vacation or other benefits); or
b)	If an employee quits the employ of the Company prior to his anniversary date without giving written notice at least two weeks prior to his termination date.
(F)	Vacation time cannot be carried forward from one entitlement year to the next. However, any vacation time not used in an entitlement year will be reimbursed. The employee must submit written request (form will be available from the manager) to be reimbursed for unused vacation.
(G)	Employees entitled to a vacation under this Agreement must take their vacation at a time convenient to the Company and vacations shall not be cumulative. The Company shall have the right to determine the number of employees in each department who can be on vacation at any one time.
The Company may, at its option, shut down all or part of its operations for one (1) or more weeks each year and schedule, during the periods of shutdown, up to two (2) weeks of an employee’s earned vacation.
(H)	The Company will give employees an opportunity to express their preference as to the time they would like to take their vacation, provided such preference is noted on the departmental bulletin board and submitted to the Company between April 1 and April 30. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and consistent with the efficient operation of the Company’s business, the Company will honor the vacation

(I)	Vacation pay shall be based on the employee’s regular straight time rate at the time the vacation is started. If a holiday recognized in Section 9 falls within a vacation week, the eight (8) hours of holiday pay at straight time shall be paid to the employee on vacation. An employee entitled to vacation shall not take less than 1/2 day of vacation at any one time.
(J)	It is understood that the purpose of vacations is to give employees a rest and employees will ordinarily be required to take vacations to which they are entitled under the provisions of this Section. However, the Company may require an employee to work during his vacation in the event of an emergency, in which case the employee will receive regular pay as well as vacation pay, or at the employee’s request, the Company will reschedule his vacation in accordance with Sections E and F.
(K)	The term "continuous active service" as used in this Article means uninterrupted service in the employ of the Company since the day on which the employee was last hired by the Company. Time worked as a part-time or temporary employee does not count towards completion of the time requirements to qualify for vacation pay.
(L)	A Safety Day is a paid day of absence awarded to those employees who work injury (OSHA recordable), accident free and critical rule violation free during the appropriate qualification period. Employees will be allowed to accrue a maximum of two (2) Safety Days; accumulated days in excess of two (2) may be “cashed out” by the employee - and will be paid according to the employees normal scheduled work day (i.e. 8 or 10 hours). Any OSHA recordable work injury, critical rule violation or negligent equipment damage incident will disqualify the employee from earning Safety Days for a minimum of two (2) months from the date of the incident. Use of a Safety Day requires the prior approval of management; however, the Company will not unreasonably deny the use of a Safety Day. Safety Days will be awarded according to the following schedule:
1.	Full-time employees with more than sixty days employment with the Company will be awarded one (1) Safety Day for every six (6) months of injury, critical rule violation and accident free service performed.

Layoffs should be in inverse order of seniority, based on qualifications. Temporary layoff, for the purpose of this Section, shall be defined to mean a layoff which at the time of such layoff the Company anticipates will not exceed fifteen (15) working days.
(C)	In case of layoff, all probationary employees shall be laid off before any employees who have established seniority are affected, unless there is no employee with seniority who is immediately qualified to do the work without further training or instruction.

Section 20 shall have and possess power and authority to act for and bind the Union only in connection with those functions, rights, obligations and matters provided for in this Agreement. They shall not have, or be deemed to have, any other authority to act for or bind the Union. Specifically, no Shop Steward has any authority, real or apparent, to act for or in behalf of the Union, in any manner contrary to or in violation of any applicable section or provision of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, in the matter of hiring or firing employees, or disciplining, demoting, or punishing employees, or discriminating against employees, or altering, suspending, or terminating all or any part of this Agreement, or calling or causing or inducing strikes, work stoppages, or picketing, or establishing boycotts. Nor shall the fact that any such Shop Steward has, on one or more occasions, assumed authority to act for the Union in connection with matters for which he is not hereby authorized to act in behalf of the Union, be deemed evidence of any real or apparent authorization by the Union of such activities by the Shop Steward, unless the Company shall have given the Union written notice of such activity or activities of the Shop Steward and the Union, within a reasonable time thereafter, has failed to post notices on the Bulletin Board located on the Company’s premises directing such Shop Steward to cease and desist from such activities and proclaiming that he has acted beyond the scope of the authority granted him by the Union.
SECTION 20A
ARBITRATION
A)	Any grievance or dispute between the Company and the Union or between the Company and an employee(s) that has been processed in accordance with the provisions of this Section of this Agreement but not satisfactorily settled shall, upon the written request of either party to this Agreement, be submitted to arbitration by an impartial arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If, within five (5) workdays after receipt of such written request, the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator, the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall be requested to submit the names of at least five (5) disinterested persons qualified and willing to act as impartial arbitrators. From such list, the Company and the Union shall each alternately strike one name until all but one name has been eliminated and the

name which remains on the list shall be selected to act as the impartial arbitrator. The procedure to be followed in submitting the difference or dispute to the arbitrator shall, unless agreed upon by the parties with three (3) workdays after the selection of the arbitrator, be determined by the arbitrator himself. The arbitrator shall submit his decision, in writing, within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearing, or hearings, as the case may be, and the decision of the arbitrator so rendered shall be final and binding upon the employee(s) involved and upon the parties to this Agreement and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The compensation and necessary expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union.
B)	In the event a grievance is referred to arbitration, this Agreement shall be the sole basis on which the arbitrator’s decision is rendered, and in reaching his decision the arbitrator shall have no authority to amend, modify, or in any way change its terms. In discipline and discharge cases, the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine just cause.
C)	The function of the Arbitrator shall be of a judicial rather than a legislative nature. The Arbitrator shall not substitute his judgment for the Company’s judgment, and where matters of judgment are involved; he shall be limited to deciding whether or not the Company acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in bad faith. The Arbitrator shall not decide issues which are not directly involved in the case submitted to him, and no decision of the Arbitrator shall require the rate or wage basis different from or the payment of any wages in addition to, those expressly set forth in this Agreement. In any discharge or disciplinary layoff case where the Arbitrator decides that the aggrieved employee should be awarded any back pay, the Company shall be entitled to full credit on such award for the employee’s gross interim earnings or, unemployment and workers’ compensation benefits or disability benefits received by the employee during the period he was not working for the Company. Subject to the foregoing qualifications and limitations, the Arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding upon the Company, the Union and the aggrieved employee or employees.

STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS
(A)	The parties agree that they will promptly attempt to adjust all complaints, disputes or grievances arising between them involving questions of interpretation or application of any clause or matter covered by this Agreement as well as by act, conduct or relation between the parties, direct or indirect. If a party delays, unduly, refuses or fails to utilize or submit to the grievance and/or arbitration procedure, the other party may submit such refusal, failure, or delay to the National Labor Relations Board for adjudication.
(B)	The Company agrees that during the term of this Agreement there shall be no lockouts. However, the closing down of the Company’s business or any part thereof, or curtailing any operations for business reasons, shall not be construed to be a lockout.
(C)	The Union, its officers, agents, members and all employees covered by this Agreement agree that for the duration of this Agreement there shall be no strikes, sit downs, slow downs, stoppage of work, boycott or any acts that interfere with the Company's operations or production. It is also agreed that no employee shall fail to cross any picket line to report to work, unless such picket line is a lawful primary picket line of the Union signatory hereto. Any violation of this provision may be made the subject of disciplinary action, including discharge, at the sole discretions of the Company.
(D)	The Company shall have the right to discipline, including discharge, any employee who (whether individually or in a group) instigates, participates in or gives leadership to any activity herein prohibited. The Company shall have no obligation to attempt to discipline each and every employee who engages in a violation of this article. If discipline in this regard is challenged through the grievance procedure and proceeds to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have no power to review the reasonableness of or modify the penalties imposed, but he may order back pay only upon an affirmative finding of innocence on the part of the employee.
(E)	In any case where a work stoppage, slow down or strike occurs, upon notification by the Company, the Union will immediately post the following notice at the affected facility, on the Union’s bulletin board:

(F)	The Company may, at its option and expense, require employees to submit to a physical or mental examination once each year by a doctor designated by the Company. Additional physical or mental examinations may be required in connection with any compensation or insurance claim or litigation, and may also be required if the Company has reason to believe that any employee has such physical or mental impairment or disease as may endanger the safety or health of other employees, the Company’s customers or the public, or constitute a hazard to the employee in his employment with the Company. If such impairment or disease is revealed by such examination, the affected employee may, at the Company’s option, be placed on a leave of absence until such impairment has been corrected or such disease cured. Nothing in this Article is meant to be, or shall be a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(G)	When an employee is involved in an accident while on duty or on the Company’s business, he shall immediately report said accident (by telephone if necessary) to his supervisor or to an official of the Company at the Company’s general offices, and such report shall include as full and complete a description as possible of any personal injury, death, or property damage involved in said accident, and all other relevant facts concerning said accident. The employee shall follow all instructions which may be given to him by the Company with respect to said accident and shall complete and sign such written statements and reports concerning said accident as may be required by the Company or by law.
(H)	The Company will implement an Annual Safety Incentive program that will allow an annual maximum payment of $500.00, prorated at the rate of $41.66 for every month worked (fifteen (15) days or more will constitute a worked month), for each full-time employee who completes the period January 1 - December 31st injury and accident free.

SAVING CLAUSE
(A)	In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to be in conflict with or violation of any state or federal statute, rule or decision or valid administrative rule or regulation, such statute, rule or decision or valid administrative rule or regulation shall govern and prevail, but all provisions of this Agreement not in conflict therewith shall continue in full force and effect, anything herein apparently to the contrary notwithstanding.
(B)	This Agreement sets out the entire understanding between the Company and the Union. Neither party intends to be bound or obligated except to the extent that it has expressly so agreed herein, and this Agreement shall be strictly construed. This Agreement applies only to the collective bargaining unit defined in Article I hereof, and no employee covered by this Agreement shall ever have or be entitled to any rights, benefits or privileges in any other bargaining unit, plant or operation of the Company (now existing or hereafter established) by virtue of this Agreement. None of the benefits, rights or privileges accorded by this Agreement to the Union or to any employee covered by this Agreement, except arbitration of preexisting arbitrable grievances, disputes or claims, shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement or the permanent discontinuance of the business operations and bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
(C)	The Union shall not be responsible for unauthorized acts of any person merely because he is a member of the Union, and the Employer shall not file any suit against the Union for damages under the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, based on the claim that the Union is responsible for the unauthorized act of any person solely because he is a member of the Union or because he is represented by the Union. The Company shall be privileged to discipline employees responsible for, and engaging in such unauthorized activities, including the right to discharge, which discipline by the Company, shall not be subject of grievance, unless such grievance is filed by an authorized officer of the Union with seven (7) days following the effective date of the disciplinary action.

INTERIM AMENDMENT
(A)	The Company and the Union each acknowledge that this Agreement has been reached as the result of collective bargaining in good faith by both parties hereto, and that both parties hereto have had the unlimited opportunity during negotiations to submit and discuss proposals on all subjects which are bargainable matters. While it is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto that each of them fully shall perform all obligations by them to be performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Union and the Company agree that the Company shall be obligated to impact bargain with the Union, during the term of this Agreement, on any and all matters pertaining to rates of pay.

(B)	This Agreement may be amended at any time by an agreement in writing.
