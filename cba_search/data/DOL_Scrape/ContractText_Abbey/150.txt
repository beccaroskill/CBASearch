BellSouth Advertising & Publishing Corporation
EFFECTIVE August5,2001 " $ 1T / 6 7

TO EMPLOYEES:
The Communications Workers of America is the official bargaining representative for all employees in your collective bargaining unit. This official relationship carries with it serious obligations and responsibilities which the Company and the Union are determined to fulfill. As a sign of good faith between BellSouth Advertising and Publishing Corporation and the Communications Workers of America, a "Responsible Relationship" clause, Article 28,01, is included in the Agreement which governs your wages, hours and working conditions.
Simply stated, "mutual respect and responsibility" means an honest regard for equality in the official relationship between Company and Union representatives. It does not allow for a supervisor attempting to "pull rank" on a Union representative nor does it allow for a Union representative attempting to intimidate or "badger" a supervisor merely because there is a difference in point of view. It further means that no Company representative at any level should regard a grievance as merely an irritant, just as it also means that no Union representative should offer "grievances" which are designed only to harass management. Additionally, this clause means that Union and Company representatives must not engage in activities to undercut or belittle each other.
Company representatives, and especially the first level of supervision, have the day to day responsibility to deal reasonably and in good faith with Union representatives. They have the right, in return, to expect responsibility and respect from the Union’s representatives. To insure continually improving relations between the Company and Union, it is the intent of both organizations to deal with each other at all levels in a sincere, honest, and businesslike manner. This effort by both parties should insure a better feeling for the needs of the employees.
_ “ Sincerely, ~	------- - - - .....................................
For the Union;
Jimmy Smith
Vice President
For the Company: John G. Robinson President

Except for payment for overtime hours worked, all hours worked by a part-time employee will be paid at the equivalent basic hourly rate for a comparable full-time employee working a normal tour in the same job title, classification, and work group. Part-time employees will not be eligible to receive overtime payments until they have worked a normal tour or work week for a comparable full-time employee.

8
1.40 — 2.01B5
2.	The classification of a part-time employee is based on the employee’s "part-time equivalent work week" which will be determined prospectively by dividing the employee's total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4,35 equals 15.6 rounded to a "part-time equivalent work week" classification of 16.)
3.	The "part-time equivalent work week" classification of each part-time employee will be reviewed by the Company on April 1 and October 1 of each year and more often if appropriate. Indicated adjustments, if appropriate, will be on a prospective basis. In determining whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Company will consider the actual average number of hours worked per month during the preceding six (6) month period and the likelihood that such number of work hours will continue for a reasonably foreseeable period of time except that any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate will not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
4.

5.	Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who work parttime on or after January 1, 1981 will thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to receive payments for the benefits and other items listed above on

B.	Appropriate allowances for wage experience calling for rates higher than such "Start" rates may be made as outlined in the sub-sections of this paragraph.
1.	Persons with previous work experience may be granted wage experience credit, if their previous work experience is directly related to the duties of the new job. The previous work experience must be verifiable with satisfactory performance.

2.	An employee formerly employed by the Company, another BellSouth Company, or any Company as required by applicable law(s), will have his/her former wage experience credit adjusted in accordance with the following table if re-employed in the same or lower-rated job classification:
For Months Out of Service
Less than 24 Months 24 but less than 48 Months Over 48 Months
Number of Months to be Deducted from Former Wage Length of Service
0 Months
6 Months
12 Months
In all cases, if an employee’s wage credit is adjusted, the employee will be placed in the nearest wage step to his/her adjusted wage length of service.
10
2.02-2.02B4
a.	If the employee had directly related experience or training during his/her absence from the Company or another BellSouth company which the Company considers of value, he/she will be given credit for this experience or training in addition to the credit provided above. Normally this credit will not exceed fifty percent (50%) of such actual work experience nor result in an allowable maximum credit of more than twenty-four (24) months.
b.	Each of a series of successive breaks in service will be computed in the same manner using the table above.
c.	The above table does not apply to an employee reengaged within four years after layoff as provided in Article 7 or employees returning from authorized leaves as provided in Article 6, but he/she will receive credit for the outside experience or training of value under ''a'* above.
3.	The provisions of "2" above will also be applicable to such a former employee when re-employed in a higher-rated job classification except that his/her wage rate and wage length of service on the higher-rated job will be established as follows:
a.	The wage rate to be received on the higher-rated job will be either the same as that calculated by the use of the above table for the lower-rated job at the location to which the employee is re-employed or the starting rate of the higher-rated job, whichever is greater. If the calculated rate is not an exact step on the wage scale for the higher-rated job, the employee will be paid the nearest'higher or lower step rate. -
b.	The wage length of service will be the number of months applicable to the wage rate determined by "a" above.
4.	An employee of another BellSouth Company transferring to this Company on a higher-rated job classification will have wage rate and wage length of service computed
11
Article 2
according to "a" and "b" of 2.02B3. An employee of another BellSouth Company transferring to this Company in the same or lower-rated job classification will be given credit for the wage experience accrued with the other BellSouth Company. The employee's wage rate will be determined by reading the wage length of service directly into the wage scale being entered.
5.	Upon employment, persons who have previous experience with independent telephone companies will be given wage experience credit commensurate with such previous training and experience that is of value to the Company, but in no event will the wage experience credit allowed be more than the employee would have received had such previous training and experience been with this Company or another BellSouth Company as determined under the provisions of 2.02B2 of the Agreement.
C. This section will not apply to persons initially engaged for technical assignments, or to persons engaged for typing or stenographic work or other work comparable to the work performed by such persons prior to their engagement by the Company.
2.03 Wage Progression Schedules.
The wage progression increases provided tn the attached wage scales will be automatic unless the wage scales specifically state otherwise.
2.04 Effective Date for Progression Increases.
The effective date for progression increases will be the beginning of the payroll period nearest the anniversary date of the employee’s wage experience date.

12
2.02B5-2.06B
A.	In the event that such action is taken, the progression steps on the wage scale or scales affected at such location or locations will be revised in accordance with the following procedure unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union:
1.	Establish the new starting rate which will be an increase of not less than $3,00 per week.
2.	Establish new progression steps in multiples of fifty cents, but not less than $1.00, to meld the increased starting rate into the existing wage scale.
3.	The new progression steps will be established at intervals of not less than three months nor more than twelve months.
B.	On the date the new starting rate is placed in effect, the Company agrees to adjust the wage rates of all employees on the payroll as of that date to the new rates established in accordance with their wage experience.
C.	At any time after the above action has been taken, the Company may reinstate the wage rates provided in the related wage scale or scales listed in Appendix B, However, if this is done no employee on the payroll at that time will have his/her wage rate reduced because of this action.
D.	The Company will notify the Union in all instances where changes in starting rates are to be made. The Union will have the right within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice by the Company to conduct negotiations concerning such changes.
2,06 Promotional Increases.

13
Article 2
2.07 Transfers Without Change in Wage Scale to Locations Having Lower Wage Zones.
A.	When an employee who has worked currently and continuously for a period of six months or more in a location or locations having a higher wage zone is transferred in the same wage scale to a location having a lower wage zone, his/her rate of pay will not be reduced if it is not above the maximum rate for the job at the new location.
1.	If his/her rate is not above the maximum at the new location he/she will continue at such rate until his/her wage length of service entitles him/her to an increase on the wage scale in effect at the new location.
2.	If his/her rate is above the maximum at the new location, his/her rate will be reduced to that maximum.
B.	When an employee who has not worked currently and continuously for a period of six months or more in a location or locations having a higher wage zone is transferred in the same wage scale to a location having a lower wage zone, his/her rate of pay will be adjusted at the time of transfer to the rate applicable to his/her wage experience credit on his/her wage scale for the lower zone.

For employees who will have their service bridged in accordance with 1.30 prior to or on the effective date of the new schedule, the seniority date to be indicated will be the new seniority date arrived at by such bridging of seniority. No change will be made in the seniority date shown on the list for an employee after his/her new seniority date has been passed in the assignment of tours. For the purpose of this section, employees temporarily assigned to a different work group in the same location will be considered as members of their regular group.
Employees with "Acting" titles in work groups other than those in which they regularly work will be included on the seniority list for the work group in which the "Acting" title is held, unless it is expected that the employees will return to their regular work group on or before the effective date of the new schedule.

The Company will make a reasonable effort to contact employees on the seniority list in the order listed for the purpose of obtaining preferences for choice of tours, except for the following: employees on vacation; employees absent from the location of their residence; and e'mployees’on leave of absencer Since-such contacts,-and — the assignment to basic tours will be made in the order of seniority in accordance with the list referred to in 2b
19
Article 3
above, the time consumed in attempting to contact each employee will be necessarily limited. Accordingly, it is contemplated that employees will express in advance assignments they prefer if they will not be readily available for such contact. Changes will not be made in any assignment after an assignment is made to the next person on the list.
a.	Employees on vacation, employees on leave of absence who are expected to return on or before the effective date of schedule, employees absent from the location of their residence, and employees whom the Company was unsuccessful in its efforts to contact, unless they have expressed in advance a preference for a different available tour, will be given assignments identical with their present assignments, if available. Employees who have not expressed a preference for an available tour, and for whom an identical assignment is not available, will be assigned a tour of the same general type with the nearest ending time to the ending time of their present assignment, or if a tour of the same general type is not available then a tour of a different type with the nearest ending time to the ending time of their present assignment.
b.	Employees on leave of absence who are expected to return on or before the effective date of the schedule who did not work during the present schedule and have not expressed a preference for choice of an available assignment on the new schedule, will be assigned any available tour.

6.	Employees who enter the work group or who return to work (except those returning from vacation or benefits) after all employees on the seniority list have been assigned, will have no seniority for preference in choice of assignments on this schedule. However, employees (except those re-entering by transfer or re-engagement) who have been given an assignment on the new schedule who return to the work group during the period the schedule is in effect will continue on such assignments for the duration of the schedule.
a.	Where employees enter the work group under the provisions of Article 7 after all assignments have been made, such employees will exercise full seniority for choice of tours on separate schedules.
b.	Employees mentioned in "6" above, who are considered as having no seniority for choice of assignments, will have no seniority for this purpose; but, where there are two or more such employees in the work group, they will be afforded an opportunity to
- exercise seniority among themselves in preference for— . choice of assignments on the weekly work schedule.
21
Article 3
7.	Employees having their service bridged after the effective date of the new schedule, thus entitling them to additional seniority, will have the opportunity to express preference for choice of tours at the next time all employees within the group have an opportunity to express this preference. Until that time the old service date will determine seniority for choice of tours.

No differential payments for evening and night work will be made unless some or all of the hours which would otherwise constitute a normal work day if scheduled over five days fall within the period of time for which such differential is paid in which
23
Article 4
event differential payments will be made in accordance with the agreement.
b.	Flexible-Time Scheduling
(1)	Flexible-time scheduling will consist of fixed “core” hours with varying beginning and/or ending times as deemed appropriate. Such scheduling will be subject to the scheduling provisions of this Article except the beginning and/or ending times may vary according to individual needs.

FORCE ADJUSTMENTS
7.01 Reduction in Force.
A.	The Company will endeavor to operate the business tn a manner which will continue to provide employment security for all regular, full-time employees consistent with the needs of the business.
1.	When, as a result of a technological change, a force surplus exists, which may result in the displacement of regular, full-time employees, the Company will adhere to the following procedures to reduce or' eliminate the detrimental impact of such displacement. In such event, the Company will notify the Union, in writing, at least six (6) months prior to any force adjustment procedures being implemented.
2.	The Company will notify the Union, at the Executive Level, of anticipated force reductions other than technological reductions prior to the reductions.
3.	Following such notification provided in 7.01 Al, the Company will meet with the Union at the Executive Level. The Union will be given the opportunity to make recommendations to decrease the detrimental effect of the technological change on employees. The Company may consider the appropriateness of the following:
•	the Union's recommendations;
•	engaging temporary employees in jobs that will become surplus;
•	engaging temporary employees in jobs in the same job title and/or work location who later could be terminated to make positions available for regular employees whose jobs have become surplused;
•	offering time off without pay and enhanced personal leaves of absences;
54
______________________________________________7.01 -7.01C1
•	terminating temporary employees in non-effected areas;
•	a hiring freeze;
. job sharing;
B.	Following the above, the Company will determine the job title(s), work group(s) and departments) in which a surplus exists and the number of jobs considered to be suiplus. Thereafter, the Company will notify the Union of such determination.
1.	After compiling a surplus list, each employee on the list will be eligible for participation in the orientation concerning the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank as described in Article 24. The Job Bank provides guidance to surplus employees on career counseling, training and retraining, job opportunities, etc.
C.	The force reduction will be implemented as follows:
1.	The affected employees will be grouped with the following employees for the purposes of reclassifying such employees to vacancies for which they qualify.
•	Employees on technological leave of absence in the location.
■	Employees who have return rights to the title pursuant to 7.01 E.
*	Employees who are participants in the Job Bank as described under 24.05D.
.	Employees in the location in the process of being displaced.
These employees (regardless of their present department) will be considered, in seniority order, in filling vacancies (regardless of department in which the vacancies exist). A vacancy will not be considered to exist when an employee desires to follow his/her work to another location due to reorganization or centralization. Surplus employees may elect to follow their work across state lines, when no equal
55
Article 7
level vacancy exists for which they can qualify in the surplus employee's location.
The normal sequence for handling this procedure will be in accordance with the following steps and will apply to both technological and economic surplus unless excluded in the step:
a.	Fill available vacancies (same or lower level jobs regardless of department) in the work location in order of seniority. Employees may reject lower level job offers and continue to be processed. Employees refusing equal level vacancies in their location will not be processed for other equal or lower level vacancies.
b.	Fill remaining available equal level vacancies in the work location by reclassifying surplus employees in inverse order of seniority.
2.	Offer SIPP and ESIPP to Reduce Surplus
In order to be considered for SIPP/ESIPP eligible employees must notify the appropriate Employment Office in advance that they are interested in such an offer.
Offer SIPP as outlined in 8.02A of the Agreement to those employees doing essentially the same type work in the location. If this SIPP offer does not reduce the surplus sufficiently or does not create enough vacancies to handle the surplus, the Company will offer Expanded SIPP (ESIPP) to non-surplus SIPP eligible employees. The offer will be made in seniority order among those employees who have expressed interest tn accordance with the following paragraphs in an effort to create vacancies for the surplus employees.
Non-surplus employees who are offered ESIPP under these procedures must accept or reject the offer by not later than the tenth calendar day following the date on which the offer is made.
56
____________________________________7.01Cla-7.01C2a ESIPP will not be offered in order to create vacancies for employees who are not qualified or for whom extensive training in excess of 14 weeks would be required.
Should a surplus employee decline a vacancy created under these procedures, the ESIPP offer will be withdrawn from the offered individual.
a.	Allow surplus employees to express their interest, in the order of priority they desire, for equal or lower rated jobs, within the location or in a location within 40 miles. Surplus employees may also select one location anywhere in the Company beyond 40 miles where they will accept a move to a vacancy within their title which may be created through ESIPP.
Should the surplus employee decline to express his/her interest as described above, the Company may offer ESIPP in seniority order to create an equal level job for which the suiplus employee can qualify within 40 miles of the surplus employees present place of reporting. Should such a vacancy be created, the suiplus employee must accept the job or be separated from the Company without termination allowance. All involuntary movement will be in inverse order of seniority.
To accommodate the express interest of surplus employees, the Company will:
•	offer ESIPP within the location in any department to create equal level jobs;
•	offer ESIPP within the location in any department to create lower level jobs;
•	offer ESIPP in a location within 40 miles to create equal level jobs;
•	offer ESIPP in a location within 40 miles to create lower level jobs;
. offer ESIPP in a location within the Company beyond 40 miles to employees holding the same
57
Article 7
title as the surplus employee should the surplus employee request a move to such location and should there be no vacancy without ESIPP. Only one such offer will be made for each surplus employee.
b.	Employees accepting lower rated jobs under this paragraph will be treated under the provisions of 8.0 IB or C, as appropriate. Employees who decline lower* rated jobs will continue to be processed.
c.	The Company may offer, but is not required to offer, SIPP/ES1PP for economic surplus.
d.	Vacancies created by SIPP or ESIPP will be filled in the order of seniority by surplus employees and will not be treated as vacancies under other provisions of the contract relating to the filling of vacancies.
e.	Generally ESIPP will not be used to create vacancies in other locations where surplus exists.
f.	Employees who elect not to accept a job offer 40 miles from their present place of reporting will continue to be processed. Employees electing to move to a job over 40 miles from their present place of reporting will receive moving expense as described in 9.01B and 7.01G.
3.	If further Force Adjustments are deemed necessary by the Company, layoff employees with less than 5 years seniority in the affected title, in any department holding the affected title, in all locations within 40 miles of the surplus location, who perform the same type work, to the extent necessary to eliminate the surplus as follows:
a.	Prepare a combined seniority list of the less than 5 year employees holding the surplus title, in any department in the surplus location and in those locations within 40 miles of the surplus location.
b.	Layoff in inverse order of seniority from the combined list of employees with less than 5 years seniority to the 58
______________________________________7.01C2b-7.01C5b(2) extent necessary to relieve the surplus and reassign or transfer surplus employees to the created vacancies.
4.	If any surplused employee cannot be placed after the above steps have been implemented, the employee will be considered for vacancies for which they are qualified, throughout the Company. The Company and the Union both recognize that relocation is not favored by the employees, the Union, or the Company. Available positions will be offered by seniority, with consideration to avoiding the relocation of employees, in the following order
•	same job title, same location or another location within 40 miles
•	same wage scale, same location or another location within 40 miles
•	same job title, different location, more than 40 miles
•	same wage scale, different location, more than 40 miles
•	demotion, same location or another location within 40 miles
>	demotion, different location, more than 40 miles
5.	If further adjustments are deemed necessary by the Company, the affected employees in seniority order will be offered:
a.	The opportunity to bump junior employees in the same location, provided he/she is qualified to do that employee's job. Refusal of an offer to bump qualifies the employee for termination allowance under 8.03B,
b.	Reassignment to vacancies in other entities as follows:
(1)	Reassignment to equal or lower level vacancies in the same location.
(2)	Reassignment to same level job vacancy in another location pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Article 7
the receiving entity's collective bargaining agreement.
The reassignments in "b" will only be done when there are no employees in the following categories who may claim the vacancy:
•	Surplus in the entity where the vacancy exists.
*	Employees in the entity where the vacancy exists who have return rights to the vacancy.
•	Employees in the entity where the vacancy exists who have mandatory rights of return from a leave of absence.
If the employee chooses "a" above the bumping provisions will be implemented as follows:
c.	The remaining surplused employees will constitute the Potential Layoff List (PLL)).
d.	A Location Layoff List (LLL), equal the number of employees on the PLL, will be developed as follows:
(1)	A list of employees, in inverse order of seniority, in the same title, in any department, in the same location (specifying the place of reporting if more than one exists in the location);
(2)	Then: A list of employees, in inverse order of seniority, in other equal or lower level titles, in any department, in the location (specifying the place of reporting if more than one exists in the location), will be added;	-
6.	Each PLL employee will be given a copy of the PLL and the LLL and will have five calendar days to give the Company his/her choice(s) in rank order for the LLL or termination allowance. Employees’ choices are limited to the same, equal or lower rated titles that are available on the LLL, in which there are employees junior in seniority to them.
60
7.01C5c- 7.01 E
Employees listed on the IXL will be given a copy of the PLL and LLL and advised that their job is in jeopardy.
Employees listed on the LLL who are bumped and are more senior than a remaining PLL or LLL employee may bump a more junior employee holding an equal or lower level job on the LLL,
7.	If further Force Adjustments are deemed necessary by the Company, the remaining affected employees may elect to either:
a.	be laid off and paid termination pay under 8.03B, or;
b.	participate in the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank as described in Article 24.
D.	An employee one step out of the bargaining unit, with five or more years of seniority, who is notified by the Company that his/her job is declared surplus locally may be reassigned to a job within the same department in a title which he/she formerly held including "acting" titles, or a job which he/she can satisfactorily perform,
1.	If the above reclassification of employees results in a surplus in the location in another title or titles, the provisions of Article 7 may be concurrently applied to such force surplus.
E.	Employees transferred and/or demoted under 7.01C, moved under 7.01C, or 12.04 will have the right, in order of their seniority, to return within 5 years to service in the location from which they were displaced as jobs become available in the job title they now hold or which they were holding at the time of transfer provided the employee has a valid request on file under 12.01B. The employee may only have one 7.01E request on file. The rejection by the employee of an offer of a job pursuant to the above will discharge the Company of any further obligation hereunder.
Employees demoted within the location under 7.0IC above will have the right, in order of their seniority, to be reinstated in a vacancy within 5 years, in the location, in the job he/she
61
Article 7
held at the time of his/her demotion, provided he/she has a valid request on file to be reinstated in such job. The rejection of an offer of a job, in the location, in the title held at the time of the demotion will discharge the Company of any further obligation hereunder.
Vacancies that are filled under the provisions of 7.01 E by such reinstatements will not be subject to the provisions of Article 12.
F.	Any regular employee whose job is affected by the force surplus due to technological change as described in 7.01 and is not eligible for a service pension may elect not to accept a reassignment involving a lower rate of pay or to a location more than 40 miles away and will be paid a termination allowance. Any such regular employee who refuses to accept a transfer to a job title having the same or greater rate of pay and which does not require a change in residence will not be paid a termination allowance.
G.	A job will be considered commutable, and therefore not requiring a change in residence, if the job is within a location less than 40 miles away from the employee's current location. Any employee who accepts a position under 7.01 C3, which is at a location more than 40 miles from their current location and relocates their residences make the job commutable will be reimbursed for moving expenses under 9.0IB.
H.	Although the filling of vacancies across entity lines under this Article is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures, the Company recognizes its obligation to make a good faith effort to consider employees who have been identified as surplus in other entities and to place such employees in vacancies.
7.02 Recalled After Layoff.
A. Laid off employees will have the right to be recalled as follows:
62
7.01F-7.02 A5a
1.

5.	A former employee who wishes to accept such offer of re-employment will notify the Company of such intention within nine work days and will normally return to the employment of the Company within fourteen days from the date of such notification, which is conclusively to be presumed to have been given as of the date of the mailing of such notification.
a.	Where the time periods specified in 7.02A6 above will work an undue hardship on an employee, they may be extended.
63
Article 7
6.	No impairment which existed at termination of last preceding period of Company service will be considered as just cause for a denial of re-employment.
7.	Any employee recalled under the provisions of this section within four years from the date of his/her layoff will have the continuity of his/her service protected, including seniority, and if his/her layoff was not for more than six months duration, he/she will be allowed service and seniority credit for such layoff unless it began within twelve months of a previous layoff.

10.	Laid off employees will be recalled based upon their seniority date on the date of layoff.
11.	Decisions regarding the recall and filling of vacancies of employees under the provisions of 7.02 may be discussed between the appropriate CW A & Company representative. Such decisions, however, are not subject to the grievance & arbitration procedures.
7.03 Temporary Hiring of Laid Off Employees.

B.	RPPP (Reassignment Pay Protection). When an employee is reclassified to a lower rated job under 7.0 IC, or as a result of a medical impairment (see 8.04) the employee's rate of pay will be reduced over a period of time based on the employee's length of seniority. The reductions in pay will be effective at periods following reassignment as shown below and each reduction is based on the difference in the appropriate rates for the old and new jobs;

C.	An employee with 15 years or more of seniority who, due to technological changes, or as a result of a medical impairment (see 8.04), is assigned to a vacancy with a lower rate of pay than the then current rate of the employee's regular job will continue to be paid in the lower level job, an amount equivalent to the rate of pay of the higher paid job in effect at the time of the downgrade. Such wage treatment will continue for 36 months following the effective date of the downgrade. Any employee involved in such downgrades will receive any increases in pay in amounts which are applicable for a comparable employee in the lower-rated job to which downgraded. At the end of the 36 month period following the date of the downgrade, the employee's wages will be reduced on the following scale:

1.	His rate of pay will not be reduced if it is not above the maximum rate for the new job and he/she will continue at such rate until his/her wage experience credit entitles him/her to an increase on the scale for his/her new job. He/she will receive initial credit for wage length of service on the new job in an amount equal to the wage length of service credited to him/her in his/her old job, except that if he/she had formerly held a job in the lower classification to which he/she is being reclassified, his/her wage experience credit will be established as the wage experience credit formerly attained in the lower

Transfers under force imbalance circumstances will be confined to locations within 100 miles of his/her present location.
E.	When the Company decides that a job would be filled by involuntarily transferring employees from one job to another, within the same location, or outside the location, it will not
115
Article 12
affect the running of the time-in-title nor the time-in-location referred to in 12.01B7.8 and 9,
12.05 Temporary Transfers.
A.	None of the foregoing provisions of this Article will apply to temporary transfers, which are defined as follows: An employee will be in a temporary transfer status when he/she is assigned to work outside his/her permanent reporting location and is not returned to such location on Company time at the conclusion of the day's work.
1.	When an employee is to be assigned to work outside his/her permanent reporting location, the Company will advise the employee whether he/she will be temporarily transferred, or be returned to his/her permanent reporting location at the conclusion of each day of work. In the event that the employee is returned to his/her permanent reporting location at the conclusion of the day’s work, the assignment will be considered as "all in a day's work".
2.	The Company may terminate a temporary transfer by returning the employee to his/her permanent reporting location on Company time and expense. However, temporary transfers will not be terminated on nonscheduled or non-work days prior to the completion of the employee's temporary assignment, except as follows:
a.	When the employee's services are temporarily needed in his/her permanent repotting location for a full tour or more.
b.	Employees may be permitted to take their scheduled vacation, unscheduled vacation, excused time, or Paid Personal Time etc., while on a temporary assignment. In this event, the Company is obligated to return the employee to his/her permanent reporting location on Company time and travel expense, provided he/she wants to commence his/her vacation from his/her home base. Should the employee elect to commence his/her vacation at his/her temporary location and continue to receive his/her per diem allowance, he/she
116
12.05 - 12.05B
may do so, if the per diem cost for the period does not exceed the cost of returning the employee to his/her permanent reporting location and back to the temporary location on Company time and expense.
c.	When the employee becomes ill to the extent that he/she is unable to work, and his/her illness is expected to continue for an extended period. In this event, his/her temporary transfer should be terminated as soon as he/she is able to travel. (An illness that is expected to be of short duration should be handled in accordance with "c" above if the employee is able to return to his/her permanent reporting location.)
3.	When an employee's temporary transfer is terminated under the conditions outlined in 12.05A2b, and c above, he/she may be placed back on the same temporary assignment, provided he/she returns to the temporary location on his/her first scheduled day to work after his/her transfer was terminated. If the employee performs work in his/her permanent reporting location after a temporary transfer has been broken, he/she should not be placed back on temporary transfer except as required or permitted under the selection procedures outlined in 12.05C1 or C2.
4.	A temporary transfer may be terminated without the employee having to physically return to his/her home base. He can be paid for the equivalent time and travel expense that would have been incurred had he/she actually returned. Such time and expense should be based on the means of transportation authorized by the Company at the beginning of his/her temporary transfer.
B.	The Company recognizes the undesirability, both from the standpoint of the transferring employees and the resident employees, of temporarily transferring employees to work away from their regular location for extended periods, and will neither make nor effectuate such transfers except to meet needs of the business.
117
Article 12
1. When it does become necessary to temporarily transfer an employees), such employee(s) will be given as much advance notice as feasible. Where the temporary transfer is beyond reasonable commuting distance and is expected to last in excess of one week* and the employee(s) was not given as much as five (5) days of advance notice, he/she should be given a reasonable amount of time off with pay, if needed, to handle his/her personal business prior to being transferred. Such excused time should not exceed one tour for interstate transfers or one session for intrastate transfers.
C.	The following procedures will be followed in the selection of individual employees for temporary transfers. However, in emergency situations the Company may transfer work groups without applying these procedures.
I.	When it becomes necessary to transfer employees temporarily to an assignment expected to be of more than one week duration, the Company will make a determination as to the work unit or units from which it desires to make such transfers. (Work unit for this purpose will be all employees within a given title who have a common place of reporting and who perform the same job duties.) AU employees in the unit or units will be notified of the proposed transfer, either by personal supervisory contacts or by a notice placed on bulletin boards within the selected unit or units. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, needs of the business permitting.
If the above procedure does not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, all employees holding the same title and who are performing the same job duties within the location (in multi-district locations, the district) and department from which the transfers are to be made will be notified of the proposed transfers, either by personal supervisory contacts or by notices placed on bulletin boards. Qualified employees volunteering for the
118
12.05B1 - 12.05C2
assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, needs of the business permitting. Should additional employees be needed, selection will be made in the inverse order of seniority from among qualified employees, in the same job title and department who are performing the same duties, within the same location (in multi-district locations, the district) from which the Company elects to make the transfer, needs of the business permitting, provided such transfers will not result in a special hardship to such employees or their immediate families.
2.	When temporary transfers are expected to be of one week duration or less, the Company will make a determination as to the work group in the location from which it desires to make such transfers. Where practicable, all employees in the work group will be notified of the proposed transfer, either by personal supervisory contact or by a notice placed on the bulletin board within the selected work group. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, needs of the business permitting.
If the above procedure does not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, volunteers will be sought using the same procedure from among all employees in the work unit in the location from which the Company desires to make such transfers. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, needs of the business permitting.
If the above procedures do not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, the transfer will be made by transferring in the inverse order of seniority the first qualified employee in the work unit from which the Company has elected to make the transfer, needs of the business permitting, provided such transfer will not result in a special hardship to such employee or his/her immediate family.
119
Article 12
3.	When temporary transferees under 12.05C are transferred to a location in another state, resident employees in work groups in that location performing the same work as that being performed by the temporary transferees will be offered six day work opportunity whenever the temporary transferees are offered six days.
D.	Basic pay treatment for temporarily transferred employees will continue in accordance with the wage progression scale in effect for their job classification at their home location. Any evening or night differential payments applicable will be paid in accordance with the schedule for such differentials in effect in the offices in which they are temporarily working.

1.	When the need for temporary employees diminishes to a point where some employees may be returned.
2.	When junior employees are available while senior employees from the same location (or work unit as appropriate), in the same title, are on temporary duty in other locations, the junior employees will be assigned to relieve the senior employees concurrent with the senior employees' next Company-paid weekend home visit, provided:

a.	When such employees are to perform work in a location within 40 miles of location "B", those initially selected may be so utilized.
(1)	When it is known in advance that the employees selected are to perform work in another location within 40 miles of location "B", this information should be made known to the appropriate employees at the time such employees are being canvassed. Also, when the expected duration of such work is known, the employees will be so advised at the time of canvassing. The Company will endeavor to keep such movement, within the cluster at a minimum, needs of the business permitting.
b.	When employees in location "A" are selected and temporarily transferred to location "B" and the need for work develops in a location more than 40 miles from location "B", the selection process specified in 12.05C should be reinstituted and the appropriate employees in location "A" should be given the opportunity to volunteer for the assignment.
F.	Temporary transfers for the purpose of training will be excluded from the requirements of 12.05C1, C2 and 12.05E.
G.	The movement in and out of locations within a State and between States of employees in the job title Directory Advertising Sales Representative is not a temporary transfer under 12.05.
12.06 Appeal Rights.

3.	Employees, other than those covered in 13.02B2, above who have a common title, a common place of reporting, a common second level supervisor (or higher level in the absence of a second level), and who perform the same type work will be grouped together for choice of vacations.
a.	For the purpose of vacations, the work group for Directory Advertising Sales Representatives will be the Regional Sales Manager's (RSM) Premise Sales Organization. If, prior to vacation selection, the RSM level and the Union agree, Directory Advertising Sales Representatives may be grouped by circuit.

13.06 Preference For Training.
A.	When an employee within a location is to be selected for formal training to equip him/her for some higher-rated work, the principle of seniority will govern,
I.	"Formal training" includes the selection of employees from within a work group who are regularly scheduled to work part time or to relieve in another job in accordance with 4.07H, and the principle of seniority will be observed among all the members of the work groups who are grouped together for the purpose of overtime and vacation selections at the same place of reporting.

126
___________________________________________________13.04- 14.01 A the training, the company will notify all of the incumbents in all of the work groups affected within a location.
1.	Such incumbents will then be offered an opportunity to take the prerequisite test as soon as practicable following such notification and, if they meet minimum test score requirements, will be considered as qualifying for taking the job-specific training.
2.	Those incumbents in (1) above who fail to meet the required minimum test score will be advised of the areas in which they appear to be deficient and will be given the opportunity to receive appropriate general skills training under the Training and Retraining Program.

3.	If an incumbent declines to take the prerequisite test at all, or declines the process offered in (2) above, or fails to successfully complete the job-specific company sponsored training, he/she will be assigned to the unchanged functions within the title within the location to the extent such work is available on a full time basis, so long as such assignment will not adversely affect operations efficiency. If such assignment is not made, or at such time such assignment cannot be continued, the employee may be treated as an "operational efficiencies" surplus under Article 7.
ARTICLE 14
JURISDICTION OF WORK
14.01 Contract Work.
A.	The Company will not, as a general policy, contract out traditional telephone company directory work if such contracting out will currently and directly cause layoffs or part-timing employees.

Article 14
commitments on contracting out work elements of the business.

The parties recognize, however, that there are proper exceptions to this general practice, made in the interest of the service or economical operation, and in such cases nothing herein is intended to prohibit the Company from working such supervisory employees on non-supervisory work.
ARTICLE 15
JOB descriptions, titles and classifications
15.01 Job Titles and Classifications
Whenever the Company determines it appropriate to create a new job title or job classification in the bargaining unit, or to restructure or redefine an existing one, it will be handled as follows:
A.	The Company will notify the Union in writing of such job title or classification and will furnish a job description of the duties and the wage rates and schedules initially determined for such job titles and classifications. Such wage rates and schedules will be designated as temporary. Following such notice to the Union at the Company bargaining level, the Company may proceed to staff such job title or classification.
128
14.01B-15.01F
B.	The Union will have the right, within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from the Company, to initiate negotiations concerning the initial wage rates or schedules established as temporary by the Company.
C.	If negotiations are not so initiated or if agreement is reached between the parties within sixty (60) days following receipt of notice from the Company concerning the wage rates and schedules, the temporary designation will be removed from the job title or classification.
D.	If negotiations are initiated and the parties are unable to reach agreement within sixty (60) days following receipt of notice from the Company, the Union will provide the Company in writing a statement of their position containing the wage rate they consider appropriate for the new or restructured job. The issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates will then be submitted to a neutral third party (NTP), to be selected as set forth below, for determination of the final schedule of wage rates.
E.	It is expected that agreement on a job description be reached during the negotiation. If such agreement is not reached, a joint job description verification study will be undertaken to ensure that the work components assigned to the job by the Company are accurately described. If, following this verification study and any resulting modifications to the job description, agreement still cannot be reached that the work components are accurately described, grievance and arbitration procedures may be initiated. Such grievances must be filed by the Union at the Executive level within the sixty (60) day period described in "D" above.
F.	Once the parties agree the job has been accurately described or the matter has been resolved by arbitration, the Company and the Union will notify the NTP that he/she has been selected and arrange a meeting within the third or fourth week of the first thirty (30) days at a place mutually agreeable with all parties. The NTP will also be informed that each of the parties will send their written rationale for the proposed wage rate of the disputed job to the NTP within two (2) weeks. This
129
Article 15
will include a job description and other agreed upon information. (Memorandum of Understanding)
G.	The Union and Company will meet within two (2) weeks and exchange their rationale for their proposed rate. This will normally include comparisons of not more than two (2) existing bargained-for jobs that each party feels will justify their position. They will jointly mail the required material to the NTP. This material will include: (1) an agreed upon job description of the disputed job, (2) the job descriptions of existing jobs (not more than two) that each party feels justifies the rate of the disputed job and the wage schedule that each party believes should apply, and (3) the parties may include information such as competitive market rates if they so desire. (Memorandum of Understanding)
H.	At the meeting, each party may verbally present its position to the NTP. This meeting is for the purpose of providing the NTP with detailed information concerning the duties of the job, the skills required, the training necessary to perform the work and other related information. Similar information for the comparable jobs as detailed in "G" above may be provided so that the NTP can expeditiously render a fair and informed decision determining the wage rate for the disputed job. It is generally expected this informative meeting would be concluded in one (1) day or less and be completed within thirty (30) days of the NTP selection. Each party will bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses at this meeting.
I.	At the conclusion of this meeting, the NTP must notify the Union and Company if additional information or a job visit is required. The parties will coordinate the provision of additional information or a job visit. If the Union and Company representatives wish to accompany the NTP on the job visit or incumbent interview, they may do so. All of these arrangements must be made so that the decision can be reached within sixty (60) days. (Memorandum of Understanding)
130
15.01G-16.01
J,	While it is not intended that such third party undertake a full and complete job evaluation study, he/she or she will review the job titles and their respective wage schedules as submitted by the Company and the Union for comparison purposes. Also, if necessary the NTP may make an on-site inspection of the workplace and conduct a reasonable number of interviews of incumbents.
K.	The decision should include a brief rationale for the wage schedule that was selected for the disputed job. The intent is that the NTP will select either the wage schedule submitted by the Company or the Union. In the event the NTP selects the wage schedule submitted by the Union, the new schedule will be placed in effect retroactively to the date notification was given to the NTP as specified in "F" above, up to a maximum of sixty (60) days. If the parties mutually agree to waive the time frames specified in Article 15, the period of retroactivity will be a negotiable item to be addressed in the final evaluation of the issue.
L.	The expense of the NTP will be bome equally by the parties.
M.	The neutral third party referred to above will be selected by mutual agreement from a list of five individuals compiled by the Company and the Union. Such individuals on the list will possess acknowledged expertise in the area of job evaluation.
15.02 Procedures to Contest Schedule of Wage Rates.
The procedures set forth in 15.01 above will be the exclusive means by which the Union may contest the schedule of wage rates which the Company sets for any new or restructured job title or classification.

B.	Requests for such leaves of absence will be acted upon promptly by the Company.
26.03 Conditions Of Leaves Of Absence.
Leaves of absence granted under the terms of 26.02 are subject to these conditions.
A.	The period of an employee’s absence on such leave will be included in determining such employee’s seniority with the Company. However, for the purpose of determining the length of service upon which such employee's wage progression is
176
26.02 - 26.03D
based, such employee will be given credit for only the first thirty (30) days of the first leave of absence granted such employee. When the employee returns from leave, his/her wage progression, if determined in accordance with an automatic wage scale, will be accelerated by reducing the normal intervals between increases by one-half until the employee will have attained his/her position on his/her wage scale commensurate with his/her length of service had he/she not been on leave of absence,
B.	During the period of such employee's leave of absence, such employee's qualified dependent, or dependents, will retain eligibility to Sickness-Death Benefits. The employee may continue coverage under the BellSouth Employees' Medical Assistance Plan when employed by CWA or when elected or appointed to a CWA office within a Local Union. The employee may continue his/her own coverage under the BellSouth Employees' Dental Assistance Plan, and the BellSouth Employees' Vision Assistance Plan by individual payment of the full amount of appropriate payment.
C.	Employees who return to Company duty at the expiration of such leaves of absence will be placed on the payroll at the rate received when such absence was granted, adjusted for any changes in wage level made during the period of such leave of absence. In the event such leave of absence has expired and such employee desires to, and is otherwise entitled to, resume employment with the Company, but at the time of such expiration such employee is unable to perform the required Company duties because of sickness, such employee will nevertheless be re-employed, and in determining the eligibility of such employee to sickness payments the first day of such re-employment will be considered as such employee's first day of absence because of sickness.
P. Such leave of absence for an employee will be terminated at his/her request prior to the expiration of such leave of absence only in case the employee is able to perform on a full-time basis the Company duties required of such employee. The term "full-time basis" as used in the preceding sentence, will
177
Article 27
not be construed to deny to such employee incidental participation in Union matters without pay if excused by the Company for such purposes. An employee requesting to return from Union leave under this paragraph will give his/her supervisor reasonable notice.
E.	The termination of this Agreement by either party will not affect the leave status or re-employment rights of an employee who is on leave of absence granted under 26.02.
F.	Notwithstanding the provisions of 21.02, employees on such leaves of absence will not be entitled to receive from the Company any pay or compensation for time consumed in meetings with Management, or necessarily consumed in traveling to and from such meetings.
26.04 Limitations Of Union Leaves.
In the event the Company is of the opinion that the duties being performed by an employee are not within the intent of this Article, the Company will notify the employee and the Union and allow the employee an opportunity to cease such duties.

Each party will bring to the attention of all employees in the bargaining unit their purpose to conduct themselves in a spirit of responsibility and respect and of the measures they have agreed upon to insure adherence to this purpose.
28.02 Total Quality Commitment
The long-term success of the Company and the Union in the ever increasing competitive advertising and publishing business are interrelated and dependent upon our meeting the needs of our customers- both external and internal. The Union, through its membership, has a vital role in the overall success of the Company's operations.
Therefore, the Company and the Union have agreed to the joint pursuit of a business process founded upon a reaffirmation of a customer first focus and rededication to excellence through the Total Quality Process.
Each employee plays a vital role in accomplishing this goal. It is important to keep the employees fully aware of the changes and needs of the advertising and publishing business. Upon mutual agreement, a joint Company/Union committee at the Executive Level may be formed to address technological change as well as other common interests of the parties.
The importance of the Total Quality Process to the Company and the Union is emphasized by the parties committing to joint
179
Article 29
meetings at the Executive Level to ensure that appropriate action is taken to support the Total Quality Process and the employees involved.
28.03 Aligning for the Digital Age
A. The Company and the Union have worked well together to achieve the goal of becoming the leading directory publisher among our peer group. To further that objective, the parties have entered into a new alliance called “Aligning for the Digital Age**. The “Aligning for the Digital Age” plan document will be distributed to all employees.
The Company and the Union recognize that to maintain our leadership position and meet growth objectives in a competitive marketplace requires the efforts of all employees. The “Aligning for the Digital Age” initiative addresses these interests and provides a foundation upon which the Company, CWA and the employees it represents, can successfully meet the challenge and share in the success.

Each employee will have the option of side-by-side or remote call sampling. Remote individual customer contact sampling will occur from within the general work area of the employee being observed and a visible notification made to ail employees when individual customer contact sampling is being conducted from a remote location.
Feedback of all sampled calls will be provided to the employee at the earliest opportunity, normally the same day the sampling occurred. Feedback should be constructive, with emphasis on the positive aspects of the customer contact and in the spirit of improving the employee’s techniques and performance. This feedback will be conducted away from the employee’s workstation.
Employees will not be disciplined as a result of individual customer contact sampling on the first observed occurrence of any incidents of gross customer abuse, fraud or violation of secrecy of communication. In the event of any subsequent incidents within IS months it will be documented and action taken if warranted.
