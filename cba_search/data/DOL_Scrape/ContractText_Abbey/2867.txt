AGREEMENT
This AGREEMENT is entered into between the City of Jacksonville, hereinafter referred to as the Employer1 and The Jacksonville Consolidated Lodge No. 5-30 of the Fraternal Order of Police, hereinafter referred to as the F.O.P. It is the intent and purpose of this Agreement to assure sound and mutually beneficial working and economic relationships between the parties hereto, to provide an orderly and peaceful means of resolving any misunderstandings or differences which may arise and to set forth herein a basic and full agreement between the parties concerning rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, and other terms and conditions of employment. There are and shall be no individual arrangements or agreements covering any part or all of this Agreement contrary to the terms herein provided. Either party hereto shall be entitled to require specific performance of the provisions of this Agreement. It is mutually understood and declared to be the public policy of the Employer and the F.O.P. to promote harmonious and cooperative relationships between the Employer and its employees, and to protect the public by assuring, at all times, the orderly and uninterrupted operations and functions of government.
1 The "Employer" means the Office of the Sheriff or the City of Jacksonville as the context may require.

FOP POLICE OFFICERS ARTICLE 1
F.O.P. RECOGNITION
1.1	Pursuant to and in accordance with all applicable provisions of Chapter 447, Florida Statutes, the
Employer recognizes the F.O.P. as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for those employees in the certified bargaining unit, defined by Certification 278 issued on November 18,1997, as all sworn police officers of the rank of sergeant and below (see attached Schedule A) and full-time temporary sworn certified bailiffs for the purpose of bargaining collectively in the determination of the wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment of the public employees within the bargaining unit unless and until recognition of such bargaining representative is withdrawn by a vote of the majority of the employees represented.
“Employees” shall mean all classified employees who are employed by the City of Jacksonville whose classifications appear on the attached Schedule A.
Terms and conditions of employment for the full-time temporary sworn certified bailiffs referred to in this section are set forth in Appendix A of this Agreement and not in the provisions of the main agreement.
1.2	It is further understood and agreed that the President or an alternate of the Jacksonville Consolidated
Lodge No. 5-30 of the F.O.P. will be the official spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police in any matter between the F.O.P. and the Employer. The alternate shall be selected from one of the officers listed below:
...	Business Agent
First Vice President
Second Vice President
Secretary
Member of Board of Directors
Florida State Lodge representative (with letter of authorization to represent Jacksonville Consolidated Lodge No. 5-30)
1.3	Any alternate designated by the President shall be designated in writing, including the period of time
covered by such designation. A written list of the accredited officers and representatives of the F.O.P. shall be furnished to the Sheriff and the City’s Chief of Human Resources immediately after their designation and the Sheriff and the City’s Chief of Human Resources shall be notified of any changes of said representatives within five (5) days.

ARTICLE 2
F.O.P. SECURITY AND CHECK OFF
2.1	Upon receipt of a written authorization from an employee covered by this Agreement, the Employer
will deduct from the employee's pay the amount owed to the F.O.P. by such employee for dues. There will be twenty-six (26) deductions per year. The Employer will remit such sums to the F.O.P. no later than the tenth (10th) day of the month following such deductions. The F.O.P. will certify any changes in the membership dues rate to the Employer in writing over the signature of the authorized officer or officers of the F.O.P. at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of such change. The Employer’s remittance will be deemed correct if the F.O.P. does not notify the Employer in writing within two (2) weeks of its receipt.
2.2	The F.O.P. will indemnify, defend, and hold the Employer harmless against any claim made and
against any suit instituted against the Employer on account of any check off of F.O.P. dues.
2.3	An employee may revoke his/her authorization for deduction of dues, provided the employee gives
thirty (30) days notice to the F.O.P. and the Employer by registered or certified mail. The Employer will not discontinue dues deduction from any employee prior to authorization of the F.O.P. or the employee. The Employer will not discontinue F.O.P. dues deduction simply because an employee has changed from one F.O.P. bargaining unit to another F.O.P. bargaining unit.
2.4	No dues deduction shall be made from the pay of an employee for any payroll period in which the
employee's net* earnings for that payroll period are less than the amount of dues to be checked off.
• “Net earnings” shall mean “net" after required deduction of federal taxes, Social Security, Pensions, Credit Union, and Health and Life Insurance premiums.
2.5	(a)	If the F.O.P. provides the Employer with at least 100 signed enrollment forms from bargaining unit
employees authorizing their enrollment in an F.O.P. sponsored employee plan or activity, the Employer will create and assign a payroll deduction code for that plan or activity. If, after the creation of the payroll deduction code, the enrollment for that plan or activity falls below seventy-five (75), the City may delete the payroll deduction code from the City payroll system and discontinue payroll deductions for the plan or activity.
(b)	TheF.O.P. recognizes that the Employer's current payroll system limits employees to no more than 12 payroll deductions. If an employee's authorized and/or legally required deductions exceed 12, the deduction will be prioritized as follows:
1.	All legally required deductions will be deducted from the employee's pay check. Legally required deductions include but are not limited to deductions for taxes, court ordered deductions and F.O.P. dues deductions when the employee has authorized dues deductions.
2.	If any remaining payroll deduction slots are available on the employee's paycheck, the slots will be used for City sponsored plans or activities.
3.	If any remaining payroll deduction slots are available on the employee's paycheck, the slots will be used for other F.O.P. sponsored plans or activities that have been authorized by the employee.
4.	If any remaining payroll deduction slots are available on the employee's paycheck, the slots will be used for any other deductions for plans or activities that have been authorized by the employee.
5
FOP POLICE OFFICERS Provided that if any employee requests in writing to change the priority of his/her payroll deductions and replace an F.O.P. deduction with a non-F.O.P. deduction, the written request of the employee will govern.
(c)	Any such plans or activities shall be administered by an "agent of record" designated by the F.O.P. It is understood and agreed that the Employer will assess a charge of 4 cents per deduction per payroll. Further, it is understood and agreed that the Employer assumes no responsibility or liability to or for the F.O.P.'s agent of record. Solicitation for these plans or activities shall only be made at times mutually agreed to by the Office of Human Resources, Jacksonville Sheriffs Office, and the F.O.P. so as to prevent loss of productive work time. The Employer will not have any responsibility to the F.O.P. or the F.O.P.'s agent of record for contacting or communicating with bargaining unit employees about the plans or activities sponsored by or associated with the F.O.P.
(d)	At the time that this agreement was being negotiated, the City was in the process of developing and implementing a new payroll software system which would allow employees to authorize more than twelve payroll deductions per paycheck. The City will notify the F.O.P. when the new system becomes fully operational. At that time, the City will meet with the F.O.P. to renegotiate Article 2.5 for the purpose of increasing the number of slots to be used for F.O.P. sponsored plans or activities.
2.6	In accordance with Chapter 447, Florida Statutes, Public Employees shall have the right to form, join
and participate in or refrain from forming joining and/or participating in any employee organization of their own choosing. They shall have the right to be represented by any employee organization of their choosing to negotiate collectively through a certified bargaining agent with the Employer in the determination of the terms and conditions of their employment.
6
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
ARTICLE 3 F.O.P. ACTIVITIES
3	.1	Employees shall have the right to join the F.O.P., to engage in lawful concerted activities for the
purpose of collective negotiation or bargaining or other mutual aid and protection, to express or communicate any view, grievance, complaint or opinion, within the bounds of good taste, related to the conditions or compensation of public employment or its betterment, all free from any restraint, coercion, discriminations or reprisal. There shall not be restraint, discrimination or reprisal against any employee because of that employee's membership or lack of membership in the F.O.P. or by virtue of his/her holding office or not holding office in the F.O.P. The Employer and the F.O.P. shall apply this provision to all employees.
3	.2	(a) On Duty Solicitation by F.O.P.
Solicitation of any kind by the F.O.P., including the solicitation of grievances, membership, and the collection of F.O.P. monies, shall not be engaged in during working hours.
(b)	F.O.P. Meetings
No F.O.P. meeting shall be held on Employer time.
(c)	On Duty F.O.P. Presentations
The President of the F.O.P. or the designated representative may address any assembly or personnel of the Sheriffs Office at their regular roll call, at each in-service training, and at each recruit class at the police academy for a period of time agreed upon by the F.O.P. and the Office of the Sheriff.
(d)	On Duty solicitation Prohibited
Employees will not be subjected to solicitation for monies or membership by outside groups (including insurance companies or charity groups) while on duty, including roll call.
3.3	The Employer will furnish a bank of three thousand (3000) hours for use as F.O.P. Pool Time. This
time shall be used for F.O.P. activities by any member of the F.O.P. Approval of such time shall be authorized by either the F.O.P. President, First Vice-President, Second Vice-President, or Secretary. Time will be charged in increments of one (1) hour. The F.O.P. may rollover not more than 500 unused hours to a subsequent year. When the F.O.P. requests time off under these provisions, the employee that is to be off shall furnish an authorized request from the F.O.P. to the Office of the Sheriff for approval. Such leave request must be in accordance with Article 17.2(c)(l)(2) of this contract.

ARTICLE 4 MANAGEMENT SECURITY
4.1	The F.O.P. and its officers, representatives and members agree that during the life of this Agreement,
they shall have no right to instigate, promote, sponsor, engage in or condone any strike, slow down, concerted stoppage of work, intentional interruption of Employer operations, or similar activities during the terms of this Agreement. The consideration for such provision is the right to a resolution of disputed questions. Management has the right to discharge or otherwise discipline any or all employees who violate the provisions of this paragraph. The only questions that may be raised in any proceeding, grievance, judicial or otherwise, contesting such action is whether the provision prohibiting strikes, slowdowns, concerted stoppage of work, intentional interruptions of Employer operations or similar activities was violated by the employee to be discharged or otherwise disciplined.
4.2	(a) The F.O.P., its representatives, members, or any persons acting on their behalf, agree that the
following "other unlawful acts" as defined in Chapter 447, Florida Statutes, are expressly prohibited:
(1)	Soliciting employees during the working hours of any employee who is involved in the solicitation.
(2)	Distributing literature during working hours in areas where the actual work of employees is performed, such as offices, warehouses, schools, police stations, fire stations, and any similar public installation. This section shall not be construed to prohibit the distribution of literature during the employee's lunch or in such areas not specifically devoted to the performance of the employee's official duties.
(3)	Instigating or advocating support, in any positive manner, for an employee organization's activities from high school or grade school students during classroom time.
(b)	The circuit courts of this state shall have jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this section by injunction and contempt proceedings if necessary. An employee who is convicted of a violation of any provision of this section may be discharged or otherwise disciplined by the Employer notwithstanding further provisions of any collective bargaining agreement.
(c)	No employee organization shall directly or indirectly pay any fines or penalties assessed against individuals pursuant to the provisions of this article.
4.3	The Employer and the F.O.P. agree that the basic intent of this Agreement is to provide a fair day's
work in return for a fair day's pay and to provide conditions of employment suitable to maintaining a competent work force. The Employer and the F.O.P. affirm their joint opposition to any discriminatory practices in connection with employment, promotion, training, or assignment, remembering that the public interest requires the full utilization of employees' skill and ability without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, marital status, or gender.

ARTICLE 5
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
It is the right of the Employer to determine unilaterally the purpose of each of its constituent agencies, set standards of service to be offered to the public, and exercise control and discretion over its organization and operations, including the right to subcontract. It is also the right of the Employer to direct its employees, take disciplinary action for proper cause, and relieve its employees from duty because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons by seniority provided, however, that the exercise of such rights shall not preclude employees or their representatives from raising grievances, should decision on the above matters have the practical consequences of violating the terms and conditions of this collective bargaining agreement.
Whenever it is determined that Civil Emergency conditions exist, including riots, civil disorders, hurricane conditions, or similar catastrophes, or when such conditions can reasonably be determined to be imminent, excluding the normal operational requirements of major civic/sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the provisions of this Agreement may be suspended by the Mayor and/or Sheriff during the time of the declared emergency provided that wage rates and monetary fringe benefits shall not be suspended.
No provision of this Agreement shall affect the City of Jacksonville's right and ability to classify employees as exempt from coverage by the Fair Labor Standards Act.

ARTICLE 8 WORK RULES
8.1	Reissuance of Conflicting Written Directives
On or before sixty (60) days after the effective date of this Agreement, all written directives issued by the Office of the Sheriff that are in conflict with the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be reissued so that no conflicts exist between written directives and the terms of this Agreement.
8.2	Notice and Scheduling of In-Service Training
It shall be the policy of the Office of the Sheriff whenever possible to give at least ten (10) working days notice to employees scheduled for in-service training and to schedule employees on the midnight shift for such training after regular days off (RD’s) have been observed. It is recognized, however, that last minute changes are often necessitated due to unanticipated sickness, court subpoenas, family situations, etc., and such situations may reduce the notification time in some cases.
8.3	Emergency Situation Meals
In accordance with the Master Plan for Emergency Control of the Office of the Sheriff, employees who are required or ordered to work twelve (12) or more hours on a single tour of duty shall be furnished a hot meal on the second and each succeeding day, within the twelve (12) hour tour of duty. The Office of the Sheriff will make a reasonable effort to designate a safe and secure area near the emergency area for employees to consume this meal. On the first day of said emergency situation, a reasonable effort will be made to furnish affected employees a hot meal within their twelve (12) hour tour of duty.
8.4	The F.O.P. recognizes the value to the general public of allowing representatives from
reserve/auxiliary or police associated organizations to ride in police vehicles with regular officers, and will cooperate with the Office of the Sheriff in promoting these programs. Other organizations or individuals may also be included in the plan, all for the benefit of law enforcement in general and for the Office of the Sheriff in particular.
Any police officer who does not wish to ride with a particular individual may decline to do so by notifying his/her commanding officer through an Inter-department Correspondence (P-004). The correspondence shall outline the specific reasons for not wanting to ride with the individual which shall be forwarded to the JSO Chief of Human Resources. This refusal is for information only and will not become part of the employee’s personnel file or be used for purposes of disciplinary action and approval of such request will not be unduly withheld.
8.5	Members of the reserve unit or of other police departments shall not be allowed to perform any
policing functions, unless such member is under the direct supervision and control of a certified police officer, nor will a member of such unit wear or display rank greater than that of a certified police officer with whom he/she is assigned to provided, however, that should the Office of the Sheriff declare an emergency to exist, the above provisions shall not apply for the duration of such emergency.
8.6	Transfers
It shall be the sole right of the Office of the Sheriff to transfer employees between any subsections of the organization as the exigence of situations dictate. Employees shall be notified at least ten (10)
17
FOP POLICE OFFICERS calendar days prior to the transfer, except where the nature of a particular situation requires immediate reassignment.
8.7	Administrative Leave Without Loss of Pay
An employee may be placed on administrative leave without loss of pay for any reason deemed necessary by the Sheriffs Office.

ARTICLE 12 COMPREHENSIVE DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES
12.1	Mutual Agreement
(a)	The Employer and the F.O.P. agree to the promotion of a drug free workplace through fair and reasonable drug testing methods for the protection of the City of Jacksonville and its employees. The drug testing policy of the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office is a proactive approach to a potentially serious problem facing all members of society. Within the limitations, as outlined in this Article, employees found to have drug abuse problems will be encouraged to participate in an employee assistance program or a rehabilitation program.
(b)	It is further agreed that drug use has serious adverse effects upon users in the work force resulting in the loss of productivity, posing a threat to the workplace and to public safety and security. Maintaining a healthy and productive work force and safe working conditions free from the effects of drugs are the goals of both the Employer and the F.O.P. It is understood that drug use creates a variety of workplace problems, including increased injury on the job, increased absenteeism, and increased financial burdens on health and benefit programs. Criminal justice work requires and the safety of the public demands total mental and physical functioning of employees at all times. The Jacksonville Sheriffs Office has a responsibility in the interest of public safety to monitor the use and abuse by employees of controlled substances, and other drugs/medicines.
(c)	The Employer agrees to establish drug testing standards to balance the interests of the Employer, employees, and the welfare of the general public through a fair, confidential, and accurate drug testing program.
(d)	Employees who feel that they are abusing drugs are encouraged to contact the Employee Assistance Program for help in overcoming this problem. Normal agency benefits such as the Employee Assistance Program, appropriate leave, and the group medical plan are available to aid in the rehabilitation process. Staff assigned to the Employee Assistance Program will support employees in this process by providing referral to the appropriate agency suited to address the particular need of the employee.
(e)	The sale, purchase, transfer, use, or possession of illegal drugs, or drugs obtained illegally, is a violation of state and federal criminal statutes and, therefore, may result in termination. Use, or being under the influence of alcohol while on duty presents a danger to the public, to the officer involved, and to other officers, and therefore, may result in termination.
(f)	In order to maintain the integrity of the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office and to ensure public safety, the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office requires that all employees shall not:
(1)	Abuse legal drugs;
(2)	Sell, purchase, transfer, use, or possess illegal drugs, or drugs obtained illegally;
(3)	Report for work and/or use Sheriffs Office equipment while under the influence of a legal
drug taken as a medication to the extent that job performance would be affected.
12.2	Discussion
(a)	Drug screening provides management with a method to assist in the detection of a possible problem so
that it may be dealt with in the proper manner.
(b)	Drug screening of Sheriffs Office employees is a deterrent to their becoming involved with drugs.
27
FOP POLICE OFFICERS Additionally, it assists management in its efforts to detect drug problems within the Sheriffs Office. Drug screening provides an avenue for identifying a specific problem associated with drug use/abuse.
(c)	Personnel are cautioned that drug screening is not an absolute indicator of drug use. It is a single indicator that must be combined with other information before a final determination is made. The drug screening program is interwoven with established Sheriffs Office policy as it is affected by administrative procedures, internal investigations, Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, criminal investigations, etc. The final determination (e.g. no action, disciplinary action, treatment or termination) is based on an accumulation of information and is consistent with the best interest of the Sheriffs Office and the employee.
12.3	Definitions
(a)	Controlled Substance - Any of the substances named in Schedules I through V of Section 893.03, Florida Statutes, and any "designer drugs" that may hereafter be proscribed by law and which are subject to manufacturing, distribution, preparation, dispensation, and administrative controls.
(b)	Employee Assistance Program - A confidential program designed to assist employees and their families with a multitude of problems that may affect the employee's work performance. Employees may volunteer for the program or be referred to it by their supervisors.
(c)	Confirmation Test - An additional analytical procedure used to identify the presence of a specific drug or metabolite in a specimen. The confirmation test must be different in scientific principle from that of the initial test procedure. The confirmation method must be capable of providing requisite specificity, sensitivity, and quantitative accuracy.
(d)	Illegal Drug - Any drug or substance, including controlled substances, the possession of which without a prescription is defined as a violation of state or federal statutes; or any prescription drug that was not prescribed to the affected employee by a person licensed to issue such prescription.
(e)	Legal Drugs - Any prescription medication or any over-the-counter medication that has some medicinal value/purpose and is being used by the person for whom it was prescribed.
(f)	Substance Abuse - The excessive or erratic ingestion, consumption, inhalation, or injection of any illegal drug or legally obtained drug or medicine not in prescribed amounts or at proper time intervals.
(g)	Use of Drugs - The injection, inhalation, ingestion, or consumption of any drug, whether prescription or non-prescription, or any controlled substance as defined under Florida law.
(h)	“Under the Influence” - A condition in which employees are unable to appropriately perform their duties because of the use of any drug, controlled substance, or alcohol. Employees shall be deemed to be under the influence if they are physically or mentally impaired and/or unable to perform their duties in an acceptable manner.
12.4	Responsibility for Reporting Legal Drug Use
(a)	Sheriffs Office employees using drugs or therapeutic treatments prescribed by a physician or other authorized health practitioner shall determine from the prescribing person whether the treatment prescribed has any effects which may interfere with the performance of their duties. If the treatment prescribed has such effects, employees shall inform their supervisors of that fact.
(b)	Any Sheriffs Office employee using legal over-the-counter non-prescription drugs which in any way
impair or affect his/her job performance is responsible for bringing this fact to the attention of his/her immediate supervisors on Form P-004. Information relating to the use of over-the-counter drugs can be removed at the request of the employee after it has been in the medical file for six (6) months, 28
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
unless the usage of such medication is part of on-going treatment.
(c)	The supervisor of any employee, upon being informed that such employee is using over-the-counter or
prescription drugs which could interfere with the performance of his or her duties shall make further inquiries to determine whether the employee is fit to perform those duties. Upon consultation with his or her commanding officer, the supervisor will decide whether the employee is fit for duty. If unfit, the employee shall be placed on personal leave. Should the employee and the commanding officer not concur on the ability of the employee to perform his/her duties, the department staff duty officer will make the final determination. Information regarding the use of legal drugs being taken by an employee will be forwarded to the Human Resources Division where it will be maintained in a confidential medical file.
(d)	All Sheriffs Office employees have an obligation to inform a supervisor or ranking officer if another employee is using drugs in violation of the law or Sheriffs Office Rules and Regulations.
(e)	If any employee knowingly ingests any drug in the performance of his or her duties, the supervisor on
duty will be immediately notified and the incident reported on Form P-004. The supervisor will see that the employee is provided with immediate medical attention if necessary. The employee will be placed on an appropriate duty status. The incident will be documented with the initiation of Form P004 to be followed by a detailed report from the employee's commander through channels to the Sheriff. Every effort should be made to avoid such ingestion. Unless employees' lives are endangered, they will refrain from the consumption, ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a substance which may either physically or mentally be dangerous to employees.
(f)	Employees knowingly subjected to the passive inhalation of a drug, such as marijuana, will submit a Form P-004 to the supervisor on duty. The report will indicate the substance the individual was exposed to, the period of time exposed, and give a brief statement explaining the necessity for the exposure. The report will be forwarded to the Sheriff for review.
12.5	Drug Screening Program
(a)	The Employer shall post a notice of the department's drug testing policy on bulletin boards in areas that are accessible to employees.
(b)	Urine testing of employees can be an effective means by which to identify those in need of counseling,
treatment, or disciplinary action. The testing program is intended to supplement, not replace, other means by which the use of drugs can be detected.
(c)	Employees will be required to participate in the drag testing program under the following conditions:
(1)	When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee is using, under the influence of or in possession of illegal drags, or is using or under the influence of alcohol while on duty, or that the employee is abusing alcohol or illegal drags and the abuse either adversely affects his/her job performance or represents a threat to the safety of the employee, coworkers, or the public. Reasonable suspicion drag/alcohol testing can be ordered by any supervisor with the approval of a commanding officer (lieutenant or above). An immediate supervisor requesting a drag/alcohol test founded on reasonable suspicion should consider among such facts and inferences:
a.	Observable behavior while at work, such as direct observation of drag/alcohol use or
of the physical symptoms or manifestations of being under the influence of a drag/alcohol.
b.	Abnormal conduct or erratic behavior while at work or a significant deterioration in work performance.
29

(2)	Following a serious accident or incident in which safety precautions were violated or unusually careless acts were performed and there is reasonable suspicion to believe these actions were the result of using drugs.
(3)	Routine fitness for duty: The Employer will require a drug test any time an employee is referred to a physician or psychologist for a fitness for duty examination.
(4)	Random Drug Testing Program: As part of the Sheriffs Office random drug testing program each employee of the bargaining unit will be randomly assigned a number that will be the only source identifying the individual submitting a sample for drug testing.
(5)	Follow-up testing: Should an employee in the course of employment enter, or be required by
the Employer to enter, into an employee assistance program for drug-related problems, the Employer may require the employee to submit to a drug test as a follow up to the program for up to two (2) years thereafter.

(9)	As part of a rehabilitation program (mutually agreed to by the affected employee and the Sheriffs Office Administration).
(10)	As a result of prior disciplinary proceedings against the employee related to the use of drugs.
(Such testing shall be conducted by the Internal Affairs Unit with the approval of, and in coordination with, the Chief of Human Resources). The Employer may require the employee to submit to a drug test as a follow up to the disciplinary action for up to two (2) years thereafter.

FOP POLICE OFFICERS the administration of the drug test, but shall be taken into account in interpreting any positive confirmed results.
(c)	Individuals responsible for conducting drug tests are acting under the direct authority of the Sheriff. Employees being tested shall cooperate fully. Any attempt to alter or tamper with the specimen, its container, or any mechanical device, instrument, or document by any individual is grounds for termination and/or prosecution under applicable Florida Statutes.
(d)	The Employer will establish guidelines for the collection of drug test samples that will afford protection to the employee to include:

test using a GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) test or other method specified by DHHS Guidelines to verify the initial test results that will be conducted by an outside licensed laboratory capable of supplying an analysis of drug content. When a confirmation test is necessary, the Employer will ensure the proper storage and transportation of the specimen to a licensed laboratory for processing.

(c)	employees hired prior to October 1,1968, who chose on or before September 30, 1968, to become subject to this provision; and
(d)	those employees who select to use their option and participate in the personal leave plan shall remain in said plan until such time as this personal leave plan or policy should be changed. Then said employees shall have the right to exercise their option as to which plan they wish to participate in.
15.2	Employees shall accrue personal leave with pay according to the following schedule on a bi-weekly
basis:
	SERVICE:	ACCRUAL: 0-4 years	160 hours per year 5-9 years	184 hours per year 10-14 years	208 hours per year 15-19 years	232 hours per year 20-24 years	256 hours per year 25 years or more	280 hours per year The rate of accrual shall change to the higher rate at the start of the first pay period of the month in which the employment anniversary occurs.
15.3	Personal leave shall accrue to a maximum of 960 hours. The Employer will compensate the employees on a hour-for-hour basis for any accrued amount over 960 hours as of September 30 each year. These payments may be as early as the second pay day in November, but shall be made no later than the first pay day in December at the September 30 rate of pay. If the employee elects, in lieu of payment, excess personal leave over 960 work hours may be credited to his/her retirement account up to a maximum of 960 work hours in that account. This option only applies to employees employed prior to October 1,1979.
15.4	If an employee does not use all of the personal leave accrued in a fiscal year, he/she may elect to be paid the difference in the amount used and the amount accrued for that fiscal year on a hour for hour basis. Such option must be elected immediately after the close of the fiscal year, which is September 30, but no later than October 31. This option is not available to an employee who would have less than 240 hours personal leave remaining after such payment. Such payments will be made, at the employee's option, on either the first payday in December or on the second payday in January at the September 30 rate of pay.
15.5	The Employer will provide employees eligible to retire the option to use leave time to fund their Deferred Compensation Program and a Post Retirement Health Care Program in the following manner: (a)	Upon attaining time service that is within three (3) years of normal time service retirement, the employee will be allowed at their option to cash in accrued leave and retirement leave 39
FOP POLICE OFFICERS account not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) for the purpose of crediting the funds to the Deferred Compensation Program in accordance with Section 457 provisions. This provision is subject to acceptance by plan providers of the City.

(c)	The Employer will provide a mechanism for insuring that at least one Employer/Union representative participate in the feasibility study contemplated in (b) above.
(d)	Employees availing themselves of the option to sell back Retirement Leave to fund the Deferred Compensation Plan will have their Retirement Leave Account balance reduced on an hour-for-hour basis, and their individual Retirement Leave Account maximum cap will be correspondingly permanently so reduced for leave used toward Deferred Compensation. For example, if an employee with a Retirement Leave account balance of 720 hours were to sell 600 hours towards Deferred Compensation, his or her new Retirement Leave Account balance would be 120 hours (720 hour balance minus 600 hours sold = 120 hours new balance), and the new Retirement Leave Account maximum cap would be 360 hours (960 hour maximum cap less 600 hours sold = 360 hours new maximum cap).
Employees availing themselves of the sell back option under this Article must submit a written statement of their planned retirement date to the Employer.

(e)	While on such leave, an employee shall not accrue personal leave but shall be eligible for legal holidays and any general salary increases but not performance/step increases.
(f)	At the employee's option, such leave may either be taken or be paid for in one lump sum on a hour-for-hour basis.
(g)	For the purpose of the Personal Leave Plan, retirement is defined in the following manner:

ARTICLE A-12 ALCOHOL & DRUG ABUSE POLICY AND PROCEDURES
12.1	Mutual Agreement
The Employer and the FOP agree to the promotion of a drug-free workplace through fair and reasonable drug testing methods for the protection of the City of Jacksonville and its employees. The drug and alcohol testing policy of the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office is a proactive approach to a potentially serious problem facing all members of society.
The parties further agree that drug use and alcohol abuse have serious adverse effects upon users in the work force resulting in the loss of productivity, posing a threat to the workplace and to public safety and security. Maintaining a healthy and productive work force and safe working conditions free from the effects of drugs and alcohol are goals of both the Employer and the FOP. The parties recognize that drug use creates a variety of workplace problems, including increases in on-the-job injuries, in absenteeism, and in the financial burden on health and benefit programs. Criminal justice work requires, and the safety of the public demands, optimum mental and physical functioning of employees at all times. In the interest of public safety, the Jacksonville Sheriff s Office has a responsibility to monitor employees’ use and abuse of controlled substances and other drugs/medicines.
Employees who believe that they may be abusing drugs are encouraged to contact the Employee Assistance Program for help in overcoming this problem.
12.2	Definitions:
(a)	“Alcohol abuse” means the use of alcohol or alcoholic beverages, on or off duty, which impairs or otherwise adversely affects the employee’s ability to perform his/her job duties. Using or being under the influence of alcohol or alcoholic beverages on the job by City employees is strictly prohibited.
(b)	“Drug abuse” means the ingestion of any controlled substance as defined in Section 893.03, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, not pursuant to a lawful prescription. The term “drug abuse” also includes the commission of any act prohibited by Chapter 893, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time.
(c)	“Illegal drug” means any controlled substance as defined in Section 893.03, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, not possessed or taken in accordance with lawful prescription.
(d)	Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (the DHHS Guidelines) means those guidelines as printed in the April 11, 1988 Federal Register (53 C.F.R. 11970), as they may be amended from time to time.
(e)	“Reasonable suspicion” means a suspicion which is based on specific, objective facts derived from the surrounding circumstances from which it is reasonable to infer that further investigation is warranted.
12.3	Circumstances When Testing May be Required.
(a)	The Employer may require an eligible employee to submit to alcohol and drug testing under any of
the following circumstances:
(1)	As part of the initial screening process for employment.
(2)	When there is a reasonable suspicion that an eligible employee is using, under the influence of, or in possession of alcohol or illegal drugs while on duty, or that the employee is abusing alcohol or illegal drugs and the abuse either adversely affects his/her job performance or
129
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
represents a threat to the safety of the employee, co-workers, or the public. Reasonable suspicion drug/alcohol testing can be ordered by a captain or higher level commanding officer.
(3)	Following a serious accident or incident in which safety precautions were violated or unusually careless acts were performed and there is reasonable suspicion to believe these actions were the result of using drugs or alcohol.
(4)	As part of the Sheriff s Office random drug testing program. Such random drug testing may occur before, during, or immediately after the regular work period of the employee, and shall be compensated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(b)	The Employer will pay the cost of any tests required by this article.
(c)	Eligible employees who are tested on the basis of reasonable suspicion may be returned to their job,
assigned to a different work location, or placed on leave pending receipt of the test results.
(d)	Failure or refusal to submit to substance abuse testing as required by this article, shall be cause for discharge.
12.4	Drug Testing Protocol and Procedures
The Sheriff’s Office will establish guidelines for the collection of drug test samples that will afford protection to the employee to include the following:
(a)	Specimens shall be collected with due regard for the privacy of the individual providing the specimen and in a manner reasonably calculated to prevent substitution or contamination of the sample.
(b)	When an employee is required to provide specimens for a testing procedure, the employee shall provide one (1) specimen (large enough to be divided into two (2) separate samples at the time of collection in order to facilitate the testing procedures).
(c)	Documentation of specimen collection shall include:
1.	Labeling of specimen containers to reasonably preclude erroneous identification of test results.
2.	Specimen collection, storage, and transportation to the testing site shall be performed in a manner which will reasonably preclude specimen contamination or adulteration.
3.	The Employer shall use a chain of custody procedure to ensure the proper record keeping, handling, labeling, and identification of all specimens to be tested.
4.	Employees selected for random drug testing will be assigned a number which will be the only means of identifying the individual who provided the specimen. The assigned numbers will be maintained in a confidential file under the direct supervision of the JSO Chief of Human Resources.
(d)	The threshold level or cut-off limit of the analytical testing procedures shall be established in accordance with the State of Florida Agency for Health Care Administration in conjunction with the standards developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHS A), regarding testing and protocol and procedures.
130
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
(e)	When eligible employees are required to participate in any of the drug testing procedures, the initial
testing specimen will be subject to an EMIT (Enzyme Multiple Immunoassay Technique). If the results of the initial test are negative, no further testing will be done.
(f)	If the results of the initial test provided for in Section 12.4(e) are positive, the Employer will submit the sample for confirmation testing using a GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) test or other method specified by DHHS Guidelines to verify the initial test results. This test will be conducted by an outside licensed laboratory capable of analyzing drug content. When a confirmation test is necessary, the Employer will insure proper storage and transportation of the specimen to the laboratory for processing.
(g)	If the results of the second test provided for in Section 12.4(f) are positive, as confirmed by a qualified medical review officer, the Employer shall promptly notify the employee of the results. At that time, the employee may elect to have the second sample tested.
(h)	A confirmed positive test result for the second sample (or for the first sample if the employee chose not to have the second sample tested) shall be grounds for discharge.
(i)	The Evidential Breather Testing Device (EBT) will be used by the Employer to test for the presence
of alcohol in an employee’s system. The test will be performed by a Certified Breath Analyzer Technician (BAT) using a EBT approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. If the initial test registers an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test will be performed. The employee will be placed in a separate room under the observation of the BAT for at least 15 minutes but not more than 20 minutes, after which he/she will receive a confirmation EBT test.
(j)	The Employer will, to the extent permitted by law, keep the results of any testing required by this article confidential. Furthermore, any positive test results which the Employer later determines to have been refuted shall have affixed thereto the subsequent refutation. Test results shall be considered confidential medical records.
12.5	Applicability of General Order XV.2

APPENDIX B
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This memorandum of Understanding is entered into on this 7th day of June 2001 between the Sheriff/City of Jacksonville and the Fraternal Order of Police, Jacksonville Consolidated Lodge No. 5-30 as representative of all sworn law enforcement bargaining units (all together hereafter referred to as the “Parties”.
Whereas, Schedule C of the police collective bargaining agreements between the Sheriff/City of Jacksonville and the Fraternal Order of Police, Jacksonville Consolidated Lodge No. 5-30 provides for physical ability testing; and
Whereas, the Sheriff/City of Jacksonville and the Fraternal Order of Police, Jacksonville Consolidated Lodge No. 5-30 have agreed to a protocol for implementation of said physical ability testing as to police that considers and resolves issues relating to the passing and failure of the physical ability testing: and
Whereas, the Sheriff/City of Jacksonville and the Fraternal Order of Police, Jacksonville Consolidated Lodge No. 5-30 desire to implement said protocol as to police officers in anticipating of incorporating the terms and conditions of the protocol into the respective collective bargaining agreements; now therefore
The parties agree as follows:
1.	The protocol and policies, reflected in the attached Physical Ability Testing Police Officer Handout shall be implemented forthwith by the Sheriff/City of Jacksonville as to police.
2.	The parties agree to negotiate the implementation protocol for inclusion in the respective police collective bargaining agreements at the earliest practicable opportunity.
Physical Ability Testing
(Police Officer Handout)
Policy
In 1996, the collective bargaining agreement (Agreement) between the Fraternal Order of Police (Officers) and the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office (JSO) recognized that sworn employees needed to maintain a sufficient degree of physical ability to handle the demands of the profession.
To facilitate this policy, the Agreement provided for an annual physical examination and physical ability test for police officers to assure that physical ability is maintained. The Agreement provides for a reasonable opportunity for officers who fail the examination to gain compliance.
The Agreement also provides for the removal of officers who cannot successfully pass the physical ability examination after reasonable opportunity to pass.
The physical ability test that was adopted was designed to be job related, and administered to ensure that those officers protecting the public meet minimal levels of physical fitness and do not pose a danger to themselves, fellow officers, or the public.
The Mission of the JSO is to protect the lives and property of the citizens of this community, to preserve peace, and to prevent crime and disorder.
As a matter of policy, the JSO recognizes the following as essential components to the accomplishment of the JSO Mission:
137
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
(1)	An able bodied, fully staffed department whose officers can effect an arrest and respond to emergency conditions; and
(2)	Flexible staffing that grants managerial discretion to assign the right person into the right position; and
(3)	Recognition that the assignment of supervisors must be need an performance based, and that assignments based merely upon an employee’s physical condition is contrary to the fulfillment of the Mission; and
(4)	Officers who are injured in concerted police actions should receive priority recognition; and
(5)	The creation of incentives and disincentives will enhance officer physical conditioning; and
(6)	A Department that is not physically fit will provide less protection and less effective services
at a much greater cost.
Administration

Rehabilitation:
138
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
An officer who fails an annual physical ability test shall be given one (1) calendar year to pass the physical ability test.
During that calendar year, the officer will remain on duty but will be required to participate in an on-duty training and/or conditioning program which will require the officer’s participation at the training academy at least twice monthly. The program will be personally designed to enable the officer to ultimately pass the examination.
If the officer so completely fails to pass the physical ability test that it demonstrates a more serious fitness for duty problem, the JSO may administer such other fitness for duty testing and take such prudent action that would otherwise be reasonable under the circumstances.
Accommodation:
As to officers who have failed a physical ability test:
(1)	After the one (1) calendar year set aside for rehabilitation, if the officer is still unable to pass the physical ability test, the officer shall be considered unable to perform the officer’s duties and if the officer does not qualify for accommodation as set forth in Paragraph (2) below, the officer shall be separated from employment as provided for in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
(2)	If the officer’s inability to pass the physical ability test in a year is a result of an ADA qualifying condition, the officer shall be accommodated as provided in paragraph (3) below; otherwise, the officer shall be separated from employment pursuant to the Civil Service and Personnel Rules and Regulations if the officer cannot be accommodated by retirement or reassignment to non-swom service.
(3)	An officer qualifying for accommodation in the sworn service pursuant to paragraph (2) above shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:
(A)	The JSO shall make available a combined number of positions for up to 1.5% of the total sworn police ranks which will be designated as Permanent Light Duty positions for all of those officers who either qualify for accommodation under paragraph (2) above, or who qualify for permanent accommodations as a result of on-the-job injuries. Each such officer who wishes to be placed in a Permanent Light Duty position so designated, must be able to perform the functions of that position with the exception of an ability to effect an arrest and respond to an emergency. A maximum of three (3) supervisory positions will be included within the total Permanent Light Duty positions.
(B)	Any officer or supervisor who does not accept an accommodation into one of the Permanent Light Duty positions, or who does not opt for normal or disability retirement, or who does not accept an accommodation to a non-swom position, shall be subject to separation in accordance with the Civil Service Rules and Regulations as a result of that officer’s inability to perform the essential functions of the job.
(C)	In order to ensure the maximum availability of accommodation for qualifying officers, officers serving in a Permanent Light Duty position described in Paragraph (3)(A) above, may serve in that position until the employee until and unless the officer is “bumped.”
“Bumping” occurs when the number of qualifying officers exceeds the number of available Permanent Light Duty positions. The criteria for bumping shall be as follows:
i.	When all positions described in Paragraph (3)(A) are filled by qualifying officers, and another
139
FOP POLICE OFFICERS
officer becomes qualified, the officer with the highest years of service shall no longer be entitled to the position and shall be accommodated by being provided the opportunity to retire and or resign. Such an officer who refuses to retire and or resign may then seek further accommodation to a non-swom position or shall be separated from employment pursuant to the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
ii.	In the event all qualifying officers are not eligible for retirement or are not in the DROP program, entitlement to Paragraph (3)(A) positions shall be determined first by giving priority to officers injured as a result of concerted police action; secondly, by giving priority to officers who are injured on-the-job; and finally, by giving priority to officers who are most senior. An officer who is “bumped” may seek reclassification as an accommodation, but if no other position is available, such officer shall be separated from employment pursuant to the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
Appeal:
The JSO believes that a policy implemented fairly and uniformly throughout the Department will provide consistency and fairness in its application.
The JSO recognizes, however, that exceptional circumstances may exist which might warrant making limited exceptions to this policy based on the extraordinary rehabilitative efforts of an officer or for such other extraordinary circumstances demonstrated by an officer.
An officer may appeal to the Sheriff, in writing, for an exception to the application of any part of this policy to that officer. The officer must show extraordinary circumstances that would warrant the granting of such exception. The Sheriff shall respond in writing to the officer and the decision of the Sheriff shall be final.
