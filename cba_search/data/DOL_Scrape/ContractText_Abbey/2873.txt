ARTICLE 2:	NONDISCRIMINATION
2.1	Discrimination Prohibited

The City further agrees that no employee shall be discriminated against because of Union membership, or protected union activity.
2.2	Reasonable Accommodation
The City will make reasonable accommodation for a unit member’s known physical or mental disability unless the City demonstrates that the proposed accommodation will produce undue hardship to the City’s operation or that the City is otherwise not obligated to accommodate the unit member. Reasonable accommodations will be consistent with provisions of this MOU and of Civil Service Rules that affect the unit member being accommodated to the extent the law at the time the accommodation is implemented permits. At the request of the Union, the City agrees to discuss a proposed unit member accommodation with the Union.

3.5	Union Stewards
The City and the Union agree that good labor relations are fostered and maintained through prompt, decisive, and fair adjustment of individual grievances at the lowest possible administrative level.
3.5.1	Number Of Stewards

location. The City shall provide the Union with a copy of its current instruction recognizing stewards designated by Union.
If, in the City’s opinion, a Union steward is failing to maintain a satisfactory level of performance, the City may call that matter to the attention of the Executive Secretary of the Union by letter outlining the specifics of the complaint. The Union will act promptly to discuss the matter with that steward in order to resolve the complaint and, failing that, another steward will be designated.
3.5.2	Scope Of Stewards
A steward may represent a member of the units covered by this Agreement at the appropriate step of the grievance procedure concerning a dispute of the rights of a member under the terms of this Agreement within the scope of representation.

A unit member may authorize payroll deduction for the amount of the agency fee as described in Section 3.6.1 of this Agreement. If a bargaining unit member has not authorized a payroll deduction within ten (10) working days from the date of commencement of assigned duties within the bargaining unit, the City shall immediately begin automatic payroll deduction.
3.6.2.2	Agency Fee Exemption

Annually, the Union will provide an explanation of the fee and sufficient financial information to enable the service fee payer to gauge the appropriateness of the fee. The Union will provide a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision maker not chosen by the Union and will make provision for an escrow account to hold amounts reasonably in dispute while challenges are pending.
3.6.2.5	Indemnification

ARTICLE 15:	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
15.1	Definition
A grievance is defined as any dispute that involves the interpretation or application of this Agreement or disciplinary action taken against a unit member, and the application of the Personnel Rules.
With the exception of grievances concerning suspension, demotion, or termination, which may be filed at Step Two, it is the express intent of the parties that grievances be resolved expeditiously at the lowest possible administrative level. Toward that objective, the following steps are prescribed:
15.2	Procedure
15.2.1	Step 1
15.2.1.1	Informal Discussion
The unit member or the Union Representative may present the grievance orally to the immediate supervisor within ten (10) working days from such time as the unit member or Union should reasonably have been aware of the occurrence.
15.2.1.2	Formal Submission
Should the grievance remain unresolved, the unit member or Union Representative may submit the grievance in writing to the immediate supervisor within the ten (10) working days cited above. The grievance shall state the specific section of the Memorandum of Understanding, or the Personnel Rules alleged to be violated, or the disciplinary action taken, and the proposed solution. The supervisor shall render a decision in writing to the unit member and/or Union Representative within ten (10) working days of the formal submission of the grievance.
15.2.2	Step 2: Appeal To Department Head
Should the grievance remain unresolved, the unit member or Union Representative may, within ten (10) working days of receipt of the supervisor’s decision, submit the grievance in writing to the department head. The department head or director or the designated representative shall respond to the grievance in writing within ten (10) working days after receipt of the grievance.
-81-
15.2.3	Step 3: Employee Relations Officer - Union Staff Representative
Should the grievance remain unresolved, the unit member or Union Representative may, within ten (10) working days after receipt of the department head response, submit the grievance in writing to the Employee Relations Officer. The Employee Relations Officer, or a designated representative, shall meet with the assigned Union Staff Representative within ten (10) working days of submission and attempt to resolve the dispute.
15.2.4	Step 4: Civil Service Board - Arbitration
Should the grievance remain unresolved, within fifteen (15) working days of the meeting described in Section 15.2.3, either party may submit the grievance to an impartial arbitrator who shall be selected by mutual agreement or, if such agreement is not reached, by alternately striking names from a list of five arbitrators submitted by the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. Alternatively, in the case of a grievance concerning discharge or disciplinary action against a unit member, the Union may elect to submit the grievance to the Civil Service Board, instead of to an arbitrator. The Civil Service Board may elect to use a Hearing Officer for such appeals as described in Appendix A, Grievance Procedure, Section 14.2.4. In the event that the Union elects to submit the grievance to the Civil Service Board, the filing of the written grievance in accordance with the provisions of Step 1 15.2.2 above shall satisfy the requirement of the Personnel Ordinance that the unit member give notice of intent to appeal a discharge or disciplinary action.
If arbitration is selected, it is agreed that the arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties and the arbitrator’s fees shall be borne equally by the parties. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement or of the Personnel Rules.
15.3	Time Limits
Time limits prescribed in 15.2 above may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. Failure by the unit member or Union to follow the time limits, unless so extended, shall nullify the grievance. Failure by the City to follow the time limits, unless so extended, shall cause the grievance to move to Step 2 or Step 3, whichever is the next level.
-82-
15.4	Witnesses
Individuals who may have direct knowledge of circumstances relating to the grievance may appear at the mutual request of the parties during any stage of the procedure. In the case of a unit member appearance, the unit member shall be compensated at the regular rate of pay for actual time spent in such appearance.
15.5	Class Action Grievance
A grievance covering more than one unit member must be identified as a “class action grievance” when first submitted. The scope of the grievance shall then be described; and, to the extent reasonably known by the Union, the grievants shall be identified by name. A “class action grievance” must meet the definition of a grievance, as described in 15.1 of this Article, to be processed as such.
15.6	Immediate Arbitration
Either party may waive the time limits specified in this Article and proceed to immediate arbitration in any case where either party alleges the other is threatening to take an action in violation of this Agreement in so short a period of time as to disallow the other party from proceeding within said time limits. Proceeding to arbitration under this Section shall be by mutual agreement, and such agreement shall not be withheld by either party arbitrarily.
In any such case, the arbitrator shall have no power to add to or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement or of the Personnel Rules, but shall have power to issue an order to the party initiating the grievance to abide by the normal time limits provided in this Article.
The arbitrator to hear such case shall be selected by the parties from a panel of three arbitrators mutually agreed upon when the provisions of this section are invoked. The first arbitrator, in designated order from the panel, available within a 48-hour period shall be selected.
No post-hearing briefs shall be permitted, and the arbitrator shall render a decision at the conclusion of the hearing.
15.7	Consolidation
Concurrent grievances alleging violation of the same provision shall be consolidated for the purpose of this procedure as a single grievance.
-83-
-84-
ARTICLE 16:	JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS
16.1	Joint Labor-Management Committee
The City and the Union agree to maintain a joint labor management committee composed of equal numbers of representatives. The committee may also include representatives from other Oakland City employee labor organizations.
The committee may establish departmental or issue-specific subcommittees. The committee and its subcommittees shall meet regularly, establish agendas, and keep records of discussions and recommendations on action items. The City and the Union shall select their own representatives, respectively, provided that the parties agree to select representatives authorized to enter into agreements after reviewing proposals with their principals, where necessary.
Training on conducting effective meetings and cooperative efforts shall be provided jointly by the City and the Union, as needed.
The joint labor management committee and its subcommittees are in no way intended to supercede or negate the parties’ mutual obligation to bargain in good faith or to supersede any portion of this Agreement, including but not limited to the grievance procedure. However, by mutual agreement, the parties may discuss and attempt to resolve matters subject to the grievance procedure. Appropriate subjects for discussion at the committee include but are not limited to career ladders, longevity increases, promotions, alternative work schedules, and telecommuting opportunities.
16.2	Labor-Management Retreat
During the life of this Agreement the parties shall conduct a labor/management retreat once every eighteen (18) months, for the purpose of enhancing communications and improving mutual commitment to organization productivity.
The Union agrees to participate in the funding necessary to conduct the retreat.
-85-
-86-
ARTICLE 17:	GENERAL PROVISIONS
17.1	Resolution
It is understood that this Agreement or any part of it is not binding upon the City until and unless the same is adopted by the City Council; and it is not binding upon the Union until and unless the same is adopted by a vote of the unit members, consistent with Union rules and regulations. This Agreement resolves in full, for its duration, all issues between the parties concerning wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.
17.2	Savings Clause
In the event any portion of this Agreement is declared null and void by superseding federal or state law, the balance of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, and the parties shall immediately commence negotiations to ensure that the superseded portion(s) shall be rewritten to conform as nearly as possible to the original intent.
17.3	Duration
Except as stated in specific sections of this Agreement, this Agreement shall become effective January 28, 2003, and shall remain in effect for a period of six (6) years, terminating on June 30, 2008.
17.4	Completion Of Negotiations
The terms and conditions described in this Agreement represent the full and complete understanding between the City and the Union.
While nothing in this Section precludes the City and the Union from mutually agreeing in writing to modify this Agreement, the Union and the City agree that this Agreement may not be modified, expanded, altered, or superceded by an agreement between unit members and a department head or an agreement between the Union and a department head. In other words, all letters of understanding, side letters, and agreements to change practices must be negotiated between the Union and the Employee Relations Office.
