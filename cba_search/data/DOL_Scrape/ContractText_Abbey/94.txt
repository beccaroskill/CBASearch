(b) SHIFT WORK.
(1)	When multiple shifts are worked and the first shift starts at a time other than during the regular working day as defined in Article VIII, Section 3, paragraph (a)(5), time and one half (1-1/2) the prevailing rate of wages shall apply until 8:00 a.m. the following day. After 8:00 a.m. the following day, when two (2) shifts are employed, each shift shall work seven and one-half ( 7-1/2) hours for eight (8) hours pay at regular time; and any additional time worked shall be at double (2) the prevailing fate of wages. After 8:00 a.m. the following day when three (3) shifts are employed, seven (7) hours shall constitute a day’s work for each shift for which a regular wage of eight (8) hours shall be paid or if less than seven (7) hours are worked, Article VIII, Section 12, shall apply. When multiple shifts are worked on Saturday, Sunday or recognized Holidays, the following shall apply: when two (2) shifts are employed, each shift shall work seven and one-half (7-1/2) hours for eight (8) hours pay at double (2) the prevailing rate of wages. When three (3) shifts are employed, each shift shall work seven (7) hours for eight (8) hours pay at double (2) the prevailing rate of wages or if less than seven (7) hours are worked, with a minimum of two (2) hours. On all shift work performed on Saturday, Sunday or Holidays, the overtime rate of double (2) time shall start with the beginning of the first or “morning" shift. In localities where the workday is less than eight (8) hours per day the hours on shift work shall be shortened proportionately.
19
(2)	No employee shall be required after having worked sixteen (16) hours (lunch periods included) to return to work for the prevailing rate of wages without having had eight (8) hours off the job. Supervision and stewards are excluded from the above for a maximum of two (2) additional hours if they are required, to stay over and coordinate the job, in which case a minimum of six (6) hours off the job would be required.
(3)	Any additional men required to work on any shift will receive the same rate of pay as the men already at work on that shift providing they have not worked on any other job or for any other Employer on that date.	■
(4)	Any shift worked under this provision shall be for a minimum of eight (8) hours pay. If the first hour of the day shift is paid for at a premium rate of wages, the same shall apply to each shift thereafter.

ARTICLE XVIII
GUARANTEE OF AGREEMENT LIABILITY
Operating Engineers’ Local No. 324 Security Deposit Fund
(a)	Every Employer agrees that it is prudent for the Union to require a reasonable security deposit to guarantee that the wages, fringe benefit contributions and other benefits made payable to and on behalf of employees by this Agreement will be paid. The parties agree that the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) is a reasonable security deposit, except as it is hereinafter provided that a larger sum is reasonable.
57
(b)	Every Employer employing Operating Engineers working under the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall deposit Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) as a security deposit with the Trustees of the Operating Engineers’ Local 324 Pension Fund to be held in a special account designated as Operating Engineers Security Deposit Account, hereinafter referred to as Security Deposit Account.
(c)	The Security Deposit Account shall be administered by the Trustees of the Operating Engineers’ Local 324 Pension Fund under the terms of this Agreement, and such other provisions as may be applicable.
(d)	The cash security deposit shall earn interest, at the i-eguiar bank rates per annum unless the security deposit is redeemed prior to one (1) calendar year from the date when such security deposit was posted.
(e)	Every Employer party to this Agreement agrees that on request of the Trustees of the Operating Engineers’ Local 324 Pension Fund he will show any of his books or records to authorized representatives of said Trustees so that it can be determined whether or not the Employer is complying with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
(f> The Union agrees to recognize the Great Lakes Fabricators and Erectors Association as surety for each of its members for any of the purposes for which the security deposit provided for herein is to be paid. In no event shall the liability of the Association for any one of its members exceed the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) except in cases of delinquency of thirty-one days or longer in which case the liability shall be Seven Thousand Dollars ($7,000.00).
(g)	As of the date of the beginning of this Agreement, the Association shall advise the Union and the Trustees of the Operating Engineers’ Local 324 Pension Fund, in writing, of the names and addresses of all Employers who are members of the Association who are covered by the Surety Agreement of the Association. If notice in writing is given to the Union and the Trustees of the Operating
58
Engineers’ Local 324 Pension Fund that an Employer is no longer covered by the Surety Agreement of the Association, such Employer shall then be treated as a non-asso-ciated Employer. If the coverage of any Employer is terminated by such a notice in writing, the Surety Agreement of the Association shall nevertheless be liable for any claims against such Employer for delinquent payments occurring during the period of three (3) calendar months immediately preceding and for a period of two (2) weeks following the mailing of such notice.
(h)	Each Employer member of the Great Lakes Fabricators and Erectors Association, by becoming a party to this Agreement authorizes and empowers the Association to act in his or its behalf and, until notice in writing to the contrary to the Union and to the Association is received it shall be prima facie evidence that the Association is acting as surety hereunder for said Employer.
(i)	A non-associated Employer who becomes thirty-one (31) days or more delinquent in any of his obligations under this Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be required to increase his cash security deposit to the Security Deposit Account to the total amount of his delinquency or, in the alternative, shall furnish a corporate surety bond in the total amount of his delinquency, which bond shall be deposited with the Trustees of Operating Engineers’ Local 324 Security Deposit Account. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the security deposit for each Employer shall never be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) and that if any amount of money is drawn out by such security deposit then the Employer shall promptly relinquish the deposit so that at no time will it be less than Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00).
(j)	Whenever a Claim of Delinquency is presented to the Chairman and Secretary of the Operating Engineers’ Local 324 Pension Fund, these two officers shall promptly withdraw an amount of money equal to the Claim of Delinquency from the Security Deposit Account of the delinquent Employer and pay such money directly to the Fringe Benefit Funds to which the money is owed.
59
A Claim of Delinquency must be certified by the Administrator of one of the Fringe Benefit Funds and must be based on an audit, an admission of liability, or a refusal by the Employer to allow an audit.
For delinquency in wages an authorized Representative of the Union may present a Claim of Delinquency. The obligations of the Employer to the various Fringe Benefit Funds shall be deemed to include any costs of collection charges assessed by the Funds for late payments.
(k)	Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, it is agreed that in the event any Employer shall | be delinquent at the end of any period in the payment of any of his obligations under this Agreement, including Security Deposit, after the authorized official of the Union shall have given seventy-two (72) hours notice to the Employer of such delinquency, the Trustees of the Fringe Benefit Funds or the Union, depending upon the type of delinquent obligation of the Employer, shall have the right to take such action as they determine necessary until such delinquent payments are made; and it is further agreed that in the event such action is taken, the Employer shall be responsible to all affected employees for any further losses resulting therefrom.
(1)	The Trustees of the respective Fringe Benefit Funds shall have the further right to take such legal action against any delinquent Employer as in their discretion may be advisable or necessary to make collection for any of the Fringe Benefit Funds entitled to monies from an Employer under this Agreement. At the direction of the Trustees of the Fringe Benefit Funds or the Administrator of same, any Employer covered by this Agreement may be ordered to produce a certified copy of his payroll records in order to show compliance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
