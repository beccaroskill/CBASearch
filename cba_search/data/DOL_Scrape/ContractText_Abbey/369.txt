WITNESSETH
In consideration of the premises and the respective promises, Agreements and covenants of said parties hereto, they do hereby mutually agree as follows, to-wit:
ARTICLE I.	- TERRITORY AND WORK AFFECTED
Section 1. This Agreement shall cover all production and maintenance employees employed in the Employer's plants at 5400 North Basin Street and 6936 North Fathom, Portland, Oregon, and any relocation, extension or expansion of such plants within the present jurisdiction of District Lodge No. 24,1 AM-AFL-CIO, excluding all supervisors with the authority to hire or fire or effectively recommend same, office workers, engineering employees, draftsmen, guards, partsmen, material handlers, painters and janitors.
ARTICLE II.	- PAYROLL DEDUCTION OF UNION INITIATION FEES AND DUES
Section 1. Upon receipt of written request, signed by an employee working in any job covered by this Agreement, executed in the form of the attached exhibit to this Agreement, and so long as such request shall not have been modified or revoked by the employee, the Employer will deduct from the pay of the employee, once in each calendar month, the amount specified in such request, to the extent otherwise then payable to the employee. The Employer will remit to the Union at its office in Portland, Oregon, once each month all money deducted from employees' pay pursuant to such requests during the preceding calendar month. Each such remittance shall be accompanied by an accounting for all such deductions indicating the credits represented thereby. The Union shall be solely responsible to each employee for application of any amounts so deducted and remitted.
-1-
ARTICLE 111.	- EMPLOYMENT
Section 1, The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent with respect to rates of pay, hours of work and other conditions of employment covered by this Agreement.
Section 2. Each employee covered by this Agreement shall apply for membership in the Union after thirty (30) days from the date he begins work and shall remain a member as a condition of employment and the Employer agrees to notify new applicants for employment and former employees returning to employment of this Agreement. The Employer shall notify, by a mutually satisfactory means, the Union of all new hires on a weekly basis.
Section 3, The Employer, within three (3) working days after receipt of notice from the Union, will discharge any employee who is not in good standing in the Union as required by the preceding paragraph. The Union agrees to indemnify the Employer and hold it harmless against any and all suits, claims, demands and liabilities for damages or penalties that may arise out of or by reason of any action that may be taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with this section.
Section 4. An employee's seniority shall be computed from the time of his employment by the Employer in any capacity within the bargaining unit, except that a new employee shall be on probation for the first forty-five (45) days of his employment. After forty-five (45) days (or extension as noted below) a new employee shall be placed on the seniority list and given seniority rating as of the first day he was last hired by the Employer. Retention or termination of probationary employees shall be at the Employer's sole discretion and specifically excluded from the grievance procedure. It is understood that the probationary period will be automatically extended for all days of absence or transitional duty, separate or combined, that extend to five (5) or more days.
Section 5,	(a) Seniority shall prevail in reduction and restoration of force, provided the
senior employee shall be capable of performing the work remaining in the shop. In the event there is a need to hold employees out of seniority at the time of a reduction of force or recall	.
| employees out of seniority, the Employer shall post a notice (with a copy to the Union)	Deleted: employer
containing the numbers of positions affected and job description. The notice shall be posted no later than five (5) working days prior to the reduction or restoration of forces. In the event of a temporary shutdown of one (1) week or less in duration and not to exceed ten (10) days total per
I Contract year, the Company may operate selected “regular assigned work areas” without regard to overall seniority. The selected “regular assigned work areas” will be limited to the Electric _________________________
Shop, /ind the Offline at the TMP. There will be at least two (2) weeks' notice prior to Deleted: thepmp~ temporary shut downs and one (1) week notice of canceling of shutdowns. Volunteer sign-up sheets for work during shutdowns will be posted at least two (2) weeks prior to shutdown.
________________Employees who sign up for work during shutdowns, but require training in order to qualify, will be provided such training, by seniority, as time and manpower requirements permit.
(b) It shall be the responsibility of the employee to keep both the Company and the Union informed of current address. During periods of layoff, the employee shall provide
-2-
notice in writing of any change in address within five (5) days to both the Employer and Union. Failure on the part of the employee to keep the Company informed of his correct address releases the Company of any responsibility of any back pay liabilities for failure to be recalled by seniority. Upon proven notice of recall by letter or telephone, the employee shall report to work
| within jive (5) working days. The five (5) working day provision may be waived upon	Deteted:
reasonable and acceptable proof of failure to report to work but not to exceed thirty (30) days, except for those employees on bona fide medical leave.
Section 6. Seniority shall prevail in shift assignments, providing, however:
(a)	The Employer may assign the longest sendee qualified employee to any shift for the purpose of training inexperienced employees.
(b)	Longer service employees may be assigned by the Company to perform necessary work requiring certain qualifications which they possess to any shift, providing no shorter service employee on such job possesses the qualifications necessary to perform such work on the shift to which the assignment was made. The Employer agrees that such temporary assignment shall continue only until a qualified shorter service employee can be trained to replace the longer service employee. An employee assigned to the shift of his preference, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, shall not be given consideration for shift preference in making subsequent assignments for a period of three (3) months from the date of the original assignment, except by agreement between the representatives of the Employer and the Local Lodge. Such assignments will become effective only at the start of the payroll week.
Section 7.	(a) An employee with twelve (12) or more months of seniority who desires to fill
| a permanent .vacancy in another regular assigned work area may file a request on a form to be supplied by the Employer. "‘Employees may file requests for six (6) "regular assigned work • areas" at any one time. There shall be one (1) transfer or refusal allowable in each six (6) month | bid period. Employees accepting .area transfers must accept the shift for which the job is available for the first week only and then may exercise any options for shift change that his seniority entitles him. Employees asked to change .areas must make a decision within twenty-four (24) hours of notification. Failure to accept such .area assignment shall nullify such .Area Transfer^ equest except for inability to accept shift assignment changes where his seniority does not allow him to move to his prior shift. Area transfer Requests may be withdrawn .prior.to .area .2: opening without penalty.
When it is determined by the Employer that a permanent vacancy exists, /\rea TTransfer Requests will be honored on a seniority basis providing the employee requesting a change to another “regular assigned work are^l has the ability to perform the job in a normal and ' average manner. The Employer will make every reasonable effort to instruct and assist the \ employee in the proper performance of the new job assignment.
Should a vacancy be created by honoring an .area bid request, the Employer will allow only one backfill jirea bid transfer to fill that vacancy. Subsequent vacancies created by honoring this backfill .area bid request will not be considered a permanent vacancy for .area bid purposes.
Deleted: . (c) That nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Employer from assigning a new employee to the day shift during that employee’s probationary period, and for ninety (90) calendar days from date of hire in die following areas: Plate Shop and Machine Shop at the Truck Manufacturing Plant and Parts Manufacturing Plant and Electric Shop as agreed to in negotiations. If an employee on the seniority list was reassigned to the night shift to make room for such a new employee under this subsection, such senior employee shall be offered the opportunity to return to the day shift at the completion of the period herein provided. The new employee will be reassigned to the shift so vacated.^

LETTER OF INTENT
JLulvjfr, 2004	,. - • [ Deleted; uly
( Deleted: 1.1997
The following sets forth the provisions of an understanding reached in negotiations with reference to subcontracting by the Employer. Because of the fears expressed by the Union that the Employer would subcontract work that could be performed by the Employer's employees during a period when employees are on layoff, the following assurances are given:
It is not the intent of the Employer to subcontract work customarily performed by the Employer in the Portland plants with its own employees, during a reduction in force, or which would directly result in a reduction in force.
Additionally, employees of another employer will not perform bargaining unit work in the Portland plants which is not currently being performed or has not been performed in the past
It should be understood that in some instances subcontracting involves considerations of production schedule, the lack of machinery and/or equipment or economic factors that will compel management to subcontract some functions. On the other hand, it is generally to the Employer's advantage to perform as much of the work with its own employees as possible.
During the 1997 Negotiations, it was further agreed that the Company will keep the Union informed of work that is normally performed by bargaining unit employees that is being considered for subcontracting prior to awarding a contract. If the Union feels that such work is within the capability of the bargaining unit and can be feasibly and competitively performed by bargaining unit employees, representatives of the Company and the Union will meet together as a joint labor/management subcontracting committee to discuss this possibility.
