An employee may elect to utilize this policy or the grievance procedure to address a complaint of discrimination.
3.9.1	EEO/AAP Policy Statement
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
]_ 0 MENDO CO & MCEBU/SEIU 10-01-2001/3-31-2004
The County of Mendocino is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to an active Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Program EEO/AAP. It is the stated policy of the County of Mendocino that all employees and applicants shall receive equal consideration and treatment in employment without regard to race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, sex, marital status, medical condition, disability, physical handicap, or any other consideration made unlawful by federal, state, or local law. All such discrimination is unlawful.
All recruitment, hiring, placements, transfers, and promotions will be on the basis of individual skills, knowledge, and abilities, and the feasibility of any necessary job accommodation, regardless of the above identified bases. All other personnel actions such as compensation, benefits, layoffs, terminations, training, etc., are also administered without discrimination. Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Program (EEO/AAP) will be promoted through a continual and progressive EEO/AAP.
The objective of an EEO/AAP is to ensure non-discrimination in the employment and, wherever possible, to actively recruit and include for consideration for employment, minorities, women, and the physically handicapped.
To comply with applicable laws ensuring equal opportunities to qualified individuals with a disability, Mendocino County will make reasonable accommodations for the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an applicant or an employee; unless undue hardship would result.
Any applicant or employee who requires special accommodations to perform the essential functions of the job should contact the Personnel Department and request such accommodations. The individual with a disability should specify what accommodation he/she needs to perform the job. The County will conduct an investigation to identify the barriers that make it difficult for the applicant/employee to have an equal opportunity to perform his/her job. The County will identify possible accommodations, if any, that will eliminate the limitation. If the accommodation is reasonable and will not impose an undue hardship, the County will make the accommodation.
The Director of Personnel has been designated EEO/AAP Coordinator. Inquiries concerning the application of federal and state laws and regulations should be referred to him/her. If you believe you have been subjected to any form of unlawful discrimination, provide a written complaint to the Personnel Director as soon as possible. Your complaint should be specific and should include name(s) of individual(s) involved and the name(s) of any witnesses. The County will take immediate action to make an effective, thorough, and objective investigation, and attempt to resolve the situation. The coordinator is responsible for administering program progress and initiating corrective action when appropriate. All personnel actions are monitored and analyzed to ensure the adherence of this policy. Regular annual reports are submitted to the Personnel Director for review and evaluation of progress.
If it is determined that unlawful discrimination has occurred, effective remedial action will be taken, commensurate with the severity of the offense. The action taken by the County to remedy the situation will be made known to you, and the County will not retaliate, nor permit retaliation against you for filing a complaint.
To achieve the goals of our EEO/AAP, it is necessary that each member of this organization understand the importance of the program and his/her individual responsibility to contribute toward its maximum fulfillment.
3.10	Americans With Disabilities
Mendocino County will comply with all relevant and applicable provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act. The EEO/AAP policy adopted by the Board of Supervisors (3.9.1 above) contains appropriate language to insure protection for ADA qualified individuals.
3.11	Discrimination in Employment Prohibited
Because the ADA requires accommodations for individuals protected under the Act, and because these
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
]_ ]_ MENDO CO & MCEBU/SEIU 10-01-2001/3-31-2004
accommodations must be determined on an individual, case-by-case basis, the parties agree that the provisions of this Memorandum may be waived in order for the County to avoid discrimination.
The Union recognizes that the County has the legal obligation to meet with the individual employee to be accommodated before any adjustment is made in working conditions. The Union will be notified of these proposed accommodations prior to implementation by the County.
Any accommodation provided to an individual protected by the ADA shall not establish a past practice, nor shall it be cited or used as evidence of a past practice in the grievance procedure.
A waiver may be granted for any provision of this Memorandum in order to undertake required accommodations for an individual protected by the Act. The County will provide the Union with notice of its intent to waive the provision and will discuss Union proposed options in a non-meet and confer forum.
3.12	No Discrimination Based on Union Activity
Provisions of this Memorandum shall be equally applied to all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination based on Union activity. Except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum, disputes under this Article shall be subject to Article 19 (Grievance Procedure).
3.13	Employee Liability
Division 3.6 of Title I of the Government Code establishes a County employee's liability for acts or omissions within the scope of employment and the County's obligation to indemnify and defend County employees for claims against them arising from those acts.
The County and County employees recognize their respective rights and obligations under these provisions of these laws as they exist at this time, and as they may be amended or given final, binding judicial interpretation.
3.14	Reassignment / Relocation
Assignment of job duties is a management right. It is the sole discretion of a department head to assign employees to j ob duties within the scope of their classifications or as emergency conditions require, in a manner to effectively carry out the functions of the department and service to the public.
The County and the Union recognize that reassignments may occur in the fulfillment of these functions.
However, in the furtherance of fairness to employees, creating better service to the public, and better communications and morale, the County agrees that in the absence of agreement by the employee, the County will provide the following information to an affected employee, prior to initiating a reassignment that requires the relocation of an employee to a facility more than 25 miles from their current job site:

ARTICLE 6	- HOURS AND OVERTIME
6.1	Application
This Article is intended only as a basis for outlining standards for hours of work, work schedules, and a basis for calculating overtime payments. Hours specified under types of employment indicate a commitment by the County to minimum and maximum hours each employee is to be regularly scheduled, as long as there is sufficient work.
6.2	Definition of Types of Employment
a.	Permanent Types of Employment with the County. (See side Itr 10/01/02)
Full-Time:	An allocated position which is regularly scheduled for eighty (80) hours of work per
pay period. Additional definitions can be found in County Code - Title 3 - Personnel Chapter 3.04.
Part-Time:	An allocated position which is regularly scheduled for less than eighty (80) hours
per pay period. If the Board of Supervisors by resolution, after fulfilling meet and confer obligations, designates a standard work week of less than forty (40) hours a week, "part-time" service shall consist of a weekly or pay period schedule which is less than the standard number of hours per week.
b.	Non-Permanent Types of Employment with the County. (See side Itr 10/01 /02)
1.	Extra-Help
a.	Extra-help is a generic term for a non-allocated position used to fill unanticipated, temporary, infrequent or occasional employee needs of a department or the County.
b.	An extra-help position is at-will. Employees in extra help assignments do not gain seniority or other property rights and are not eligible for other benefits normally associated with a County Civil Service classification.
c.	Extra-help should not normally be used when the staffing need for a position is regular, scheduled, or routinely anticipated, or is a, frequent, predictable, or constant factor that could be calculated into a department's annual budget request, and could be appropriately assigned to a fully trained permanent or regular employee.
2.	Temporary
A temporary position is an extra-help position that is limited in time and scope, usually for a particular project, and frequently of short duration, rarely longer than six or 12 months, or is used for an extended period of time to assist on or complete a particular project or assignment that has a clear end or completion date [such as a grant funded project],
.3 Work Schedules
The County reserves the right to establish and modify work schedules after meeting and conferring with the Union.
6.4	Flex-Time Schedule
The County reserves the right to utilize a flex-time schedule. An employee and the employee's appointing authority must agree to the assignment to flex-time. Employees assigned to a flex-time schedule will be eligible for compensation for overtime when required by law or when the employee's pay status hours exceed forty (40) in the employee's regular seven (7) day work period or in excess of a normal full-time daily work shift. The
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
]_ 9 MENDO CO & MCEBU/SEIU 10-01-2001/3-31-2004
County reserves the right to discontinue the flex-time schedule and reassign an employee to a normal daily work schedule based on the operational needs of the department.
6.5	Posting of Work Schedules
For the convenience of employees, changes in normal work schedules will be posted in advance.

Lunch time may be assigned by the department or supervisor any time from three [3] to five [5] hours after the start of the employee’s shift or work day, and does not require a five day notice to change, unless the employee has notified his or her supervisor of a scheduled appointment that cannot be timely changed on short notice.
An employee may agree to any schedule change - and waive any notice requirement.
Unless the change in schedule has been requested or waived by the employee, failure to give the five [5] calendar days notice to a full-time employee shall entitle the affected employee to compensation equaling one-and-one-half times the employee’s base hourly rate for all hours actually worked on the new schedule which are exclusive of the old schedule until five [5] calendar days notice has been achieved. However, for each such hour worked that constitutes statutory overtime, compensation shall be based on the regular rate of pay so that one-and-one half time is not compounded upon one-and-one-half time.

It is the policy of Mendocino County to avoid the necessity for overtime whenever possible. When overtime work is necessary to provide County service, such overtime shall be compensated as provided below. Overtime for the non-exempt employee is divided into statutory overtime and non-statutory overtime.

Except for the Elections Department, overtime is also defined as hours actually worked on the seventh consecutive full (8, 9, or 10) hour day and any consecutive full (8, 9, or 10) hour days worked thereafter; however, individual employees may waive such overtime with the consent of the Union.

6.10	Overtime Compensation for Non-Exempt

6.13	Duty-Free Meal Period
Employees shall be granted a duty-free meal period during each work shift which exceeds six (6) consecutive hours. The duration of the meal period may be not less than thirty (30) minutes nor greater than sixty (60) minutes and will be scheduled as near to the middle of the work shift as reasonably possible. Different meal periods may be assigned to different work units in the same County department or division. Duty-free meal periods shall not be considered as time worked.
6.14	Non-Duty-Free Meal Period
Notwithstanding Article 6.13 above, in those special circumstances where the County determines a duty-free meal period is not appropriate with the delivery of efficient and productive services to the public, as determined by the appointing authority, the employee shall be assigned to a non-duty-free meal period which shall be considered time worked. If the County plans to take action under this Article, the department shall give the affected employee(s) advance written notice and provide an opportunity for the affected employee(s) to discuss the issue with the appointing authority before final action is taken.

11.1	Health Insurance
11.1	A Plan Description
1.	The parties hereby agree that medical, dental, vision, life and accidental death and dismemberment programs will be provided by the County of Mendocino.
2.	The benefit levels as they exist are presently described in the Pertinent Plan Documents that are incorporated to this Memorandum by reference.
3.	Effective pay period 6 of fiscal year 2001 - 2002 (March 3,2002), the health plan contribution levels are as set forth in section 11.1. of this MOU, and in the amounts specifically cited in Attachment A -Premium Schedule, attached hereto and incorporated by reference.
11.1	B Health Premium Levels
1.	Effective the first full pay period in March 2002, the parties will implement the 75/75 health insurance premiums in the amounts as set forth in the Health Premium Schedule for 2002 contained in Attachment A - Premium Schedule, attached and incorporated herein. The County may reasonably delay implementation of the new premium and benefit increases and changes in order to assure appropriate administration and technical requirements for implementation.
2.	The County and MCEBU/SEIU Local 707 agree, beginning January 1, 2003 and January 1, 2004, to adjust annually the contributions to health insurance premiums in an amount necessary to pay for “health care industry cost trends” as determined by the health system actuary, utilizing the same share-of-cost ratio - at which time a new Attachment A - Premium Schedule with amended Health Premium Schedule will become applicable.
(a)	However should the health care industry cost trend increases recommended by the health system actuary be more than 16%, the parties agree to meet and confer on insurance premiums and benefits - prior to the adoption of any increase of more than 16%.
(b)	If the increase is more than 16%, an increase of up to 16% may be implemented while the meet
and confer process occurs regarding the balance of any additional changes in premiums or benefits.
3.	Under the health premium plan hereby adopted, the County will pay approximately 75% of both the employee and dependent coverage, and employees in the bargaining unit represented by SEIU will collectively pay approximately 25% of the costs associated with providing health insurance to the members of the SEIU unit as a whole.
(a) The parties understand and agree that as soon as the annual insurance trend adjustments can be applied where no employees within the Union receive a reduction in premiums while other member categories receive an increase - the health premiums paid by employees will become reflective of a true or actuarially sound 75/75 plan (wherein the County pays approximately 75% of both the employee and dependent coverage and the individual employee pays the remaining approximate 25% for his or her own coverage and any dependents and /or spouse).
4.	A Special Open Enrollment to move up or down in the Plan will be set by Risk Management prior to implementation of the new Attachment A - Premium Schedule in 2002.
(a)	This special open enrollment will be set by Risk Management one month prior to implementation of the new Attachment A - Premium Schedule.
(b)	During special open enrollment, immediately following ratification, employees will be allowed
to move down one or more Plans [reflecting a lower employee premium payment]. However, employees will only be allowed to move up by one Plan.
5.	The Regular Open Enrollment period for 2003 (effective the first full pay period in January 2003) will be announced by Risk Management to all employees at least one month prior to the beginning of that Regular Open Enrollment period.

The Health Benefits Committee will investigate the feasibility of broadening our pool of insured persons by forming a cooperative venture with other public employers for the purpose of increasing our leverage with insurers and providers and for the purpose of spreading risk.
11.2	General Retirement Benefits
The County will provide retirement information to each new employee upon initial employment.
General retirement classifications / positions represented by SEIU shall receive the following corrections, changes, and increases in retirement benefits, as scheduled:
1.	Effective the first full pay period in October 2003, the County will implement the formula in Government
Code Section 31676.12 (the 2% at 57 retirement formula) for all classifications represented by the (SEIU) Service Employees International Union Local 707, exclusive of those members effected by the safety retirement improvement (see section 9, Safety Member Retirement).
2.	The County will pay for future service at the same ratio (percentage) as previously established. In this
regard and as the retirement benefit has increased, the employee’s retirement cost will increase to reflect the benefits enumerated under Government Code, section 31676.12, of the retirement formula.
3.	Employees may buy-back past service with Mendocino County at their own cost, which includes both the employee and the employer’s contribution.

(b)	Retirement contributions made by or bought back by the employee shall be credited and accrue to the employee's account and become a vested interest of the employee.
It is the intent of the County to separate retirement Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) for DSA, MCLEMA and other safety retirement members from general members, which will at the same time adjust (reduce) the retirement contributions for general retirement members.
1.	Because agreement between the County and both DSA and MCLEMA regarding a separation in retirement COLA payments has not yet been reached this adjustment to retirement contribution will not occur for general members represented by SEIU. Upon reaching agreement or implementing such a separation with DSA and MCLEMA, wherein DSA and MCLEMA member contributions financially enable such a reduction, the County will adjust SEIU member retirement contributions to reflect this change.
2.	If such a separation in payment occurs, any differences (reductions for general members) caused by this separation will be paid by or inure to the employee and the County in their respective proportionate retirement rate contributions.
3.	If such a separation in payment in Retirement Cost of Living Adjustments between safety and general members does not occur by February 1, 2003, the parties agree to re-open on this issue.
4.	It is the intent of the County that general members not pay any additional cost due to an increase in retirement benefits to safety members over the current safety retirement plan of 2% at 50.
11.3	Safety Retirement Benefits
Effective the first full pay period in October 2003, the County will implement the formula in Government Code Section 31664 (the 2% at 50 safety retirement formula) for all members of the Probation Department in the classifications listed in the section below. Eligibility to receive the safety retirement enhancement is contingent on the employee still being employed by the County on, or being hired after, October 1, 2003 in an eligible classification currently represented by SEIU - as listed below.
The County will pay for all past safety retirement associated with the classifications listed herein -providedthat this employment occurred in the County of Mendocino and meets the criteria set forth in this section.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 31581.2, it is the intent of the Board of Supervisors that the retirement contributions made by the County - including those for past service - do not become a vested interest of, and will not accrue to the employee. Upon retirement, sufficient funds will be transferred to the retirement reserves to assure that the retirement benefit is paid to the member and or spouse.
Regardless of the stipulation in Government Code sections 31558 and 31469.4 that set forth certain categories of job classifications or employees that are potentially eligible for safety retirement, it is the County’s intent to limit this retirement improvement to the classifications listed in this section.
The following classifications shall be eligible for the safety retirement improvement stated above:
(1)	Deputy Probation Officer I,
(2)	Deputy Probation Officer II,
(3)	Deputy Probation Officer III,
(4)	Juvenile Hall Supervisor,
(5)	Correction Counselors, and
(6)	To the extent they are covered by the law extending safety retirement to peace officers - Welfare Investigators and Welfare Investigator Supervisors shall be included in safety retirement.

The Service Fee shall be equal to the monthly dues of regular membership, less non-chargeable costs as defined in Article 20.11, and/or by statutory or case law, but in no event to exceed ninety-five percent (95%) of the regular membership dues.
The Union shall have the exclusive right to decide and determine whether any such action or proceeding referred to in the above paragraph shall or shall not be compromised, resisted, defended, tried, or appealed, but shall consult with the County prior to making any such decision or determination.
20.10	Chargeable Costs
To the extent authorized by law, the costs of the Union's collective bargaining activities shall be considered by the Union when making a determination of the amount of the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee authorized by this Article. Examples of chargeable costs include, but are not limited to: (1) expenditures for labor contract negotiations (e.g., the fees and expenses of the Union representative and support staff, including research of and preparation for negotiating matters within the scope of representation); and (2) expenditures for administration of contracts (e.g., meetings and discussions with management concerning grievances under the Memorandum, meetings with employees as part of grievance resolutions, and costs of representatives and staff support for arbitrations, including costs for research and preparation).
20.11	Non-Chargeable Costs
Currently, the following activities are not included in the calculation or determination of the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee:
A.	Lobbying or other political activity, except as authorized by law;
B.	Payments to affiliates, except for chargeable costs as authorized by law;
C.	Social activities, except as authorized by law;

20.12	Deduction of Non-chargeable Costs
All non-chargeable costs will be deducted from the Fair Share Agency Shop Fee prior to such Fees being collected.
20.13	Advance Notification
No Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee shall be collected from any employee until the employee has received written notice sent by certified mail from the Union, which includes legally adequate audited information concerning the breakdown of "chargeable" and "non-chargeable" expenses, and a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision-maker.
Specifically, such notice shall, at a minimum, include an accounting report prepared, signed, and verified by an independent auditor, who is a certified public accountant, for the overall purpose of providing a detailed itemization of the expenditures of the Union so an employee may reasonably be able to determine what the Union spends on both chargeable and non-chargeable items and consider whether expenses designated as chargeable are related to the Union's collective bargaining functions. However, this requirement can be met without requiring or allowing non-members, or the County, to become the Union's auditors. The accounting will utilize data from the prior fiscal year. At a minimum, this accounting report must:
A.	State the amount of the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee and provide an overview of how the accounting reports were translated into calculation of this fee;
B.	Disclose the Union's major categories of expenses, including employee compensation, specifying the actual expenditures within each category and the amount spent in each expenditure for chargeable items and non-chargeable items; each major category and the allocations of expenditures therein for chargeable and non-chargeable expenses must be verified by the auditor;
C.	Disclose what percentage of total Union expenditures is allocable to chargeable items and what percentage is allocable to non-chargeable items;
D.	State the total sum of money the Union pays affiliates and demonstrate what percentage of such money is used for chargeable and non-chargeable activities;
E.	Disclose what percentage of regular membership dues is allocable to chargeable items and what percentage is allocable to non-chargeable items and, consequently, what percentage of dues will be collected as the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee; and,
F.	Explain the methodology used in producing the Union's accounting report. To enable the independent auditor to prepare the accounting report, the Union shall provide the auditor access to all records reasonably necessary for such a preparation, including a record of the employee's activities in sufficient detail to enable the auditor to make the necessary determination of chargeable or non-chargeable items. In the event that payments are made to any other organization, the auditor shall be provided access either to such organizations' records or relevant audited financial statements when reasonably necessary to prepare the above accounting.
20.14	Filing a Challenge
Instructions on filing a challenge to the amount of the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee with the Union shall, at a minimum, provide the following:
A.	Non-members who wish to challenge collection of the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee because the
amount identified allegedly contains expenditures for non-chargeable activities must file an objection
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
5 7 MENDO CO & MCEBU/SEIU 10-01-2001/3-31-2004
letter with the Union within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of notice (notice shall be rebuttably presumed to have been received no later than five (5) calendar days after it is postmarked). A nonmember may file a letter by presenting it to the Union business office in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The non-member shall provide a copy of the letter to the Personnel Director within three (3) calendar days of its filing with the Union;
B.	The letter shall be signed by the challenger, or the challenger's agent, under penalty of perjury, and must state with specificity the particular expenditures being challenged and the grounds for such challenge. The letter must contain the name and mailing address of the challenger;
C.	During the pendency of the challenge, the amount of the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee reasonably in dispute shall be placed in an escrow account established by the Union;
D.	Within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt, the Union shall schedule a date for arbitration, which shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by American Arbitration Association. Pending the commencement of arbitration, the Union and the challenger may, by mutual agreement, attempt to resolve the dispute informally;
E.	The arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration Association;
F.	The Union shall have the burden of proving that the fee amount complies with this Article and applicable law; and,
G.	The costs of the arbitrator and court reporter, if any, shall be borne entirely by the Union. The challenging employee shall be responsible for their own costs including, but not limited to, attorney fees and copies of the court reporter's original transcripts.
20.15	Maintenance of Membership
Union members may terminate their membership in the Union by giving written notice to the Union and the County annually during the month of June. Thereafter, the employee will be subject to the Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fee.
20.16	Union Obligations
The Union shall comply with all applicable statutory requirements and furnish any information needed by the County to fulfill its obligations under this Article.
20.17	Indemnification and Hold Harmless
The Union shall defend, indemnify, hold harmless, release and save the County, its agents and employees, from and against any and all claims, demands, suits, orders, judgements, expenses, or other forms of liability arising out of or in connection with this Article and/or any action taken or not taken by the County and/or the Union under this Article including, but not limited to, the collection and procedures for collection of Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fees and the amount of such Fees. This Article shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the County under this Memorandum, or provision of law.
20.18	Rescission of Fair Share Agency Shop
The implementation of the provisions of this Article shall not prohibit or restrict an election to rescind this Fair Share Article pursuant to Government Code 3502.5, or its successor provision.
20.19	Record-keeping and Reporting

20.20	Violation
If a court finds the implementation of this Article in violation of constitutional law, the Union shall have sixty (60) days to comply with the court's order or the County may thereafter cancel Article 20. In the interim, all collections of Fair Share Agency Shop Service Fees by way of payroll deductions by the County shall be suspended, except as allowed by the court. Also, except as allowed by the court, no unpaid Fair Share Agency Shop Fee that would otherwise have been due during the time such violation existed may be collected retroactively after the violation was corrected.
20.21	Exemption of Continuous Nonmembers
County employees who are in the bargaining unit and who are not members of the Union the first pay period following Board of Supervisors approval of this amended memorandum shall be exempt from Article 20 in its entirety for as long as they remain employed in this bargaining unit and remain nonmembers of the Union. However, this exemption shall not prohibit a nonmember in the bargaining unit from voluntarily paying the F air Share Agency Shop Fee through payroll deduction.
