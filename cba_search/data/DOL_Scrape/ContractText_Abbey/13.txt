Employees who are required to work overtime should be given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary. For weekend overtime, such notice will normally be given on Thursday.
2.	Actual overtime hours offered to the employee but declined will be charged against the employee’s record the same as though the employee actually worked the hours offered. The last employee who accepts overtime offered in an equalization group will be the last employee charged unless the entire equalization group is exhausted. Overtime hours are charged on a Monday through Sunday basis.
2a. When overtime is scheduled and an employee is absent from work for any reason (except in Paragraphs 2(b), 2(d), or 2(e) below) or for Company Reasons so they cannot be notified that overtime is available for him/her, the hours will be charged against the employee’s record.

2c. If an absent employee returns to work on the last regularly scheduled work day prior to the beginning of an extended holiday weekend or the Christmas holiday period and notifies their supervisor during the first four (4) hours of their regular shift of their availability for overtime work, the employee will be scheduled for all overtime previously charged to them during their absence when the overtime was scheduled. If the employee fails to notify their supervisor of their availability during the first four (4) hours of their shift, the employee will not be scheduled and the available hours will remain charged to the employee.
2d. It is understood, as provided by the applicable Federal Law, that overtime hours available to employees who are required to attend military meetings, drills, summer camps or cruises will not be charged. Management will provide forms to be used by employees who are unable to accept overtime because of such meetings, drills, summer camps or cruises. These signed forms may be used to substantiate the absence in order that the available overtime hours will not be charged.
2e. When an employee is on jury duty or absent from work because of being eligible for Bereavement Pay, they will not be scheduled or charged for overtime work during such period; however, they may make satisfactory arrangements with their Supervisor to work weekend overtime.
27

When training on-site on an employee’s regular shift, they will be scheduled and charged for daily overtime. (See Memorandum of Understanding in regard to training.)
2g. Employees will not be charged for daily overtime occurring at the end of the shift (or the beginning of the following shift) if they are offered and decline such overtime after they have clocked out at the end of their regular shift.

In the event the employee returns to work in less than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days as provided above, hours available to them will be charged the same as if they had worked. Employees being placed on indefinite layoff will be asked and charged for any available overtime hours up to and including the Saturday immediately following the effective date of the indefinite layoff.
3a. Employees who are on a temporary layoff (including a temporary layoff due to model change) for a period of fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days or more, will upon being returned from temporary layoff, be assigned foe median overtime hours of foe respective equalization group to which they are returned.
4.	When a new employee is hired or a non-seniority employee is rehired, it is agreed that the employee will be assigned the highest number of overtime hours in the equalization group to which the employee is assigned. It is understood that a new hire will not be offered weekend overtime their first work week unless all other employees within that Equalization group have been offered work. Temporary employees with seniority hired under foe provisions of Appendix D-2 of foe National Agreement will enter an equalization group by being assigned median hours in that equalization group.

charged foe same as if they had worked.

7a. Apprentices may be assigned to weekend overtime work in a classification after all joumcypersons within that classification have been offered weekend overtime work. Weekend overtime will normally be scheduled on Thursday. If a joumeyperson is absent on the day that the overtime is being scheduled, the apprentice can be scheduled for overtime. Local Balancing of Hours Agreement provisions {Paragraph 2(b)) would then apply.

a)	The employee makes satisfactory arrangements with their supervisor to work the available overtime.
b)	The employee is able to physically work the overtime without interfering with their Union leave assignment and/or efficiency of Company operations.
It is further understood that it is the employee’s sole responsibility to make suitable and timely arrangements with their supervisor for accepting the available overtime. Failure on the part of the employee to make such arrangements will result in normal charge of all available overtime hours.

OVERTIME SUPPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
Management is implementing the following policy for supplementing exhausted production equalization groups:
•	The exhausted production equalization group will be supplemented by a like production equalization group in the same Plant, consistent with Paragraph #8 of the Local Balancing of Hours Agreement, which states:
“Management recognizes that as a general rule the employees lowest in overtime hours who can do the job should be considered for the assignment as far as practical.”
•	It is understood that in situations in which several like production equalization groups coexist in the same Plant, Management will make every reasonable effort to ensure that an exhausted production equalization group is not always supplemented by the same like production equalization group in that Plant.
*	The purpose of this Management policy is to supplement exhausted production equalization groups in a fair and businesslike manner, and in which the efficiency of the Plant product line is maintained by employees more familiar with that product line. Any practice contrary to this fair intent which is brought to Management’s attention by the Shop Committee will be promptly investigated and resolved by the parties.
As stated previously in policy letters, Skilled Trades employees should not be offered the opportunity to supplement production groups. Also, favoritism in supplementing exhausted equalization groups will not be allowed.
Management assures Local UA.W #663 that this policy will not he changed or in any way altered, except by mutual consent, during the life of the 2004 Local Agreement.
Clarification: Due to the complexity of the assembly process, it is understood that Departments 1273, 1274 and 1275 may supplement from each other before supplementing from their respective plants.

67
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TOOLING COMMITMENT
Under current and existing conditions and without prejudice to the position of either party, the parties mutually agree to the following:
In 1999 the National parties negotiated a special separation package for Tooling employees that effectively ended Guide’s participation in new tool build. As part of those negotiations, the “seven day agreement” was continued for the life of the 2000 Local Agreement.
While the “seven day agreement” is no longer applicable, the need for in-house Tooling labor to service tools remains. In this regard. Management assures U.A.W Local #663 that in-house Tooling employees will continue to be assigned to all normal and historical repairs or modifications of tools that we are capable of performing, once they have undergone debugging and have been released for production. Warranty work will continue to be performed by the outside tooling source, as in the past.
Management recognizes that previous customer schedules drove the Tool Room workload beyond the contractual seven days, and was supplemented occasionally by periods of extended hours. Should manufacturing requirements remain appro* irrmte to previous model years, discontinuance of a formal “seven day agreement” is not anticipated to seriously affect overtime opportunities in the Tool Room.
During the 2004 National Agreement negotiations, the Corporation made a firm commitment to the International Union, UA.W that monies would be directed toward capital investment in new technology and equipment at the Anderson and Monroe facilities. The local parties are fully committed to pursuing funding opportunities for a variety of tools and equipment that would enhance the performance and efficiency of tool service work at this location.
In summary, opportunities for new work, new technology and new equipment have been provided by the National Agreement. In pursuing these opportunities, Management recognizes the desirability —and the contractual obligation —to continue to use in-house labor on tool service work.
68
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TOOLING BID PROCESS SECONDARY TOOLS
During the 2004 Guide / U.A.W Local Negotiations the parties had several discussions emphasizing the importance of continuing to improve Guide's competitive position in today’s global marketplace. The parties recognize that for Guide to exist as a viable manufacturer, Guide must be competitive in its cost structure for quality, cost, and performance.
During these discussions the Union expressed an interest in exploring the competitiveness of Guide's tooling department in regards to building new end of arm tooling. The parties acknowledged that currently the tooling department’s work load has, at times, required extended overtime hours be worked either daily and/or weekends to properly service/repair existing tools in support of manufacturing operations. The Union suggested during periods in which the workload in the Tooling department was lessened, Tooling personnel could be utilized to build new tools provided service needs to manufacturing are met, and that the new tool build work can be done competitively (quality, cost, time limits, and performance).
To that end, the parties agree to create a Tooling Bid Process Committee whose purpose is to jointly evaluate the possibilities (quality, cost, time limits, and performance) of building new secondary types of tools while efficiently utilizing the talents and knowledge of the Tooling department
The Tooling Bid Process Committee will include a designated representative from Labor Relations, Tooling and two (2) designated U.A.W representatives. Support and technical advisors with specific knowledge of the work being considered will be included as needed. The Committee will meet monthly and a designated Committee member will review the Committee’s discussions to the next Steering Committee Meeting each month.

Based upon concerns raised by the Shop Committee during the 2004 local contract negotiations, this is to advise you of Management’s policy of identifying employees at the gate entrances.
Under normal circumstances, Plant Security will simply request that employees openly display their employee identification badge. Should employees enter or exit through an unmanned turnstile gate, as at Gate #2, they will be expected only to place their identification badge upon the required video scanner and to verbally identify themselves to the computer operator officer at Gate #1.
Enqrloyees entering the plant after an extended lunch period or entering the plant after normal starting times will be required to identify themselves with their badge, and will be requested to sign a gate pass, pursuant to previous settlements made between the parties.
Plant Security will be instructed to question employees only in unusual circumstances or in emergency situations. This does not preclude Plant Security from halting the entrance or exit of employees engaged in suspicious activities or exhibiting unsafe or unusual behavior.
Any situations brought to Management’s attention that are contrary to the intent of this letter will be investigated promptly.
Sincerely,
William Edwards
Personnel Director

General Subjects Demand #3: “Demand all problems with Loral Balance of Hours be resolved.’'
This demand is satisfactorily settled under current and existing conditions on the following basis:
This demand is settled on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding dated January31, 2000 regarding “Median Hours - Local Balancing of Hours Agreement” [below].
At this location, it has been the practice that seniority employees, who enter into a new equalization group, enter in at "median” hours. It has been brought to our attention that there is a lack of understanding in determining the correct median hours where there are only two (2) employees in an equalization group.
To this end, when there are two (2) employees in an equalization group and one (I) employee leaves/transfers, creating a vacancy, the replacement employee will assume the identical hours of the employee who remained in the equalization group. These employees will be placed in alphabetical order on die overtime sheet and scheduled for overtime accordingly.

GENERAL SUBJECTS DEMAND #21
Demand and all problems with the Gas and Electric Truck Drivers and Stock Chasers classifications be resolved.
This demand has been settled under current conditions on the following basis:
A.	The need for additional battery chargers for the Gas and Electric Truck Driver and Stock Chaser classifications will be jointly reviewed and adequate battery charging facilities will be provided on a timely basis.
B.	Employees riding a three-wheeled bicycle can only transport items which could normally be carried by hand.
C.	During the 1990 Local Negotiations, the parties discussed the use of flatbed trucks, fork trucks and hi-stackers by skilled trades and classifications other than Gas and Electric Truck Drivers and Stock Chasers. The following agreements spell out the conditions that must be present when these pieces of equipment are used:
1.	Flatbed trucks may be used by employees with the intent of providing a more rapid means of transporting personnel and those items which normally can be hand carried. Flatbed trucks are not intended to transport items which extend beyond the front or side perimeter of the vehicle (for safety reasons) nor items which are normally hauled by the Gas and Electric Truck Driver classification. Welders and various equipment, which are tools of the trade, are considered a part of the truck.
2.	The Millwright classification may use a fork truck only as a means of accomplishing the following Millwright assignments:
a.	Movement of machinery which would normally be lagged to the floor.
b.	Loading, unloading or movement of machines or equipment that would require rigging for safety consideration.
3.	The intended use of hi-stackers by skilled trades classifications is only for the vertical movement (lifting and lowering) of personnel and job-related materials.
The above settlements were designed to provide the affected classifications a more efficient method to accomplish the described tasks and not replace any of the work historically performed by the Gas and Electric Truck Driver and Stock Chaser classifications. The Union expressed concern with regard to the proper implementation of these agreements during the recent 1990 Local Negotiations. Therefore, it is imperative to operate this equipment within the described parameters. These settlements will be reviewed with all affected personnel within thirty days after the ratification of the 1990 Local Agreement In addition, a joint committee will be formed to evaluate and resolve any problems associated with these settlements.
97
Clarification: Both parties agreed to the following definitions:
B. The phrase “carried by hand” is a “role of thumb” indicating that common sense should govern what can be carried on the stated vehicles.
C-l. The word “germane” used in the first sentence of Section #5 of G.S.D. #34 of the 1967 Local Agreement (“Flatbed trucks may be used by certain classifications on work germane to their classifications and departments.”) meant that one classification should not haul tools or equipment that are “germane” to another classification’s job.
The transporting or pulling of material (pipe or other bulky materials) on “robber tired" wagons or other type of carriers which can be connected to powered vehicles is work of the Gas and Electric Truck Driver classification.
C-2. The use of fork trucks by Millwrights to move equipment or machines does not limit that job assignment exclusively to the Millwright classification, i.e. Gas and Electric Truck Drivers may, at times, assist in moving equipment

This Memorandum of Understanding does not supersede the language on training on the respective shift expressed in G.S.D. #7 of the 1979 Local
Negotiations:
This demand is settled under current conditions on the basis that Management recognizes the desirability of providing additional training for employees. When training programs are provided, such programs wUl be provided on the employee’s respective shift unless the nature of the program and availability of equipment or instruction make it impractical.
Management stated in a clarification of this demand that the intention behind this language was to provide training on an employee’s respective shift whenever the equipment and/or instruction required for the training was available on that shift. Management suggested that the word “unreasonable” substituted for the word “impractical” could better convey the meaning of the language, e.g., if there was one person to be trained and it required two people to do the training, it would not be reasonable to change the shift of two employees to train one employee.

Demand the cleaning of Plastic Machines be as signed to the Laborers Classification.
This demand is settled under current conditions based on the following:
It is understood by the parties that the Plastic Operators’ main responsibility is maintaining the equipment and the quality of the parts. In addition it is recognized by the parties that the operator may assist the line operator in certain duties as set forth in the settlement of Appeal Cases N-99 and N-100 dated 8-23-72. However, this in no way precludes the understanding arrived at in the settlement of General Subjects Demand #53 of the 1967 Local Agreement In addition it is Management's policy not to schedule operators in the various plastics classifications on overtime for the purpose of cleaning the plastic machines.
Clarification:
There have been complaints lodged with Labor Relations concerning problems with the spreading and picking up of quick dry or oil soak materials around plastic machines. In addition, there have been complaints raised concerning the actual cleaning of plastic machines. Please review with your General Supervisors and Supervisors the following guidelines concerning these two subjects. These guidelines are the result of a series of grievance and General Subjects Demand settlements in the past nine years.
Quick Dry Materials
Normal amounts of quick dry material may be put down and swept up by production operators in the normal course of cleanup within a department. When a plastic machine has a major oil spill requiring a large amount of quick dry material or when quick dry material is used on a regular basis to build an oil dam around the base of a plastic machine, Plastic Operators may put down quick dry and sweep it up into mounds adjacent to the plastic machines. Laborers should be called to shovel up and remove the mounds of quick dry material.
Cleaning Plastic Machines
Production employees may clean those portions of plastic machines that are reachable from the floor level. This may include wiping down the Plexiglas doors, machine sides, panels, controls, etc. with rags. The operators should be sweeping and maintaining the surrounding areas. When it necessary to use ladders to climb up to clean upper levels of plastic machines the work should be scheduled through Maintenance and the proper people assigned to perform the work Plastic Operators should not be assigned as regular full time plastic machine cleaners within a department or a group of departments.
