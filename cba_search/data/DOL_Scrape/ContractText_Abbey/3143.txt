SECTION 8-LEAVES OF ABSENCE
8.1	Sick Leave
8.1.1	Calculation: All teachers shall earn sick leave based on the number of duty hours up to a maximum of 96 hours for a teacher working 8 hours per day for 185 days. Teachers working less than 8 hours a day and/or less than 185 days will earn sick leave based on the following formula:
Sick leave hours = # of hours on paid status in one school year multiplied by 0.0649
(A full-time teacher works 1480 hours per school year and earns 96 hours of sick leave. 96/1480 = 0.0649 hours of sick leave earned per hour worked.)
The following table will provide clarification of the above formula:

absence. In the case of equal seniority, the teacher with the lower license file number as required by the MDE shall be deemed senior.
13.3.3	Reinstatement: Teachers placed on unrequested leave of absence shall be reinstated to the positions from which they have been given leaves of absence or, if not available, to other available positions in ISD 196 in fields in which they are licensed.

SECTION 14	-TRANSFERS
14.1	Purpose
The purpose of this Section is to establish the procedures to be followed by ISD 196 in making an involuntary transfer of a teacher from one school building to a vacant position in another school building. An involuntaiy transfer shall not be used as a punitive measure against a teacher.
14.2	Selection for Transfer
A teacher may only be involuntarily transferred to a vacant position for which such teacher is both qualified and licensed by the MDE. A teacher shall be deemed to be “qualified” for the purpose of this Section only if such teacher has a major in the subject matter or field of licensure by the MDE and has a currently valid license (other than a limited or provisional license) to teach in such subject matter or field. However, an ECFE teacher may only be involuntarily transferred to another ECFE position, and an ABE teacher may only be involuntarily transferred to another ABE position.
Before making an involuntary transfer from any school building, ISD 196 will seek a volunteer from among those teachers in such building who are licensed for the vacant position. If no satisfactory volunteer is found pursuant to the criteria for selection, as set forth in Section 14.4, the teacher who is qualified and licensed for the vacant position who is lowest on the seniority list shall be transferred.
14.3	Notice of Transfer
A teacher subject to an involuntary transfer shall be notified of such transfer as early as possible, and shall be furnished a system-wide list of all vacancies in ISD 196 for which such teacher is qualified and licensed. In order to visit schools where vacancies may exist, the teacher may request one-half day of leave, without deduction from leave allowance, such request to be submitted to in advance and subject to

approval by the Director of Human Resources.
14.4	Criteria for Voluntary Transfer
ISD 196 shall make every reasonable effort to grant applications for voluntary transfers to the extent that such applications are consistent with the educational requirements of ISD 196. All continuing contract, internal candidates who apply for a position are guaranteed an interview for any position for which they are qualified. Probationary teachers may apply but are not guaranteed an interview. Teachers applying for an open position have five (5) days from the posting of the opening to submit their intent to transfer. If the transfer request occurs between August 1 and October 15 inclusive, the teacher’s current principal must also agree to the transfer. If more than one (1) eligible teacher applies for a vacant position, selection for transfer shall be based on the following criteria:
A.	Contribution that the teacher could make to the students in the new teaching position according to his/her training, experience, and interests.
B.	Qualifications of the teacher as compared to those of other candidates for the position to be filled.
C.	The reasons why the teacher wants the transfer or reassignment.
D.	The recommendations of the principals, department chairpersons or team leaders involved in the transfer.
E.	The opportunities for professional growth on the teacher’s part.
F.	In the event that all other criteria are essentially similar, the teacher highest on the seniority list shall be preferred.
Each teacher applying for voluntary transfer shall be promptly notified in writing of the disposition of such application. To apply for a voluntary transfer, each teacher shall complete ISD 196 voluntary transfer form.
