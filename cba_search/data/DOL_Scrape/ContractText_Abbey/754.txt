14. LOW-NEED DAYS AND LAYOFF:
Reduction of registered nurse staff may be made only in the event of a diminished number of needed nursing care hours. Unanticipated declines in patient needs may 37
result in the'need to'temporarily jeduce hours, but it is recognized by the parties that the basic policy shall be to use the layoff procedures of this Contract to accomplish staff reductions when a reduction iri-patient needs is reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time, Non-bargaining unit personnel shall not be utilized to replace any bargaining unit nurse whose hours are so reduced. '
A.	Definitions:	j	;	.
As used in this. Section 14, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
1.	"Clinical group" means a unit or group of units which require similar nursing skills.	y
2.	"Qualified” means the ability to independently provide safe; direct patient . -	- ; hr; care, for the standard case load on the unit within a reasonable period of
/ '. s :• r _■orientation not to exceed four (4). weeks; but said term does not requ ire . ■ , : • j 3 / । proficiency in all technical skills or the performance of leadership roles.
3.	"Seniority" means the total compensated hours accrued by a nurse since
. / ■ ij	her er his-; most recent date of employment into the bargaining unit at the
. / • •	... Hospital. Compensated hours, as.qualified, in this paragraph, shall
; ? ?	„ include all hours for which a nurse islpaid. Each overtime hour worked
t shaH be.counted as one (1),compensated hour. Off-premises on-call
■	.. r: shall be. counted at the conclusion of each W-2 year at the rate of one-
. fourth (%).aftheon-call hours, paid./In.addition, compensated hours shall include hours which Section .13,/'Leave of Absence," subparagraphs A, D, E, G, and J provide are hours worked or hours for
■. /which length of service increments dcqrue.
: / : 3 ? . The above notwithstanding, seniority for anurse who transfers to a non-i ;	:	supervisory and non-managerialnursing position that is not covered by
. the Contract Agreement and .is in the same hospital in which the nurse is : ; .: j ; employed in a bargaining unit pp^itioh,accrdb nd further seniority.
The nurse’s accrued seniority shall be maintained. 8n the nurse’s record and shall be restored to the nurse if she or he transfers back to a
; : 1A.	bargaining unit position within.one (1.) year. The nurse may not exercise
.... i,/,: frozen seniority for,any purpose under this Contract while in the non-
, j -bargaining unit position. If the nurse does not return to a bargaining unit : • " position within one (1 j year from the date of the transfer out of the bargaining unit, all bargaining unit seniority is lost.' ' ;
A revised and up-to-date listing of the, seniority for each nurse in the bargaining unit will be posted by the Hospital bach six (6) months and provided to the Minnesota Nurses Association.
B.	Voluntary Low-Need Days and Leave: ■	. "

JOB SECURITY
It is the intent of the hospitals to enhance the employment security of the Registered Nurses through application of the following principles and strategies:
*	Involve the Minnesota Nurses Association in an on-going dialogue related to job security of Registered Nurses in the evolving health care environment.
•	Provide an opportunity for Minnesota Nurses Association members to have meaningful involvement in implementation of change that may affect job security of Registered Nurses.
•	Provide employment security to the degree possible by exploring all options prior to layoff (see layoff framework).
-	Provide for cross training of the registered nurse; staff that may enhance the job security of the nurse and increase flexibility in staffing for fluctuating patient volumes, including volume reductions or redesign. Cross training is defined as the orientation to another unit for the purpose of filling routinely scheduled shifts on that unit.
•	If reduction in services are necessary, every effort will be made to identify suitable open positions and provide employee essistance.
TIME OFF FOR ASSOCIATION ACTIVITIES
Increased priority will be placed on granting nurses time off for the following: Delegates to the Minnesota Nurses Association and ANA convention, Minnesota Nurses Association chairperson meetings, and Assembly of Bargaining Unit Leaders meetings.
LAYOFF AND RECALL PROCESS
93
A. As part of the continuing communication between the parties, th rough each .Hospital’s * system for1 cooperative labor-management, the Hospital will share its. data and assessment of patient volume and projections, reimbursement changes, pay or contract changes, and other environmental factors. The Hospital will notify the Association if it is considering layoffs. -	•/	.. g'g y:

-	.///> HEALTH AND SAFETY ; J" _	; ' c
The Minnesota Nurses Association and Fairview Health Services believe that the American Nurses Association’s (ANA)-statement regarding RiskA/ersus Responsibility in Providing Nursing Care addresses, the concerns raised about related issues during 2004 negotiations. The ANA document is,.therefore, adopted as a Minnesota Nurses Association/Metropolitan Healthcare Council joint statement on this issue. Statement is as follows: :
This, statement, developed.by the Cpmmittee on Ethics of the American Nurses Association, examines the question, "At what point does it tease to: be the .nurse's duty to undergo risk, for the benefit of the patient?"; .
. . Thatquestiop is partjcularly.relevant for, nurses caring for patientsr; ' ?: afflicted with communicable prinfectious diseases such as. typhoid;;
tuberculosis, plague, Hansen’s dis.easb, influenza, hepatitis B, ; ' Legionnaires’ disease, cytomegalovirus, and H1\A Not only must nursing care be readily available to individuals afflicted with communicable or ; . . infectious diseases, but also nurses must be advised oh the risks and: 1 the responsibilities.they.face in providing care to those individuals.5 ■ Accepting personal risk which exceeds the Iimits of duty is not morally : ; obligatory - it is a moral option. ' ::	1	; c ?::
;	\c *	’■ C'i'.’: .;■ /'■ ..	'■■■	....................■ .
According to the Code for Nu rses, nurses may morally,refuse to
; participate in .care, .but only, .on the grounds of either patient advocacy or moral objection .to a .specif ic. type of intervention. Nursing is resolute in . j its perspective that care 'shoultf be delivered without prejudice, and it r makes no allowance for use.gf the patient’s personal attributes or socio- ; economic status or the nature of the health problem as grounds for discrimination..............	:	: .cz < . :v,
The first statement of the Code for A/urses says;‘rthe nurse provides , services with- respect for human dignity and the uniqueness of the client, -	un restricted by considerations of social or economic statu s, persorial
attributes, or the nature of health problem^.’’ Here the code is addressing the issue of ribri-discrimination in the allocation of nursing resources,(a question of justice and fairness):"	^	c
Historically/nurses have given care.to those in need, even at risk to their ov9n health, life, or I i m b. I nd eed, th e Suggested Code of 1926 prqclai ms! that "the most precio us possession of this profession is the idearofservicb, extending even to the sacrifice of life itself. .Nursing history is replete with examples of nurses who have knowingly incurred great risk in order to care for those in need of nursing or to contribute to the . advancement of health, science. Contemporary nurses, too, knowingly place themselves in jeopardy when giving care on the battlefield, in places of squalor and poor sanitation at home or abroad, in situations of natural or manmade disaster, and. to those with communicable or infectious diseases.	■ '
96
As the Suggested t^ept 1926. reCggnizd^'the ideal or service is, in fact,'-an ideal. There are limits to the personal risk df harmdiibnurse can be expected' to’ accept as a moral duty. The profession does not and qannoi demand the sacrifice of the nurse’s well being, physical, emotional, orotherwisd, ordHe nurse’s life for the benefit of the ■ patient. :	....
For assists nee.inJresojying the question of risk versus‘nisspOnsibility, nurses must turn	;
,to the field of efhicsfor guidance. in dthics, the differentiation between benefiting 3|' ■ • another as a morel 'dufy and'benefiting another as a morii 'dptidhfis fouhcWfdur •	'’*
