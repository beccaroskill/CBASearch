Table I. All increases will be effective on the Increase Effective Date of rhe review periqci an cl wifi' be rounded to the nearest $50. Eligible employees are those classified in.the bargaining unit and , on the active payroll on both the Fund Computation Date and the Increase Effective Date. ,
11.4(a)(3) The Company in its sole discretion may selectively increase base salary rates of individual employees on effective dares other than the Increase Effective Dates in Table I (out-oEsequence increases).
11.4(b) Cost of Living Adjustments.
11.4(b)(1) Employees eligible to participate in the selective adjustment funds un^qr 11.4(a) may also receive Cost of Living Adjustments to the extent such adjusttT|ents become effective under and in accordance with all of the terms, conditions and limitations stated tn 11.4(b). "The terms, definitions, and limitations stated in 11.4(a) and 11.4(b) also apply to such adjustments. Cost of Living Adjustments would be delivered to each eligible employee separately from those selective adjustment funds derived in 11.4(a). Cost of Living Adjustments would be effective on the data specified in Table 11.
11.4(b)(2) Determination of Cost of Living Adjustments shall be niade in reference rd. the seria U.S. city average “Consumer Price Index Urban Wage Earners and'Clerical Workers” published J by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, with'the following base'period 1982-1984 = 100, such Index being referred to herein as the BLS Index.
11.4(b)(3) Computations will be made using the three (3) month average of the BLS Index for : July, August and September, 2002 (176.6), as the base period.
11.4(b)(4) During the life of this Agreement, Cost of Living Adjustments shall be computed using the three (3) month average of the BLS Index for the periods specified in Table II and thr corresponding BLS Index threshold values'expressed as percentage increases ovei1 the 2002 bast period. The formula will be: percentage of Cost of Living Adjustment equals fifty (50) percent of the percentage increase in the BLS Inciex, from the 2002 base period co the BLS'indei Comparison Quarter, that exceeds the BLS Index Threshold Percentage shown in Table II. In order to preclude recognition, on more than one effective date, of the same percentage increase, in the BLS Index, any recognition on one effective date o'f a percentage increase over*die applicable BLS Index Threshold Percentage will cause that'percentage’to be ‘set aside and disregarded in ensuing computations, [ffg., if the BLS Index for October, November, and; December, 2002 represented a 12.0 percent increase over the base period (yielding a 2.0 percent. Cost of Living Adjustment effective 3/7/2003), no Cost of Living Adjustment would result foi-the 3/5/2004 effective date unless, and to the extent, the BLS Index for October, November, and' December, 2003 represented an increase in excess of 20.3 percent over the base period.] BLS/ Index three-month averages, BLS Index increase percentages, and salary increase percentages will, be rounded to the nearest tenth, with five hundredths rounded upward to the nearest tenth.

1	, (Engineeringanti Technical Units)
The parties acknowledge that Article 9 limits the use of contract personnel during workforce reductions or when employees are on active recall status. The parties acknowledge further that occasionally situations arise when shortterm assignments require additional staffing. In the past, the Company has contracted those work packages to non-Boeing entities. The Company in its sole discretion has from time ro time preferred to have this work performed by employees on active layoff status.
In recognition of the fact that the work under discussion involves short-rerm assignments, the panics agree to the implementation of the process described immediately below.
1.	The process shall be known as Temporary Recall and shall be defined as the temporary re-employment of individuals on active layoff status (hereinafter “employees”).
2.	Temporary Recall assignments may be designated for specific programs or projects with a defined beginning and ending date. .The normal minimum will be one (I) month and rhe normal maximum will be six (6) months. Assignments will normally be full time (average eighty (80) hours in a pay period).
3.	The Company will determine which employees will be offered Temporary Recall assignments. Temporary Recall will be strictly voluntary on the pan of the employee. Refusing co consider an employee for Temporary Recall or an employees rejection of an offer of Temporary Recall will not affect the employee’s active layoff status.
4.	Temporarily recalled employees will receive the same salary they were receiving prior to layoff, adjusted for any general wage increases implemented between the date of their original layoff and temporary recall.
5.	If the temporarily recalled employee begins within one year of the original layoff effective date, eligibility 'for coverage for medical/dental insurance, life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, business travel accident insurance, long-term and short-term

SPEEA & BOEING - JOINT COMMITMENT	2
(Engineering and Technical Units)	3
November 8, 2002	4
.!.■ il .	. !'■ -i f ■	■' ■
The recent, significant reductions in employment in Commercial Airplanes have been very painful for everyone 6 involved. The negative effects on both morale and [productivity have been substantial This, along with the 7 continued difficult economic conditions, have resulted in a great deal of focus on both job security and our future.	8
• i	9
SPEEA and the Company understand the impact these issues have on employees and their careers, and are 10 developing constructive approaches to address them. The foundation of our company’s success is the technical 11 workforce, and it is clear that business'success starts with commitment to people first. This commitment must ‘ 12 be demonstrated by our actions, and our agreement to form a real partnership is an important step forward. 13
14
As we all know, job security is enhanced by preparing ourselves to compete more effectively in a dynamic, 15 global marketplace. SPEEA and the Company are jointly committed to a number of critical initiatives	16
where we will work together for the mutual success of employees, SPEEA and Boeing. These include:	17
18
•	Breakthrough improvements in productivity and morale through effective utilization	19
•	Retention and transfer of key knowledge	20
•	Restructuring and reorganizing our company and team	2!
•	Alignment of our product definition teams internally and externally to improve quality,	22
cost and cycle time of our products	23
•	Exploring more effective ways to link compensation to productivity	24
•	Improved approaches to increase stabilization of employment levels	25
•	Life-long learning as an investment in our knowledge and skills	26
27
We have recently completed a study on external alignment with our BCA Landing Gear Design Center 28 team. The engagement of the employees directly involved in the process under examination has provided	29
us with some key insights into both the benefits and obstacles to externa] alignment. One outcome is a	30
new plan co primarily align our teams with their true internal customers, and then consider external 31 alignment from a more strategic view when warranted.	32
33
In addition, we have been studying approaches to achieve dramatic improvements in productivity, again 34 using employee engagement as the primary approach to change. This study has modeled the effects of 35 normal attrition over the next five years, and confirms that we must double our productivity over the 36 next five years if we are to avoid another wave of significant employment increases as the airline industry 37 recovers from the current downturn.	38
39
As we define and implement these key initiatives, our desire is that we use attrition whenever practical to 40 accomplish any further reductions in employment and avoid layoffs in the future. However, due to the 41 cyclical nature of our business, it is difficult to predict and control conditions that affect employment 42 levels. Therefore, to the extent practical, the Company will provide job transition support and services to 43 the technical workforce affected by employment reductions through, but not limited to, the following:	44
45
•	Skills retraining (Ed ’Wells Initiative)	46
•	Career Transition Services	47
•	Career Counseling	48
•	Resume preparation	49
•	Boeing Enterprise Staffing System (BESS)	50
•	Intellectual capital management .	51
•	Skills management through Process Councils and Skill Teams	52
•	Partnerships with local educational institutions	53
•	Financial counseling	54
•	Medical benefits continuation	55
•	Income benefits continuation (involuntary layoff only)	56

Week 1 ...............................Waiting	period; no benefits’paid under the Plan
Weeks 2 through 13.....................80%	of weekly salary
Weeks 14 through 26 ...................60%	of weekly salary
Short term disability benefits for full-time employees are determined using the weekly salary reflected in Boeing Service Center records at the time the disability first begins. Short term disability benefits for part-time employees are based on the employees average weekly salary for the six weeks immediately preceding the date of disability.
The disabled employee’s benefit may be adjusted for certain other income benefits and rehabilitative employment. There is no minimum or maximum benefit payment under the Plan.
To receive short term disability benefits, the employee must be totally disabled. The employee also must be under the continuous care of a legally qualified physician throughout the employee’s period of total disability. All determinations of total disability are made by the service representative within the terms of its contract with the Company.
Short term disability benefits are paid as shown in the Short Term Disability Benefit Schedule above while the employee continues to be totally disabled. Benefits end at the earliest of the following dates:
1. The date the employee no longer is totally disabled.
2. The end of the employee’s maximum benefit period.
3. The date the employee dies.
A period of disability ends when the employee returns to work for one full day. ‘
After short term disability benefits have become pavable, if the employee returns to work, then again is unable to work as a result of being totally disabled, the second period of disability - is considered a continuation of the prior period of disability, provided:
1. The second period of disability is the result of the same or a related condition, and
2. The period of recovery during the benefit payment period is for a total of 60 or fewer days.
The Short Term Disability Plan does not cover any disability due to:

If the employee or dependent is confined to a hospital when first becoming covered under this plan, this plan is secondary to any plan already covering the employee or dependent for the eligible expenses related to that hospital admission: If the employee or dependent does nor have other coverage for hospital and related expenses, this plan is primary.
Benefits under a Company-sponsored medical or dental plan are not coordinated with benefits paid under any other group plan offered by the Company. An employee can receive benefits from only one (1) Company-sponsored medical or dental plan. However, when dental services performed by a licensed dentist also are covered under the medical plan, the dental plan pays its benefits first and the medical plan is secondary.	" ’ “
Federal rules govern coordination of benefits with Medicare. In most cases, Medicare is secondary to a plan that covers a person as an’ active employee 'or dependent of an active employee. Medicare is primary in most other circumstances.
B.	Traditional Medical Plan
The primary plan pays benefits without regard to any o titer pl|h.'When tile Traditional Medical Plan is secondary, it adjusts benefits so that the total'payable under both plans for expenses covered under the Traditional Medical Plan is not more than would be payable under the Traditional Medical Plan. Neither plan pays more than it would without coordination of benefits.	'■
