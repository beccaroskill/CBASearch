ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION AND PURPOSE
1.1	Recognition and Purpose
A.	This Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter "MOU" or "Agreement") is entered into by and between the State of California (hereinafter "State" or "State employer") and the California Association of Administrative Law Judges, Attorneys, and Hearing Officers in State employment, (hereinafter "CASE"), pursuant to the Ralph C. Dills Act, Government Code Section 3512 et seq.
B.	Its purpose is to improve employer-employee relations between the parties by establishing wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.
C.	Pursuant to the Dills Act and PERB certification No. S-SR-2, the State recognizes CASE as the exclusive representative of all employees in the Attorney and Hearing Officer Unit, Unit 2 (hereinafter "bargaining unit").
D.	Pursuant to Government Code section 3517, CASE recognizes the Director of the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) or his/her designee, as the designated representative of the Governor for the purposes of negotiating this MOU.
ARTICLE 2	- CASE RIGHTS
2.1	CASE Representation
A.	Representational Activity
The State recognizes and agrees to deal with CASE representatives on all matters relating to bargaining unit grievances and claims and appeals to the State Personnel Board (SPB). An employee and a CASE representative shall be authorized a reasonable amount of time off during work hours without loss of compensation (consistent with workload requirements) to prepare and present grievances and claims and appeals before SPB. CASE employee representatives may be required to notify their immediate supervisors and obtain approval regarding the time of day for conducting such activities.
B.	CASE Representatives
A written list of CASE representatives at each work location shall be furnished to the State immediately after their designation, and CASE shall notify the State promptly of any changes of such representatives. CASE officers or representatives shall not be recognized by the State until such lists or changes thereto are received.

1.	Nine (9) CASE Board members shall each be released without loss of compensation from work for up to and including one (1) day per month for organizational (board-level) activity, subject to the following:

3.	Organizational activity is that which is performed on behalf of CASE and generally affects its membership at-large.
D.	Employee Donated Release Time Bank
1.	Each department with Unit 2 employees shall establish a release time bank.

2.	Time donated to the release time bank shall be for engaging in organizational activity as defined in section 2.1 (C)(3) above. CASE shall provide verification that employees withdrawing from the bank were engaging in organizational activity.
3.	Time shall be donated in one (1) hour increments. Time shall be used in eight (8) hour increments. Donations are irrevocable.

6.	Each department shall establish and publish the procedures for donating and using time. Departments may limit the number of times each year that employees may donate to the release time bank.

Alternatively, CASE may at its option and expense, provide (at one or more facilities) a bulletin board not to exceed 36” X 48” in size to be placed in a location, and at a time of day, determined by the facility manager. Any materials posted shall be dated and initialed by the CASE representative responsible for the posting. A copy of all materials posted shall be distributed to the designated management representative at the time of posting.
B.	CASE agrees not to post any material of an illegal, libelous, obscene, defamatory, or solely non-educational partisan political nature on bulletin boards.
2.4	Distribution of Literature

C.	CASE agrees to reimburse the State Controller for all reasonable costs to produce these lists.
2.6	Use of State Rooms, Phones, and Electronic Communication Equipment

9
BU 2
01-03
C.	CASE shall be permitted incidental and minimal use of State electronic communication equipment ordinarily available to the user-employee during the regular course of business if (1) as permitted by the employee’s department for other non-business purposes; and (2) for representational purposes only; and (3) provided it results in no additional cost to the State; and, (4) provided it does not interfere with the operations of the State.
D.	The State can not guarantee privacy when using State rooms, phones and electronic communication equipment.
2.7	Fair Share Fees/Dues Deduction
A.	The State agrees to deduct and transmit to CASE all membership dues authorized on a form provided by CASE. Effective with the beginning of the first pay period following ratification of this agreement by the Legislature and the Union, the State agrees to deduct and transmit to CASE Fair Share fees from employees who do not become members of CASE.
B.	The State and CASE agree that a system of authorized dues deductions and a system of Fair Share deductions shall be operated in accordance with Government Code sections 3513(h), 3513(j), 3515, 3515.6, 3515.7, and 3515.8, subject to the following provisions:
1.	The State and CASE agree that if a Fair Share rescission election is conducted in Unit 2 pursuant to Government Code section 3515.7(d), a majority of the members of the Unit shall determine whether the Fair Share deductions shall be rescinded.
2.	The written authorization for CASE membership deductions shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this agreement; provided that any employee may withdraw from CASE by sending a signed withdrawal letter to CASE at any time. A withdrawal under this paragraph does not then relieve an employee from the Agency Shop provision of this agreement. An employee who so withdraws his or her membership shall be subject to paying a Fair Share fee if such a fee is applicable to Unit 2.
3.	The amount of dues and fees deducted from CASE members' and fee payers' pay warrants shall be set by CASE and changed by the State upon written request of CASE.
4.	CASE agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the State and its agents harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the State arising from this Section and the deductions arising therefrom.
5.	CASE agrees to annually notify all employees who pay Fair Share fees of their right to demand and receive from CASE a return of part of that fee pursuant to Government Code section 3515.8.
6.	No provision of this Section, nor any disputes arising thereunder, shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Agreement.
10

01-03
2.8	Safety Committee

Where safety committees (or like forums) already exist or are established for purposes of addressing safety matters of concern to more than just Unit 2 employees, then at least one (1) Unit 2 employee representative may instead be permitted to join that committee. The safety committee(s) may be constituted for purposes of addressing issues at one, or more than one work site.
2.9	New Employee Orientation
Upon initial appointment of an employee in a Bargaining Unit 2 classification, the appointing authority shall, within a reasonable period of time, inform the employee that CASE is the exclusive representative for his/her bargaining unit. The appointing authority shall also present the employee with a copy of this memorandum of understanding and a packet of information pertaining to representation by CASE, if supplied to that appointing authority in advance by CASE.

5.2	Merit Salary Adjustments
The State shall pay an amount sufficient to enable employees, after completion of their first year in a position, to receive annual merit salary adjustments in accordance with Government Code Section 19832 and applicable Department of Personnel Administration rules.
5.3	Range Changes
Employees shall receive upon movement to an alternate range the salary and MSA provided in the Alternate Range Criteria for the class.

Said request by employee shall be in writing and submitted no less than thirty (30) days prior to the employee’s anniversary date for purposes of the range change.
5.4	Bilingual Differential Pay
Bilingual Differential Pay applies to those positions designated by the Department of Personnel Administration as eligible to receive bilingual pay according to the following standards:
A.	Definition of bilingual positions for Bilingual Differential Pay
19
BU 2
01-03
1.	A bilingual position for salary differential purposes requires the use of a bilingual skill on a continuing basis averaging ten percent (10%) of the time. Anyone using their bilingual skills ten percent (10%) or more of the time will be eligible whether they are using them in a conversational, interpretation, or translation setting. In order to receive bilingual differential pay, the position/employee must be certified by the using department and approved by the Department of Personnel Administration. (Time should be an average of the time spent on bilingual activities during a given fiscal year.)
2.	The position must be in a work setting that requires the use of bilingual skills to meet the needs of the public in either:
a.	A direct public contact position;
b.	A hospital or institutional setting dealing with patient or inmate needs;
c.	A position utilized to perform interpretation, translation, or specialized bilingual activities for the department and its clients.
3.	Position(s) must be in a setting where there is a demonstrated client or correspondence flow where bilingual skills are clearly needed.
4.	Where organizationally feasible, departments should ensure that positions clearly meet the standards by centralizing the bilingual responsibility in as few positions as possible.
5.	Actual time spent conversing or interpreting in a second language and closely related activities performed directly in conjunction with the specific bilingual transaction will count toward the ten percent (10%) standard.
B.	Rate
1.	An employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria during the entire monthly pay period would receive a maximum one hundred dollars ($100) per monthly pay period, including holidays.
2.	A monthly employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria less than the entire pay period would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
3.	A fractional month employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
4.	An employee paid by the hour meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive a differential of fifty-eight cents ($.58) per hour.
5.	An employee paid by the day meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive a differential of four dollars and sixty-one cents ($4.61) per day.
C.	Employees, regardless of the time base or tenure, who use their bilingual skills more than ten percent (10%) of the time on a continuing basis and are approved by the Department of Personnel Administration will receive the bilingual differential pay on a regular basis.
20
BU 2
01-03
D.	Bilingual differential payments will become earnings and subject to contributions to the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), OASDI, levies, garnishments, Federal and State taxes.
E.	Employees working in positions which qualify for regular bilingual differential pay as authorized by the Department of Personnel Administration may receive the appropriate pay during periods of paid time off and absences (e.g., sick leave, vacation, holidays, etc.).
F.	Employees will be eligible to receive the bilingual differential payments on the date the Department of Personnel Administration approves the departmental pay request. The effective date shall be retroactive to the date of appointment, not to exceed one (1) year, and may be retroactive up to two (2) years, to a position requiring bilingual skills when the appointment documentation has been delayed. The effective date for bilingual pay differential shall coincide with the date qualified employees begin using their bilingual skills on a continuing basis averaging ten percent (10%) of the time, consistent with the other provisions of this section.
G.	Bilingual salary payments will be included in the calculation of lump sum vacation, sick leave and extra hour payments to employees terminating their State service appointment while on bilingual status.
H.	Qualifying employees in Work Week Group 2 shall receive bilingual salary compensation for overtime hours worked.
I.	Employees receiving regular bilingual differential pay will have their transfer rights determined from the maximum step of the salary range for their class. Incumbents receiving bilingual pay will have the same transfer opportunities that other class incumbents are provided.
J.	The bilingual differential pay shall be included in the rate used to calculate temporary disability, industrial disability and non-industrial disability leave benefits.
5.5	Overpayments/Payroll Errors
Overpayments/payroll errors shall be administered in accordance with Government Code Section 19838.
5.6	Late Docks
A. Notwithstanding Section 5.5 (Overpayments and Payroll Errors) and Section 5.7 (Timely Payment of Wages), departments may elect to proceed as follows as it pertains to “late docks”.
1.	Whenever an employee is charged with a “late dock” as defined by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) for the purpose of issuing salary through the negative payroll system, departments may issue the employee’s paycheck for that period as if no late dock occurred. This means that:
a.	The employee will receive a regular pay warrant on pay day (unless it would have been withheld for purposes other than the late dock);
21
BU 2
01-03
b.	The employee will be overpaid, since the dock time will not have been deducted from the employee’s pay check; and,
c.	The employee’s pay will be adjusted for any dock time occurring before the SCO cut off date, since late docks occur on or after the cut off date established by SCO.
2.	Employees who are overpaid because of paragraph 1 above, will repay the State for their overpayment by an automatic payroll deduction of the total amount from their next month’s pay check/warrant (or successive warrants where needed to satisfy the debt). Departments shall notify employees about the overpayment and the automatic payroll deduction in writing at the time the determination is made. The absence of said notification will not preclude the department from automatically deducting overpayments as otherwise permitted by this section.
3.	Departments that elect to proceed under this section may do so on an employee-by-employee basis thereby reserving the right to issue salary advances in lieu of a regular paycheck in order to avoid an overpayment due to a late dock as the department deems prudent.
4.	If an employee separates or retires from State service before satisfying late dock overpayments as a result of this section, the State shall deduct the total amount due from any other pay owing the employee at the time of his/her separation or retirement.
5.7	Timely Payment of Wages
A.	When a permanent full-time employee receives no pay warrant on payday, the State agrees to issue a salary advance, consistent with departmental policy and under the following conditions:
1.	When there are errors or delays in processing the payroll documents and the delay is through no fault of the employee, a salary advance will normally be issued within two (2) work days after payday for an amount close to the actual net pay (gross salary less deductions) in accordance with departmental policy.
2.	When a regular paycheck is late for reasons other than (1) above (e.g., AWOL, late dock), a salary advance of no less than fifty percent (50%) of the employee's actual net pay will normally be issued within five (5) work days after payday. No more than two (2) salary advances per calendar year may be issued under these circumstances.
3.	The difference between the employee's net pay and the salary advance shall not be paid until after receipt of the Controller's warrant for the pay period.
4.	The circumstances listed in (1), (2) and (3) are not applicable in remote areas where difficulties in the payroll process would not allow these timelines to be met. In these areas, the State agrees to attempt to expeditiously correct payroll errors and issue salary advances.
22
BU 2
01-03
B.	It will be the responsibility of the employee to make sure voluntary deductions (e.g., credit union deductions, union dues, etc.) are paid. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a waiver of any individual right an employee may have apart from this agreement, to bring a personal action against the State as the result of payroll errors or delays. Said actions shall not be the subject of the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this agreement.
C.	This provision does not apply to those employees who have direct deposit. This provision does not preclude advances if they are provided for under any other rules or policies where direct deposit is involved.
5.8	Recruitment and Retention, State Prisons
A.	Effective July 1, 1998, Unit 2 employees who are employed at Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons, Department of Corrections, for twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, shall be eligible for a recruitment and retention bonus of $2,400, payable thirty (30) days following the completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods.
B.	If an employee voluntarily terminates, transfers, or is discharged prior to completing twelve (12) consecutive pay periods at Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons, there will be no pro rata payment for those months at either facility.
C.	If an employee is mandatorily transferred by the Department, he/she shall be eligible for a pro rata share for those months served.
D.	If an employee promotes to a different facility, or department other than Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons prior to completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, there shall be no pro rata of this recruitment and retention bonus. After completing the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, an employee who promotes within the Department will be entitled to a pro rata share of the existing retention bonus.
E.	Part-time and intermittent employees shall receive a pro rata share of the annual recruitment and retention differential based on the total number of hours worked excluding overtime during the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods.
F.	Annual recruitment and retention payments shall not be considered as compensation for purposes of retirement contributions.
G.	Employees on IDL shall continue to receive this stipend.
H.	If an employee is granted a leave of absence, the employee will not accure time towards the twelve (12) qualifying pay periods, but the employee shall not be required to start the calculation of the twelve (12) qualifying pay periods all over. For example, if an employee has worked four (4) months at qualifying institution and then takes six (6) months’ maternity leave, the employee will have only eight (8) additional qualifying pay periods before receiving the initial payment of $2,400.
23
BU 2
01-03
5.9	Out-of-State Differential Pay
Unit 2 employees who are headquartered out-of-State or who are on permanent assignment to travel at least fifty percent (50%) of the time out-of-State shall receive a pay differential of three hundred and fifty dollars ($350) per month.
5.10	National Judicial College Differential
A.	Employees in classes enumerated in Section E (below) who complete an equivalent judicial education curriculum shall receive a monthly differential of five percent (5%) of their salary. The differential shall be considered compensation for purposes of retirement.
B.	“Equivalent judicial education curriculum” means either a certificate issued by the National Judicial College (NJC) in courses related to administrative law adjudication or twenty (20) hours of judicial education or certification as approved by the department. Equivalency shall be determined by the Department of Personnel Administration based on recommendations from the employee’s department.
C.	Employees already receiving the differential at the time this agreement is ratified by the Legislature and CASE’s membership shall continue to receive the differential.
D.	Employees not receiving the differential at the time this agreement is ratified by the Legislature and CASE’s membership who complete a qualified judicial education curriculum after July 1, 2000, may begin receiving the differential no earlier than the beginning of the pay period following the month in which the curriculum was completed and not later than the month following ratification of this agreement by both CASE and the Legislature.
CASE recognizes that attendance at department provided training may be postponed for a reasonable period of time to coincide with training offered for other employees.
E.	The State agrees to reimburse employees in Administrative Law Judge and Hearing Officer classifications; including Fair Hearing Specialists; Office of Administrative Hearings, Hearing Advisers (OAH); California Energy Commission, Hearing Advisers (CEC); and Workers’ Compensation Conference Judges for necessary and reasonable expenses incurred (e.g., tuition and travel expenses) and to provide time off during normal work hours without loss of compensation, upon request, consistent with operational needs, to attend a qualified judicial education curriculum as defined above.
F.	Reimbursement for the above expenses shall be in accordance with the Business and Travel Expense provision of this MOU.
5.11	Recruitment and Retention Differential
A.	Upon approval by the Department of Personnel Administration, departments may provide Unit 2 employees a recruitment and retention differential for specific positions, classifications, facilities, or geographic locations.
B.	Less than full-time permanent employees shall receive the recruitment and retention differential on a pro rata basis.

61
BU 2
01-03

1.	The State shall contribute $1500 per year on behalf of each bargaining unit member (employee) who lives in a defined rural area, as more definitely described in Government Code Section 22825.01.
a.	Payments shall be on a monthly basis.
b.	For permanent employees, as in the “Medical Reimbursement Account” situation, the employee does not have to wait for reimbursement of covered medical expenses until the full amount has been deposited.
2.	As to any employee who enters State service or leaves State service during a fiscal year, contributions for such employee shall be made on a pro rata basis. A similar computation shall be used for anyone entering or leaving the bargaining unit (e.g., promotion in mid-fiscal year).
3.	The money shall be available for use as defined in Government Code Section (GC) 22825.01.
4.	A Rural Healthcare Equity Program will be established with a separate account for Bargaining Unit 2 members, as one of several similar accounts.

6.	If an employee does not utilize the complete $1500 pursuant to the procedures and limitations described in GC section 22825.01, then the unused monies shall be put in a “same year pool.” That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred eligible health care expenses in excess of the $1500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in GC section 22825.01.

BU 2
01-03
7.	If monies still remain after a distribution to such employees (i.e., all employees who spent more than $1500 as provided in GC section 22825.01 were completely reimbursed), then those surplus monies shall be rolled over into the next fiscal year’s funds available for distribution to employees whose expenses pursuant to the statute exceed $1500 in such subsequent year. Similar “rollovers” would occur in any years where all employees were completely reimbursed (or had payments made on their behalf) pursuant to GC 22825.01 and monies still remained in the pool.
11.7	Group Legal Services Plan
The State of California agrees to contract for an employee-paid group legal services plan, effective on or after March 1, 1992.

A full day is defined as a 24-hour period starting at midnight.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he or she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.

This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under subsection (B) of this section. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his or her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.

An employee will be eligible for NDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.
I.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
J.	Upon approval of NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
K.	All appeals of a denial of an employee's NDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to the denial of an individual's benefits.

The employee may elect to supplement payment from the 23rd work day with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay.

The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
B.	The legislative language would allow an employee in Second Tier to exercise the Tier 1 right of election at any time after the effective date of this legislation.

Attachment B - IRS Agreement Employer-Paid Employee Retirement Contributions
A. The purpose of this attachment is to implement the provisions contained in Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code concerning the tax treatment of employee retirement contributions paid by the State of California on behalf of employees in the bargaining unit. Pursuant to Section 414(h)(2) contributions to a pension plan, although designated under the plan as employee contributions, when paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by the employee, under circumstances in which the employee does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer, may be excluded from the gross income of the employee until these amounts are distributed or made available to the employee.
Implementation of Section 414(h)(2) is accomplished through a reduction in wages pursuant to the provisions of this Article.
1.	DEFINITIONS. Unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions in this Article govern the construction of this Article.
a.	"Employees." The term "employees" shall mean those employees of the State of California in Bargaining Unit 2 who make employee contributions to the PERS retirement system.

c.	"Employer." The term "employer" shall mean the State of California.
d.	"Gross Income." The term "gross income" shall mean the total compensation paid to employees in Bargaining Unit 2 by the State of California as defined in the Internal Revenue Code and rules and regulations established by the Internal Revenue Service.
e.	"Retirement System." The term "retirement system" shall mean the PERS retirement system as made applicable to the State of California under the provisions of the Public Employees' Retirement Law (California Government Code Section 20000, et seq.).
f.	"Wages." The term "wages" shall mean the compensation prescribed in this Agreement.
2.	PICK UP OF EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS.
a.	Pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the employer shall make employee contributions on behalf of employees, and such contributions shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of the United States.

BU 2
01-03
b.	Employee contributions made under Paragraph A. of this Article shall be paid from the same source of funds as used in paying the wages to affected employees.
c.	Employee contributions made by the employer under Paragraph A. of this Article shall be treated for all purposes other than taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as employee contributions made prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
d.	The employee does not have the option to receive the employer contributed amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement directly instead of having them paid to the retirement system.
3.	WAGE ADJUSTMENT.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement on the contrary, the wages of employees shall be reduced by the amount of employee contributions made by the employer pursuant to the provisions hereof.
4.	LIMITATIONS TO OPERABILITY.
This Article shall be operative only as long as the State of California pick-up of employee retirement contributions continues to be excludable from gross income of the employee under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
5.	NON-ARBITRABILITY.
The parties agree that no provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be arbitrable under the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Agreement.

In the interest of promoting harmonious labor relations, to avoid the uncertainty, inconvenience, and expense of litigation, and in settlement of the dispute that has arisen between the parties, the State of California (Department of Personnel Administration [DPA]) and the California Attorneys, Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers in State Employment (CASE) hereby agree and stipulate to the following:
1.	The California Energy Commission (CEC) Hearing Advisers II listed below shall receive the following one-time additional income of:

•	Major Williams	($3,538.84)

If CEC determines that in its opinion, one or both of the HA classifications should be revised, CEC will prepare and present a classification proposal containing its recommendations to the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) within four (4) months of the time the new Unit 2 collective bargaining agreement is ratified by both parties. Said study will be submitted and reviewed by DPA in accordance with their customary practice and the terms of the Unit 2 collective bargaining agreement. Further, if there is a cost associated with the proposal from CEC its approval and implementation shall be subject to the availability of funds as determined by the State.
3.	Nothing in this agreement shall be considered an admission by the State of California or DPA, that conduct underlying grievance number 01-02-0002, constitutes wrongdoing, out-of-class work, a violation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement, or a violation of any laws or regulations.
4.	This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supercedes all prior agreements and understanding of the parties in connection herewith.
5.	This agreement represents the full, complete, and final resolution of all disputes between the parties as it relates to all acts and omissions by the State of California giving rise to, or any way related to Section 6.3 and Section 15.3 (and any successor provisions) of the Unit 2 collective bargaining agreement, grievance number 01-020002, and Government Code §§ 19818.8 and 19818.16.
6.	Nothing in this agreement shall be used as evidence or a precedent between the parties as it relates to duties assigned to CEC Hearing Advisers in this or any other case or matter pertaining to Unit 2 employees.
7.	CASE agrees to withdraw grievance number 01-02-0002 with prejudice. CASE agrees not to request or support arbitration of grievance number 01-02-0002. CASE hereby waives any and all claims on behalf of itself and the CEC Hearing Advisers, and their heirs, executors or assigns, that may be raised in any forum, administrative and judicial.

SIDE LETTERS
Side Letter #1 - Release Time, Confidential Designations, Case and Workload Waiver
Bargaining Unit 2 Side Letter Between The
State of California and the Association of CA State Attorneys & Administrative Law Judges
This agreement supercedes a like agreement that did not include reference to the Department of Industrial Relations executed by the parties July 13, 2000.
RELEASE TIME
1.	In addition to (and apart from) Section 2.1, subd. (C) of the Unit 2 collective bargaining agreement, the parties agree to the following
A.	The Department of Justice (DOJ) shall subject to the terms of this agreement, provide up to nine (9) days of release time per month.
B.	The Board of Equalization (BOE) and the Department of Health Services (DHS) and Industrial Relations (DIR) shall each subject to the terms of this agreement, provide up to three (3) days of release time per month.
2.	Release time granted pursuant to this agreement shall only be for members of the CASE board of directors who are elected officers (i.e., president, vice president, secretary, treasurer) and directors who are members of the executive board, or CASE members designated by the President of CASE who are employed by DOJ, BOE, DIR and DHS.
3.	Release time granted pursuant to this agreement shall be without loss of compensation.
4.	Release time shall only be requested and approved for organizational (board-level) activity. Organization activity is that which is performed on behalf of CASE and generally affects its membership at large.
5.	Employee seeking release time must notify their immediate supervisor and/or the departmental Labor Relations Officer in advance and obtain approval for use of release time. Release time requests shall only be denied for operational reasons.
CASE recognizes the cumulative effect of this agreement and section 2.1 of the Unit 2 collective bargaining agreement may have on departments with more than one CASE elected officer, steward or representative who work in a single unit. Thus, the amount of time employees are released for organizational and/or representational purposes is affected by the number of CASE directors, stewards, etc., and the amount of release time otherwise used by unit employees for either organizational or representational purposes.
108
BU 2
01-03
CASE recognizes that DIR will be continually, evaluating the impact of this side letter and may, as a result, propose changes to or the discontinuance of the application of this side letter to DIR during its term. CASE, therefore, agrees upon request of the State to reopen negotiations regarding a successor to this side letter at it pertains to DIR only, to take effect no sooner than July 1, 2001.
CONFIDENTIAL DESIGNATIONS
6.	In addition to the confidential designations provided for in (a) the Petition for Unit Modification executed by the parties September 6, 1999; and, (b) the agreement which allows an additional four (4) confidential designations for the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, the State and CASE agree to the following.
A.	The Department of Justice shall have seven (7) confidential designations.
B.	The Board of Equalization shall have one (1) confidential designation.
C.	The Franchise Tax Board shall have one (1) confidential designation.
7.	The designation referenced in paragraph 6(A) and (B) above shall continue as long as the release time provisions in paragraphs 1-5 remain operative. As a result, the September 6, 1999, Petition for Unit Modification for thirty-six (36) positions shall be considered increased by eight (8) positions as long as the release time provisions in paragraphs 1-5 remain operative.
8.	The designation referenced in paragraph 6(C) shall continue until such time as the parties mutually agree that it shall be discontinued. It shall be considered an addition to the parties September 6, 1999, Petition for Unit Modification. As a result, the September 6, 1999, Petition for Unit Modification for thirty-six (36) positions shall be increased by one (1).

Side Letter # 2 - CUIAB Workload
This agreement is an addendum in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), effective July 1, 1999, reached between the State of California and the California Attorneys, Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers in State Employment (CASE), as exclusive representative for Bargaining Unit 2. The State of California, Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board (CUIAB), the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) and CASE hereby agree as follows:
1.	In order to assure that ongoing funding for the 5% pay differential would be available, workload flexibility language was added to the contract. The CUIAB will not use the flexibility provided to it by Article XIII, Section 16 (Case and Hearing WorkloadUnemployment Insurance Appeals Board), to increase the number of cases or hearings assigned to Administrative Law Judges except where workload or budgetary needs so require.
2.	The CUIAB agrees to pay qualifying ALJ’s the 5% pay differential contained in Article V, Section 12 of the MOU, as amended by the November 10, 1999 agreement between CASE and the State, beginning with the October 1999 pay period.
3.	The CUIAB will make an effort to obtain at least one rank and file ALJ II position in each field office and to make appointments to those positions.
4.	The State and CASE agree pursuant to Title 8 Cal. Code of Regs, Section 32781 to modify Bargaining Unit 2 by designating four (4) Administrative Law Judge II, CUIAB positions as confidential positions in the Field Operations under the Ralph C. Dills Act. These positions are in addition to the thirty-six (36) Unit 2 positions CASE and the State previously stipulated to designate as confidential.

Side Letter #3 - Attorney IV Allocation Standards
Original side letter typed on Carroll, Burdick & McConough LLP letterhead.
Dear Ms. Buzzini:
ASCA hereby acknowledges and agrees that the following reflects the parties intent as it relates to the attorney allocation standards concurrently negotiated and the related out-of-class grievance process.
1.	Class specifications adopted by the State Personnel Board remain operative and unaffected by the Attorney IV allocations standards.
2.	DOJ attorneys may not file (or base) out-of-class grievances or allocation claims based on duties performed because they are assigned Supervising Deputy Attorney General.
3.	ASCA recognizes that it is the State’s position that the “existing standard” for determining whether employees are working out-of-class (and whether positions should be allocated at a higher level) is inter alia whether the employee has continuously spent a majority (i.e., more than 50%) of his/her time (over the course of two consecutive weeks or more) performing the full range of duties in an existing higher level classification which do not overlap with the lower level classification.
The State recognizes that ACSA does not agree the above is the “existing standards”.
Consequently, the parties have not included this definition in the attorney IV allocation standards and they have thereby reserved the ability to present the issue of what constituted “the existing standard” to an arbitrator as a threshold matter.
4.	Out-of-class grievances and requests to reallocation of positions to the IV level that exceed the cap will receive strict scrutiny.
This description of the IV level cap is not intended to modify how the cap functions at the III level.
5.	ACSA recognizes allocating positions to the IV level is contingent on the approval of funding by the Department of Finance (or designee).
6.	Nothing in the Attorney IV allocations standards, or the Attorney IV Grievance and Position Allocations Claims process, or this letter shall be used as the basis for reducing any existing Attorney IV incumbent’s classification level.
Very truly yours,
CARROLL, BURDICK & McDONOUGH LLP

Attorney IV Allocation Standards
These standards shall take effect upon execution of this agreement by both parties. These standards shall remain in effect until agreement is reached on a successor to the 1999-2001 Unit 2 collective bargaining agreement, or until they are changed as a result of the proper application of the State’s impasse procedures.
The Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) will review allocation and reallocation requests made by departments using the following criteria. The criteria will also be used for purposes of deciding Attorney III Out-of-Class Grievances and Position Allocation Claims.
The following factors will be applied collectively realizing that the inability to satisfy one factor(s) (e.g., forum usually practiced in) can be offset by the strength of duties associated with another factor(s). When applying the following, the state shall determine which, if any, of its attorneys perform work that is substantially similar to the work of existing properly allocated Attorney IVs used as the benchmark. Application of the criteria shall be based upon an evaluation and weighing of the following factors. The depth, breadth and frequency of duties performed shall be evaluated based on existing standards.
Disputes over application of this criteria shall be resolved exclusively by the Attorney III Out of Class and Position Allocation Claims process. (see attached.)
