The unit member shall be immediately assigned to the new work schedule upon completion of or withdrawal from the course in which he/she is enrolled at the time of the notification of the change in hours.

5.13	Overtime and Compensatory Time
5.13.1	Definition

For unit members working a 9/80 schedule, overtime shall be granted for all hours worked in excess of the required workday of nine (9) hour workday and a workweek of forty (40) hours.
Unit members who are not required or requested to work overtime during a specific time period, may voluntarily request on a non-regular, non-reoccurring basis to modify the hours on one day and make up the hours on another day as long as the total number of hours worked in any week does not exceed forty (40).

The unit member will also have the option to return to the same position he/she just vacated, provided the position has not been offered to another applicant. Unit members who are not permanent District employees may not return to the previous classification without the approval of the supervisor of the vacancy at the lower classification. If the unit member chooses to return to the same position he/she just vacated, the unit member shall state her/his intention to do so in writing, with copies provided to her/his current supervisor, the supervisor of the position to which he/she wishes to return, and Human Resources. A transfer application request shall not be required in this case. The unit member shall be returned to her/his former position within ten (10) working days of submission of the written statement of intent. Such action shall not be considered to be a demotion.

3.	In the event the unit member so laid off has at least five (5) years of classified service with the District and has no bumping rights under 19.5(1) or 19.5(2) above, he/she may bump any unit member with less District seniority in an equal or lower classification within the same job family, when the senior unit member has the minimum qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance in that classification. However, a unit member in a lower classification may not bump a unit member in a higher classification regardless of his/her seniority.

21.1.1	A "grievance" is a claim alleging a violation, misapplication, or misinterpretation of a specific provision of this Agreement, exclusive of all other documents.
21.1.2	A "grievant" is either a unit member covered by this Agreement or a class of similarly situated unit members or AFT. In the case of multiple grievance claims regarding the same allegation, AFT may select one grievance to be processed, and the decision rendered will be applicable to all claims on the same issue arising from the same set of circumstances.
21.1.3	An "immediate supervisor" means the individual who is not a member of the unit and who assigns, reviews, and directs the work of the grieving unit member(s).
21.1.4	A "representative of the unit member" shall mean someone selected by the grievant to assist him/her in presenting and processing his/her grievance. The representative need not be an AFT representative.

If such an agency or judicial body does not accept jurisdiction, the time limit for filing a grievance begins on the date of receipt of notification of rejected jurisdiction.
21.2.2	The District and AFT agree that every effort will be made to settle grievances at the lowest supervisory level possible. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any grievant to discuss a grievance informally with his/her immediate supervisor or to have the grievance resolved at any time without the intervention of AFT, provided that the resolution is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
21.2.3	The filing of a grievance will in no way interfere with the right of the District in carrying out its management responsibilities subject to the final decision of the grievance. In the event the alleged grievance involves an order, requirement, or other directive that does not involve unreasonable danger to the personal health and safety of the unit member or others or is not illegal and/or does not call for an illegal act, the grievant will fulfill or carry out such order, requirement, or other directive, pending the final resolution of the grievance.
21.2.4	If the grievance involves unit members with different immediate supervisors, the grievance may be filed at Step II or Step III as appropriate.
21.2.5	If the immediate supervisor at Step I does not have the authority necessary to adjust the grievance, the grievance process shall commence at the step where such authority resides.

Performance Appraisal Criteria Definitions and Guides Food Service Employees
Employee Performance Criteria
Employee performance criteria are defined below. These are only to be considered examples and evaluation is not limited to these suggestions. Each criterion should be checked in relation to the individual employee's duties and responsibilities. Do not assume that all factors are of equal importance. Each criterion's degree of importance will vary according to the requirements of the employee's job. The employee should be made aware of these requirements. Performance not falling within levels described below should be rated as “needs improvement” with specific written guidance as to what can be done to improve performance.
Quality of Work
The degree of excellence of the work performed over the entire rating period. In rating this criterion, attention should be paid to the consequences of work that is not of good quality.
