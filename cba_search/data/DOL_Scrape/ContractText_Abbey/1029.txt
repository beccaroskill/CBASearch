Authorized staff representatives of the Union shall have access at reasonable times to those areas of the Employer’s premises which are open to the general public for the purpose of investigating grievances and contract compliance. Union staff representatives shall not have access to employee lounges, nursing units, work areas or other patient care areas unless advance approval has been obtained from the Employer. The Union agrees that this limited right of access to the Employer’s premises shall be subject to the same general rules applicable to other non-employees and such access shall not interfere with or disturb employees in the performance of then* work during working hours, and shall not interfere with or provide any distraction to patient care, patient families or the normal operation of the “Hospital”.
4.2	Unit Representative/Shop Steward. The Union may designate Unit Representatives (Shop Stewards) for each department of the Employer. The Unit Representatives shall not be recognized by the Employer until the Union has given the Employer written notice of the selection.

Monthly, the Employer shall provide a list of new hires (including the above referenced information) and a listing of names and social security numbers of all terminations during the month. As of the date of this Agreement, the Union is working to eliminate the need to rely on Social Security numbers. As soon as practicable, the Union will advise the Employer that it no longer needs Social Security numbers and the parties will develop a mutually acceptable alternative.
4.6	New Employee Orientation. A designated UFCW, Local 21 bargaining unit representative may meet with new hires for a period of up to thirty (30) minutes at the end of the Hospital’s orientation. Attendance shall be voluntary and shall be on the unpaid time of the bargaining unit representative and the new hire.

Prior to the start of Collective Bargaining, the designated employees shall identify whether they wish to use PTO for the dates of the bargaining sessions they attend. If they choose not to use PTO, the days of the bargaining sessions shall be treated as “no pay” days, but shall not alter accrual of benefits that would otherwise be earned by the employee.

5.7	Length of Service. For purposes of this Agreement and the method of computing paid time off, seniority, and other conditions of employment, a “month” shall be defined as 173.3 hours of work, and a “year” shall be defined as 2080 hours of work. For purposes of computing longevity (wage) steps and annual leave progression steps, a “year” shall be defined as 1664 hours of work or twelve (12) months, whichever comes last. Time paid for but not worked (excluding standby pay) shall be regarded as time worked for purposes of computing wages and benefits. Time worked which is paid on an overtime basis shall count as time worked for purposes of computing wages and benefits not to exceed 2080 hours within any twelve (12) month period. Effective January 1, 2020, the preceding sentence shall be replaced by: “Time worked which is paid on an overtime basis shall count as time worked for purposes of computing benefit accruals not to exceed 80 hours per pay period.

6.1	Job Posting. Regular job openings in the bargaining unit shall be posted in a prominent location for seven (7) days. The requirements for the job (including any required registrations, licenses, certifications, etc.) shall be included in the posting. In the selection process, the Employer will select the most highly qualified applicant for the position. Where qualifications are considered by the Employer to be equal, the senior employee applying for such job will be given preference. For purposes of this contract, the term “qualified” is herein defined to include
4847-6711 -975 lv.1 0017722-000462
such factors as skill, competence, ability, experience, attendance/punctuality record and past performance, in the opinion of the Employer.. Absent exceptional circumstances, the selected employee will be placed in the new position within three (3) months of acceptance. Subject to the above provisions, per diem employees applying for a position will be considered before outside applicants.
6.1.1	Any employee selected for a new position will be subject to a ninety (90) day trial period. If the employee is unable to successfully perform the duties of the position during the trial period in management’s opinion based on established job criteria and, if the employee is otherwise in good standing, the employee will be returned to the employee’s prior position if the employee’s former position is still vacant; otherwise the employee will be laid off and will be eligible for recall to the employee’s prior position, or similar classification if qualified at the first available opening, or in the alternative, the employee may elect to terminate with severance pay (7.3.2).
6.1.2	Upon being selected for a new position, an employee shall be ineligible for other job openings for a period of six (6) months, unless otherwise agreed to by the Employer.
6.2	Notice of Resignation. Employees are encouraged to give at least twenty-one (21) days’ advance notice of resignation and shall be required to give at least fourteen (14) days’ written notice of resignation. Failure to give the required fourteen (14) day notice may, in the Employer’s discretion, result in loss of accrued vacation and the employee may not be eligible for rehire. The Employer will give consideration to situations that would make such notice by the employee impossible.
6.3	Discipline and Discharge. No full-time or part-time employee shall be disciplined or discharged except for just cause. “Just cause” shall be defined to include the concept of appropriate performance improvement activities and corrective action administered with “due process”, which may include a written performance improvement plan, counseling, coaching, or suspension with or without pay. All disciplinary and “corrective” actions shall be described in writing, and a copy shall be given to the employee. Employees shall be required to sign the written document for the purpose of acknowledging receipt thereof. The employee’s signature thereon shall not be construed as admission of guilt or concurrence with the corrective action, but rather shall only be an acknowledgment that the employee has seen and comprehends the gravity of the disciplinary action taken. Corrective action and performance improvement processes shall not be applied when the nature of the offense requires immediate suspension or discharge. The concept of the “verbal warning” shall not be relevant or used for purposes of discipline and discharge. An employee may request the attendance of a Union representative or a Steward (who has obtained a release from his/her manager) during any investigatory meeting which may lead to disciplinary action. This section shall apply to any per diem employee who has been regularly scheduled on a continuing weekly basis, who has worked at least one (1) year for the “Hospital” , and who has worked 416 or more hours within the last twelve (12) months.
6.4	Personnel File. By appointment, employees may have access to their personnel files during normal Human Resources Department hours. Such files will be reviewed by the employee with a representative of the Human Resources Department or the department manager or designee in attendance.
4847-6711-975lv.1 0017722-000462
6.5	Performance Evaluations. All employees will be formally evaluated in writing prior to completion of the probationary period, at one year and thereafter as determined to be necessary, or requested. The evaluation is a tool for assessing the professional skills of the employee and for improving and recognizing the employee’s performance. Completion of annual department specific competencies will be required. The employee’s participation, including a
self-evaluation, is an integral part of the evaluation process. The employee will be given a copy of the evaluation, if requested. Employees will be required to sign the evaluation acknowledging receipt thereof. Employees will be given the opportunity to provide a written response to the evaluation which will be retained with the evaluation in the employee’s personnel file.
6.6	Health Tests. The Employer will address additional occupational health needs consistent with state and federal requirements and as appropriate with national recommendations and guidelines (e.g. Center for Disease Control), local and state health departments and community standards. The Employer will provide vaccines and titers consistent with CDC guidelines and/or OSHA regulations without cost to any employee.
6.7	Availability of Scrubs. Employees who routinely are exposed to contact with patient bodily fluids will have access to impervious gowns. Each department will have access to scrubs to provide a change of clothing to an employee whose work clothes become contaminated with bodily fluids.
6.8	Parking. Parking and transit benefits shall be in accordance with Employer policies. In the event the Employer modifies its current parking and transit policies or rates, the Employer will notify the Union and, upon request, meet and review the changes with the Union. The Employer will notify the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to the intended implementation date.
6.9	Equal Opportunity. The Employer and the Union agree that conditions of employment shall be consistent with applicable city, state and federal laws regarding nondiscrimination. This section shall not be subject to Step 4 (arbitration) of the grievance procedure (Article 16).

7.2	Reallocation of Staff. Reallocation of staff may occur when restructuring of the FTE compliment on an existing unit or department occurs, when a unit or department changes clinical focus, when two or more units or departments merge, or when the staff mix ratio of a unit or department is restructured. The Employer will determine the number of full-time and part-time FTEs by shift required for the new or restructured unit or department. A listing of the FTEs for each shift on the new/restructured unit or department, including any qualification requirements, shall be posted on the unit or department for at least fourteen (14) days. By the end of the posting period, each employee shall have submitted to the Employer a written list which identifies and ranks the employee’s preferences for all available positions (first to last). Based on these preference lists, the Employer will assign employees to positions on the new/restructured unit or department based on seniority, providing skill, competence, ability and experience are considered equal in the opinion of the Employer. Employees who are not assigned a position in the new or restructured unit or department may take voluntary layoff with recall rights (7.4), apply for another vacant position for which the employee is qualified, or the employee may elect to terminate with severance pay.
Note: A mandatory reduction in an employee’sposition/hours (FTE) shall be implemented by using the provisions of this Section 7.2.
7.3	Layoff. Layoff is defined as a permanent or prolonged reduction in the number of employees employed by the “Hospital”. Layoffs shall be by job group within a department and shift. In the event of a layoff, seniority within the job group shall be the determining factor when such factors as skill, competency, ability, experience and past performance (within the last twelve [12] months) are considered to be equal in the opinion of the Employer. Employees shall receive at least fourteen (14) days’ notice of the impending layoff or pay in lieu thereof plus any accrued vacation.
An employee who has been displaced due to a layoff may accept the layoff or may displace the position of any employee on the low seniority list for the employee’s job group, provided the employees’ qualifications, competence, experience and past performance are considered to be equal in the opinion of the Employer, and provided further that the employee who was initially displaced is not on the low seniority list.
The low seniority list consists of the least senior employees in a job group who comprise twenty percent (20%) of the job group. Any employee identified for layoff who is on the low seniority list and any employee who has been displaced by another employee pursuant to the above process may displace the position of the least senior employee on the low seniority list provided the employees possess equal qualifications, competence and efficiency in the opinion of the Employer.
7.3.1	Roster. In the event of a layoff, a seniority roster will be given to the Union as well as available at the Department of Human Resources.
7.3.2	Severance Pay. Employees subject to a layoff may elect to be terminated and be eligible for severance pay. Severance pay shall be one (1) week’s pay for every two (2) years of work in the bargaining unit. Employees who choose termination
4847-6711-975 lv.1 0017722-000462
with severance shall be ineligible for recall rights and shall be considered to have terminated their employment.
7-4 Recall. Employees on layoff status shall be placed on a reinstatement roster for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of layoff. When vacancies occur, the positions will be posted house-wide pursuant to Section 6.1, Job Posting. Employees on the reinstatement roster shall be regarded as applicants for the open position, together with other internal applicants.
The position will be filled in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.1.
7.4.1	Notification of Recall. When subject to recall, the Employer will notify the employee on the recall roster by certified mail or receipted email. If the employee does not respond to the recall notice sent by certified mail or receipted email within seven (7) days, the employee will be removed from the recall roster and the personnel records shall be adjusted to reflect the employee’s termination. The employee shall notify the Employer by certified mail or receipted email of any change in the employee’s current mailing address. If the employee fails to provide this notification, the employee’s name shall be eliminated from the recall list and the Employer’s recall commitments shall terminate.
7.5	Termination. Seniority shall terminate upon cessation of the employment relationship; for example, discharge, resignation, retirement, failure to return from an approved leave of absence, refusal to accept permanent work on the same shift formerly worked when offered by the Employer while on layoff, after twelve (12) consecutive months of layoff, or failure to comply with specified recall procedures.
7.6	Low Census (Low Need). Subject to employee qualifications and patient considerations, the Employer shall make a good faith effort to rotate low census equitably on each shift within a department. Prior to instituting mandatory low census, the Employer will endeavor to first cancel local agency personnel, employees working in an overtime condition, volunteers, on-call employees and employees working extra shifts. Travelers will be considered part of the regular staff for purposes of the low census rotation. Where the necessity for releasing employees because of low census is determined prior to beginning of the shift, volunteers will be determined by reference to a volunteer sign up list. Regular full-time and eligible part-time employees who work reduced schedules at the request of the Employer shall continue to accrue all benefits as if they had worked a normal schedule; provided, however, that under no circumstances shall an employee be credited with more than 2080 hours of work for purposes of benefit accrual during any one (1) twelve (12) calendar month period. A temporarily reduced work schedule because of low census (low need) shall not alter accrued hours of employment for seniority or the accrual of benefits which would otherwise be earned by the employee. An employee may elect to use accrued vacation, holiday, or personal time to receive compensation for low census hours up to the actual hours scheduled. Inadvertent or mistaken application of this provision does not entitle the employee to backpay; rather, the employee will be entitled to skip their next turn in the rotation.
ARTICLE 8	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
8.1	Work Day. The normal work day shall consist of eight (8) hours’ work to be completed within eight and one-half (8 1/2) hours.

Where innovative schedules are utilized, the Employer retains the right to revert back to the eight (8) hour day schedule or the work schedule which was in effect immediately prior to the innovative work schedule, after at least twenty-eight (28) days’ advance notice to the employee.
8.5	Overtime. Overtime shall be compensated for at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay for time worked in excess of the normal full-time work day or normal full-time work period.

When an employee has worked more than sixteen (16) hours within a defined twenty-four (24) hour period without condition, double time (2x) for any overtime hours worked during that shift shall be paid. Time paid for but not worked shall not count as time worked for purposes of computing overtime pay. All overtime must be approved by supervision. Employee initiated schedule changes shall not result in additional contract overtime or premium pay obligations being incurred by the Employer.
8.5.1	1 O-Hour Day. Employees working this ten (10) hour shift schedule shall be paid overtime compensation at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of the ten (10) hour shift and for hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week. If an employee works more than twelve (12) hours within a defined twenty-four (24) hour period, the time worked over twelve (12) hours during that shift shall be paid at the rate of double (2x) the employee’s regular rate of pay, providing the employee gets overtime authorization and works the scheduled shifts for the remainder of the pay period, excluding low census conditions, use of accrued paid sick time, and situations where an employee had worked more than sixteen (16) hours within a defined twenty-four (24) hour period. Without
4847-6711-975 lv.1 0017722-000462
condition, double time (2x) for overtime hours worked shall be paid to an employee who works two (2) sixteen (16) hour shifts in a pay period but only for the overtime hours during those two shifts.

8.6	No Pyramiding. There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of overtime pay or premium pay paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) or double time (2x). When an employee is eligible for both time and one-half (1 1/2) and double time (2x) pay, the employee will receive the highest pay rate.
8.7	Meal/Rest Periods. Employees shall be allowed two (2) paid fifteen (15) minute rest periods during each normal work day and a thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period. Meal and rest periods shall be administered as provided by state law (WAC 296-126-092).
8.8	Rest Between Shifts. In scheduling work assignments, the Employer will make a good faith effort to provide each employee with at least twelve (12) hours off duty between shifts. In the event an employee is required to work with less than twelve (12) hours off duty between shifts, all time worked within this twelve (12) hour period shall be at time and one-half (1 1/2). This section shall not apply to standby and callback assignments, in-service, education or training, committee meetings or staff meetings.

8.8.2	When an employee has worked in addition to his/her scheduled shift and such additional work does not allow at least twelve (12) hours rest (or ten (10) hours for ten and twelve hour shift employees) before the start of the employee’s next scheduled shift, the employee may request supervisory approval in advance to not start that next scheduled shift on time. If such supervisory approval is granted and, as a result, the employee does not meet his/her full FTE, the employee may choose to supplement with vacation, holiday, or personal time or take no pay for the portion of the FTE not worked. This paragraph 8.8.2 includes callback assignments.
4847-6711-975 lv.1 0017722-000462
8.9	Posting of Schedules. The Employer’s departments shall determine and post work schedules for at least twenty-eight-day periods (28) at least fourteen (14) days immediately preceding the effective date of the schedule. If a department intends to implement scheduling for a shorter period, it shall notify the Union. Within ten (10) days of the notification, the Union shall advise the Employer if it objects to the proposed format. If it objects, the format shall not be implemented until an agreement is reached. Except for emergency conditions involving patient care, reduced work load conditions (Section 7.6) and unplanned leaves, posted schedules may be amended only by mutual agreement. Any increase in scheduled hours of work for part-time employees will be discussed and mutually agreed to prior to posting the work schedule, except for holiday coverage. Employee initiated schedule changes shall not result in additional contract overtime or premium pay obligations being incurred by the Employer. Schedule changes after posting shall be communicated to involved employees in writing or by email.
8.10	Weekends. The Employer will make a good faith effort to rotate any weekend work in a fair and equitable manner consistent with departmental needs. This shall not apply to employees hired into work schedules that specifically include weekend work at a greater frequency. The weekend shall be defined as Saturday and Sunday for day and evening shift employees, and Friday night and Saturday night for night shift employees.
a. “Modified Baylor” Positions: For those units where employees covered by the Agreement work with Registered Nurses who are on a modified Baylor schedule, the Employer may post positions that are expected to work every weekend. When the Employer chooses to post such positions, premiums shall be paid on alternate weekends, as follows:
(i)	The first weekend shall be a “straight time weekend” and the following weekend shall be the “Baylor” weekend. These two shall continue to alternate as long as the employee remains in the position, and shall not be switched.

(iii)	If the employee works the straight time weekend or is in paid status (such as vacation, personal, sick leave, bereavement) or in a low census no pay status for the straight time weekend, the employee shall receive time and one-half the regular rate of pay for hours worked on the following Baylor weekend. If the employee does not have any paid time for the straight time weekend, hours worked on the following Baylor weekend shall be paid at straight time.
(iv)	Pay for hours not worked (vacation, personal, sick leave, bereavement, etc.) on the Baylor weekend shall be paid at straight time.
8.11	Premium in Lieu of Benefits. Benefit eligible employees may elect to receive a fifteen percent (15%) wage premium in lieu of all benefits. This election must occur within the first ten (10) days of employment or within ten (10) days of the signing of this Agreement, whichever is later, or annually on dates designated in advance by the Employer, providing the employee presents the Employer with written evidence that the employee is covered by health insurance elsewhere, and providing the application for enrollment is approved by the insurance
4847-6711-975 lv.1 0017722-000462
carrier. Employees will be given advance notice of enrollment dates. After the decision to receive either compensation plus benefits or compensation plus premium pay in lieu of benefits has been made by the employee, no change in that compensation status will be allowed except as provided herein.
8.12	Report Pay. Employees who report for work as scheduled (unless otherwise notified in advance) and are released from duty by the Employer because of low census shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours’ work or four (4) hours’ pay at the regular rate of pay. This commitment shall not apply when the Employer has made a good faith effort to notify the employee at least one and one half (1 !4) hours in advance of shift cancellation.

4847-6711-975Iv.I 0017722-000462
from duty, the supervisor will assign a later start time. An employee whose schedule is adjusted by the Employer pursuant to this subsection shall not receive discipline under the Hospital’s attendance/tardy policy for this absence.
10.3.2	Call Back - Not From Standby: When a regular employee has left the Employer’s premises or their alternative site of care and is called to return to work outside of regularly scheduled hours for work and not adjacent to regularly scheduled hours and is not on standby status, any time worked during the callback shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 V2) times the regular rate of pay for a minimum of three (3) hours.

10.8	Preceptor. A preceptor is an experienced employee assigned specific responsibility for planning, organizing, teaching, and evaluating the skill development of a new employee or an employee who has transferred to a new classification unrelated to the employee’s prior classification. A new or transferred employee may be enrolled in a defined preceptor program, the parameters of which have been set forth in writing by the Employer. Inherent in the preceptor role is the responsibility for specific, criteria-based and goal-directed education, training and documentation of the trainee’s progress for a specific training period. The period in which the new staff member is “precepted” is defined as the identified period of time for planned and guided learning experiences in which the new employee is not expected to perform independently. During the precepting period, the preceptor evaluates the new employee’s competence in critical thinking ability as well as assessment and technical skills.
Department management will determine the need for a preceptor program, the length of the precepting period, and the selection of the preceptors. If the department decides to have a precepting program, managers and staff of the department will collaborate to develop the criteria for the preceptor program. Preceptors will be assigned on a voluntary basis to the extent possible. Preceptor pay will be paid during the initial training period for precepting a new staff member or for the cross training or specialty skill training of another staff member for training other employees as designated by management. When assigning responsibilities requiring the preceptor role and functions, the Employer will only assign a staff member who has completed preceptor training unless no preceptor-trained employee is available. It is understood that all employees in the ordinary course of their responsibilities will be expected to participate in the general orientation process of new employees. This would include the providing of informational assistance, support, task instruction, and guidance to new employees.
10,8.1	Preceptor Pay. Any employee assigned as a preceptor shall receive one dollar ($1.00) per hour over the regular rate of pay for all hours when acting as a preceptor. However, a preceptor shall not receive this differential if the employee is in a higher paid job classification that contemplates training and education as job responsibilities.
10.9	Work on Day Off. An off-duty employee not on call (standby) who is asked and agrees to work in a patient care capacity shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half (1 ¥2) the regular rate of pay for a minimum of three (3) hours.

An employee on the hospital premises for training or a staff meeting who is asked to provide patient care instead of the training or staff meeting shall not be covered by this paragraph. An employee on the hospital premises for training or a staff meeting who is asked to provide patient care for the time periods after the end of the training or staff meeting shall be covered by this paragraph. This paragraph shall not apply to those employees doing telephone consultations and related work from home.
10.10	Transport Team Premium. All Respiratory Care Therapists II, Transport Team who are members of the Independent Transport Team shall receive a premium of $4.00 per hour.

Until March 11, 2019, the prior contractual provisions for PTO shall remain in place.
11.2	Scheduling. Vacation, holiday, and sick time shall begin accruing the first day of employment. All paid time off, other than sick time, must be scheduled in advance and in accordance with Employer policies and with approval by supervision whenever possible. The Employer shall have the right to schedule time off in such a way as will least interfere with patient care and work load requirements of the Employer. Patient care needs will take precedence over individual requests.

Managers are responsible for making the decisions for department-based outcomes and the overall direction of the unit. The Unit Based Committees will operate under the following guidelines:
a.	A department, through its staff, may choose not to participate in this program. Moreover, where feasible, this program may be coordinated with existing programs for staff input.
b.	While significant census fluctuations characterize the Employer’s business, it is anticipated that collaboration will improve the ability to manage response to these fluctuations in a manner that supports the care of the patients and improve working situations, while promoting collaboration between staff and management. Toward this 4847-6711-975 lv.1 0017722-000462
end, the UBC will make recommendations to management. The UBC will determine its schedule for meeting including frequency and length. The UBC will be responsible for reviewing outcomes to measure success.
c.	There will be between three (3) and six (6) staff members on the UBC. Volunteers will be sought for the UBC. If appropriate, the manager may request that other staff members participate to provide demographic diversity on the UBC. The UBC will keep minutes describing the topics discussed at each meeting.
d.	The UBC may be comprised of different job classifications and/or modalities (i.e. CT and MRI), as such, all participants recognize position/modality needs may vary. Recommendations from the committee may be position specific.
e.	Where a unit has a staffing committee containing members of other bargaining units, management may coordinate meetings for discussion of common issues, provided that the UBC members of the bargaining unit do not lose their opportunity to participate and provide input.
f.	The Hospital will provide training, on paid release time, for the UBC members to allow them to fulfill their responsibilities successfully.
The parties agree the UBC shall align with the values of compassion, excellence, integrity, collaboration, equity and innovation as it pertains to both staff and management participation.
