GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
I.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
A.	GRIEVANCES
1.	Differences involving the interpretation, application or enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement or the application of a rule or regulation of the Milwaukee Police Department affecting wages, hours, or conditions of employment shall constitute a grievance under the provisions set forth below. Matters of departmental discipline involving application of the rules or regulations of the Milwaukee Police Department which are not subject to appeal to the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners, shall constitute a grievance under the aforementioned provisions and matters of departmental discipline involving application of the rules or regulations of the Chief of Police which are subject to appeal to the Board of Fire and Police Commissioners shall not constitute a grievance under the aforementioned provisions. Matters involving approval of medical (or dental) insurance claims filed by an employee, or medical (or dental) insurance claims filed by an employee on behalf of his/her dependents, shall not constitute a grievance under the aforementioned provisions.
Obligations of the City under Chapter 65, Wisconsin Statutes, and any pension matter under the exclusive jurisdiction or control of any duly constituted pension board shall not constitute a grievance under the provisions aforementioned.
2.	Grievances over discipline shall be initiated at the level of the Grievance Procedure immediately above the level of the chain of command at which the discipline was administered, except that in cases of discipline
7
administered by the Chief of Police the grievance shall be initiated at step 2 of the Grievance Procedure and be reviewed by the Chief of Police.
3.	Steps 1 and 2, inclusive, of this Grievance Procedure shall be inapplicable to grievances involving health and life insurance benefits. A grievance concerning health insurance or life insurance benefits, other than a matter involving claims, shall be submitted directly to the City Labor Negotiator for review within fifteen (15) calendar days of the occurrence of the incident leading to such grievance. Within fifteen (15) calendar days following receipt of such grievance by the City Labor Negotiator, representatives of the MPA shall meet with the City Labor Negotiator, or his/her designee, at a mutually convenient time and place in an attempt to resolve the grievance. Following such meeting, the City Labor Negotiator shall answer the grievance in writing setting forth the reasons for his/her
' decision and submit same to the Association Grievance Committee Chairman within twenty-five (25) calendar days of such meeting. If the grievance is not settled, the Association may proceed to final and binding arbitration as hereinafter provided.
4.	All grievances and grievance appeals shall set forth the provision of the Agreement and/or the rule or regulation of the Chief of Police under which the grievance was filed. All appeals of duly filed grievances not submitted by the Association or employee (hereinafter referred to as "member") within the time limit specified shall be termed abandoned grievances and as such shall be considered as being resolved in favor of the City and not subject to provisions of this GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE. By mutual agreement, the parties may waive any of the steps contained in this GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE. With the consent of the Association, the City Labor Negotiator may waive any of the steps contained in this GRIEVANCE
8
1
AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE for grievances involving economic matters; this waiver provision shall not apply to grievances over matters of Departmental discipline.
5.	In the event the Chief or Department takes a particular action which, in the Association's view, results in a violation of the agreement and such action adversely affects a number of members under circumstances that are essentially identical, the MPA grievance committee may file a group grievance on their behalf at the second step, within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of the incident leading to such grievance. The group grievance shall identify by name, all members alleged to have been adversely affected by such action. If the MPA grievance committee is unable to identify all members of the group, by name, within the time limit allowed for the filing of grievances, it shall specify those facts which cause the adversely affected members to be identically situated in its view. Before responding to the grievance, the Department shall provide the Association with information or access to information reasonably necessary for the Association to identify the members covered by the group grievance. The Association must identify all members covered by the group grievance before appealing it to arbitration. Alleged violations occurring after the occurrence of the incident giving rise to the group grievance shall not be considered to be covered by the group grievance, even if the facts are alleged to be essentially identical. In such a case, separate grievances or group grievances must be timely filed in order to be considered. Nothing herein is intended to preclude the parties from agreeing to consolidate grievances and group grievances for purposes of arbitration.
B.	STEPS IN THE GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
STEP 1:
The aggrieved member shall reduce his/her grievance to writing on a
9
I
provided numbered form and shall present such written grievance to his/her Association Steward. The Association Steward shall meet with the grievant and if the grievant so desires and the Association Steward so determines, the Association Steward shall present the written grievance to the grievant's district or bureau commanding officer within fifteen (15) calendar days of the occurrence of the incident leading to the grievance. Thereafter, the grievant, his/her Association Steward and his/her district or bureau commanding officer together with the grievant's immediate supervisor shall meet and discuss the grievance in a friendly manner and shall make every effort to resolve the grievance. The district or bureau commanding officer, if he/she deems it appropriate, may also discuss the grievance with the grievant's shift commander and may include him/her in the meeting. Following said meeting, the district or bureau commanding officer in
~ consultation with the grievant's shift commander and immediate supervisor shall answer the grievance in writing, setting forth the reasons for his decision and submit same to the Association Steward and the aggrieved within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance.
STEP 2
If the grievance is not resolved in step 1 above, the MPA Grievance Committee Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the MPA bargaining unit, may within fifteen (15) calendar days of the receipt of the Step 1 decision appeal this decision to the Chief of Police. Failure to appeal said decision within said period of time shall constitute a settlement of the grievance. Said appeal shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the Chief of Police and therein a request shall be made for a meeting with the Chief of Police to consider the decision from Step 1. The Chief of Police and the Chiefs Panel together with the MPA Grievance Committee Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the MPA
10
bargaining unit, shall meet at a mutually agreeable time. The grievant shall be entitled to be present at such appeal meeting and shall have the right to be represented by the Grievance Committee Chairman, or his/her designee who shall be a member of the MPA bargaining unit, and the parties shall discuss the Step 1 decision in good faith and attempt to resolve the matter. Within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the written appeal to the grievance, unless the time period is mutually extended by the parties, the Chief shall, in writing, advise the Chairman of the MPA Grievance Committee and the grievant as to the Chiefs decision with respect to the grievance. If an Association gr ievance is not settled at the second step, the Association may proceed to final and binding arbitration as hereinafter provided.
II.	GRIEVANCE ARBITRATION
A.	Final and binding arbitration may be initiated by serving upon the Chief of Police and City Labor Negotiator a notice in writing of an intent to proceed to final and binding arbitration within 30 calendar days of receipt of the second step answer. Said notice shall identify the grievance and the employees involved.
B.	Umpire
1.	Grievance appeals properly submitted for final and binding arbitration shall be decided by an umpire mutually acceptable to the City and the Association.
2.

No renewal shall extend beyond the term of this Agreement. By mutual consent of the parties, an individual serving as umpire may be removed at any time. Upon non-renewal or removal of the umpire, either a new umpire, mutually acceptable to both parties, shall be
11
appointed, or, in the event the parties, after 20 calendar days, are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable umpire, Part HI, Section II. B. from the GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE of the 1981-1982 City/Association Labor Contract shall be substituted for subsection B. of this Article and the word, "arbitrator" shall be substituted for the word, "umpire" wherever it appears in this Article.
3.	In accordance with the foregoing provisions and by their mutual consent, the parties agree to designate Byron Yaffe as umpire for the time period beginning on the execution date of the successor, agreement to the City/MPA 1998-2000 Labor Agreement, and ending six (6) months thereafter.	; ;	.
C.	The umpire shall hold hearings at a time convenient to the parties, with the location of such hearings alternating between the MPA offices and the offices of the City Hall complex. The umpire shall take such evidence as in his/her judgment is appropriate for the disposition of the dispute. Statements of position may be made by the parties and witnesses may be called. In disputes involving application of rules or regulations of the Milwaukee Police Department, the Chief of Police or his representative shall be permitted to participate in the proceeding and to state the Department's position on the dispute.
D.	The umpire shall neither add to, detract from, nor modify the language of the Agreement or of the rules and regulations in arriving at a determination of any issue presented that is proper for final and binding arbitration within the limitations expressed herein. The umpire shall have no authority to grant wage increases or wage decreases.
E.	The umpire shall expressly confine himself/herself to the precise issues submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to determine any other issue not so submitted to him/her or to submit observations or declarations of opinion which are not directly essential in reaching the determination.
12
F.	In reviewing any difference over application of a departmental rule or regulation under this grievance and arbitration procedure, the umpire shall take into account the special statutory responsibilities granted to the Chief of Police under Section 62.50, Wisconsin Statutes, 1977. The umpire shall not impair the ability of the Chief of Police to operate the Department in accordance with the Statutory responsibilities under Section 62.50, Wisconsin Statutes, 1977, nor shall he/she impair the authority of the Chief of Police to maintain, establish and modify rules and regulations for the operation of the Police Department, provided such rules and regulations are not in violation of the specific provisions of this Agreement. In addition, the umpire shall not prohibit the Chief of Police from executing Departmental rules and regulations in a fair and equitable manner.
G.	All expenses which may be involved in the arbitration proceedings shall be borne by the parties equally. However, the expenses relating to the calling of witnesses or the obtaining of depositions or any other similar expense associated with such proceedings shall be borne by the party at whose request such witnesses of depositions are required.
H.	For the purpose of receiving testimony and evidence, the provisions of Section 788.06 and 788.07 of the Wisconsin Statutes shall apply. The arbitration award shall be reduced to writing and shall be subject to Sections 788.08 through and including 788.15 of the Wisconsin Statutes. All other sections and provisions of Chapter 788 are hereby expressly negated and of no force and effect in any arbitration under this Agreement.
I.	It is contemplated by the provisions of this Agreement that any arbitration award shall be issued by the umpire within sixty (60) calendar days after the notice of appointment unless the parties to this Agreement shall extend the period in writing by mutual consent.
J.	The umpire shall submit in writing his/her award to the parties.

23
having been on the payroll for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is on the Police Department payroll less that 14 days in a calendar month, then the employee shall be deemed as not having been on the payroll at all during the calendar month.

3.	OVERTIME PAYMENTS
a.	Definitions
(1)	Compensatory Time Off Balance (CTB)
The term “compensatory time off balance (CTB)”, as used in subsection 3 of this Article, shall mean the unused amount of overtime the employee has earned that was compensated in time off instead of cash.
(2)	Overtime Earned
The term “overtime earned,” as used in subsection 3 of this Article, shall mean the amount of overtime worked times the rate at which it is
- compensated; for example, one hour of overtime worked that is compensated at straight time rates (IX)*1 under this Article shall equal one hour of overtime earned and one hour of overtime worked that is compensated at a rate of time and one-half (PAX) under this Article shall equal 1 ’A hours of overtime earned.
b.	Payment
All overtime earned for work performed during the term of this Agreement, shall be paid for in cash except that:
(1)	If an employee’s compensatory time off balance (CTB) recorded on the most current Police Department Personnel Status Report is less than 225 hours, the employee may elect to be compensated in time off instead of cash for each instance of overtime work performed after issuance of the most current Status Report until issuance of the next Status Report which
1 *Less than two and one half hours of Court Overtime worked shall equal two and one half hours of overtime earned at 1.5X Base Salary.
31
indicates the employee’s CTB is equal to or greater than 225 hours.
(2)	An employee may use compensatory time off on dates he/she has requested provided the employee gives his/her commanding officer reasonable advance notice of the dates requested and the dates are determined available by the commanding officer in accordance with the needs of the Police Service. The processing of requests for use of compensatory time off shall be on a first-come, first-served basis. Decisions made by employee’s commanding officer with respect to the availability of the dates the employee has requested shall be subject to all of the provisions of subsections 3.b. (3) and -(4).
(3)	The parties recognize arid shall implement the U.S. Department of Labor’s position that prior to denyihg a request to use accrued compensatory time, and even when granting the request would bring operations below
' prescribed staffing levels, an employer must first attempt operational alternatives to fill its prescribed staffing levels by using replacement officers at premium overtime rates when required by the FLS A. Accordingly, the City, working with and through the Milwaukee Police Association, has established a system which guarantees that no one is denied compensatory time off when prescribed staffing levels can be met through a replacement (paid at FLSA premium rates where they apply). If a police officer is denied a request to use compensatory time on the regularly scheduled shift that the officer has requested, whether on the basis of prescribed staffing levels or for any other reason(s), the provisions enumerated as subsections (a) through (k) at the end of this paragraph will be utilized in order to obtain, when at all possible, a suitable replacement for the officer, excepting under the following circumstances in which the below-described duties fall within the officer’s regularly scheduled shift:
(aa) where that police officer is required to testify at a hearing, trial, or
32
other proceeding on behalf of the City (including, inter alia, Fire and Police Commission meetings or hearings, grievance arbitrations, or lawsuits) to the exclusion of any other police officer, and where he or she has not been subpoenaed to testify;
(bb) where a police officer is mandated to appear at a charging conference in the office of the District Attorney, or before any other public prosecutor, and where his or her involvement in the arrest or other pertinent events mandates that the police officer appear to the exclusion of any other police officer; and
(cc) in those circumstances where the police officer (excluding those assigned to the Patrol Bureau) possesses unique technical skills which are required to be made available to the Police Department during a particular period of time. In the event that an officer is denied compensatory time off (or is initially granted compensatory time off and is subsequently denied) under this subsection (cc), s/he shall be compensated at the rate of l-l/2x (or 2x if cancelled within 24 hours of the start of the compensatory time previously granted) for all hours of that shift for which compensatory time off had been requested if the following conditions are satisfied prior to notification by the Department that s/he would be required to work during that time:
1.	the officer made arrangements for a replacement; and
2.	both the officer requesting compensatory time off and the replacement executed and filed with the Department the forms specified in Article 15 Section 3.b.(3)(l), of this paragraph, below.
The Chief of Police shall develop a form, which will be posted at each work location throughout the Police Department, upon which employees seeking
33
replacements may identify themselves and the pertinent date(s). The availability of this form shall not preclude the use of replacements obtained by police officers through other means. The following conditions will apply to replacements obtained under this subsection. If these conditions are fulfilled, the replacement will work in place of the employee who has requested the use of compensatory time off and that request shall be granted.
(a)	Arrangements for a replacement must be made and confirmed at least 48 hours in advance of the start of the compensatory time which is to be taken off.
(b)	The replacement worker is within the same “box” as shown on the “Milwaukee Police Department Organizational Chart” attached hereto as page 1 of Appendix G (as may be in effect, modified or changed from time to time by the Department or the Fire and Police Commission) as the employee exercising his/her right to use compensatory time off, except as specifically provided on page 2 of Appendix G or unless the employee’s commanding officer in his or her discretion approves a replacement obtained by the employee from a different “box.” In the event that the Department or the Fire and Police Commission modifies the organizational chart, the parties will immediately engage in collective bargaining to provide for reasonably comparable access to replacement workers.
(c)	The replacement must have more than one (1) year of service from date of hire and must have completed field training.
34
(d)	The replacement must be of the same rank as the employee requesting use of compensatory time off.
(e)	The replacement will be permitted to work as a replacement only on a day when he/she would otherwise be on a regular day off.
(f)	An employee is ineligible to work as a replacement for more than two (2) regular off days in a pay period.
(g)	An employee is ineligible to work as a replacement for more than four (4) hours during a shift that immediately precedes or follows that employee’s regular work shift, not to exceed two (2) occasions per pay period.
(h)	The regular shift replacement hours will be compensated in cash at straight-time (IX) rates (except for the four (4) contractual holidays specified at Article 32 paragraph 1 of this Agreement which will be paid at P/2X Base Salary). Time worked as a replacement under this subsection shall be counted as “hours worked” for FLS A purposes, so long as the requirements of the FLSA apply to the City.
(i)	The replacement will not receive out-of-shift premium.

HEALTH INSURANCE
1.	Benefits
a.	Basic Plan
During the term of this Agreement, Basic Plan health insurance benefits shall be the same as the Basic Plan benefits that were provided in the 1998-2000 City/Association Agreement, including the following provisions:
(1)	Every medical procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis shall not be covered by these benefits when the procedure is performed on a hospital inpatient basis. Procedures that can be performed on an outpatient basis that are done on an inpatient basis in conjunction with other procedures requiring inpatient status, or any procedures performed on an inpatient basis that constitute a medically verifiable exception (as determined by the Utilization Review Contractor) to the requirement that it be performed on an outpatient basis, shall be covered.
(2)	A Utilization Review Case Management Program (UR/CM) program shall
49
be established by the City for all elective procedures. Elective procedures subject to the UR/CM program shall include all treatments for mental health disorders and substance abuse and home health care services. The program would be an independent review that assures each patient that the proposed hospitalization is necessary, based upon the medical condition of the patient, delivered in the most appropriate medical setting (inpatient or outpatient) and fair and equitably priced. Whenever an elective procedure is recommended for an employee, or his/her dependents, by a physician, the employee shall be required to notify the designated UR/CM program representative of this fact by telephone at the time such procedure is recommended, in accordance with procedures established by the Employee Benefits Manager for that purpose. Any elective procedure not submitted to the designated UR/CM program representative shall not be covered by these benefits. UR/CM shall determine whether or not a procedure is elective. Within 48 hours of the hospital admission time for any urgent or emergency procedure performed on an employee, or his/her dependents, the employee or adult responsible for him/her, shall be required to notify the designated UR/CM program representative of this fact by telephone in accordance with procedures established by the Employee Benefits Manager for that purpose; provided however, that if bona fide medical circumstances applicable to the employee preclude compliance with the 48-hour notification requirement, UR/CM shall authorize reasonable extension of this time limit consistent with such medical circumstances or the availability of an adult responsible for the employee. Following its review of an elective procedure contemplated for an employee, or his/her dependents, UR/CM will inform the employee of its determination in respect to approval or denial of the procedure. After the patient informs his/her physician that the proposed elective procedure must be approved by
50
the UR/CM program representative and the physician has contacted such representative, the UR/CM program will determine if the procedure will be approved or denied. If the physician and the UR/CM program representative disagree, discussions between them will continue in an attempt to resolve the disagreement. If discussions over five working days do not resolve the issue, the Employe Benefits Manager shall appoint a local physician who practices in a medical field relevant to the contemplated elective procedure and who is not affiliated with the employee's physician. The second physician's findings shall be submitted to the UR/CM program representative for review. If the second physician's prescribed treatment is approved by the UR/CM program representative, it shall be the treatment which is covered. In the event that both physicians either prescribe the same course of treatment, or each prescribes a different one, and the procedure(s) does(do) not meet the standards of the UR/CM program representative, and no compromise can be effected, the UR/CM program representative will approve the course of treatment prescribed by the employee's physician. Once established, the foregoing appeal procedure shall remain in effect until the execution date of the successor contract to this Agreement.
(3)	The major medical deductible shall be $100 per person, $300 per family maximum on the Basic Plan.
(4)	Transplant Benefit

51
procedures is $250,000. This aggregate lifetime maximum benefit limit applies to all benefits arising out of an organ or tissue transplant.
(5)	The maximum annual benefit per participant for outpatient services for alcoholism, drug abuse and nervous and mental disorders provided in the outpatient department of a hospital, an Outpatient Treatment Facility or a physician's office, that is provided under the "Hospital Surgical-Medical Group Master Plan Document for City of Milwaukee" shall be two thousand dollars ($2,000). The maximum benefits provided under the "Major Medical Coverage" section of the Basic Plan for benefits for professional services for psychiatric care, including any type of nervous or mental care provided to a participant without confinement- shall be 80% of two thousand ($2,000) of charges.
(6)	Effective January 1, 2002, the Major Medical lifetime maximum benefit shall be increased from $250,000 to $500,000.
b.	Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Plans
Employees shall have the right to select coverage under an HMO Plan approved by the City in lieu of coverage provided by the Basic Plan. The benefits of the HMO plans will be substantially the same as the Basic Plan benefits. The benefits for employees enrolled in an HMO plan offered by the City shall be the uniform benefits specified in the 1999-2000 City of Milwaukee's Request for Proposals from Health Maintenance Organizations.
c.	Basic Dental Plan
Basic Dental Plan insurance benefits shall be the same as the benefits provided for in the DENTAL SERVICES GROUP CONTRACT FOR THE CITY OF MILWAUKEE, effective October 17, 1981 executed April 26, 1982, except that: The age limit at which the orthodontic benefits
52
provided for under the "Orthodontics" Section of said DSG CONTRACT cease for participants shall be changed from age 19 to age 25; all other terms and conditions applicable to orthodontic benefits shall remain unchanged.

(4)	The City, in conjunction with its insurance carrier, shall have the right to develop and implement any other cost containment measures it deems necessary.
(5)	An employee's health/dental insurance benefits provided by this Article shall terminate on the last day of the calendar month in which the employee is removed from the Police Department payroll; provided however, that
53
when an employee is suspended from duty without pay, such benefits shall not terminate on the last day of the calendar month in which the suspension begins if the suspension ends prior to the last day of the next following calendar month. The Police Department Administration will provide written advance notice to an employee indicating the date on which his/her health/dental insurance coverage will be terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee's health insurance coverage shall not terminate so long as he/she and/or his/her dependent(s) are eligible for and receiving health insurance coverage under the specific provisions of this Agreement that are applicable to individuals hot on the Department payroll. Except for suspensions (as provided above) this exception does not extend the termination date of an employee's dental insurance coverage beyond the last day of the calendar month in which the employee is removed from the Department payroll.

disability benefits, as provided by Chapter 102 of the Wisconsin Statutes (Worker's Compensation Act), they may receive 80% of their base salary as "injury pay" instead of such worker's compensation benefits for the period of time they may be temporarily totally or temporarily partially disabled because of such injuries. Such injury pay shall not be granted for more than 365 calendar days for any one compensable injury or recurrence thereof. A compensable injury associated with or arising from one or more separate incidents occurring prior to the incident constituting its immediate cause shall be deemed a recurrence and shall not give rise to additional injury pay entitlement. The 80% provision shall become effective January 1, 19.85, and shall cover employees receiving injury pay benefits on or after that date regardless of the date on which the compensable injury, or recurrence thereof, occurred. k.
2.	In providing injury pay in an amount equal to 80% of the employee's base salary, the employee agrees to allow the City to make a payroll adjustment to his/her biweekly paycheck deducting an amount equal to 20% of his/her base salary for that portion of the pay period he/she received injury pay and make no subsequent claim for said amount whatsoever. Such deduction shall be administered so as not to reduce employee pension benefits. For purposes of interpretation of the provisions of this Article, the term base salary as used herein shall mean the employee's base salary pay rate in effect during the pay period he/she is claiming injury pay as that base salary rate is established in the BASE SALARY Article of this Agreement.
3.	After "injury pay" benefits have been exhausted, employees shall have the option of accepting sick leave benefits or accepting worker's compensation temporary disability benefits. This option, which shall be in writing, may be terminated without prejudice to temporary total or temporary partial disability benefits under the Worker's Compensation Act thereafter, but such termination shall not be retroactive and any sick leave already used at the time of such termination of option shall not be restored to the employee.
4.	Questions involving eligibility for injury pay shall be determined under the applicable law and the substantive and procedural rules of the Department of Industry, Labor and Human
71
Relations relative to Worker's Compensation and in the event of a dispute between the City and the employee relative to such eligibility, the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations and the courts upon the statutorily prescribed review thereof shall be the sole and final arbiters of such dispute.
5.	In all third-party claims or actions, the City shall not be limited in its recovery to the amount of temporary disability benefits which would otherwise have been payable under the Worker's Compensation Act, but shall instead be entitled to recover the amount of injury pay received by the employee.

6.	Whenever an employee sustains a compensable injury, he or she shall immediately notify his or her commanding officer of this fact. Each instance of injury pay that the employee fails to comply with the requirement of this subsection shall result in the employee losing his/her entitlement to any injury pay for that instance.	-
7.	Employees reporting absent due to a compensable injury shall be governed by the Rules and Regulations and Standard Operating Procedure of the Police Department pertaining thereto.
8.	If the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determines that the injury pay benefits provided hereunder are taxable as wages, then beginning with the effective date of such determination, the City will no longer require the 20% employee deduction from injury pay benefits provided for in subsections 1. and 2. of this Article, above.
9.	In no case shall temporary disability benefits and injury pay be allowed for the same period of time.
10.	Employees appointed to the Police Officer position classification shall not be entitled to the injury pay benefits provided hereunder for any injury they may sustain while on duty prior to the start of field training during the period of time they are assigned to the Police Training Academy for recruit training. Such employees shall instead be covered by State of Wisconsin Workers' Compensation Act (WCA) temporary disability benefits during such period, including all applicable terms and conditions provided for in the WCA. The
72
provisions of subsections 6, 7 and 9, above, shall be applicable to employees governed by this subsection.

The following definitions shall be used solely for the purpose of computing the current and prospective vacation benefits:
78
a.	Anniversary Date: The date an employee completes twelve (12) months of active service following appointment to the City of Milwaukee as a regular employee. After the completion of the first twelve (12) months of active service an employee's vacation anniversary date shall not change.
b.	Active Service: The time spent as a regular employee on the City of Milwaukee payroll including the performance of assigned duties for the City and paid time not worked. In order for paid time to count as active service for vacation purposes, such time, together with any authorized unpaid leaves of absence must be continuous from the date of appointment. Active service shall also include the time spent by an employee who takes a military leave. In the event of an employee's resignation, discharge or retirement from City employment, active service shall cease as of the employee's last day at work.
c.	Year of Service: The duration of time in active service.
2.	Eligibility for vacation shall begin after the completion of twelve (12) months of active service following appointment. An employee whose service is expected to continue so as to complete a year's active service may, after six months of service and at the sole discretion of the Chief of Police be allowed to take vacation time within the year of appointment. However, if the employee leaves the service of the City before the completion of the initial 12-month period, that vacation shall be deemed unearned and payments made during the vacation shall be deducted upon termination of employment.
3.	An employee shall earn vacation time at the following rates:
a.	Rates For Calendar Years 2001, 2002 and 2003
(1)	Eight (8) hours for each calendar month of active service since an employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of eighty (80) hours per calendar year for an employee with less than seven (7) years of active service.
(2)	Twelve (12) hours for each calendar month of active service since an employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of one hundred twenty (120) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least seven (7) years but
79
less than fifteen (15) years of active service, for calendar years 2001 and 2002. Effective for calendar year 2003, twelve (12) hours for each calendar month of active service since an employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of one hundred twenty (120) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least seven (7) years but less than twelve (12) years of active service.
(3)	Sixteen (16) hours for each calendar month of active service since the employee's last anniversary date, up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least fifteen (15) years but less . than twenty (20) years of active service, for calendar years 2001 and 2002.
Effective for calendar year 2003, sixteen (16) hours for each calendar month of active service up to a maximum of one hundred sixty (160) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least twelve (12) years but less than twenty (20) years of active service. Such vacation shall be earned from the affected employee's anniversary date in 2002 and shall be for use in calendar year 2003.
(4)	Twenty (20) hours for each calendar month of active service since an employee's last anniversary date up to a maximum of two hundred (200) hours per calendar year for an employee with at least twenty (20) years of active service.
b.	For purposes of pro-rating, an employee in active service for at least fourteen (14) days in a calendar month shall be deemed as having been in active service for the full calendar month; in the event the employee is in active service for less than 14 days in a calendar month, then the employee shall be deemed as not being in active service at all during the calendar month.
c.	The time period during which an employee earns vacation with pay for a calendar year shall be limited to the employee's period of active service between his/her anniversary date for that calendar year and his/her immediate preceding anniversary date. The amount of vacation time taken during a calendar year, except for separation from service as provided in subsection 5 below, shall be limited to the
80
maximums noted in this subsection, above. These maximums are not guarantees; an employee is not entitled to any greater vacation with pay in a calendar year than that which he/she has earned for that calendar year.
4.	Employees must use vacation time during the calendar year for which such vacation time is earned; employees who do not use all of their entitled vacation time within the calendar year for which it was earned shall lose all rights to the unused time off.
5.	Vacation time taken before the full amount has been earned shall be considered time owed the City until it is earned. Any employee who leaves the service of the City due to resignation, retirement, termination, discharge, layoff or death will have the compensation for vacation time owed the City deducted from the final pay check. In the event the employee's last pay check is for an amount less than the amount of compensation owed the City, a deduction shall also be made from the employee's next preceding pay check that covers the balance of compensation owed the City: Any employee who leaves the service of the City due’to resignation, retirement, layoff or death or who takes military leave will be paid for earned vacation time that has accumulated. If an employee returns to duty prior to his/her next following anniversary date, any vacation time earned and taken hereunder shall be offset against the employee's earned vacation time for the calendar year in which that anniversary date falls. Discharge employees are not entitled to pay for accumulated vacation time.
6.	An employee on authorized injury leave as a result of a duty-incurred injury may use vacation scheduled during the period of such leave provided the Police Department Administration receives a written advance request to use the vacation, which indicates the time and place of the vacation, and provided further, the employee's private physician has authorized use of this vacation. Injured employees not using vacation scheduled during the period of their leave shall have their unused vacation rescheduled by the Police Department Administration when they return to duty, if it is possible to do so, before the end of the calendar year. In the event the Police Department Administration is unable to reschedule all of the employee's remaining unused vacation before the end of the calendar year, the
81
employee shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equivalent to the dollar value of the remaining unused vacation at the end of the calendar year, computed on the basis of the employee's base salary rate in effect at the time for which the vacation was originally scheduled. This lump sum payment shall be made as soon as is administratively practicable following the end of the calendar year. The lump sum payment shall not be construed as being part of the employee's base salary and shall not be included in the computation of any fringe benefits enumerated in this Agreement. The lump sum payment shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall it be included in any computation establishing pension benefits or payments. When authorized by the Police.Department Administration, an employee may elect to carry over into the next succeeding calendar year any remaining unused vacation that the Police Department Administration was unable to reschedule by the end of the calendar year, instead of the lump sum payment provided above. The vacation carried over shall be used by March 1 of the following calendar year or the employee will lose all rights to it, including all rights to the lump sum payment provided above. The scheduling of carried- over vacation shall be subject to availability of the dates requested by the employee, require prior approval by the employee's Commanding Officer and in no way affect the scheduling of other employees' vacations.
7.	Employees on authorized sick leave shall have their vacation that was scheduled during such leave rescheduled by the Police Department Administration when they return to duty if it is possible to do so before the end of the calendar year. In the event the Police Department Administration is unable to reschedule all of the employee's remaining unused vacation before the end of the calendar year, the City, upon the employee's return to duty, will restore to the employee's sick leave account an amount of time equal to the amount of unused vacation.
8.	Employees in active service shall have time spent receiving a duty disability retirement allowance included as years of service for purposes of computing current and prospective vacation benefits.

82
a.

The aggregate amount of an employee's segmented vacation for a calendar year shall be deemed a segmented vacation period. All other vacation benefits to which an employee is entitled shall be taken in five (5) consecutive eight-hour work day units in accordance with existing Departmental practices.
b.	A segmented vacation period may be used during the time period from January 1 through and including December 31 of a calendar year.
c.	An employee requesting a segmented vacation period in a calendar year shall, prior to March 15 of such calendar year, notify his/her commanding officer in writing of this fact on a form provided by the City, setting forth thereon the number of segmented days requested. Notification requirements as to the specific dates requested by the employee for his/her segmented vacation shall be as set forth in subsection 9.d., below. An employee failing to comply with this requirement shall not be permitted a segmented vacation period during such calendar year. The Police Department Administration shall have the authority to limit the aggregate number of segmented vacation days requested in the time period provided for in subsection b., above, if it determines that granting additional requests for segmented vacation periods will result in insufficient manpower being available to meet the needs of the Police Service.
d.	For each unit of segmented vacation, the employee shall provide his/her commanding officer with reasonable advance notice indicating the date(s) on which the employee wants to use such unit of segmented vacation; such advance notice shall be provided in writing no later than 72 hours prior to the first day of the segmented unit of vacation. Except for requested segmented vacation dates occurring on or before March 15 of the calendar year, no requested dates for segmented vacation will be processed by the Department until all non-segmented
83
vacations for that calendar year have been selected by every employee in the Association bargaining unit. All segmented days must be scheduled or requested on or before October 15th of the calendar year; provided, however, that subject to the approval of an employee's commanding officer, the October 15 deadline may be waived because of emergency, or other extraordinary circumstance, affecting the employee. An employee failing to comply with requirements of this subsection shall have his/her unused segmented vacation time scheduled for him/her by his/her commanding officer.
e.	All requests made by employees for scheduling units of segmented vacation that are submitted in accordance with the time limit and notice requirements provided above shall be processed on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to the availability of the dates requested determined by the employee's commanding officer. No request will be granted that results in another employee losing any non-segmented vacation dates he/she had previously selected in accordance with Departmental practices established for that purpose. In the event an employee's request for scheduling a unit of segmented vacation is in compliance with all of the time limit and advance notice requirements provided above, but the employee's commanding officer has determined that some or all of the dates requested by the employee for that unit are unavailable, it shall be the responsibility of the employee to schedule available substitute dates with his/her commanding officer.
10.	The vacation with pay benefits computed under the provisions of this Article shall be the full and only vacation benefits to which employees covered by this Agreement shall be entitled during calendar years 2001, 2002 and 2003.
11.	The assignment and scheduling of vacations with pay shall be controlled by the Chief of Police. However, in exercising those controls, supervisors charged with the responsibility of scheduling vacations shall not be prohibited from tentatively agreeing to allow members to rearrange their scheduled off days in order to change the starting date of a non-segmented vacation, if projected staffing needs would appear to permit such a rearrangement. If it is
84
necessary to revoke the tentative approval granted due to staffing needs, the member shall be given notice no later than seven days prior to the first day the member is tentatively scheduled to be absent.
ARTICLE 29
TIME OFF FOR JURY DUTY
1.	Employees covered by this Agreement shall be granted time off with pay for jury duty when they are legally summoned for jury duty, subject to the terms and conditions provided for in subsections 2 through 6, inclusive, of this Article, below.

While on authorized jury duty employees shall be considered by the Police Department to be working the day shift and shall be permitted to change their off-duty days (regular off and vacation days) subject to approval from the Police Department Administration. If the employee's off-duty days are changed, the employee shall be required to turn over all jury duty payments he/she receives (excluding official travel pay) to the City; in the event the employee's off-duty days are not changed he/she shall be entitled to retain the jury duty payments he/she receives for jury duty performed on his/her off-duty days, but shall be required to turn over to the City all other jury duty payments he/she receives (excluding official travel pay).
85
4.	Employees shall not be eligible for overtime while on jury duty, even if such duty extends beyond eight hours in one day; nor shall they be eligible for overtime for work performed outside their regularly scheduled work shift that is the result of changes made pursuant to subsection 3. of this Article, above.
5.	On days when the employee is normally scheduled to work, no greater amount of time off for jury duty shall be granted than is necessary. If an employee is called for jury duty on such day and reports thereto without receiving a jury assignment for that day, or if he/she is engaged in jury duty for part of such day, he/she shall immediately notify his/her commanding officer of this fact by telephone and report back to work for the remainder of his/her work day. If the employee is engaged in jury duty for part of a day that falls on a work day, then such requirement to report back to work, shall not be applicable on days where the amount of time remaining in the employ ee's regularly scheduled eight-hour shift for that day, together with travel time from the jury duty site to the employee's duty assignment location, does not allow for a work period of reasonable length; in this circumstance, the employee shall still be required to notify his/her commanding officer in accordance with the requirement set forth above. The criteria used in determining what constitutes reasonable length shall be based on present Police Department practices covering jury duty; notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee released from jury duty prior to 12:00 noon on a work day must report back to work for the remainder of his/her work. day.
ARTICLE 30

Time off in lieu of holidays shall be earned at a rate of eight (8) hours per calendar month for each calendar month in a calendar year that the employee was on the Police Department payroll.

4.	If an employee is unable to use all of the time off in lieu of holidays with pay to which the employee is entitled during a fiscal year because of an extended period of authorized sick leave that does not allow the Chief of Police to reschedule some or all of the employee's unused time off in lieu of holidays in that fiscal year, then the City, upon the employee's return to duty in the next fiscal year, will restore to the employee's sick leave account an amount of time equal to the amount of such unused time off in lieu of holidays with pay that the Chief of Police was unable to reschedule. This provision shall only cover time off in lieu of holidays that is not integrated into the employee's regular work schedule. (In the case of an employee assigned to a District Station on an eight-hour shift basis whose regular work schedule is five days on-duty, two days off-duty, followed by four days on-duty, two days off-duty, etc., this provision would cover the 32 hours off in lieu of holidays per fiscal year that are not integrated into the employee's regular work schedule and would not cover any of the 64 hours off in lieu of holidays per fiscal year that are integrated into the employee's regular work schedule.)

For purposes of interpretation and construction of this Article, the compensation herein provided shall only be granted for authorized duty occurring on the actual calendar dates that the four (4) holidays listed above fall; no such compensation will be granted for
88

Except as provided in subsection 3, below, only approved parking facilities' monthly parking permits that are properly endorsed shall be covered by the benefits provided herein. No employee shall be eligible to receive benefits under both paragraphs 2.a. and 2.b. for the same calendar month.
3.	The Association recognizes that there are a limited number of parking spaces available at City approved parking facilities; accordingly, monthly parking permits for these spaces will be sold to eligible employees (either individually, or collectively, as one permit for a carpool) on a first-come, first-served basis, subject to their availability. During a calendar month when no monthly parking permit at any City-approved parking facility(ies) is(are) available because the vendor(s) has(have) determined that no space is available, the City will honor monthly parking permit receipts from parking facilities not on the City-approved list that are within the geographic area bounded by West Wisconsin Avenue on the south, North 12th Street on the west, West Juneau Avenue on the north and North Van Buren Street on the east. The employee (or each individual employee comprising a carpool) shall endorse the receipt by indicating his/her signature and payroll number on the monthly parking permit receipt and shall submit the endorsed parking permit receipt to the Police Department Administration no later than the 15th day of the calendar month covered by the monthly permit (i.e., the 15th of April for the month of April). Following submission of the
129
parking permit receipt to the Police Department Administration, the employee (or carpool) shall be entitled to receive a monthly parking benefit for the month covered by the parking permit under the same terms and conditions provided in paragraph 2, above.
4.	Daily Parking Receipts
During a calendar month when no monthly parking permit is available to an employee under the provisions of either paragraph 2 or 3, hereof, because no space is available, the City will honor daily parking receipts from parking facilities within the geographic area described in paragraph 3, hereof, subject to the employee submitting a form prescribed by the Department to the Police Department Administration within five consecutive calendar days following the close of the calendar month. The form shall contain the following information:	.	;
a.	The employee's name, signature, and payroll number (or this information for each individual comprising a carpool);
b.	A listing of each individual daily parking receipt for the calendar month indicating
the date and amount arranged in date order with a total amount ("total amount") for the calendar month plainly indicated; and
c.	All of the daily receipts for the calendar month stapled to the back of the form. Following submission of the prescribed Departmental form to the Police Department Administration, the employee (or carpool) shall be entitled to receive a monthly parking benefit for the calendar month covered by the daily parking receipts equal to the lesser of (1) the "total amount" described in paragraph 4.b., hereof, or (2) the maximum amount provided in paragraphs 2.a. or 2.b., hereof, whichever is applicable. Such benefit shall be in lieu of the monthly parking benefits provided under paragraphs 2 and 3.
5.	No employee shall be eligible for the parking benefits provided by the Parking During Court Overtime Appearance paragraph of this Agreement for a calendar month for which he/she receives benefits hereunder.
6.	The benefits provided hereunder are intended to be used by an employee only for the purpose of commuting to and from his/her Departmental work location in connection with
130
his/her City employment. The use of a parking permit by an employee for any other purpose during a calendar month shall disqualify the employee from the benefits provided hereunder for that calendar month.
7.	Payments made under the provisions of this Article shall not be construed as being part of employees' base pay and shall not be included in the computation of any fringe benefits enumerated in this Agreement. Any payment made under the provisions of this Article shall not have any sum deducted for pension benefits nor shall such payments be included in any computation establishing pension benefits or payments.
8.	The City shall be held harmless against any and all claims, actions and lawsuits relating to theft or personal property damage brought against the City by employees using parking facilities pursuant to the parking allowance benefits provided herein. The City shall be held harmless against any and all claims, lawsuits, actions, damages and judgments due to the employee's operation of his or her private vehicle at parking facilities which are subject to the parking allowance benefits provided herein. Nothing herein would’operate to relieve the City of any liability it may have arising from its actions or omissions or preclude the employee from pursuing any rights or claims he/she may have under Wisconsin State Statute 895.46.
9.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, during a calendar month the employee members of a carpool are receiving carpool benefits, the City will honor daily parking receipts for that calendar month in accordance with the following schedule:
a.	Two-person carpool - An amount of reimbursement up to $20 which, in aggregate with the carpool benefits received by the employees' carpool, shall not exceed $90. Effective the calendar month following execution of the 2001-2003 City Union Agreement, an amount of reimbursement up to $30 which, in aggregate with the carpool benefits received by the employees' carpool, shall not exceed $100.
b.	Three-or-more-person carpool - An amount of reimbursement up to $40 which, in aggregate with the carpool benefits received by the employees' carpool, shall not exceed $110. Effective the calendar month following execution of the 2001-2003
131
City Union Agreement, an amount of reimbursement up to $50 which, in aggregate with the carpool benefits received by the employees' carpool, shall not exceed $120.
Carpool members shall determine the method of apportioning the amounts of reimbursement; any dispute involving this apportionment is specifically excluded from the grievance/arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 64
DRUG TESTING
MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT DRUG TESTING POLICY STATEMENT
The Milwaukee Police Department is charged with enforcing all laws and ordinances and with maintaining a safe and peaceful community. The pervasive risk of harm caused by drug trafficking and illegal drug use by members of the Police Department creates a clear and present danger to the safety of the public and fellow law enforcement officers. The illegal use of drugs cannot and will not be tolerated within the Milwaukee Police Department. The law enforcement profession has several uniquely compelling interests that justify the use of employee drug testing. The public has the right to expect that those who are sworn to protect them are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to assume these duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of controlled substances and other forms of drug abuse can seriously impair an employee's physical and mental health, and thus, job performance. Where law enforcement officers participate in illegal drug use and drug activity, the integrity of the law enforcement profession and public confidence in that integrity is destroyed. This confidence is further eroded by the potential for corruption created by drug use.
Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the Milwaukee Police Department and to preserve public trust and confidence in a fit and drug free law enforcement profession, the Department shall implement an expanded drug testing program to detect illegal drug use by sworn employees. Officers of all ranks will be randomly tested in such numbers as to ensure that a credible deterrent exists to illegal drug use.
132

MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT DRUG TESTING PROGRAM
(Provisions applicable to MPA-represented Department Members)
I.	DRUG TESTING PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
A.	The term "Department" as used herein shall mean the Milwaukee Police Department. The term "member" shall mean a Department employee in the WERC - certified Department bargaining unit represented by the MPA.
B.	Members shall be subject to drug testing under the following circumstances: 1. Where facts or circumstances are sufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion that a Department member is illegally using drugs.
NOTE Reasonable Suspicion exists when evidence or information which appears reliable is known to the police supervisor and is of such weight and persuasiveness as to make the supervisor, based upon/his/her personal judgment and experience, reasonably suspect that member of the department is illegally using drugs. A reasonable suspicion that a member is illegally using drugs must be supported by specific articulable facts from which rational inference may be drawn. Reasonable suspicion cannot be based upon mere "hunch" or solely upon poor work performance. If suspicion of drug use is based upon observation of the suspected member's physical appearance, at least two (2) supervisors must make observations.
2.	Whenever a member is directly involved in an incident that results in death, or great bodily harm as defined by State Statute.
3.	Whenever a member is on probation, the member shall be tested prior to completion of the member's probation period. Completion of the member's probation period shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.
4.	Whenever a member is eligible for promotion (including reclassifications), the member shall be tested prior to promotion. Promotion shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.
133
5.	Whenever a member is returning from a leave of absence that exceeds 90 consecutive calendar days in duration. Reinstatement to the Department from the leave of absence shall be contingent upon passing the drug test.
6.	Random Drug Testing
a. Periodically a list of Department members selected for drug testing shall be generated by an independent secure random selection process. The frequency of random testing, and sampling rate, shall be as prescribed from time to time by the Chief of Police. The independent agency providing the random selection process shall be prescribed by the Chief. Such independent agency shall be provided with a list of all Department members covered by random drug testing encoded so that only the Chief of Police and the Commanding Officer of the Internal Affairs Division know the identity of the Department members.
' b. The Chief may increase the frequency of random testing, and sampling rate over and above the frequency of random testing and sampling rate he prescribes from time to time under paragraph 6.a., hereof, for members assigned to the following Department Units: Vice Control Division, Tactical Enforcement Unit, Property Control Section (only those persons directly involved in the custody and handling of illegal drugs) and Internal Affairs Division. If subsequent Departmental reorganization results in modifications to any of these units, the function performed by a unit as it is presently constituted, shall continue to be covered hereunder no matter how such unit is constituted following a future reorganization.
c.	Members selected to be tested shall be notified by their Commanding Officer, who shall give them a written order to report for testing. A copy of such written order shall not be entered into a member's personnel file, but shall be retained by the Department in a file kept at the Internal
134
Affairs Division.
d.	All members on paid leave who are selected for drug testing pursuant to paragraphs 6.a. or 6.b., hereof, shall not be required to participate in such test, except those members having the following status as of the notice of selection:
(1)	Members on sick or injury leave who have received permission to leave the residence to further recuperation;
(2)	Members on compensatory time off authorized after the selection notice; or
(3)	Members on "suspended with pay" or "dismissed with pay pending appeal" status. .
e.	Members on regular off days shall not be subject to random drug testing, f. Any member selected for testing who claims inability to participate due to medical reason shall be examined by a physician designated by the Chief. The physician shall determine if such member may be excused from the test. If such member is excused from a scheduled test, he/she shall be rescheduled for testing as soon as possible, irrespective of any random sampling selection.
7. Members having sensitive assignments, referenced in paragraph 6.b., hereof, shall be subject to drug testing upon entering and leaving these assignments, as well as on an annual basis while serving in such assignments.
C.	Refusal to submit to a drug test shall result in immediate suspension and discipline up to and including dismissal from the Department. Attempts to alter or substitute a test sample provided by the member being tested shall be deemed a refusal to submit to a drug test. When the member appears unable to give a specimen at the time of the test, testing personnel shall document the circumstances on the drug-test report form. The member shall be permitted no more than three (3) hours to give a sample, during which time he/she shall remain in the testing area, under observation.
135
Reasonable amounts of water may be given to the employee to encourage urination. Failure to submit a sample shall be considered a refusal to submit a drug test.
D.	Testing Procedure
1.	The current testing procedure shall be continued. This procedure is currently administered by Aurora Consolidated Laboratories. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Chief of Police from changing the provider of this procedure, so long as the new provider is DHHS-certified and performs the procedure pursuant to DHSS standards.
2.	Substances to be tested for include:
Amphetamines	Opiates
Canabinoids	Phencyclidine (PCP)
Cocaine
Nothing herein shall prohibit the Chief of Police from amending this list of substances, so long as the added substance is one for which DHHS has adopted a quantitative standard for a positive test finding for the substance; the Department will notify the MPA of amendments to this list of substances.
3.	Split Samples
At the collection site, the technician shall either collect the specimen in two containers or shall collect the specimen in one container and shall then split the specimen into two containers. One sample (the primary sample) shall be tested by the City-designated testing laboratory. The other sample (the split sample) shall be stored by the testing laboratory should a verified confirmed positive result from the test of the first sample.
If a verified, confirmed positive result is obtained from the test of the primary sample, the member shall be informed that he/she has 72 hours to notify the Medical Review Officer (MRO) that he/she wishes to challenge the test result by means of independent testing of the split sample. The member must so notify the MRO in writing within 72 hours of the member's being notified that his/her test was verified confirmed positive for the presence of a drug. Upon
136
such a challenge, the split sample retained by the testing laboratory for use by the member shall be forwarded by the testing laboratory to a DHHS-certified laboratory selected by the member from a list of four such laboratories designated by the City.
All costs associated with the testing of the split sample shall be borne by the member, provided however, if the test of the split sample does not indicate a positive drug test result, then the Department shall reimburse such member for the costs of testing the split sample. Testing of split samples shall be conducted pursuant to the retesting provision described in the Federal Guidelines.
4.	All test results shall be reviewed and interpreted by a Medical Review Officer (MRO) who shall be a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse disorders, designated by the Chief. The MRO shall examine alternative medical explanations for any confirmed positive test result. This action may include conducting a medical interview with the individual, review of the individual's medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical factors. The MRO shall review all medical records made available by the tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have resulted from legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall forward the results of his/her review to Chief of Police and/or Commanding Officer of the Internal Affairs Division.
II.	ACCESS TO TEST RESULTS
Confirmed positive drug test results verified by the MRO shall be made available only to the following:
Chief of Police
Commanding Officer of the Internal Affairs Division
III.	ADMINISTRATION/DISCIPLINARY ACTION
A.	A member, who has been ordered to take and has taken, a drug test based on either
137
reasonable suspicion, or the requirements of paragraph I.B.2., hereof, shall not be subject to disciplinary action until the test results are received by the Department. During that period, however, the member may be required to surrender his/her weapon, badge, I.D. card, cap shield, and callbox key, and may be suspended with pay. This action shall be accomplished most discreetly and, whenever possible, without advising other personnel of the reasons.
B.	All discipline involving a member who has a confirmed positive test for illegal drug use, verified by the MRO, shall be administered by the Chief; such discipline may include dismissal from the Department. A challenge to a confirmed positive test result by a member shall not affect or delay the effective date of discipline imposed against the member pursuant to this section. The Department's position is that any member proven to have illegally used drugs should be dismissed for such use, subject only to the discretion of the Chief and review of the Fire and Police Commission.
IV.	EXCLUSION OF TEST RESULTS FROM CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
Drug test results obtained through the Milwaukee Police Department Drug Testing Program may not be used as evidence against an officer in a criminal nor in a municipal ordinance violation proceeding.
V.	CONFIDENTIALITY
A.	Except as provided in paragraph V.B., below, there shall be no dissemination of an individual member's drug test results (including documentation or information contained therein) to the public.
B.	The provisions of paragraph V.A., hereof, shall not apply to an individual member's drug test results in the following circumstances:
(1)	Disciplinary hearings, or appeals therefrom, occasioned by such individual member's drug test results.
(2)	Nondisciplinary administrative hearings, or appeals therefrom, when such individual member's drug test results would be relevant to such
138
hearings/appeals.
