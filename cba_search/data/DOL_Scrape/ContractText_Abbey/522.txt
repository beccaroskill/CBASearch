CENTRAL HUDSON GAS & ELECTRIC CORPORATION
(hereinafter called the Company) and
LOCAL UNION 320 OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS A.F. OF L.-C.I.O.
(hereinafter called the Union)
This agreement is made for the purpose of establishing stabilized conditions of employment, including rates of pay, and working conditions, facilitating the peaceful adjustment of differences that may arise between the parties hereto from time to time, and of promoting harmony and efficiency, to the end that the Company and the Union and the general public may mutually benefit.
In the event the Company should change its name or its ownership, or should sell, lease or transfer its business, or any substantial part thereof, this Agreement shall be binding on its successors and assigns. An absolute precondition to the sale, lease, or transfer of any of the business, or any substantial part thereof, is that any purchaser, transferee, or lessee thereof shall agree to, and become party to, and bound by all the terms, conditions, and obligations of this Agreement including, but not limited to, immediately providing the same wages, benefit plans, level of benefits and all terms and conditions of employment to which such employees were entitled as employees of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation. Upon satisfaction of the preconditions in the previous sentence, the Company shall be released from any and all future obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, and shall be obligated only for an event which occurred prior to the date of any such sale, lease or transfer (“Pre-closing Event'); however, the Company’s liability for any Preclosing Event shall expire thirty-six months after the date of such sale, lease or transfer, or on the expiration of the term of this Agreement, whichever is later (“Open Period”). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any claim by an employee that relates to a Pre-closing Event which has been brought to the attention of the Company during the Open Period shall be allowed

REPRESENTATION AND RECOGNITION
A.	The Union, having been certified by the National

The Company and Local 320 of the I.B.E.W. have also entered into a collective bargaining agreement dated May 1,2003, covering full-time bargaining unit employees known as the “Technical, Office and Clerical Bargaining Unit”, or the “TOC” Bargaining Unit. The Company and Local 320 of the I.B.E.W. have also entered into a collective bargaining agreement dated May 1.2003 covering part-time bargaining unit members known as the “Part-Time Bargaining Unit” or the “PT” Bargaining Unit.

Two floating holidays will be granted to be taken during each calendar year. These holidays will be granted if the employee was employed on or before October 1 of such calendar year and notification is given to the employee’s supervisor not less than five working days in advance of such holiday, provided, however, any such holiday cannot be taken on a workday which either coincides with, precedes or follows a holiday referred to in this Article III F and further provided such two floating holidays cannot be taken consecutively.

I.	Overtime shall be distributed equitably among
qualified employees in each job classification if they are available. (See +Exhibit 17)
J.	Employees who have worked overtime shall not be
given time off without pay on a regularly scheduled workday to equalize that overtime.

However, where a shift worker’s shift is changed to start on an employee’s third consecutive day off and a notice of change is given less than 72 hours in advance, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. Premium payment for a change of schedule without sufficient notice will not be paid to an employee who is absent from work on the scheduled day for which such premium would have been payable.

D
If a shift employee is required to work two consecutive shifts for which the employee would normally be paid straight time, the employee shall receive an additional four hours' pay at straight time.
Shift employees may exchange workdays or hours within a scheduled workweek provided forty-eight hours’ written notice is given to their supervisor and provided that such exchange will not result in premium payment.
M.	(Reserved)
N.	An employee required to work 16 or more consecutive
hours, shall be allowed a rest period of 8 hours after the termination of said work. If the rest period runs into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall not lose pay by reason thereof. If the employee does continue working after 16 or more consecutive hours and the period of work extends into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday, the employee shall receive pay at time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take oft.
If an employee who has worked 16 or more hours consecutively and thus became entitled to sleep time is asked to report for work again before the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday, the hours actually worked prior to the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday shall be added to the hours of sleep time to which the employee is entitled. (See +Exhibit 10)
An employee who works overtime between the seventh and the fourth hours preceding the commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period, if such overtime is not part of a period of 16 or more consecutive hours of work, shall be entitled to time off at the beginning of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period without loss of pay, equivalent to the number of overtime hours actually worked during the 7 hours immediately preceding the commencement of such basic work period. An employee who becomes entitled to time off under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence may work the balance of the remaining hours of the employee’s basic work period at the beginning of the next scheduled basic work period. However, the Company may request the employee to waive the time off to which the employee is entitled under this paragraph and to continue working. If the employee does continue working pursuant to such request, the employee shall receive pay at double time instead of
10
Article III (cont’d)
straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.
O.	1. An employee who is called out to work shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate except that if such call-out occurs ninety minutes or less prior to the beginning of the employee’s basic workday or scheduled work period, the employee shall be paid for a minimum of two hours’ time at the applicable rate. (See 1971-3 and 1971+15)
2. An employee who is scheduled to report to work outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled basic workday or basic workweek shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate with the exception that if such work is immediately before or after the basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall be paid at the applicable rate only for the actual time worked. If the Company decides it does not want the employee to work as scheduled, no payment shall be made if the notice of such decision not to work is given before the employee leaves work on the basic workday within the basic workweek immediately preceding the day on which the job was to have been done.
P.	No employee shall be requested or required at any
time to be on call or to stand by except when such employee is paid at the prevailing overtime rate.
Q.	Employees who, at the request of the Company, are
sent outside of the territory of the Company to work on the property of another utility shall receive their regular rate of pay from the Company or the rate paid by the utility on whose property they are working in the nearest comparable classification, whichever of these two rates is the higher. However, if such utility has a pay practice that would pay their employees double time for all hours worked while assigned to any mutual aid on Central Hudson’s property, then Central Hudson will adopt a similar pay practice for such assignment to mutual aid on the property of such utility. The double time pay provisions shall be administered as follows:
a.	An employee will be paid double time from the time Central Hudson begins billing the reguesting company for the employee’s services.
b.	The double time will cease when Central Hudson stops billing the requesting company for the employee’s services.
Article III (cont’d) - Article IV[Jj.
c.	All other pay provisions except for pay on a recognized holiday shall be suspended during the time such employee is being paid double time in accordance with this section Q. The maximum pay rate on a recognized holiday shall be double time plus straight time regardless of the other company’s holiday pay provisions.
d.	If a company does not have a pay practice that would pay their employees double time for all hours while assigned to mutual aid on Central Hudson’s property and offers to pay Central Hudson employees at the double time rate while assigned to their property through notification to the Central Hudson Human Resources department, Central Hudson will agree to accept such offer on behalf of the employees.
With respect to holidays or overtime rate on a holiday, the employee shall receive provisions of this Agreement or those of the other utility whichever provides the higher rate of pay to the employee except if an employee is covered under paragraph c above.
All other provisions and conditions, except as to rate, contained in this Agreement shall apply to such work except if an employee is covered under paragraph c above.
R.	Double time shall be paid fortime worked in excess of
16 consecutive hours, except as may otherwise be provided in Article lll-N hereof. (See 1973-67)
ARTICLE IV SENIORITY IN PROMOTION, TRANSFER, LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
A.	Length of continuous employment in the Company in
job classifications included tn Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. shall be known as “seniority” except as provided in Sections C and H of this Article; provided that if the period of continuous employment of any employee extends to a date prior to the establishment of this bargaining unit, such continuous prior employment in any capacity shall be included in that employee’s seniority.*
*See memorandum dated January 13, 1967 regarding former Ellenville Electric Company employees and memorandum dated August 16, 1990 regarding Saugerties Gas Company. (See +Exhibit 2)
12
Article IV (cont’d)
B.	1. Service shall be the length of continuous employment with the Company.
2.	On all promotions, seniority shall be applied as provided in this Article.
C.	The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to regular
employees. It shall not apply to temporary employees. Regular employees are engaged without time limitations. Temporary employees may be engaged for work only if it will not result in the layoff of regular employees, and if it is anticipated that the work will not continue for more than six months. If continued beyond six months, temporary employees shall become regular employees with seniority and service starting from the date of employment.
The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to the classifications of Customer Service Representative-Part-Time and to all job classifications included under the "Part-Time Agreement” by and between the Company and Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. except as follows: Seniority for all employees in such “part-time” classifications shall commence only when such employees are assigned to a classification covered by this Agreement or assigned to a classification covered by the TOC Agreement, and such seniority shall accrue only during the period when such employees are assigned to any classification covered by this Agreement or the TOC Full-time Agreement. Seniority for Customer Service Representatives -Part-Time shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the CSR - Part-Time Agreement which is part of the TOC Full-Time Agreement. The application of any Customer Service Representati ve Part-Time and any employee covered by such “part-time” classification, for any vacancy or new position in a classification covered by this Agreement which is posted, shall only be processed if no “full-time” applicant qualifies who is covered by this Agreement or said TOC Full-time Agreement.
D.	When an employee is to be transferred or demoted,
the Company agrees to confer in advance with the President and Business Manager of the Local Union or an alternate in his absence.
E.	When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is
created within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six working days setting forth the classification, job duties and requirements, hours and days of work, and wage rates. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting
Article IV (cont’d)
13
forth their qualifications. Employees who do not make application within the period of posting the notice shall have no right to consideration for the job. The Local Union shall be supplied with copies of the notice and applications. An employee who has qualified by exam, but has neither withdrawn from the posting nor elected a holding mark only (“HMO”) status, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of assignment will be considered as a return to a former position under Article IV F 6. In addition, any employee who has a holding mark, bids for a position and does not withdraw prior to being assigned to the position, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of such assignment will be considered as a return to a former position under Article IV F 6. The transfer to the new position will be effective within 30 calendar days after acceptance unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union. When the vacancy(s) has been filled for 10 working days the posting will be closed. (See Exhibit 24)
F.	1. The Company shall have the right to determine the classification of a job when it is posted and the minimum qualifications required for any job. Qualifications for any position within Local 320 shall be demonstrated by an examination. The Company shall select from the applicants the number that will take an exam. If no one qualifies, the Company will continue the examination until a qualified individual is selected or the bid list is exhausted. Such selection shall be made in order of seniority. In the event that more than one person receives a passing mark on such examination, seniority among the persons passing shall govern; if two or more employees who qualify for a posted job have equal seniority, length of service in the Company shall govern. If two or more employees of equal seniority and equal service pass an examination for promotion, the employee receiving the highest mark on the examination shall be entitled to the position; except that as between probationary employees the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
2.	The examination shall be prepared, given and graded by a committee composed of one representative of the Company and one representative of the Union; except that with respect to the selection of Working Foremen/Forewomen, Chiefs or Commercial Specialists, two examiners from the Company and two from the Union may be appointed. The representatives shall be appointed within six working days after expiration of the posting period. When a personal appraisal is required in connection with job promotion, two representatives of the Union and two representatives of the Company shall prepare and submit their appraisals. Such representatives of the Union for the purposes of this section shall be appointed by the President and
14 Article IV (cont’d)
Business Manager or other acting executive officer of the Union from individuals presently employed in the highest level of the occupation available. In the event that such representatives are unable to agree upon any question concerning the examination, the dispute shall be referred to the President of the Company whose decision shall be final. (See Exhibits 3 and +15)
3.	An employee who has passed an examination for any classification shall not be required to take another examination (other than physical) for the same classification within a period of sixty months after the employee has passed such examination, unless the employee’s mark has been voided as specifically provided in this agreement or unless, in the opinion of the Company, the employee’s ability to perform the work has changed or the job content has changed in the interval. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an employee’s mark for the aptitude portion of a Working Foreman/Forewoman, Chief or Commercial Specialist classification test would not expire at the end of such 60-month period, but would continue so long as such employee is in and remains in the series such employee is attempting to qualify for. However, an applicant wishing to be considered for a position must, regardless of previous qualifications, submit an application for a vacancy each time it is posted.
Applicants who have marked their bid form to indicate that they are applying for the posted position only for the purpose of achieving a holding mark only (“HMO”) status shall not be offered such position. Employees can change their election regarding their HMO status up to and including the day of the test or appraisal (whichever is later).
4.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Working Agreement, an employee who receives a mark of 60% or less on an examination for any classification shall not be eligible to take an examination for the same classification within a period of six months unless, in the opinion of the Company, there is a demonstrated need to waive this requirement. However, this sixmonth disqualification shall not apply to the senior applicant.
5.	The following selection and training procedures shall apply only to the following job classifications:
Protective Equipment Tester
Gas Production Man/Woman - Second Class
Stock Handler
General Maintenance Man/Woman - Second Class
Field Clerk/Storekeeper

a.	The selection of a candidate to train for the posted position will be made from those who apply through the use of a general ability examination on which the passing mark shall be 75%. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a higher pay group, the employee will be continued at the employee's present pay and will be trained for the position. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a lower pay group, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or stay at the employee’s existing rate of pay, whichever is lower.
b.	If the selection of a trainee is made from employees with more than six months’ service with the Company, the seniority provisions applicable to promotions shall apply. In the event the selection is made from employees with less than six months’ service, the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
c.	The Company will predetermine the length of time necessary for training in each classification below the posted classification and in the posted classification for which the individual is being trained and so notify the Union. Such training shall be of no less than three nor more than six months’ duration, except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the job specifications. The trainee’s classification will be increased as progress is demonstrated by passing an appropriate job knowledge examination(s) on which the passing grade shall be 75%. Upon completion of such predetermined training perlod(s), the trainee will be required to pass such job knowledge test before being assigned to the posted classification and the pay applicable thereto.
If the trainee does not qualify or meet the job requirements within a reasonable qualifying period, such trainee will be returned to the employee’s former classification or the employee’s training period may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Union President and Business Manager.
6.	If the employee selected does not qualify or meet the job requirements within a reasonable qualifying period, the employee will be returned to the employee’s former classification. The employee’s training period may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Union President and Business

Article IV (cont’d)
Manager. If the employee requests in writing to Human Resources to return to the employee’s former position within two weeks of the employee’s transfer, the employee will be reassigned within two weeks to the position from which the employee was transferred (and any person who is filling that position must also return to that person’s former position), and the next senior qualified bidder will be transferred to the vacancy. If on two separate occasions within a three-year period an employee elects to return to the employee’s former position after assignment to another position, the employee shall be ineligible to bid for any position for a period of twenty-four months (measured from the date of the second election to return to the employee’s former position). (See Exhibit 26 and 1987-24)
In addition, once during the 24-month period an employee may exercise his/her rights to laterally transfer within his/her job classification without, however, any 2-week returnable rights.
7.	In the event no employee passes the job knowledge examination for the vacant position and the classification is not included in the training program listed above, or if the classification is included in the training program but, in the opinion of the Company, the position must be filled before the training program can be completed, the Company in such cases reserves the right to bring in qualified persons from outside the Union. (See 1983-10B)
8.	All applicants outside the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit and the PT Bargaining Unit will be excluded from the foregoing examination procedures described in this Article until all applicable provisions with respect to selection are exhausted for members of such Units; however, persons from outside the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit and the PT Bargaining Unit may be included in the exam procedure by mutual agreement. This exclusion, however, shall not apply to the arrangement with respect to the transfer of disabled employees as set forth in Article IX.
9.	A job applicant’s final mark on the examination will be made available to the employee upon the employee’s specific request to the employee's supervisor; however, marks of other applicants will not be divulged. Furthermore, upon request of an employee, the supervisor, in the interest of employee selfbetterment, shall discuss an applicant's lack of specific job knowledge or aptitude as demonstrated by the examination with the applicant so that the applicant may have an opportunity to improve the applicant’s knowledge of a job for future opportunities which may arise.
Article IV (cont’d)
17
10.	In no event will the specific marks attained be given on individual parts of the examination or individual questions. The results as determined by the examiners shall be final.
G.	When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is
created in the first level of supervision outside of the T&D Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job duties and requirements and hours of work. When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is created in those unclassified positions other than first level supervision which the Company may reasonably expect can be filled by qualified personnel from within the T&D Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job details and requirements. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. Upon receipt of such application, the Human Resources division shall immediately forward to the qualified applicant the following information: rate of pay, job duties, hours of work and starting date. The provisions of Article X shall not apply to these promotions to the first level of unclassified positions. (See Exhibit 117)
H.	In the event it becomes necessary to reduce in rank
an employee from an unclassified position, any time within two years after the time of the employee’s promotion and provided the employee has continued to pay Union dues and assessments, the employee shall be returned to the T&D Bargaining Unit, if the employee was promoted from such Unit, and shall assume in it the employee’s seniority, plus seniority equivalent to the time accumulated in the unclassified position. If the employee cannot perform the work to which assigned, the employee’s assignment within a classification covered by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union. While in •the unclassified position, the employee shall have no bidding rights on other jobs within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit, or the PT Bargaining Unit; during such time, the employee may continue Union membership, but is not compelled to do so. If the employee was not promoted from the T&D Bargaining Unit, the employee shall not be included in it except by mutual agreement.
Any employee returned to the T&D Bargaining Unit from an unclassified position pursuant to this paragraph shall have such a return considered as a return to a former position under Article IV F 6 hereof.
18
Article IV (cont’d)
I.	New employees shall have no seniority for the first six
months of their employment During such period new employees will be considered probationary and the Company may dismiss them at any time without regard to the other provisions of this agreement. Employees transferring during the probationary period shall have their probationary period extended to six months from the date of transfer, unless the Company is satisfied that it has had the ability thoroughly to appraise an individual’s performance, in which event, the individual, if not to be dismissed as permitted in the prior sentence, will be transferred to regular status and no extension of the probationary period will be required. In no event shall such probationary period exceed a period of one year from date of employment.
J.	1. When it becomes necessary to select candidates for beginning jobs in the automatic progression series, an appropriate general ability examination will be given. Of those who pass such an examination, the candidate with the greatest amount of seniority in Locai 320 wiii be seiected. (See Exhibit 117)
2.	(Reserved)
3.	When the Company has a need at a particular headquarters for an additional employee(s) in a first-class classification in the automatic progression series, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards announcing such need and will consider requests from (1) those employees presently in the same first-class classification in a different headquarters who may want to laterally transfer, (2) those employees who were transferred pursuant to Article IX-D and who retain a first-class rating in such classification, and (3) those second-class and third-class employees presently in the same classification who request a lateral transfer; and any such transfer will be made according to seniority.
4.	When the Company desires to start an applicant in a job subject to automatic progression, the lowest job classification in the progression series shall be posted and the proposed headquarters shall be designated. At any time, or upon completion of the progression, the Company may assign those in the progression series to any headquarters within the T&D Bargaining Unit.
However, before assigning an employee to a headquarters at the first-class level, if no prior notice has been made as provided in Paragraph 3 above, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards stating the proposed headquarters and will consider requests as provided in Paragraph 3. (See 1981-M34, 1987+30, and 1987+M27)

5.	An employee who fails to qualify for promotion within the maximum time in grade stated for the particular classification will be reassigned to the classification, pay group and pay step from which such employee entered the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the craft in which such employee failed to qualify for a minimum of 60 months from the date of such failure, except that an employee who is entitled to an additional opportunity to qualify under Article IV J 6 hereof and who fails such additional opportunity shall have no such reentryright. This reentry-right after 60 months can be exercised once only for the craft in question. If there is no vacancy in the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.
6.	Employees who are on automatic progression at the second-class level and who fail to qualify for a first-class rating will be given one additional opportunity to qualify. The second qualifying examination will be given at the option of the Company any time between six months and one year following the first examination. If such employee fails the second time, such employee will be returned to the job classification, pay group and pay step which such employee held before entering the program and will be considered ineligible for future training in the craft in which such employee failed to qualify. If there is no vacancy in the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.
7.	A practical qualifying examination covering basic skills required for Linemen/Linewomen - Third Class, the content of which shall be subject to mutual agreement between the Company and the Union, will be given after the first nine months of third-class training.

Article IV (cont’d)
21
K.	An employee who is promoted or transferred shall be
given a reasonable qualifying period in which it shall be determined whether or not the employee can meet the job requirements. During this period the employee shall be instructed and trained in the job. An employee failing to meet the job requirements within this period shall be reassigned to the classification from which the employee was promoted or transferred and the employee’s exam mark will be voided. The foregoing provisions do not apply to job classifications in the automatic progression series.
L.	Employees will be laid off in reverse order of their
seniority when curtailment of activities makes a reduction of the working force necessary. If the employees to be laid off have equal seniority, they shall be laid off in the reverse order of their service with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph only, the term “employees” shall mean all Company employees represented by Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. (excluding those employees under the “part-time” contract) so that layoffs shall be so affected pursuant to a combined list of such employees. (See 1983-M29)
M.	Lists showing service and seniority shall be supplied
to the Union quarterly. The Union shall be given notice of the hiring of new employees within 10 days of their employment. (See 1979-48 and 1981-21)
N.	1. Employees who are laid off for lack of work and as of the date of layoff have completed one year or more of continuous service, shall be given an allowance of one week’s base pay for each full year of continuous service. If the employee accepts a separation allowance, the Company shall not be obliged to rehire such employee. Such separation allowance must be accepted or rejected, in writing within four weeks after the affected day of layoff. If such separation allowance is rejected, the employee’s rights to reemployment shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article IV-N 2.
2.	If after completion of the post and bid procedure additional employees are needed, employees who have not elected the separation allowance referred to in Article IV-N 1 hereof and who shall, within the applicable “recall” period noted below, by written notice, be offered a position on the basis of “last out - first in” in the classification to be filled:
22
Article IV (cont’d)
Years of Service	Period of Recall Right From Layoff Date
Less than 6 months	No recall
More than 6 months to 1 year	6 months
More than 1 year but less than 2 years	18 months
More than 2 years but less than 5 years	24 months
5 or more years	36 months
provided that each such laid-off employee meets the minimum qualifications, the physical condition of the laid-off employee is no worse than at the time of separation and such employee accepts such position by making a written acceptance to the Company within 14 days of either the employee’s written acknowledgment of receipt of the Company’s notice or the date which the U.S. postal authority indicates that it was unable to deliver such notice at the employee’s address last supplied to the Company by the employee. The Company’s notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such employees, at such employees’ latest mailing address supplied to the Company by the employee and a copy of such notice shall be supplied to Local 320. The employee’s acceptance shall also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Company’s Human Resources Department.
O.	1. Seniority shall accumulate during the period when an employee is temporarily in the military service, maritime service or merchant marine. When such employee returns from service, the employee shall be placed in the employee’s old classification.
2.	Should a promotion be made while an employee is temporarily in military service, maritime service or merchant marine for which the employee would have been eligible and to which such employee would have been entitled by reason of seniority if the employee had been working at the time, such employee shall, upon return from such service, be placed in the higher classification provided that the employee is able to perform the work and demonstrate qualifications by examination.
3.	In either of the above cases the employee with the least time in the classification that the veteran is eligible for shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came. If a surplus is thereby created in the lower classification, the provisions of Article IX, Section D shall be applied.
P.	1. The following shall apply to any returns or reassignment to a classification/position as permitted or required by Article IV thereof:
Article IV (cont’d) - Article V 23
a.	After the 30th day from the award of the winning bid for the sale/transfer of either of the Plants, no such return or reassignment shall be permitted or required if the result would be that the employee would return or be reassigned to the Production Plant Bargaining Unit.
b.	With respect to any such return or reassignment precluded by paragraphs a and c hereof, the employee shall be assigned to a classification within the T&D Bargaining Unit as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine; however, the employees’ wages shall not be less than the pay group and pay step of the classification from which such employee entered the position from which the employee is being assigned.
c.	In all other cases, transfers/assignments to and from the T&D Bargaining Unit shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Exhibit 117.
ARTICLE V

1 week 2 weeks
3 weeks

6 weeks
2.	Pay for each week of vacation shall be five days at the rate of eight hours of straight time. All vacations will be granted, so far as possible, in accordance with the desires of the employees in the order of their seniority. Any days in excess of ten may be taken within the normal vacation period only if operating conditions permit it; otherwise they must be taken outside of the normal vacation period. The normal vacation period shall be between May 1 and September 1. (See Exhibit *125)
3.	Employees may elect to take their vacations at any other time to suit their plans, provided that it is possible for them to do so without adversely affecting the operation of the Company’s business.
4.	Employees may in any year defer up to the equivalent of ten days of the vacation to which they are entitled and may use those days during any subsequent year. The time of taking such days shall be subject to the approval of the employee’s supervision and must be taken in units of not less than one day. The maximum accumulation shall be no more than ten days. A
Article VIII (cont’d)31 regularly scheduled vacation for any current year will in scheduling take precedence over a carry-over vacation proposed to be taken in that year. (See 1981-43)
B.	Should a holiday be observed while an employee is
on vacation, the employee shall be entitled to an additional day off with pay at the beginning or end of the employee’s vacation.

2.	Vacation schedules shall be established and posted on bulletin boards a reasonable time in advance of the normal vacation period. All changes or selections made after May 1 in any year will be made only with the approval of the employee’s supervisor and the agreement of any employee whose vacation is affected thereby.
3.	Full weeks of vacation shall take precedence over individual days of vacation for scheduling purposes.
D.	Employees shall be given, in advance, the pay due on the paydays falling within their vacation period if they so desire and apply.
E.	Any employee who leaves the Company for any reason shall be granted a vacation if taken before the date of separation or given vacation pay if the employee works up to the date of separation; provided, however, that an employee who resigns without giving the proper notice shall not be granted a vacation or given vacation pay. By “proper notice” is meant that the employee shall have informed the Company sufficiently in advance so that the employee shall work at least two weeks before the termination of the employee’s employment with the Company. The vacations granted in these cases shall, for regular employees with more than six months of continuous employment, be one day (eight hours) for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with five or more years of continuous employment shall be one and one-half days (twelve hours) for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with 15 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two days (sixteen hours) for each completed month of employment, for regular employees with 22 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two and one-half days (twenty hours) for each completed month of employment, and for regular employees with 30 years or more of continuous employment, shall be three days (twenty-four hours) for each completed month of
32 Article VIII (cont’d)
employment, starting in each case with the preceding July 1. If the employee elects to take a separation allowance, the employee shall not be entitled to vacation provisions in addition thereto. In no case shall an employee who leaves the Company’s employ be given a greater vacation allowance than the employee would have been entitled to had the employee remained with the Company through the ensuing vacation period.
F.	The Company will apply the following rule so long as
it is not abused:
In the event that an employee is or becomes ill prior to the employee’s scheduled vacation or is admitted to a legally constituted hospital during the employee’s scheduled vacation and it is determined that the illness or injury was in no way attributable to the employee’s reckless or willful action while on vacation, the period of the employee’s illness or hospital confinement, and any subsequent period of confinement to bed, will be processed in accordance with Section H of this Article. Any remaining vacation will be rescheduled in accordance with this Article. (See 1969-13)
G.	(Reserved)
H.	Payments for personal noncompensable disability
shall be made in accordance with the Disability Benefits Plan filed under the New York State Disability Law. (See Exhibit 82)

Payments beyond those above enumerated may be continued in the discretion of the Company. The Company reserves the right to have its own doctor check on claims of disability.
In no case shall the Company be obligated to pay any amounts for a disability with respect to which the employee is entitled to receive insurance proceeds covering lost wages as provided under Article XVIII (“No Fault”) of the Insurance Law of New York.
Article VIII (cont’d) 33
I.	1. Employees who are selected by their Local Union to serve as accredited delegates to conventions or similar meetings shall, after reasonable notice to the Company, be granted a leave of absence without pay for sufficient time for this purpose.
2.	An employee who is selected or appointed to serve as Business Manager for the Local Union shall after reasonable notice to the Company, be granted a leave of absence without pay during the employee’s term of office and shall continue to accumulate seniority throughout the leave of absence. Upon termination of the employee’s duties the employee shall be reinstated in the employee’s former position provided the employee is physically able to perform the work and it has not been eliminated.
If the position has been eliminated, or the employee is physically unable to perform the work, the employee shall, by agreement with the Union, be placed in a classification for which the employee is qualified, and the employee with the least seniority in that classification shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came. If a surplus is thereby created in the lower classification, the provisions of Article IX, Section D, shall be applied. The number of employees on leave of absence for this purpose shall not at any time exceed one unless increased by mutual agreement. (See Exhibit 111).
3.	Employees who have had at least six months of continuous service will be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than five working days, which need not be taken consecutively, because of the death of a father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, child, father-in-law or mother-in-law, and not more than three days because of the death of a grandparent or grandchild. (See 1971-55)
If an employee is on vacation and a death in the family occurs during such vacation, such allowable absence shall not be considered as vacation time.
4.	Regular employees who are members of the National
Guard or Reserve Corps will be allowed up to four weeks’ leave of absence without pay except as hereinafter provided for military duty. If such military duty is required of such members to maintain their status in the National Guard or Reserve Corps and such service is paid for by the Government, and the rate paid for such service is less than the employee’s normal daily compensation, the Company will pay the difference for each day while on military duty, but not in excess often days. (See 1971-60, Exhibit 47,1989-7B and 2003-17)
34
Article VIII (cont’d) - Article IX
5.	Employees serving on jury duty shall be given leave of absence for those days during their normal workweek when they are serving on jury duty. If the jury rate paid for jury service is less than the employee’s normal daily compensation, the Company will pay the difference. (See Exhibit 9 and 1981+M24)
6.	Employees who have had at least one year of continuous service will, with the consent of the Supervisor, be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than two working days in any year in the event of sickness in the family or for personal business of a nature that cannot be taken care of in other than normal working hours. Such time may be taken in increments of not less than two hours. Notification of the need for absence for this reason shall be given to the Supervisor as far in advance as possible. Such personal time, in whole or in part, shall not be used to extend the vacation period. (See 1969-44 and +Exhibit 40)
J.	A regular employee shall be granted a leave of
absence without pay after reasonable notice to the Company, provided that the conditions of work at the time are such that the employee’s services can be spared. Leaves of absence shall accumulate at the rate of one week for each full year of consecutive service with the Company subject to no limitation as to the aggregate weeks of leaves of absence which can be accumulated. Leaves of absence may be taken in whole or in part; provided, however, no employee during the employee’s employment career with the Company may take leaves of absence, which in the aggregate exceed the total leaves of absence accumulated during the employee’s working career with the Company. Leaves of absence taken prior to July 1,1977, will not be subtracted from an employee’s entitlement on and after July 1, 1977. During these leaves of absence, seniority shall accumulate. If an employee overstays such leave or if the employee accepts employment elsewhere during such leave without the consent of the Company, the employee’s employment with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated. If a leave of absence is extended by the Company, seniority shall continue to accumulate during such extended leave. (See 1975-16 and 1983-18)

2.	The Company shall have the right to transfer or reassign any employee during the term of this contract due to a layoff or lack of work situation, provided that the Company will not transfer or reassign such employee to a job classification which at the time of transfer has a greater rate of pay than the classification from which the employee is being transferred, excepting therefrom transfers or reassignments resulting in a greater rate of pay due to the operation of the provisions of Article IX-D 3. Any such transfer or reassignment may be made without regard to any provisions of this Agreement other than the provisions of this Article IX-D.
3.	Any transfer or reassignment under this Article IX-D shall be effected by the Company as set forth below and where such transfer or reassignment is to be made based upon consideration of seniority, health, ability, residence and other factors (“SHAROF”), the Company’s decision shall be final after review of such decision with the Union President and Business Manager or an alternate in his absence:
a.	The selection and placement of the employees to be transferred or reassigned from a non-automatic progression series classification shall be made by the Company on the basis of SHAROF. An employee transferred or reassigned pursuant to the provisions of such Article IX-D 3 a, shall be offered the classification from which the employee was transferred or reassigned if a vacancy arises in such classification and if such employee continues to be qualified and physically capable to fill such classification. Such classification shall be offered on the basis of seniority to those employees so transferred or reassigned.
36
Article IX (cont’d)
b.	1) The selection of employees to be transferred or reassigned from an automatic progression series classification shall be made (a) from the employees in the first-class level or higher solely on the basis of system-wide seniority where there are no second-class or third-class in progression below the first-class level, and (b) from the second-class or third-class in progression on the basis of SHAROF taking into account all such second-class or third-class and excluding employees in the first-class level or higher.
2)	An employee, other than an employee in the first-class level or higher, to be transferred or reassigned from an automatic progression series classification shall be returned to the job classification, pay group and pay step from which such employee entered the automatic progression series classification. And, in the event there is no vacancy in the classification to which such employee is transferred or reassigned, the Company shall have the right to make a further transfer or reassignment of any employee in that classification pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (b) or paragraph (a) above, whichever is then applicable.
An employee to be transferred from an automatic progression series in the first-class level or higher with less than ten years’ continuous employment with the Company shall be transferred or reassigned to such classification as the Company, in its sole discretion, shall determine. However, the employee’s wages shall not be less than the pay group and pay step of the classification from which such employee entered the automatic progression series.
An employee to be transferred from an automatic progression series in the first-class level or higher with ten or more years of continuous service with the Company shall be transferred or reassigned to such classification as the Company, in its sole discretion shall determine.

Article IX (cont’d)37
given a test to qualify for the next highest rating relating to such employee’s then current classification. Such test opportunity shall not result in any delay in implementing such employee's transfer or reassignment under this Article IX-D. If the employee fails to so qualify, the employee shall be ineligible for future training in that craft except if the failure to qualify is for the first-class rating and is not the employee’s second failure, the employee shall be eligible for future training in that craft and within six months to one year after reentry to that automatic progression classification, such employee shall be given a second qualifying test, failure of which shall result in the consequences set forth in Article IV J 6 hereof.
4)	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee to be transferred or reassigned from the second or third-class level in an automatic progression series classification under this Article IX-D 3 b, who had no prior classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, may be discharged.
4.	Any employee transferred or reassigned under this Article IX-D who at the time of such transfer or reassignment has been continuously in the employ of the Company for 10 years or more will not have a reduction in pay during the term of this Agreement by reason of such transfer or reassignment to a job below such employee’s pay group and such employee will be entitled to any general increases applicable to such employee’s retained pay group. All others so transferred or reassigned will be paid the rate of the job to which transferred or reassigned except as may otherwise be provided in this Article IX-D. (See Exhibit +43, 1981-11 and 1998-18)
5.	The provisions of this Article IX-D shall not apply to employees transferred or reassigned because of physical disability.

An employee whose rate of compensation is affected by the provisions of the disability clause will receive one-half of the general increase for the employee’s compensation each year of the contract until the rate for that job equals the employee’s then pay. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any employee, who becomes disabled and is transferred to a job carrying a lower rate of pay under this Article IX E will receive 100% of any general wage increase placed in effect on and after the date when such employee has completed 30 years of continuous service with the Company. (See 1983-M6C and 1985-37)

If any such observed holiday falls on a shift or special schedule worker’s first regularly scheduled day off, the day previous to the employee’s first day off shall be treated as the holiday; and if it falls on the employee’s second regularly scheduled day off, the day following will be treated as the holiday except that if any observed holiday falls on a regularly scheduled day off, such holiday or holidays shall be observed pursuant to the Chart(s) set forth either as an attachment or immediately preceding any index to this agreement.
Two floating holidays will be granted to be taken during each calendar year. These holidays will be granted if the employee was employed on or before October 1 of such calendar year and notification is given to the employee’s supervisor not
Article III (cont’d)
53
less than five working days in advance of such holiday, provided, however, any such holiday cannot be taken on a workday which either coincides with, precedes or follows a holiday referred to in this Article III E and further provided such two floating holidays cannot be taken consecutively.

qualified employees if they are available, having regard, however, to the special type of work to be performed during such overtime. (See *Exhibit 53)
I.	Employees who have worked overtime shall not be

54
Article III (cont’d)
J.	An employee required to work 16 or more consecutive
hours shall be allowed a rest period of 8 hours after the termination of said work. If the rest period runs into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday within the basic workweek, such employee shall not lose pay by reason thereof. If the employee does continue working after 16 or more consecutive hours and the period of work extends into the beginning of the regularly scheduled basic workday the employee shall receive pay at time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off. An employee who works overtime between the seventh and fourth hours preceding the commencement of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period, if such overtime is not part of a period of 16 or more consecutive hours of work, shall be entitled to time off at the beginning of the employee’s next regularly scheduled basic work period without loss of pay equivalent to the number of overtime hours actually worked during the 7 hours immediately preceding the commencement of such basic work period. An employee who becomes entitled to time off under the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence may work the balance of the remaining hours of the employee’s basic work period at the beginning of the next scheduled basic work period. However, the Company may request the employee to waive the time off to which the employee is entitled under this paragraph and to continue working. If the employee does continue working pursuant to such request, the employee shall receive pay at double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee’s basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.
K.	1. An employee who Is called out to work shall be paid for a minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate except that if such call-out occurs ninety minutes or less prior to the beginning of the employee’s basic workday or scheduled work period, the employee shall be paid for a minimum of two hours’ time at the applicable rate. If an employee who has worked 16 or more hours consecutively and thus becomes entitled to sleep time is asked to report for work again before the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday, the hours actually worked prior to the commencement of the employee’s next basic workday shall be added to the hours of sleep time to which the employee is entitled. (See 1971-3)
2. An employee who is scheduled to report to work outside of the employee’s regularly scheduled basic workday or basic workweek shall be paid fora minimum of three hours’ time at the applicable rate with the exception that if such work is
Article III (cont’d)55 immediately before or after the basic workday within the basic workweek such employee shall be paid at the applicable rate only for the actual time worked. If the Company decides it does not want the employee to work as scheduled, no payment shall be made if the notice of such decision not to work is given before the employee leaves work on the basic workday within the basic workweek immediately preceding the day on which the job was to have been done.
L.	No employee shall be requested or required at any
time to be on call or to stand by except when such employee is paid at the applicable rate.
M.	Shift schedules, including schedules for special
schedule employees, shall be posted four weeks in advance. Shift schedules may be changed as required. However, if a shift or special schedule employee’s posted schedule is changed so that the employee is required to begin work on the revised schedule with less than forty-eight hours' notice, in the case of shift workers or, in the case of special schedule workers, either twenty-four hours’ notice if the reason making the notice necessary is within the Company’s control or twelve hours’ noticejf the reason making the notice necessary is outside the Company’s control, in advance of the new starting time, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. However, where a shift worker’s shift is changed to start on an employee’s third consecutive day off and notice of change is given less than 72 hours in advance, the employee shall be paid one and one-half times the applicable rate for the first shift of the revised schedule. Premium payment for a change of schedule without sufficient notice will not be paid to an employee who is absent from work on the scheduled day for which such premium would have been payable.
If a shift employee is required to work two consecutive shifts for which the employee would normally be paid straight time, the employee shall receive an additional four hours’ pay at straight time.
Shift employees may exchange workdays or hours within a scheduled workweek provided forty-eight hours* written notice is given to their supervisor and provided that such exchange will not result in premium payment. This section shall not apply to employees occasionally assigned to chauffeur duty, while so assigned.

Article III (cont’d)
N.	Shift and special schedule employees, the majority of
whose regular scheduled basic workday hours in any workday occur within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m., shall be paid a night differential of $1.20 per hour effective May 1, 2003, and effective May 1, 2004, $1.25 per hour and effective May 1, 2005, $1.30 per hour and effective May 1, 2006, $1.40 per hour and effective May 1, 2007, $1,50 per hour for the total basic hours worked. However, when the basic hours worked in any workday are less than the majority of total hours worked then the night differential shall be paid only for those basic hours worked within the period from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. The night differential shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid. (See 1969-7)
O.	Employees who at the request of the Company are
sent outside of the territory of the Company to work on the property of another utility shall receive their regular rate of pay from the Company or the rate paid by the utility on whose property they are working in the nearest comparable classification, whichever of these two rates is the higher. However, if such utility has a pay practice that would pay their employees double time for all hours worked while assigned to any mutual aid on Central Hudson’s property, then Central Hudson will adopt a similar pay practice for such assignment to mutual aid on the property of such utility. The double time pay provisions shall be administered as follows:
a.	An employee will be paid double time from the time Central Hudson begins billing the requesting company for the employee’s services.
b.	The double time will cease when Central Hudson stops billing the requesting company for the employee’s services.
c.	All other pay provisions except for pay on a recognized holiday shall be suspended during the time such employee is being paid double time in accordance with this section O. The maximum pay rate on a recognized holiday shall be double time plus straight time regardless of the other company’s holiday pay provisions.
d.	If a company does not have a pay practice that would pay their employees double time for all hours while assigned to mutual aid on Central Hudson’s property and offers to pay Central Hudson employees at the double time rate while assigned to their property through notification to the Central Hudson Human Resource department, Central Hudson will agree to accept such offer on behalf of the employees.
Article 111 (conf d) - Article IV

With respect to holidays or overtime rate on a holiday, the employee shall receive provisions of this Agreement or those of the other utility whichever provides the higher rate of pay to the employee except if an employee is covered under paragraph c above.
All other provisions and conditions, except as to rate, contained in this Agreement shall apply to such work except if an employee is covered under paragraph c above.
P.	Double time shall be paid for time worked in excess of
16 consecutive hours, except as may otherwise be provided in Article lll-J hereof. (See 1973-67)

SENIORITY IN PROMOTION, TRANSFER, LAYOFF AND REEMPLOYMENT
A.	Length of continuous employment in the Company in
job classifications included in Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.l.O. shall be known as “seniority” except as provided in Section B of this Article; provided that if the period of continuous employment of any employee extends to a date prior to the establishment of this bargaining unit, such continuous prior employment in any capacity shall be included in that employee’s seniority. (See *Exhibit 2)
Service shall be the length of continuous employment with the Company,
B.	The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to regular
employees. It shall not apply to seasonal employees or, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, to employees previously employed by the Company, and in the services of the United States, who return to work. Regular employees are engaged without time limitations. Seasonal employees may be engaged for work only if it will not result in the layoff of regular employees and if it is anticipated the work will not continue for more than six months. If the work continues more than six months, the job will be filled in accordance with the procedures specified in Section D of this Article IV.
The provisions of this Article IV shall apply to the classifications of Customer Service Representative-Part-time and to all job classifications included under the “Part-time Agreement"
58
Article IV (cont’d)
by and between the Company and Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers AFL-CIO except as follows: Seniority for all employees in such “part-time” classifications shall commence only when such employees are assigned to a classification covered by this Agreement or assigned to a classification covered by the T&D Agreement, and such seniority shall accrue only during the period when such employees are assigned to any classification covered by this Agreement or the T&D Agreement. Seniority for Customer Service Representatives-Part-Time shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the CSR-Part-Time Agreement. The application of any Customer Service Representative-Part-Time and any employee covered by such “part-time” classification for any vacancy or new position in a classification covered by this Agreement which is posted, shall only be processed if no “full-time” applicant qualifies who is covered by this Agreement or the T&D Agreement. (See ‘Exhibit 54)
C.	When an employee is to be temporarily or
permanently transferred within the employee’s classification, or demoted, the Company agrees to confer in advance with the President and Business Manager of the Local or an alternate in his absence, and in selecting the person to be transferred shall give consideration to seniority, health, ability, residence, individual preferences of employees and similar considerations; however, the Company’s decision as to who shall be transferred shall be final.
Where a vacancy exists which is to be filled by posting, no transfer to that vacancy will be made prior to such posting at the request of, or solely for the convenience of, any employee. Nothing herein shall derogate from the right of the Company to make transfers in good faith under the provisions of the preceding paragraph.
D.	When vacancies occur or when new positions are
created within the TOC Bargaining Unit the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six working days, setting forth the classification, job duties and requirements, hours and days of work, and wage rate of said vacancies, and whether the job to be filled is a vacancy or a new position. Where the Company knows the number of such vacancies or new positions, it shall state such number in the posting; but if the number is indefinite, the Company shall state that “one or more” vacancies or positions are open. The transfer to the new position will be effective within 30 calendar days after acceptance unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union; but this provision shall not apply to examinations to qualify for future
Article IV (cont’d)
59
vacancies. When the vacancy(s) has been filled for 10 working days the posting shall be closed. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. Employees who do not make application within the period of posting of the notice shall have no right to consideration for the job. The Union shall be supplied with copies of the notices. (See Exhibit 24, ‘Exhibit 86 and 1981*27)
E.	1. The Company shall have the right to determine the classification of a job when it is posted and the minimum qualifications required for any job. Qualifications for any position within the bargaining unit shall be demonstrated by an examination. In the event that more than one person receives a passing mark on such examination, seniority among the persons passing shall govern. If two or more employees who qualify for a posted job have equal seniority, length of service in the Company shall govern. If two or more employees of equal seniority and equal service pass an examination for promotion, the employee receiving the highest mark on the examination shall be entitled to the position, except that as between probationary employees the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
T O
C
2.	The examination shall be prepared, given and graded by a committee composed of one representative of the Company and one representative of the Union; except with respect to the selection of Chief, two examiners from the Company and two from the Union may be appointed. The examination for Customer Service Representative - E.H., Customer Service Representative (3/C, 2/C and 1/C) and the examination for Customer Service Representative - Part-time (3/C, 2/C and 1/C) shall, in addition, require a personal appraisal on which the passing grade shall be 75%. When a personal appraisal is required in connection with job promotion, two representatives of the Union and two representatives of the Company shall prepare and submit their appraisals. Such representatives of the Union shall be appointed by the President and Business Manager or other acting executive officer of the Union. In the event that such representatives are unable to agree upon any question concerning the examination including time, place and content, the dispute shall be referred to the President of the Company whose decision shall be final. (See Exhibits and 2003-74)
3.	An employee who has passed an examination for any classification, shall not be required to take another examination (other than physical) for the same classification within a period of sixty months, unless the employee’s mark has been voided as specifically provided in this agreement or unless, in the opinion of
60
Article IV (cont’d)
the Company the employee’s ability to perform the work has changed or the job content has changed in the interval. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an employee’s mark for the aptitude portion of a Chief classification test would not expire at the end of such 60-month period, but would continue so long as such employee is in and remains in the series such employee is attempting to qualify for. However, an applicant wishing to be considered for a position must, regardless of previous qualifications, submit an application for a vacancy each time it is posted. (See Exhibit 3 and 1973*35)
Applicants who have marked their bid form to indicate that they are applying for the posted position only for the purpose of achieving a holding mark only (“HMO") status shall not be offered such position. Employees can change their election regarding their HMO status up to and including the day of the test or appraisal (whichever is later).
4.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Working Agreement, an employee who receives a mark of 60% or less on an examination for any classification shall not be eligible to take an examination for the same classification within a period of six months unless, in the opinion of the Company, there is a demonstrated need to waive this requirement. However, this sixmonth disqualification shall not apply to the senior applicant.
5.	(Reserved)
6.	The Company and Union agree individuals assigned
to Maintenance Worker 1/C and Maintenance Worker 2/C through the post and bid procedure shall be assigned through a jointly agreed to, and administered aptitude examination.

Chauffeur-Mechanic
District Courier
Telephone Representative Interdistrict Courier
Record Control Clerk

Stationery Storekeeper/Courier
Article IV (cont’d)
61
a.	The selection of a candidate to train for the posted position will be made from those who apply through the use of a general ability examination on which the passing mark shall be 75%. If the applicant fortraining is transferring to a job in a higher pay group, the employee will be continued at the employee’s present pay and will be trained for the position. If the applicant for training is transferring to a job in a lower pay group, the employee shall go to the highest pay step of the lower pay group or stay at the employee’s existing rate of pay, whichever is lower. Examinations for customer contact positions shall in addition require a personal appraisal on which the passing grade shall be 75%.
T O c
b.	If the selection of a trainee is made from employees with more than six months’ service with the Company, the seniority provisions applicable to promotions shall apply. In the event the selection is made from employees with less than six months’ service, the selection will be made based on service from those who qualify by examination.
c.	The Company will predetermine the length of time necessary for training in each classification below the posted classification and in the posted classification for which the individual is being trained and so notify the Union. Such training shall be of no less than three nor more than six months’ duration, except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the job specifications. The trainee’s classification will be increased as progress is demonstrated by passing an appropriate job knowledge examination(s) on which the passing grade shall be 75%. Upon completion of such predetermined training period(s), the trainee will be required to pass such job knowledge test before being assigned to the posted classification and the pay applicable thereto.
If the trainee does not qualify or meet the job requirements within a reasonable qualifying period, such trainee will be returned to the employee’s former classification or the employee’s training period may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Union President and Business Manager.
d.	If in the opinion of the Company the position must be filled before training can be completed, the Company reserves the right to bring in qualified persons from outside Local 320.

Article IV (cont’d)
9.	In the event no employee passes the examination(s) for a posted position, the Company, in such cases reserves the right to bring in qualified persons from outside Local 320. (See 1983-10B)
10.	If the successful applicant for any position within the TOC Bargaining Unit desires to return to the employee’s former position, the employee must within two weeks after the employee’s assignment to the new position forward the employee’s request in writing to Human Resources through the employee’s supervisor. The employee will be reassigned within two weeks to the position from which the employee was transferred (and any person who is filling that position must also return to the employee’s former position), and the next senior qualified bidder will be transferred to the vacancy. If on two separate occasions within a three-year period an employee elects to return to the employee’s former position after assignment to another position, the employee shall be ineligible for a period of twenty-four months (measured from the date of the second election to return to the employee’s former position) to bid for any position within the classification within the work group designated in the posting applicable to the position from which the employee returned. An employee who has qualified by exam, but has neither withdrawn from the posting nor elected a holding mark only (“HMO”) status, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of assignment would be considered as a return to a former position under this paragraph. In addition, any employee who has a holding mark, bids for a position and does not withdraw prior to being assigned to the position, may be assigned to the position and any refusal at the time of such assignment will be considered as a return to a former position under this paragraph. (See Exhibit 26 and 1987-24)
11.	All applicants outside the TOC Bargaining Unit, the T&D Bargaining Unit and the PT Bargaining Unit will be excluded from the foregoing examination procedures described in this Article until all applicable provisions with respect to selection are exhausted for members of such Units; however, persons from outside the TOC Bargaining Unit, the T&D Bargaining Unit, and the PT Bargaining Unit may be included in the exam procedure by mutual agreement. This exclusion, however, shall not apply to the arrangement with respect to the transfer of disabled employees as set forth in Article IX.
12.	A job applicant’s final mark on the examination will be made available to the employee upon specific request to the employee’s supervisor; however, marks of other applicants will not be divulged. Furthermore, upon request of the employee, the
Article IV (cont’d)
63
supervisor, in the interest of employee self-betterment, shall discuss such employee’s lack of specific job knowledge or aptitude as demonstrated by the examination with the employee so that the employee may have an opportunity to improve the employee’s knowledge of the job for future opportunities which may arise. (See 1981*25)
13.	In no event will the specific marks attained on individual tests or questions be given. The results as determined by the examiners shall be final.
F.	When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is
created in the first level of supervision outside of the TOC Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job duties and requirements and hours of work. When a vacancy occurs or when a new position is created in those unclassified positions other than first level supervision which the Company may reasonably expect can be filled by qualified personnel from within the TOC Bargaining Unit, unless the vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company shall post a notice on its bulletin boards for a period of six days setting forth the job details and requirements. When such a vacancy is to be filled by the transfer of an unclassified employee, the Company will notify the Union in advance of filling such vacancy. Additional information with respect to job requirements and rate of pay may be obtained from Human Resources. Employees desiring to be considered shall make application to Human Resources setting forth their qualifications. The foregoing provisions shall not apply to positions which the Company feels must be filled by employing college graduates from outside the Company. When a vacancy for Procedures Analyst occurs which is not to be posted, the Company will notify the Union in advance of filling such vacancy. The provisions of Article X shall not apply to these promotions. (See Exhibit 117)
T O C
G.	In the event it becomes necessary to reduce in rank
an employee from an unclassified position, any time within two years after the time of promotion and provided the employee has continued to pay Union dues and assessments, the employee shall be returned to the classification within the TOC Bargaining Unit if the employee was promoted from such Unit and shall assume in it the employee’s seniority, plus seniority equivalent to the time accumulated in the unclassified position. If the employee cannot perform the work to which assigned, the employee's assignment within a classification covered by this agreement shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union. While in
64 Article IV (cont’d)
the unclassified position, the employee shall have no bidding rights on other jobs within the T&D Bargaining Unit, the TOC Bargaining Unit or the PT Bargaining Unit; during such time, the employee may continue Union membership, but is not compelled to do so. If the employee was not promoted from the TOC Bargaining Unit, the employee shall not be included in it except by mutual agreement.
Any employee returned to the TOC Bargaining Unit from an unclassified position pursuant to this paragraph shall have such a return considered as a return to a former position under Article IV E 10 hereof.
H.	New employees shall have no seniority for the first six
months of their employment. During such periods new employees will be considered probationary and the Company may dismiss them at any time without regard to the other provisions of this agreement. This probationary period shall notextend beyond six months unless the Company and the Union agree that the circumstances of the case warrant an extension.
I.	An employee who is promoted or transferred shall be
given a reasonable qualifying period in which it shall be determined whether or not such employee can meet the job requirements. During this period such employee shall be instructed and trained in the job. An employee failing to meet the job requirements within this period shall be reassigned to the classification from which such employee was promoted or transferred and the employee’s exam mark will be voided. The foregoing provisions do not apply to classifications in the automatic progression series.
J.	Employees will be laid off in reverse order of their
seniority when curtailment of activities makes a reduction of the working force necessary. If the employees to be laid off have equal seniority, they shall be laid off in the reverse order of their service with the Company. For purposes of this paragraph only, the term “employees” shall mean all Company employees represented by Local 320 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers A.F. of L.-C.I.O. (excluding those employees under the “part-time” contract) so that layoffs shall be so affected pursuant to a combined list of such employees. (See 1983-M29)
Article IV (cont’d)65
K.	Lists showing service and seniority shall be supplied
to the Union quarterly. The Union shall be given notice of the hiring of new employees within 10 days of their employment. (See 1979-48 and 1981-21)
L.	1. Employees who are laid off for lack of work and as of the date of layoff have completed one year or more of continuous service, shall be given an allowance of one week’s base pay for each full year of continuous service. If the employee accepts a separation allowance, the Company shall not be obliged to rehire such employee. Such separation allowance must be accepted or rejected in writing within four weeks after the effective day of layoff. If such separation allowance is rejected, the employee’s rights to re-employment shall be governed solely by the provisions of Article IV-L 2.
2.	If after completion of the post and bid procedure additional employees are needed, employees who have not elected the separation allowance referred to in Article IV-L 1 hereof and who shall, within the applicable “recall” period noted below, by written notice, be offered a position on the basis of “last out, first in” in the classification to be filled:
Period of Recall Right
Years of Service	From Layoff Date
Less than 6 months	No recall
More than 6 months to 1 year	6 months
More than 1 year but less than 2 years	18 months
More than 2 years but less than 5 years 24 months 5 or more years	36 months
provided that each such laid-off employee meets the minimum qualifications, the physical condition of the laid-off employee is no worse than at the time of separation and such employee accepts such position by making a written acceptance to the Company within 14 days of either the employee’s written acknowledgment of receipt of the Company’s notice or the date which the U.S. postal authority indicates that it was unable to deliver such notice at the employee’s address last supplied to the Company by the employee. The Company’s notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such employees, at such employees’ latest mailing address supplied to the Company by the employee and a copy of such notice shall be supplied to Local 320. The employee’s acceptance shall also be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Company’s Human Resources Department.
66 Article IV (cont’d)
M.	1. Seniority shall accumulate during the period when an employee is temporarily in the military service, maritime service or merchant marine.
2.	Should a promotion be made while an employee is temporarily in military service, maritime service or merchant marine to which such employee would have been entitled if working at the time, such employee shall, upon return from such service, be placed in the higher classification provided that such employee is able to perform the work, and the employee with the least seniority in that classification shall be returned to the lower classification from which the employee came. If a surplus is thereby created in the lower classification, the provisions of Article IX, Section D shall be applied.
N.	1 ■ When it becomes necessary to select candidates for beginning jobs in the automatic progression series an appropriate general ability examination will be given. Of those who pass such an examination, the candidate with the greatest amount of continuous seniority in Local 320 will be selected. (See Exhibit
2.	When the Company has a need at a particular headquarters for additional employee(s) in a first-class classification in the automatic progression series, the Company will place a notice on its bulletin boards announcing such need and will consider requests from (1) those employees presently in the same first-class classification in a different headquarters who may want to laterally transfer, (2) those employees who were transferred pursuant to Article iX-D and who retain a first-class rating in such classification, and (3) those second-class and third-class employees presently in the same classification who request a lateral transfer; and any such transfer will be made according to seniority.

At any time, or upon completion of the progression, the Company may assign those in the progression series to any headquarters within the TOC Bargaining Unit. (See 1987*56)
However, before assigning an employee to a headquarters at the first-class level, if no prior notice has been made as provided in Paragraph 2 above, the Company will place a

This reentry-right after 60 months can be exercised once only for the craft in question. If there is no vacancy in the classification, pay group and pay step to which such employee is reassigned, the Company shall reassign an employee within that classification pursuant to the provisions of Article IX-D 3 hereof. However, if the employee who fails the test had no such classification because such employee was hired directly into the automatic progression series, such employee may be discharged.

Vacation schedules shall be established a reasonable time in advance of the normal vacation period. On selections made before May 1 in any year, service shall govern the choice of vacations except where operating conditions do not permit such selection. All changes or selections made after May 1 in any year will be made only with the approval of the employee’s supervisor and the agreement of any employee whose vacation is affected thereby. Employees whose basic workweek consists of less than forty (40) hours will receive such proportion of the vacation pay above specified as the number of their regularly scheduled hours of work in each week bears to 40 hours. Full weeks of vacation shall take precedence over individual days of vacation for scheduling purposes.
Employees may in any year defer up to the equivalent of ten days of the vacation to which they are entitled and may use those days during any subsequent year. The time of taking such days shall be subject to the approval of the employee’s supervision and must be taken in units of not less than one day.

106
Article VIII (cont’d)
In the event that an employee is or becomes ill prior to the employee’s scheduled vacation or is admitted to a legally constituted hospital during the employee’s scheduled vacation and it is determined that the illness or injury was in no way attributable to the employee’s reckless or willful action while on vacation, the period of the employee’s illness or hospital confinement, and any subsequent period of confinement to bed, will be processed in accordance with Section H of this Article. Any remaining vacation will be rescheduled in accordance with this Article. (See 1969-13)
C.	For Group A employees whose basic workday
consists of less than eight hours per day, in any week in which one or more days are not worked because of vacation or jury duty, overtime shall commence after the employee has worked time in excess of eight hours per day, counting as worked for this purpose the hours regularly scheduled on the vacation days and on any holiday occurring during said week.
D.	Except for the third, fourth or fifth week of vacations,
vacations will normally be taken within a single period. If an employee desires to separate vacation into periods of not less than one day, application should be made to the Division Manager, and the request will be approved where schedules permit. The normal vacation period shall be between May 1 and September 1, but employees may elect to take their vacations at any other time to.suit their plans provided it is possible for them to do so without adversely affecting the operation of the Company’s business.
E.	Employees shall be given in advance the pay due on
paydays falling within their vacation period if they so desire and apply.
F.	An employee who leaves the Company for any reason
shall be granted a vacation if taken before the day of separation or given vacation pay if such employee works up to the date of separation; provided, however, that an employee who resigns without giving the proper notice shall not be granted a vacation or given vacation pay. The vacations granted in these cases shall, for regular employees whose basic workweek consists of forty (40) hours and who have more than six months of continuous employment, be one day with pay (eight hours) for each completed month of employment, for such employees who have five or more years of continuous employment shall be one and one-half days (twelve hours) for each completed month of employment, for such employees with 15 years or more of continuous employment, shall
Article VIII (cont’d)
107
be two days (sixteen hours) for each completed month of employment, for such employees with 22 years or more of continuous employment, shall be two and one-half days (twenty hours) for each completed month of employment, and for employees with 30 years or more of continuous employment, shall be three days (twenty-four hours) for each completed month of employment, starting in each case with the preceding July 1. Employees whose basic workweek consists of less than forty (40) hours shall receive prorated pay based on their regular weekly hours of work.
By “proper notice” is meant that the employee shall have informed the Company sufficiently in advance so that such employee shall work at least two weeks before the termination of service with the Company. An employee who elects to take a separation allowance shall not be entitled to vacation provision in addition thereto. In no case shall an employee who leaves the Company’s employ be given a greater vacation allowance than the employee would have been entitled to had the employee remained with the Company through the ensuing vacation period.
G.	Group B employees include all employees covered by
this unit in job classification numbers 138.6 and 139.1. Group A employees shall include all other part-time employees covered by this unit.

shall be made in accordance with the Disability Benefits Plan filed under the New York State Disability Law. (See Exhibit 82)

Notification of intended absence for this reason shall be given to the Supervisor as far in advance as possible. Such personal time, in whole or in part, shall not be used to extend the vacation period. Each of such five working days may be taken in increments of not less than two hours.
2.	Employees who have had at least six months of
continuous service will be permitted to be absent without loss of pay for not more than five working days, which need not be taken consecutively, because of the death of a father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, child, father-in-law or mother-in-law, and not more than three days because of the death of a grandparent or grandchild.

consecutive service with the Company subject to no limitation as to the aggregate weeks of leaves of absence which can be accumulated. Leaves of absence maybe taken in whole or in part; provided, however, no employee during the employee’s employment career with the Company may take leaves of absence which in the aggregate exceed the total leaves of absence accumulated during the employee’s working career with the Company. Leaves of absence taken prior to July 1,1977, will not be subtracted from an employee’s entitlement on and after July 1, 1977. During these leaves of absence, service shall accumulate. If an employee overstays such leave or if the employee accepts employment elsewhere during such leave without the consent of the Company, the employee’s employment with the Company shall be deemed to have terminated. If leave of absence is extended by the Company, service shall continue to accumulate during such extended leave. (See 1975-16 and 1963-18)

An employee whose rate of compensation is affected by the provisions of the disability clause will receive one-half of the general increase for the employee’s compensation each year of
Article IX (cont’d) - Article X 111

Re: Selection of Working Foremen/Forewomen, Chief or Commercial Specialists
The selection program shall consist of three parts:
Exhibit 3 (Cont’d)
149
I.	“Job Know How” Examination designed to measure an applicant's knowledge of the job for which the employee is attempting to qualify and/or the employee’s demonstrated ability to perform all phases of such work. This examination shall be prepared by the Company and the Union examiners and will consist of questions which may require either written answers and/or a demonstration of the applicant's ability to perform the work. The examiners will assign a point value to each question according to agreed importance.
II.	Supervisory Aptitude Tests which are designed to measure the applicant's ability to effectively get work done through the efforts of the people he/she supervises. Tests for this portion of the program will vary according to the type of job for which the applicant is being considered and may include tests such as the following:
( a) General Intelligence
( b ) Match Comprehension
( c ) Practical Judgment
( d ) Supervisory Knowledge
( e ) Reading Comprehension
( f) Safety Knowledge
Examiners will agree upon the characteristics to be measured, the tests to be used, and the point value to be assigned to each test.
III. Applicant Appraisal is designed to appraise certain qualities which cannot be measured by tests or examinations, such as: attitude, expression, initiative, organization and planning, interest, and so forth. The examiners will agree on the number of appraisals to be used and will designate the persons to complete them. An equal number will be prepared by the Company and the Union Representatives and the average of all appraisals will be used in determining the final score. A point value will be placed on the degree each characteristic is measured and an agreed passing grade determined before the applicant is appraised.
An applicant must have had at least three years’ experience as a first-class employee in the craft for which such employee is attempting to qualify as a Working Foreman/Forewoman, Chief, or Commercial Specialist. However, if an applicant who does not have such three years’ experience qualifies by examination, the senior employee of those who do qualify will be selected.
150
Exhibit 3 (Cont’d)
In order to qualify for a Working Foreman/Forewoman, Chief, or Commercial Specialist's position, an applicant must receive a passing grade in all three parts of the selection program.

Memorandum of Understanding Re: Changes Concerning Examinations for Promotions
Use of Reference Books
It is agreed reference books and/or standards normally used in day-to-day work may be used during examinations. However, such reference materials must be approved and furnished by the examiners. The decisions of the examiners with respect to such reference books shall be final.
Written vs. Practical Questions
In preparing examinations, examiners will give consideration to the use of demonstrations vs. “paper and pencil” tests, when appropriate, in order to best measure the applicants’ abilities.
“Paper Work” Questions
It was agreed that questions concerning paper work such as preparation of time sheets and material requisitions will not be included in examinations for jobs where in practice such paper work is not a part of the job. The use of “paper work” questions shall be left to the judgment of the examiners.
Examinations for Working Foreman/Forewoman
As an exception to the Working Agreement with respect to the number of examiners, the Company and Local 320 may by mutual agreement appoint an additional qualified examiner from both the Company and Local 320 to assist in the administration of an examination for the selection of Working Foreman/Forewoman.
* Exhibit 4 (Cont’d)151
Time Limitations
Every effort shall be made to hold the length of an examination within reasonable time limits. It is further agreed that Human Resources will review examinations to insure time limits are reasonable and consistent for the type and complexity of the position being filled.
Instructions for Examiners
The attached instructions will be sent to each examiner prior to the preparation of an examination.
Instructions for Examiners
Introduction
The basis for promotion of employees under our Working Agreements is an examination jointly prepared by examiners appointed to represent the Union and the Company and designed to measure an employee’s ability to do the work for which such employee is attempting to qualify. It is, therefore, most important that the examiners know their responsibilities and duties in order to carry out the wishes and intent of the Company and the Union as set forth in the Working Agreement.
Preparing the Examination
(1)	During the preparation ofthe examination, examiners may jointly review previous examinations given for the job. Although the same format does not necessarily have to be followed, it may be helpful in maintaining consistency in both content and form. Copies of prior examinations may be obtained through Human Resources.
(2)	Questions used must relate to the job for which applicants are attempting to qualify and should measure an applicant's ability to handle the job efficiently and safely. Questions should be clearly stated.
(3)	Passing grades, point values, and a general understanding with respect to correct answers should be agreed upon before the examination is given.
(4)	After an agreement is reached, a signed copy of the examination must be forwarded to Human Resources where it will be reviewed for consistency and to see that it is in keeping with the provisions and intent of the Working Agreement.
152
Exhibit 4 (Cont’d)
After such review, if any changes are recommended, the copy will be returned to the examiners for their further consideration. If changes are made by the examiners, a revised, approved copy will be sent to Human Resources for file. If there are no changes recommended, the initial approved copy will be retained in Human Resources’ files.
Administering the Examination
(1)	Arrangements for giving the examination should be made by the department or division where the vacancy exists with the concurrence of the examiners. This includes time, place and notification of applicants.
(2)	Prior to the examination, arrangements should be made for pencils, paper, reference materials (if needed) and demonstration equipment (if used), etc.
(3)	The examiners shall decide who is to give instruction to the applicants. Instructions which should be given to the entire group should be clearly stated and include such items as:
(	a ) Introduction of examiners
(	b ) Location of drinking fountains and toilet facilities
(	c) Use and limitations of handbooks or other materials
(	d ) Time limitations
NOTE:	Whenever an applicant asks a question relating to the
examination which the examiners feel can be answered, both the question and answer must be given to the entire group.
After the Examination
The examiners may grade the results by one of three methods: (1) They may be graded independently and the results averaged; (2) examiners may jointly agree on the value to be awarded to each answer; or (3) a combination of both methods.
The findings of the examiners shall be final.
After the exam has been graded, the results will be forwarded to Human Resources which will promptly notify the applicants of the results.
Exhibit 4 (Cont’d)
153
Under no circumstances are examiners to discuss the results of their grading with any of the applicants. An applicant’s request for information about the results of the examination should be referred to their supervisor.
Conclusion
The role of the examiners is an important one, since the success of the job posting and examination procedure depends upon the examiner’s sincerity and ability to fulfill their responsibilities to the Company and the Union. Every effort, therefore, should be made to insure that all employees are given a fair and equal opportunity to prove their ability and knowledge of the job for which they are attempting to qualify.

TO ALL EMPLOYEES:
As a result of a recent serious injury to an employee engaged in work for another employer, the following statement is being sent to all employees and is being added to the booklet, “Working With Central Hudson”:
Outside Employment
The Company cannot sanction its employees engaging in outside employment. If any such employment is found to interfere with an employee's regular job with the Company or tends to damage the Company's public relations, such employment will not be permitted. Also, all employees are cautioned that their jobs and various Company benefits may be jeopardized as a result of injuries sustained in outside employment.

A.	Shift workers assigned to work schedules that provide for seven day a week 24 hour a day coverage will be scheduled to work when holidays fall within their basic scheduled workweek.
B.	Shift workers assigned to work schedules that may not necessarily require seven day a week or 24 hour a day coverage, may be scheduled off on holidays falling within their workweek and the holiday shall not be considered a basic workday. If an employee is scheduled off on such a holiday and is subsequently required to work that day, the work assignment shall be considered as an overtime assignment and all provisions covering overtime assignments will apply. If an employee is scheduled to work on such a holiday and it is subsequently found that such employee is not required to work that day, the cancellation of such employees work assignment shall be considered as a cancellation of overtime work and the appropriate provisions shall apply.
C.	Shift employees who perform maintenance or construction work normally are assigned to work from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. When so assigned these employees are considered as day workers and are usually not required to work on a holiday that occurs during the workweek. If it is necessary for an employee so assigned to work on a holiday that falls within the workweek, such assignment will be considered as overtime and treated in the same manner as overtime for a non-shift worker.
D.	When it is necessary to set up special schedules for maintenance work, emergency repairs, etc. any holidays falling within the work schedule shall be considered as overtime days and treatment shall be the same as covered by Paragraph A above.

2.	If an employee's rest period extends into the employee's basic workday, the employee will be allowed to complete this period without loss of pay; but if the employee is required to work, the employee will be paid “time plus double time instead of straight time for the time worked during the employee's basic work period which the employee would otherwise have been entitled to take off.”
3.	If the rest time does not extend into the employee's basic workday and occurs during weekends, holidays, or other scheduled days off, no payment will be made.

+ Exhibit 10 (Cont’d)
4.	If an employee is called or scheduled to work before completing the employees 8-hour rest period, and the hours the employee works during this period, when added to the employee's rest period, causes its extension into the employee's basic workday, the employee shall be entitled to the payments provided for in Paragraph N of Article III of the Working Agreement.
5.	If an employee who works 16 hours has sufficient time to complete 8 hours rest, even though they may not be consecutive, before the employee is asked to report for work again or before the commencement of the employee's regular workday, no payment will be made.
6.	An effort will be made to allow an employee to complete this time off. However, due to the nature of our business, occasionally there may be circumstances or emergencies which make this impossible.
7.	The foregoing understanding does not change the interpretation or administration of the so-called “7th to 4th hour” rule.

Section 501 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law presently requires a driver to hold a Class 3 Chauffeur's License to operate a truck having a maximum gross weight in excess of 18,000 lbs. We have interpreted the Utility Worker classification to require a Class 3 Chauffeur's License.
All Utility Workers are required to obtain the Class 3 license during the first four months of their probationary period. The responsibility for obtaining the necessary application forms and taking the preliminary tests will rest with the employee. However, local supervision will provide a truck for one road test. If the employee fails to pass such test, it will be the employee's responsibility to make the employee's own arrangements for any future test at the employee's own expense.
The job specification for Utility Worker requires the employee to have and currently maintain the license required by the state to operate a vehicle in excess of 18,000 lbs. gross weight.

Re: Hiring Relatives
The Company will continue its policy with respect to employing relatives of Company personnel. However to eliminate possible charges of favoritism, it will not permit situations where one family member will be working for or with another nor will it permit a situation where one may have direct influence over another except on the express approval of the Company. The Company in determining exceptions will take into consideration such items as job headquarters, and the work and family relationship involved.
At the time relatives are employed, they will be required to sign the following statement:
In recognition of the fact I have a relative working for the Company, I agree as a condition of employment that I will not be accepted for any assignment which will violate the Company's policy with respect to the hiring of relatives. Furthermore, I understand it may be necessary on occasion for the Company to reassign me in order to administer such policy uniformly.

Re: Changes Concerning Examinations for Promotions
The Company and Local 320 have agreed to the following changes with respect to the administration of the examination procedures. Changes will become effective immediately and any necessary changes to the T&D Working Agreement will be made at its next revision July 1,1963.
Use of Reference Books
It was agreed reference books and/or standards normally used in day-to-day work may be used during examinations. However, such reference materials must be approved and furnished by the examiners. The decisions by the examiners with respect to such reference books shall be final.
Written vs. Practical Questions
In preparing examinations, examiners will give consideration to the use of demonstrations vs. “paper and pencil” tests, when appropriate, in order to best measure the applicants' abilities.
“Paperwork” Questions
It was agreed that questions concerning paper work such as preparation of time sheets and material requisitions will not be included in examinations for jobs where in practice such
162
+ Exhibit 15 (Cont’d)
paper work is not a part of the job. The use of “paper work” questions shall be left to the judgment of the examiners.
Examinations for Working Foremen/Forewomen, Chiefs and Commercial Specialists
As an exception to the Working Agreement with respect to the number of examiners, the Company and the Union may by mutual agreement appoint an additional qualified examiner from both the Company and the Union to assist in the administration of an examination for the selection of Working Foremen/Forewomen, Chiefs and Commercial Specialists.
Time Limitations
Every effort shall be made to hold the length of an examination within reasonable time limits. It was further agreed that Human Resources will review examinations to insure time limits are reasonable and consistent for the type and complexity of the position being filled.
Instructions for Examiners
The attached instructions will be sent to each examiner prior to the preparation of an examination.
Appraisal of Applicants for District Representative, Commercial Representative-Special, 1/C and 2/C Collector, Meter Reader and Jr. Meter Reader
It was agreed the appraisal form used to evaluate an applicant’s qualifications for commercial work will be prepared by two members of the Union and two from the Company. The average grade of the four examiners will be used to determine an applicant’s mark. (See 1981+8)

+ Exhibit 15 (Cont’d)
163
April 4,1963
Instructions for Examiners
Introduction
The basis for promotion of employees under the Working Agreements is an examination jointly prepared by examiners appointed to represent the Union and the Company and designed to measure an employee's ability to do the work for which the employee is attempting to qualify. It is, therefore, most important that the examiners know their responsibilities and duties in order to carry out the wishes and intent of the Company and the Union as set forth in the Working Agreement.
Preparing the Examination
(1)	During the preparation of the examination, examiners may jointly review previous examinations given for the job. Although the same format does not necessarily have to be followed, it may be helpful in maintaining consistency in both content and form. Copies of prior examinations may be obtained through Human Resources.
(2)	Questions used must relate to the job for which applicants are attempting to qualify and should measure an applicant's ability to handle the job efficiently and safely. Questions should be clearly stated.
(3)	Passing grades (where applicable), point values, and a general understanding with respect to correct answers should be agreed upon before the examination is given.
(4)	After an agreement is reached, a signed copy of the examination must be forwarded to Human Resources where it will be reviewed for consistency and to see that it is in keeping with the provisions and intent of the Working Agreement.
After such review, if any changes are recommended, the copy will be returned to the examiners for their further consideration. If changes are made by the examiners, a revised, approved copy will be sent to Human Resources for file. If there are no changes recommended, the initial approved copy will be retained by Human Resources’ files.
164
+ Exhibit 15 (Cont’d)
Administering the Examination
(1)	Arrangements for giving the examination should be made by the department or division where the vacancy exists with the concurrence of the examiners. This includes time, place and notification of applicants.
(2)	Prior to the examination, arrangements should be made for pencils, paper, reference materials (if needed) and demonstration equipment (if used), etc.
(3)	The examiners shall decide who is to give instruction to the applicants. Instructions which should be given to the entire group should be clearly stated and include such items as:
( a ) Introduction of examiners
(	b) Location of drinking fountains and toilet facilities
(c)	Use and limitations of handbooks or other materials
( d ) Time limitations
NOTE: Whenever an applicant asks a question relating to the examination which the examiners feel can be answered, both the question and answer must be given to the entire group.
After the Examination
The examiners may grade the results by one of three methods: (1) They may be graded independently and the results averaged; (2) examiners may jointly agree on the value to be awarded to each answer; or (3) a combination of both methods.
The findings of the examiners shall be final.
After the exam has been graded, the results will be forwarded to Human Resources which will promptly notify the applicants of the results.
Under no circumstances are examiners to discuss the results of their grading with any of the applicants. An applicant's request for information about the results of the examination should be referred to the employee's supervisor.
+ Exhibit 15 (Cont’d)
165
Conclusion
The role of the examiners is an important one, since the success of the job posting and examination procedure depends upon the examiner's sincerity and ability to fulfill their responsibilities to the Company and the Union.
Every effort, therefore, should be made to insure that all employees are given a fair and equal opportunity to prove their ability and knowledge of the job for which they are attempting to qualify.

In such cases, if the employee directly supervising the Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C is not a Line Clearance Man/Woman of a higher classification, such Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C shall be upgraded in accordance with the Working Agreement except when such related line clearance is performed from the ground. However, it should be clearly understood that such Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C may be assigned to perform the work of a lower classification for which the employee is qualified without upgrading.

UNIFORM PRACTICE FOR THE EQUALIZATION & ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME AS REVISED ON JULY 1, 1975 (Revised 7/1/77, 7/1/83, 7/1/87, 7/1/89, 7/1/91, 7/1/94, 7/1/98 and 5/1/2003)
Uniform Practice for the Equalization and Assignment of Overtime.
166
+ Exhibit 17 (Cont’d)
I.	General Rules
1.	The following procedure which supersedes all other written or verbal agreements for distributing overtime shall apply to all regular and probationary employees. It will not apply to temporary employees.
2.	Scheduled overtime records and a call-out system will be maintained for employees at each work headquarters as a basis for the assignment of scheduled overtime and for calling employees for overtime work.
3.	Every effort will be made to equitably distribute scheduled overtime paid to qualified employees and to provide a fair and equal opportunity for call outs.
4.	Scheduled overtime records under this practice will start at July 1, 1964, and will continue on a “carry-over” basis thereafter. This carry over may be reduced by an agreement adopted by a two-thirds majority of the employees in the classification involved within the appropriate grouping.
In the event scheduled overtime records are reduced to zero for all employees on an overtime list in accordance with the above paragraph, the list showing all employees at zero will be put in seniority order with the senior employee being given the first opportunity to respond. The overtime list will revert to the low employee as soon as the next overtime list is published showing an employee with charged hours greater than zero.
5.	A temporary employee (not a probationary employee) will not be called out or scheduled for overtime assignments if regular employees in the same classification are able and willing to accept the assignment. This will not affect extended day work.
6.	Individual changes in procedure will be made only upon mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
II.	Scheduled Overtime
1.	Insofar as possible scheduled overtime will be assigned by referring to a scheduled overtime record prepared each week with the low employee being given first preference. Exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
+ Exhibit 17 (Cont’d)
167
a.	In the case of an extended workday those employees already assigned to the work may be asked to continue regardless of their position on the list.
b.	With respect to work in progress, those employees already assigned to the work and who are most familiar with it, may be asked to continue on an overtime basis without regard to their position on the list.
c.	If the overtime work is of a specialized nature (such as the use of Kenetron, Meuller, or welding equipment), a qualified employee who customarily does the work may be assigned.
2.	If an employee refuses a scheduled overtime assignment or accepts an overtime assignment and subsequently does not report for duty, the employee will be charged with the number of hours actually paid to the employee who worked the assignment.
3.	If an employee is absent for any reason, the employee's record will not be charged during this absence; however, in case of extended absence in excess of two weeks due to sickness, leave of absence without pay, military leave, or where an employee cannot accept extra work due to health reasons, the employee will be charged with sufficient hours to equalize the employee with the lowest active employee in the employee's classification grouping.
4A. An employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment.
E X H
B.	Employees who accept assignments to work for another utility accept such assignment for the entire period of such assignment or until the Company releases such employee(s) to return to Central Hudson. Any employees released to return to Central Hudson shall be released based on the then current scheduled overtime list.
C.	An employee who declines an assignment to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment or up to the point where Central Hudson would have released such employee to return to
168
+ Exhibit 17 (Cont’d)
Central Hudson. However, if such employee who refused the assignment has a full week of vacation during the entire period or some portion of the entire period of such assignment, such employee will not be charged with refused overtime during such week of vacation.
D.	Any employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory who is a shift or special schedule employee shall be considered to be a day worker during the entire period of such assignment. The short notice shift schedule change provisions of the labor agreement shall continue to apply to such employees when making such assignments.
5.	Scheduled overtime records will be posted weekly and will show the number of hours charged to each employee. A copy will be supplied to the steward on the steward's request.
6.	If an employee's job classification grouping or headquarters is changed, including transfers made pursuant to Article IV J 4, the employee will start in the employee's new classification grouping or at the employee's new headquarters with the average scheduled overtime hours charged to the employee in the employee's new classification grouping or at the employee's new headquarters. For overtime records of roving Linemen/Linewomen see 1977+20. For overtime records of roving Gas Mechanics see 1987-M+30. For overtime records of roving Testers see 1991-M+40.
In the event an employee returns to his/her former position within his/her 2 week returnable right period from another bargaining unit position or within the first 2 weeks of assignment to an unclassified position, such employee shall resume in the former job he/she is returning to the amount of charged overtime he/she had at the time of transfer to the new position.
7.	If an employee is working overtime as the result of assignment on a “scheduled” basis and is “scheduled” for a further overtime assignment while working, such additional overtime shall be considered “scheduled”.
8.	When it is necessary to schedule employees as “helpers” in the line and gas forces for overtime work, the assignment will be made from a group of classifications comprised of Equipment Operators, Field Clerks, Equipment Operator-Dynamite Handlers, Linemen/
+ Exhibit 17 (Cont’d)
169
Linewomen 3/C, Gas Mechanics 3/C, Gas Mechanic Welders 3/C, Splicers 3/C and Splicer-Helpers and Mechanics 3/C, All Utility Workers within the same division and headquarters regardless of normal assignment will be listed together with those classifications listed above and will be scheduled for overtime assignment in either gas or electric. The overtime assignment will be made on the basis of the job classification required for the work; however, insofar as possible an effort will be made to equalize scheduled overtime among this group.
Where the work assignment is work of a nature that will provide an individual an opportunity to learn or be exposed to specific skills or job knowledge associated with their particular job progression, the Company may schedule an individual out of turn.
9.	When an employee has been scheduled to work and is called out before the scheduled reporting time, those hours between the call out and the scheduled reporting time will be considered call out; all other hours worked will be charged as scheduled overtime.
10.	If after going through the scheduled overtime list in the district where the overtime is required and no one accepts the scheduled overtime, then the employee(s) on the scheduled overtime list in question, who is/are the lowest on the scheduled overtime list will be selected and will be assigned to work. The overtime hours normally recorded pursuant to Section II, paragraph 2, for any individual so assigned shall be doubled (i.e. declined hours plus paid hours).
III.	Call-Outs
E X
H
1.	For the purpose of this procedure a notification to an employee while off duty either to report for immediate duty or at a designated time shall be considered a call-out and made from a rotating call system.
2.	In an emergency or for work of a specialized nature if it becomes necessary to call an employee out of turn, a skip tag will be placed on the employee's call card.
3.	If an employee refuses a call or cannot be reached, the next employee in rotation will be called and the employee who could not be reached will be placed in last place. If an employee is on vacation, the employee's card
170+ Exhibit 17 (Cont’d)
will be so marked and the employee will not be called. In such cases, the employee's card will be placed in last place.
4.	If an employee is unable to accept calls for health or other reasons, the employee may be temporarily removed from the call list until the employee is able to accept calls.
5.	Sleep time worked resulting from a call-out will be treated as part of the call-out and not as scheduled overtime.
6.	When it is necessary to call a “helper” in Customer Services, the call will be made from a rotating call list comprising Utility Workers, Equipment Operators, Field Clerk/Storekeepers, Linemen/Linewomen 3/C, Gas Mechanic 3/C, Gas Mechanic Welders 3/C, Equipment Operator-Dynamite Handlers, Mechanics 3/C, Splicers and Splicer Helpers. If it is necessary to call an Equipment Operator, Field Clerk/Storekeeper, Lineman/Linewoman 3/C, Gas Mechanic 3/C or Gas Mechanic Welder 3/C within their separate classifications of work, a skip will be applied. Where the work assignment is work of a nature that will provide an individual an opportunity to learn or be exposed to specific skills or job knowledge associated with their particular job progression, the Company may call out an individual out of turn and a skip will be applied.
7.	If it is resolved by the district and the Control Center that an employee was called in error by the Control Center, that employee shall be charged with a skip.
8.	Employees transferred pursuant to Article IV J 4 shall be placed last on the callout list in the district such employee was transferred to.
IV.	Exception to Foregoing Procedures
1.	The parties agree that an employee assigned as a rover pursuant to Item 1977+20 or 1987-M+30 maybe asked to work overtime in the headquarters the employee is roving to after all employees on the headguarter overtime list have been offered the opportunity to work the overtime in question.
2.	With respect to Electricians, the following will apply:
a.	When it is necessary to call a “helper” for the Electricians in the district*, preference will be given
♦ Exhibit 17 (Cont’d)___________________________________171
to Electricians 3/C, Field Clerk/Storekeepers and Utility Workers assigned to that district*.
b.	In the district*, all scheduled overtime will be distributed equitably among qualified employees in each job classification.
c.	Upon refusing scheduled work, the employee will be credited with overtime hours to be paid for, equal to the scheduled work. This will be added to the overtime record.
d.	When overtime scheduled work is necessary, an effort will be made to use the employees in the district* in which the work exists. If these employees refuse or are already engaged in overtime work, an effort again will be made, providing that additional expenses are not incurred, to obtain people from the district* in which the lowest overtime exists. The above statement does not pertain to extended days.
e.	When employeesfrom within a district* are not available, required personnel assigned to the headquarters closest to the assigned work will be used.
*District, in this context, indicates the employees in a headquarters assigned to the General Services Division. (See Exhibit 116)

Therefore, participants in the Pilot Program may be engaged for work only if it will not result in the layoff of regular employees. They shall have no seniority during the period they are considered “Project Trainee” employees; however, if when in the opinion of the Company they are entitled to become regular employees and they become regular employees, they shall have seniority and service starting from the date of employment with the Company. All other applicable provisions of the Working Agreement shall apply unless otherwise stated in this memorandum.
4b. It shall be understood that during the time they are considered “Project Trainee” employees they shall have no “bidding rights” under the posting and examination procedure.
4c. As “Project Trainee” employees they will not be called out or scheduled for overtime assignments if the regular employees are able and willing to accept the assignment. This will not, however, apply to extended day work.

TRAINING PROGRAM - PILOT PROJECT
First Phase
Candidates after being selected will be enrolled in the HVOIC Feeder Program. These individuals will not be on the payroll of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation until the feeder program has been successfully completed.
Prior to the actual start of the feeder program, candidates will receive a brief explanation from two employees giving them an indication of exactly what duties the Utility Worker performs and some insight as to what their experiences were with Central Hudson. This should present to the candidates the idea that a job really does existat the end of their training program and will establish for them some reachable and attainable goal.
During the feeder program they will receive the following training;
5	hrs. Computational Skills (Basic Arithmetic)
5	hrs. Communication Skills (Basic English)
2 hrs. Minority History
2 hrs. Personal Development (Grooming-Hygiene, etc.)
1 hr. Consumer Education

3.	Eating-bring lunches, etc.
E.	Types of skill required for future advancement
At the conclusion of the program those selected candidates will be notified that they are now eligible for temporary employment with Central Hudson and will be asked to sign a statement of understanding (see attached).
Second Phase
Upon successful completion of the first phase of training, the selected candidates will be asked to report to a specified work headquarters. After reporting, each individual will be assigned to work as a Utility Worker (Project Trainee) and will perform all of the normal duties associated with this classification.
During their first year of employment, it is understood that each candidate will voluntarily participate in a training program designed by Mind, Inc. This program requires that students listen with earphones to small transistor tape recorders and write in workbooks. They work at their own speed, repeating lessons without being observed by anyone. Roughly for each 22 hours of study they should improve their ability by 1.43 grade levels.
+ Exhibit 18 (Cont’d)___________________________________177
The students will participate two or three nights per week until they have exhausted the teaching prog ram-the amount of time required to do this will vary depending upon their abilities and previous education, but it should not be more than 160 hours of instruction.
Third Phase
At the completion of the Mind, Inc. instruction phase (1 year maximum), the selected candidates will sign up to take the New York State High School Equivalency examination. Hopefully, all should pass. If an individual does not pass, consideration must be given to whether or not they should remain in the training program for additional instruction or be dropped from further consideration.
If the selected candidate successfully passed the examination and is to be granted a New York State High School Equivalency Diploma and the supervisors feel that the trainee’s on-the-job training has been satisfactory, the trainee will be transferred to regular status with ail the rights and privileges of a regular employee.
Evaluation
The Working Foreman/Forewoman or Chief will evaluate each “Project Trainee" employee on a weekly basis. This evaluation will be routed through the Distribution Superintendent to the Human Resources coordinator.
Counseling
The Human Resources coordinator will see that each “Project Trainee” receives the necessary counseling and guidance to minimize ail problems and keep the individual posted as to their progress in the program.
Supervision
As a necessary part of this program, the supervisors (including Foreman/Forewoman, Working Foreman/Forewoman or Chief) must be given some training with regard to handling this type of employee. This is a very important phase of their operation since the supervisor’s understanding and ability to handle their particular problems will be primary to their success. It will also serve to point out to the supervisor the necessity of the weekly evaluation sheets and the supervisor’s role as counselor.

1965 Local 320 Negotiations T&D and TOC Job Specifications Changes Customer Services Division District Representative and Estimator
The Company requests a minor change in the job specifications for Estimator 1/C and 2/C and District Representative to make the job content of these classifications conform more closely with the basic objectives of the new Customer Services Division directed toward improving customer service. The proposed change permits the Company greater latitude and opportunity to assign either an Estimator or a District Representative to handle all of the customer and public contacts and technical layout work directly associated with the establishment of the less complicated service extensions and relocations.
The change is intended to improve customer service by eliminating duplication of effort and permitting one employee to handle the complete job of less complicated service extensions and relocations. In most cases when it has been necessary to contact the customer to obtain information concerning field work, a Commercial Representative has been called in to talk with the customer. There have been instances where several employees have eventually met with the customer to discuss the same job.
Exhibit 23 (Cont’d)
185
The Company’s public image would be improved by having one employee involved in these situations.
Attached hereto are job specifications for Estimator 1/C, Estimator 2/C and District Representative, revised to accomplish the objectives stated above. The additional language in each case is underscored.
The phrase ‘less complicated service extensions and relocations” as used in this memorandum and in the specifications attached hereto is defined as follows:
Any line extension not requiring more than one additional pole or any service lateral regardless of the length of such lateral; including lesser jobs involving secondary extensions; area lights or individual multiple street lights wherein only the application of the Company construction standards is required.

Memorandum Regarding Substitution of Roving Mechanic-Operator Job Specifications for Those of Hydro Station Mechanic-Operator
The Company and the Union agree:
Effective February 1,1971, the present specifications for Hydro Station Mechanic-Operator are hereby eliminated and in substitution, therefore, the attached specifications for Roving Mechanic-Operator are hereby adopted.

190
+ Exhibit 25 (Cont'd)
similar to those of field crews and, accordingly, the requirement for the inclusion of a Chief Roving Mechanic-Operator for a crew of three to eight employees is recognized as based upon different conditions than those upon which the requirement of inclusion of Chief Plant Mechanic for a group of four or more employees is based (see eighth paragraph, Article V, Section C of the T&D Working Agreement).
4.	Amend Article V, Paragraph C, third Section to include Roving Mechanic-Operators.
5.	Substation Operators First and Second Class will be utilized for observation and communication oniy relative to peaking units not normally manned.

1/C or a Gas Mechanic Welder 1/C and a qualified Lineman/Linewoman I Splicer will install the entire electric system, and the main gas distribution system including gas services and meters to those homes ready for service at the time the main is installed. It is anticipated that the Gas Mechanic and Lineman/Linewoman I Splicer will work together installing the electric and gas systems during which a Gas Mechanic will be primarily responsible for making all gas connections and the Lineman/Linewoman I Splicer will be primarily responsible for making all electrical connections, it is understood that the crew which includes a Chief Gas Mechanic and a qualified Gas Mechanic may work on the energized gas systems and the crew which includes the Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T) and the qualified Lineman/Linewoman / Splicer may work on the energized electric system. It is also understood that the addition of qualified employees which result in two qualified employees from each craft being present will enable the crew to work on both energized systems. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an electric crew only may, at the Company’s election, be used for installing terminating and energizing cable within a conduit system.
( b ) Without limiting the right to use a crew described in paragraph 1(a) above, a crew consisting of a Gas Mechanic 1/C or higher and a Chief Gas Mechanic or higher may be utilized to install electric and gas services (which is included in the work referred to in paragraph 1( a ) above). The crew referred to in this paragraph 1(b) will be responsible for, but not limited to, fusing a service saddled to a plastic main or installing a mechanical saddle to a plastic main and installing, testing, purging and pressurizing a gas service up to the outlet of the meter by tapping the main. The crew referred to in this paragraph 1 ( b ) may also install a complete electric service from outside the transformer or service pedestal up to and into the meter box. The crew referred to in this paragraph 1(b) will not be responsible for energizing this electric service. The crew referred to in this paragraph 1(b) may also be responsible for excavating and backfilling the trench or coordinating such trenching and backfilling with a contractor.

2.	Electric and Telephone • Trenching by Communications Company
Central Hudson will use a crew which includes at least a Lineman/Linewoman 1/C I Splicer 1/C and an additional employee who will be paid at no less than Pay Group 16. This crew will have the initial responsibility for installing and connecting all primary cables, secondary cables, secondary pedestals, transformer pads and related work. All such work will be performed while the system is deenergized; however, if such crew includes two qualified Linemen/Linewomen, they may work on the energized electric system.
3.	Electric and Telephone - Trenching by Central Hudson Electric (only) - Trenching by Central Hudson
It is anticipated that where applicable, Central Hudson will perform trenching with its own personnel; however, contractors from time to time may be used to perform such trenching. When work on a job begins, trenching shall be performed by a crew of no less than two employees one of which will be an employee of a first-class classification. When the work progresses to a point where operations in addition to trenching are being performed, Central Hudson will use a crew including a Working Foreman/Forewoman 2/C (LES&T), Lineman/Linewoman 2/C / Splicer 2/C or higher and an employee of Pay Group 11 or higher. The operator of trenching equipment will be an individual at Pay Group 16 or above. It is anticipated that the trenching operator will close the trench working as either part of this work crew or independently at the completion of this operation.
4.	Recognizing that the majority of electric service connections associated with URD developments will not be completed during the initial installation but will be made at some time in the future, one employee Lineman/Linewoman 1/C I Splicer 1/C or higher may make energized secondary connections in a pedestal or in a deadfront padmount transformer where the cable has been previously installed inside the transformer pad.
5.	The Company agrees that it will, in its best efforts, try to equitably distribute combination gas and electric URD work between the electric and gas crew in each district.
6.	The Company and Union have developed a program that establishes clearly the guidelines for the work involved. Therefore, it seems somewhat unnecessary to establish a
198
+ Exhibit 31 (Conf d)
formal review committee at this time. However, the Company would not be hesitant to convene a small committee to discuss any problems that may arise from the trial agreement we have reached on URD.
7.	In making assignments for URD work, the supervisor in charge of each individual work headquarters will make every effort to consider the expressed preferences of individuals to perform URD-type work.
8.	During the period of this agreement, the Company will train bargaining unit employees in the operation of fault locating equipment. Upon the completion of such training, the bargaining unit employees will normally be used to operate such equipment.

TO ALL SUPERVISORS:
CALL-OUT PAY AND OVERTIME MEALS
Section H of Article V of the T&D Contract or Section E, Article V, of the TOC Contract was originally intended to cover the application of overtime meals. Although it is expected that liberal treatment will be applied in unusual cases, it is expected that both parties will be fair and reasonable in the application of the principles intended. It is impracticable to outline specific treatment to be applied to all individual situations that may arise. Unforeseen circumstances may arise requiring special interpretation which may not necessarily form a precedent for handling other similar situations. To insure uniformity, the interpretation of these sections under normal predictable circumstances will be as follows:
An employee required to continue work for a period longer than two hours beyond the scheduled quitting time shall be entitled to a meal furnished or paid for by the Company and to an additional meal for each additional five hours worked thereafter.
An employee who is called or scheduled to work before or after the employee's regular workday schedule and misses a meal or meals thereby, or is called or scheduled to report for work more than one hour in advance of the regular starting time and misses a meal or meals thereby, shall be entitled to a meal or meals furnished or paid for by the Company.
Exhibit 32 (Cont’d)
199
A callout is a communication to an employee while off duty directing the employee to proceed immediately to a designated work location to engage in overtime work or to report for such work at a designated time.
On a call-out for immediate duty, time shall begin from the time of call with the understanding that the employee shall be reasonable and fair in his/her promptness in reporting.
On a call-out to report for work at a designated time, compensation shall begin at the time of leaving for work. Notice to report for work at a designated time shall be given at least eight hours prior to the start of the employee's regularly scheduled basic workday. An employee who is called to report for work at a designated time and such call is subsequently cancelled shall receive a cancellation payment equivalent to three hours' pay at the applicable rate.
If an employee is scheduled or called out to report for work at a designated time and if the employee cannot be relieved after starting duty and is requested to obtain the employee's regular meal in advance of the regular starting time, a meal allowance time at the applicable rate may be paid for by the Company.
On a call-out to report for work at a designated time to cover an unscheduled absence, travel time and meal allowance time, if applicable, shall not be considered as working time for the purpose of applying the sleep time provisions of this Working Agreement.
Overtime meals shall be eaten on Company time and only such time shall be taken as is reasonably necessary to obtain and eat the meal.
Overtime meals shall be those eaten before or after regular working hours orthose covered by Article III E of the T&D Contract or Article III D of the TOC Contract.

(Amended 6/1/83)
To All Supervisors:
During the 1954 negotiations with Local 320 there was considerable discussion about the distinction between general and direct supervision as the terms are used in the job specifications.
To insure uniform understanding the following summary of the discussion has been prepared and issued.
General Supervision
The term "under general supervision” means that an employee performs their duties in accordance with general instructions from a supervisor or from a qualified higher rated employee. The employee is expected to exercise judgment and to make decisions regarding the performance of such duties. The employee is responsible for the completion of the employee's duties. It is contemplated that the employee will not require continuous supervision and that the employee will be supervised principally on the basis of overall results achieved. The employee may be required to direct the work of other employees.
Exhibit 37 (Cont’d)
203
Direct Supervision
The term “under direct supervision" means that an employee performs the employees duties under the guidance or direction of a supervisor or of a qualified higher rated employee who will remain in the general vicinity of the job to check the progress of the work from time-to-time, and who will be available to make decisions regarding the performance of the work, and who will be responsible for the completion of the job. The employee may be assisted by other employees.

+ Exhibit 39
November 20, 1952 (Amended 6/1/83)
The Company’s work of line clearance has been greater in amount each year as its lines have been extended, and more important as increasing reliance is placed upon electric service. Every effort is being continuously directed to making electric service just as reliable as practically possible. Many factors operate against the supply of uninterrupted service, and cause the interruptions which distribution and transmission lines experience. The major factor is interference from trees, and there is none as difficult to bring under control.
It has been the Company’s practice to have this work performed by its line forces and by forces of tree trimming contractors. The amount performed annually by each has varied, being dependent upon the amount of line construction and maintenance work the line forces had to do. This practice has produced reasonably satisfactory results, although at times needed tree trimming has been delayed because of insufficient forces to do the work. Consideration of the increasing importance of this work and the necessity for performing more of it as time goes on, led to a review of the practices of carrying on line clearance. Based on this review it has been concluded that it would be more advantageous for the Company to employ tree trimming crews of its own to carry on a large part of the line clearance work, and to continue to perform the remainder of the work with its line crews and with tree trimming contractors. The
204
+ Exhibit 39 (Cont’d)
Company intends, therefore, to modify its present practice to that extent and hopes thereby to obtain better and more continuous clearance of lines, to effect a better control of public relations and to improve the quality of electric service supplied.
in order to test the merits of the proposed method of handling line clearance an organization of tree trimming crews will be created with headquarters at Eltings Corners. These crews will be comprised of persons specially trained for this work who will perform on a year-round basis such work as can be economically conducted from Eltings Corners. Initially there will be created three crews, each consisting of one First-Class Tree Trimmer, and one Second-Class T ree T ri mm er, under the supervision of a T ree Trimmer Foreman/Forewoman.
It is intended that this organization will be set up during December, when it is expected the equipment ordered for the crews will be received. To recruit employees for these new positions, job postings are being made herewith and applications for these positions are solicited.
The duties of a Lineman/Linewoman include all the work which is done on transmission and distribution lines. Line clearance, such as tree trimming, is one of these duties. The creation of the new position of Tree Trimmer shall in no way alter or set aside any of the duties which Linemen/Linewomen have historically performed. The duties of a tree trimmer shall be complementary to those of a Lineman/Linewoman.

Lineman/Linewoman Taking Rotation Test
In the course of work operations involving a customer (or customers) who has polyphase electric service, it is sometimes necessary to disconnect such service in order to make modification to some part of the physical plant which serves the facility.
In such instance, it is necessary to make a rotation test before service is disconnected to provide a base for checking rotation when service is to be restored.
The Company feels that from the standpoint of operating efficiency, taking into consideration the job specifications and qualifications of existing Lineman/Linewoman 1/C or higher, the taking of such rotation tests by such personnel is an appropriate assignment. All other phase rotation tests presently performed by Testers will continue to be performed by Testers.

Re: Travel Allowance
An employee who is declared excess under the provisions of Article IX D of the Working Agreement and who is transferred to another headquarters that is a greater distance from the employee's place of residence than the employee's headquarters on the date of the declaration of excess and who subsequently bids to and accepts a position which requires travel equal to or greater than the distance from the employee's place of residence at the time of the original transfer, the employee will
Exhibit 52 (Cont’d)
219
remain eligible for the mileage allowance under Article V P (T&D) or V H (TOC) for a period of time no longer than the applicable time period referred to in such sections measured from the date of the declaration of excess. Provided, however, if the subsequent bid and acceptance is to a position of a greater pay rate than the employee received on the date of the declaration of excess, the employee's mileage allowance will cease.
if the position subsequently bid and accepted requires travel less than the distance from the employee's place of residence at the time of the original transfer, the employee will be eligible for a mileage allowance based on such distance provided that such distance is greater than the distance from the employee's headquarters on the date of the declaration of excess from such place of residence for a period of time no greater than one year from the time declared excess and further provided if the subsequent bid and acceptance is to a position of a greater pay rate than the employee received on the date of the declaration of excess, the employee's mileage allowance will cease.
For the purposes of this memorandum, there shall be no differentiation for travel distance between Roseton and Danskammer.

(Amended 5/1/2003)
January 20, 1983
UNIFORM PRACTICE FOR THE EQUALIZATION & ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME APPLICABLE TO THE TOC BARGAINING UNIT
I. General Rules
1.	The following procedure, which supersedes all other written or verbal agreements for distributing overtime, shall apply to all regular and probationary classified employees (except Part-time CSRs), subject to the TOC Labor Agreement. It will not apply to temporary employees.
2.	Scheduled overtime records and a callout system will be maintained for employees for each area as determined from time to time by Management in which two or more classified employees work together on a specific type of work and will serve as a basis for the assignment of scheduled overtime and for calling employees for overtime work. Such area may include a section or
220_________________________________________* Exhibit 53 (Cant'd)
working unit within a division at a work headquarters, and such area will hereinafter be called the “responsibility area”.
3.	Every effort will be made to equitably distribute scheduled overtime among qualified employees in each responsibility area and to provide a fair and equal opportunity for callouts.
4.	Scheduled overtime records under this practice will start at January 1, 1983 and will continue on a “carry-over” basis thereafter. This carry-over may be reduced by an agreement adopted by a two-thirds majority of the employees in the classification involved within the responsibility area.
In the event scheduled overtime records are reduced to zero for all employees on an overtime list in accordance with the above paragraph, the list showing all employees at zero will be put in seniority order with the senior employee being given the first opportunity to respond. The overtime list will revert to the low employee as soon as the next overtime list is published showing an employee with charged hours greater than zero.
5.	A temporary employee (not a probationary employee) will not be called out or scheduled for overtime assignments if regular employees in the same classification within the same responsibility area are available and willing to accept the assignment. This provision will not be applicable to an extended workday.
6.	Changes in this procedure will be made only upon mutual agreement between the Company and Local 320.
II.	Scheduled Overtime
1.	Insofar as possible, scheduled overtime will be assigned by referring to a scheduled overtime record within the responsibility area with the low employee in such area being given first preference. Exceptions to this general rule are as follows:
a.	In the case of an extended workday, those employees already assigned to the work may be asked to continue regardless of their position on the list.
Exhibit 53 (Cont’d)
221
b.	With respect to work in progress, those employees already assigned to the work and who are most familiar with it, may be asked to continue on an overtime basis without regard to their position on the list.
c.	If the overtime work is of a specialized nature, a qualified employee within the responsibility area, who customarily does the work, may be assigned.
2.	If an employee refuses a scheduled overtime assignment or accepts an overtime assignment and subsequently does not report for duty, such employee will be charged with the number of hours actually paid to the employee who worked the assignment.
3.	If an employee is absent for any reason, such employee’s record will not be charged with overtime hours during this absence; however, in case of extended absence in excess of two weeks due to sickness, leave of absence without pay, military leave, or where an employee cannot accept overtime work due to health reasons, the employee will be charged with sufficient hours to equalize such employee with the lowest active employee in such employee’s classification within the responsibility area.
4A. An employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment.
B.	Employees who accept assignment to work for another utility accept such assignment for the entire period of such assignment or until the Company releases such employee(s) to return to Central Hudson. Any employees released to return to Central Hudson shall be released based on the then current scheduled overtime list.
E X H
C.	An employee who declines an assignment to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory will be charged with all overtime hours worked during the entire period of assignment or up to the point where Central Hudson would have released such employee to return to Central Hudson. However, if such employee who refused the assignment has a full week of vacation during the entire period or some portion of the entire period of such assignment, such employee will not be charged with refused overtime during such week of vacation.
222
Exhibit 53 (Cont’d)
D.	Any employee assigned to work for another utility outside Central Hudson territory who is a shift or special schedule employee shall be considered to be a day worker during the entire period of such assignment. The short notice shift schedule change provisions of the labor agreement shall continue to apply to such employees when making such assignments.
5.	Scheduled overtime records will be posted weekly and will show the number of hours charged to each employee. A copy will be supplied to the steward on written request.
6.	If an employee’s job classification or responsibility area is changed, including transfers made pursuant to Article IV N 3, the employee will start in the new classification or at the new responsibility area with the average scheduled overtime hours charged to the employees in the employee’s new classification or at the new responsibility area.
In the event an employee returns to his/her former position within his/her 2-week returnable right period from another bargaining unit position or within the first 2 weeks of assignment to an unclassified position, such employee shall resume in the former job he/she is returning to the amount of charged overtime he/she had at the time of transfer to the new position.
7.	If an employee is working overtime as the result of assignment on a “scheduled” basis and is “scheduled” for a further overtime assignment while working, such additional overtime shall be considered “scheduled”.
8.	When an employee has been scheduled to work and is called out before the scheduled reporting time, those hours between the callout and the scheduled reporting time will be considered callout; all other hours worked will be charged as scheduled overtime,
9.	If after going through the scheduled overtime list in the district where the overtime is required and no one accepts the scheduled overtime, then the emp)oyee(s) on the scheduled overtime list in question, who is/are the lowest on the scheduled overtime list will be selected and will be assigned to work. The overtime hours normally
* Exhibit 53 (Cont’d)223
recorded pursuant to Section II, Paragraph 2, for any individual so assigned shall be doubled (i.e. declined hours plus paid hours!.
III. Call-outs
1.	For the purpose of this procedure, a notification to an employee while off duty either to report for immediate duty or at a designated time shall be considered a call-out and made from a rotating call system.
2.	In an emergency or for work of a specialized nature, if
it becomes necessary to call an employee out of turn, a skip tag will be placed on the call card.
3.	If an employee refuses a call or cannot be reached, the next employee in rotation will be called, and the employee who could not be reached will be placed in last place. If an employee is on vacation, the employee’s card will be so marked, and the employee will not be called. In such cases, the card will be placed in last place.
4,	If an employee is unable to accept calls for health or other reasons, the employee may be temporarily removed from the call list until the employee is able to accept calls.
5.	“Sleep time” worked resulting from a call-out will be treated as part of the call-out and not as scheduled overtime.
6.	If it is resolved that an employee who responded for overtime duty was called in error, that employee shall be charged with a skip.
7.	Employees transferred pursuant to Article IV N 3 shall
be placed last on the callout list in the district such employee was transferred to. (See Exhibit 116)

224________________________________________* Exhibit 54 (Cont’d)
Exhibit A to that certain Agreement, dated October 16, 1981, by and between the Company and Local 320, as last amended May 1, 2003 and, as amended, is restated in its entirety to read as follows:
Exhibit A
This Agreement shall be known as the “CSR-Part-time Agreement”.
The Customer Service Representative classification has been added to the automatic progression series of the “TOC” Agreement and the titles have been changed to CSR1 /C, CSR 2/C, and CSR 3/C. The CSR-D classification was eliminated; and CSR 3/C and CSR 2/C were retained as training positions with no change in job specifications or pay grade. Maximum times in grade are one year tor CSR 3/C and 18 months for CSR 2/C. If an employee in the 2/C position fails to qualify for the 1/C position, the employee will be given one additional opportunity to qualify. The second qualifying examination will be given at the option of the Company anytime between six months and one year following the first examination. Effective July 1,1989, the classification of Customer Service Representative-E H. has been added to the automatic progression series as part of the full-time Customer Service Representative series as a special schedule position under Article III B of the TQC Labor Agreement and reference to the term “full-time CSR” referred to herein shall include such new classification, except as specifically excluded herein.
The Company has established three new classifications entitled Customer Service Representative First Class - Part-Time, Customer Service Representative Second Class - Part-Time and Customer Service Representative Third Class -Part-Time in the automatic progression series.
Successful applicants will be assigned and will go through the regular CSR training program on a part-time basis and the maximum time in grade will be two years for CSR 3/C - Part-Time and three years for CSR 2/C - Part-Time. The Company maintains the right to post for a maximum of one (1) CSR-PT in each of the Fishkill, Catskill, Kingston and Newburgh Headquarters and a maximum of seventeen (17) CSRs-PT in the Poughkeepsie Headquarters; however, the total CSR-Part-Time complement wifi be determined from time to time by the Company but will not exceed 17 or 25% of the total number of full-time CSRs (excluding CSRs-E.H. and CSRs in progression to CSR-E.H.), whichever is greater, as determined on July 1, 1995 and updated
Exhibit 54 (Cont’d)
225
on each January 1 and July 1 thereafter. Written notification to the President and Business Manager of Local 320 of such numbers will be provided.
No additional CSR-PT positions, in addition to those listed in the previous paragraph, will be posted, or otherwise filled, unless there is mutual agreement between the Company and Union.
The Part-time CSR position will be posted before Part-time CSR positions are filled from outside the Company.
Full-time CSRs at the headquarters will be given the first opportunity to respond to requests for call-outs. If the Company elects to extend the hours of CSR work for any reason, then the Company may assign either full-time CSRs on an overtime basis or part-time CSRs on a straight-time basis.
If a Customer Service Representative or CSR-E.H. is assigned to an office open to the public between the night time hours of 6:00 p.m. and 12 midnight, or a CSR-Part-Time is assigned to an office open to the public between the night time hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., there will be at least one additional employee (classified or unclassified) assigned to that office during such hours.
Part-time CSRs will work a maximum of 1,040 hours per year July 1 through June 30 and the Company has the right to schedule such part-time CSRs for any hours of work during any day of the week. Paid hours for vacation and holidays will not be included in the 1,040 hours. A part-time CSR who is unavailable to meet an assigned work schedule four times in any 30-day period will be terminated; however, any such unavailability will not be charged for absences associated with a death in the family (as defined in paragraph VIII I 3 of the TOC Labor Agreement). If scheduled, part-time CSRs will be assigned for a minimum of three (3) consecutive hours and they will receive straight time for alt hours worked except they will be paid time and one-half for all hours worked on those holidays designated in Article ill E of the Working Agreement or those hours worked in excess of eight hours per day. The applicable negotiated hourly wage for full-time CSRs will be the same hourly wage for part-time CSRs. (See Exhibit *125 and 1987-M*48)
A Part-Time CSR who is called out in accordance with 1987-50 wili be compensated at the prevailing overtime rate for all hours worked outside their normal schedule and it shall not be considered as a reschedule of their work schedule. In the event
226* Exhibit 54 (Cont’d)
such CSR-PT declines such callout it shall not be counted as one of the 4 unavailables within any 30-day period under Exhibit 54 of the Labor Agreement.
The Company will provide each of the individual Customer Service Representative Part-time employees, no later than the 15th day of each month, the anticipated work plan for that employee for the following month. Such plan will continue to be subject to change without notice.
Part-time CSRs will receive the paid holidays as outlined in Article 111 E of the “Full-Time" Working Agreement. Holiday pay will be for four (4) hours at the straight-time rate.
Part-time CSRs will earn vacation at the rate of one (1) day for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed ten (10) days.
Additional vacation for part-time CSRs will be earned for additional years of service, either as full-time or part-time employees as follows:
Five years of service - one and one-half (1 1/2) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed fifteen (15) days.
Fifteen years of service - two (2) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed twenty (20) days.
Twenty-two years of service - two and one-half (2 1/a) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed twenty-five (25) days.
Thirty years of service - three (3) days for each 90 hours worked in a calendar year not to exceed thirty (30) days.
Vacation pay will be for four (4) hours per day at the straight time rate. Vacation for part-time CSRs will be taken in the following calendar year. Vacations earned can be deferred pursuant to the provisions of Article VIII A-4 of the TOC Labor Agreement. Requests for vacation will be subject to the approval of the Supervisor, but the Company reaffirms that each employee is entitled to two weeks' vacation in their normal vacation period (provided they are eligible for such two weeks’ vacation) in accordance with Article VIII of the Working Agreement. Part-time CSRs shall not be paid for any absence except as outlined above for holidays and vacation. (See 1985-M*36)
* Exhibit 54 (Cont’d)______________________________________227
Part-time CSRs will become members of the Retirement Income Plan after meeting the one year eligibility requirements but they will not be eligible for nonstatutory benefits under the Company’s self-insured disability plan. Effective October 1, 1983, part-time CSRs may elect to be covered for $10,000 of life insurance coverage. Effective October 1, 1989, CSRs-PT may elect to participate in the Health Benefit Plan with individual coverage only. If a CSR-PT elects family coverage, he or she will pay the difference between the individual rate and the family rate. Any part-time CSR who becomes a permanent full-time CSR will become eligible for family health care benefits the first of the month coinciding with or following employment as a full-time employee. Effective July 1, 1998, Customer Service Representatives • Part-Time shall only contribute one-half of the health benefit amounts contributed by Customer Service Representatives - Full-Time.
Part-time CSRs will become members of the Company’s Wellness Program effective July 1,1998.
“Service” for a CSR-PT and a PT will be continuous from the date of the employee’s date of employment. “Seniority” for a CSR-PT and a PT shall commence from the date a CSR-PT or a PT is awarded a full-time position under either of the Full-time Agreements and shall accrue only while such employee is in any full-time position except as follows:
Seniority of all CSR-PTs shall accrue at the rate of one (1) day for each two (2) days of employment as a CSR-PT retroactive to the date of their entering or re-entering the CSR-PT classification including those who left the classification prior to Julyl, 1994. Seniority for CSR-PTs who were incumbents at July 1, 1983, and have not left the classification, shall continue to accrue on the basis in effect on June 30, 1994; however, if such incumbents are assigned to a full-time position and, thereafter, are reassigned to the CSR-PT classification (other than an exercise of the incumbent’s return rights), seniority shall accrue, thereafter, at the rate set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.
Seniority of all CSR-PTs accrued to July 1,1983 shall be recognized.
New service work and front lobby customer contact, including cashier duties, will be performed by full-time and/or part-time CSRs.
228
Exhibit 54 (Cont’d)
Except as may otherwise be provided herein and in the said TOC “Full-time Agreement”, the part-time CSRs will have all the rights and obligations of other employees covered by said TOC “Full-Time” Agreement except that paragraphs M-1 of Article IV of said TOC “Full-time” Agreement shall apply only to the Service of said Part-time CSRs and further except that paragraphs L and M-2 of said Article IV shall be inapplicable to said part-time CSRs.
CSR Part-time employees (“CSR-PTs”) and part-time employees (“PTs”) in the Local 320 Part-time Agreement (“Part-time Agreement”) shall have full bidding rights on all job postings in the Local 320 T&D and TOC Full-time Agreements (“Full-time Agreements") after the full-time bid list has been exhausted. Part-time employees in the Local 32Q Part-time Agreement shall have full bidding rights on all job postings in the Local 320 Part-time Agreement after the full-time bid list has been exhausted. Employees in the job classifications of Head Cleaning Worker (138.6) and/or Cleaning Worker (139.1) have no such bidding rights except as provided in Item 40 B of the 1989 Memorandum of Agreement. Seniority shall prevail, and where seniority is equal, service shall prevail. (See 1985-M*33)
Effective October 1, 1983, Group Life Insurance coverage of $10,000 will be offered to the CSR-PTs and the PTs. This coverage will also be offered to the CSR-PTs regardless of the number of hours worked. Contribution for such overage will be at the rate of 15^ per $1,000 of coverage. No AD&D coverage will be provided, and no coverage into retirement will be provided.
Part-time CSR employees, the majority of whose regular scheduled basic workday hours in any'workday occur within the period from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM, shall be paid a night differential of $1.20 per hour effective May 1,2003, effective Mav1, 2004, $1.25 per hour and, effective May 1, 2005, $1.30 per hour, effective May 1, 2006, $1.40 per hour and effective May 1, 2007, $1.50 per hour for the total basic hours worked. However, when the basic hours worked in any workday are less than the majority of total hours worked then the night differential shall be paid only for those basic hours worked within the period from 4:00 PM to 8:00 AM. The night differential shall not be paid for any work performed for which overtime is paid.

New Meter Set
The work associated with establishing a new service including inspection of appliance installations, care for leaks and stoppages, adjustment of appliances and inspection and adjustment of gas regulators, shall be performed by Commercial Representatives. A gas crew may connect the new service piping to the customer piping and set the gas meter.
Overtime
Relighting is to be performed on an overtime basis by gas crews in accordance with these general guidelines. Notwithstanding the Company’s right to uniformly make assignments on an overtime and regular time basis, gas crews will be assigned to relight on an overtime basis when repairing leaks, responding to emergencies, and relighting at the completion of an assignment on an extended workday. Gas crews will not be assigned to relight appliances on an overtime basis when the work has been scheduled with the knowledge that gas service will be interrupted. Commercial Representatives perform these scheduled overtime relights.
General
Bearing in mind that the relight assignment to a gas crew is intended to be incidental to their normal construction, repair and maintenance work, there is no restriction on number of services which may be relighted. Assignments to relight construction and maintenance jobs should be made with the purpose of scheduling and utilizing ail employees in an effective manner.
230
+ Exhibit 56 (Cont’d)
Relocating Gas Meters
The relocation of the meter and associated piping, including tying into the customer piping, can be performed by either craft, separately or jointly, subject to limiting members of a gas crew to installing and tying in 10 feet or less of filler pipe between the new meter and the customer piping. Relighting will not be performed by members of a gas crew.
Changing a Gas Meter in Accordance with the PSC Time Test Program
Commercial Representatives shall be responsible for changing small meters associated with the PSC time test program. A crew consisting of at least a Gas Mechanic and a Commercial Representative may work jointly to change a large meter.
Interruption by Others
When service is interrupted by a third party excavator, relighting will not be performed by gas crews. When the interruption is caused by the gas crew in response to damage by a third party excavator, the management reserves the right to assign Gas Mechanics the responsibility for relighting.

Re: Response to Grievance 1976-88 Third Step
I understand your arguments and more importantly the fear, or perhaps suspicion, on the part of the Meter Testers that we are reaching out to reduce the Tester work. First, let me tell you, categorically, that we have no intention of having anyone but Meter Testers perform mandated Public Service Commission tests (i.e. rotating standards). We do not believe that the “black box” is a “testing” device as we are familiar with that term. This is merely a tool for helping the Commercial Representative resolve customer complaints and is used to indicate to the customer or the Commercial Representative 1st Class and above that there are no fundamental problems with the service; and the use of such a tool falls within the Commercial Representatives 1st Class and above job specification. We find no violation of the Working Agreement but we will take a good, hard look at the organizational function of those various activities to see if we can serve the customer more effectively and economically than we are currently doing.

Re: Clarification of Meal Provisions
At this year's negotiations, Local 320 asked for a clarification of meal provisions, especially as applied to extended day work.
For example, when employees are required to work an extended day at Danskammer, on a job requiring continuous coverage, it is the practice to stagger meal periods. In applying the section which provides for a meal two hours after quitting time and an additional meal for each five hours worked thereafter, employees who are asked to eat early may be entitled to a second meal before they leave for home under the “five-hour” rule, while those eating later may not. This apparent inequity comes about by applying the existing interpretation that time for determining eligibility for a second meal starts after the completion of the first meal.
232
+ Exhibit 61 (Cont’d)
The Company recognized an inequity and was willing to apply uniform treatment in such cases by agreeing to a “sevenhour” rule which merely combines the two and five hour provisions. In agreeing to this rule, however, it was the understanding of Company representatives that time to eat the first meal would not be considered as time “worked” and would not be a part of the seven hours.
It was quite apparent that there were misunderstandings as to what was agreed to. The Company representatives thought the settlement was based on time “worked”, whereas the Union members thought the agreement to mean an elapsed seven hour period starting from the normal quitting time, in defense of their position, the Union referred to examples quoted by one of their members during negotiations to clarify the Union's understanding.
In recognition of the apparent misunderstanding with respect to meals to which an employee may be entitled when required to work an extended day, the Company shall arrange to provide meals for such extended days with the following understandings:
1.	Overtime meals will be furnished or paid for the first elapsed seven hours of an extended day.
For example: If an employee whose normal quitting time is 4:30 p.m. continues on an extended day basis for seven hours until 11:30 p.m., he becomes eligible for a second meal at 11:30 p.m. In other words, time to eat the first meal will be treated as working time only for calculating the seven hours.
2.	Such meals will apply only to extended day overtime assignments at the end of a regular workday as set forth in the first paragraph of Article V, Paragraph H, of the Local 320 Contract, effective July 1, 1962.
3.	In agreeing to the foregoing, the Company is not conceding that time to eat a meal or travel time is time “worked” for the purpose of interpreting other provisions of the Working Agreement,

The following is in settlement of Grievances 81-03, 81-29, and 81-31, and shall continue during the term of the current Working Agreement:
The Company will continue its commitment to the Union that normally manned storerooms will be staffed by an employee of at least Pay Group 18 (or as may be provided in Item 1957-20 of the Memorandums of Agreement to Current Working Agreement), which employee will continue to be the responsible person for receiving and issuing material. However, CRT input will continue to be performed by an employee of a lower classification, including but not limited to the Equipment Operator-Special, who will be trained in the operation of the CRT.
Effective June 1, 1982, the Stock Handler classification will be increased to Pay Group 16, and effective as of said date, the job specification of Stock Handler is hereby amended as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part of this settlement.
The Company will provide the opportunity for training for the Stock Handler classification to qualify for a N.Y.S. Motor Vehicle 1st Class Chauffeur's License required to operate and drive a tractor trailer with a fifth wheel. The incumbent Stock Handlers will continue at Pay Group 15 until they so qualify and

The Supervisor will grant approval to the employee to renew the licenses referred to in this paragraph on Company time, if the employee has given the Supervisor adequate notice preferably 10 working days; and if in the opinion of the Supervisor, the employee's absence will not adversely affect the completion of work assignments or require excessive travel.

Line Clearance Job Area Reporting Program
In response to your request for automatic progression and in an attempt to make our trimming crews more competitive with contractors, the following is proposed:
The Company shall have the right to assign Line Clearance personnel to their assigned headquarters or to any given job area within a radius of 25 miles of the employee’s assigned headquarters. Those assigned Line Clearance personnel will report to that area at the normal starting time and be dismissed from that area at the normal quitting time. The work assignments of line clearance employees will include trimming work and other incidental work. Personnel assigned to report to job areas In excess of the 2 5-mi Ie radius in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be subject to the provisions of Article V G. In consideration of the fact that Line Clearance personnel would be required to report to a specific but varying job area, designated by the Company, the Company will grant automatic progression over an 18-month period from Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C to 1/C. Existing Line Clearance Men/Women 2/C with more than 18 months in grade will be examined without delay for promotion and assignment at their existing headquarters. All other rules of automatic progression shall apply to employees covered under this proposal.
Additionally, when required to report to a job area within the 25 mile radius other than the employee’s assigned headquarters, the employee will be reimbursed for travel costs related to any additional tolls and any additional mileage from the employee’s home to the designated job area in excess of the mileage from his or her home to the assigned headquarters. Reimbursement will be based on the road miles driven and paid in accordance with the mileage rate established in Article V P of the Labor Agreement.
E X H
The Company shall continue to assign a Chief Line Clearance Man/Woman whenever four or more employees are brought together as a crew to do trimming.
The Company shall post for one additional Chief Line Clearance Man/Woman with no increase in complement. In addition, the Company agrees to increase the rate of pay for Chief
236
+ Exhibit 68 (Cont’d)
Line Clearance Men/Women from 19.0 to 19.1 and the rate of pay for Line Clearance Men/Women 1/C from 17.0 to 17.1.
These proposals are made with the understanding that the Company is not committed to maintaining any established complement of Chief Line Clearance Men/Women, Line Clearance Men/Women 1/C or Line Clearance Men/Women 2/C in the future. However, Management agrees to maintain a complement of no less than three Chiefs so long as personnel are assigned to report to areas other than their assigned headquarters.
Line Clearance personnel for the purposes of this Line Clearance Job Area Reporting Program shall be defined as those employees in the job classifications of Chief Line Clearance Man/Woman -106.0; Line Clearance Man/Woman 1/C -106.1; and Line Clearance Man/Woman 2/C -106.2. Job specifications for these classifications are attached hereto.
This Program, known as the Line Clearance Job Area Reporting Program, shall remain in effect during the term of this Working Agreement. If mutually agreed to by both parties at the expiration of this Working Agreement, the Program shall be made permanent. If either party does not agree to continue the Program, the Program will be cancelled as of the expiration of this Working Agreement, however, all employees who have received the benefit of an upgrade as a result of the Program shall remain in the positions and pay groups in which they have been placed. Following such cancellation, all future employees who may enter the classification of Chief or Line Clearance Man/Woman 1/C or 2/C shall enter the classification in accordance with job specifications and associated pay groups in effect on June 30, 1985, and the automatic progression provision from 2/C to 1/C shall be eliminated.
Management shall insure that all employees receive timely delivery of all pertinent notices and communications including job postings, paychecks, newsletters, credit union transactions, time sheets, crew logs, vehicle cards, etc.
Whenever reporting areas are changed, Management shall be responsible for arranging the relocation of the equipment.
Headquarters shall be established in accordance with Article IV J with a concurrent posting at the time the vacancy is initially posted.

An employee who is called out to work shall be paid a minimum of three hours at the applicable rate. Supervisors may release employees who are called out prior to the expiration of the three-hour guaranteed work period after they have performed the necessary emergency work.
However, employees who are released remain on Company time until the expiration of the three-hour period and may be directed during this three-hour period by subsequent callouts to further necessary emergency work. An employee who receives a subsequent call during the minimum period of three hours’ time of the original call shall be paid at the applicable rate for the time elapsed from the beginning of the first call to the end of the second call or the end of the original minimum period, whichever is greater.
Due to a possible misunderstanding on the grievant's part as to his obligation to remain available for the minimum three-hour period after being released from the initial callout, the Company will, without precedent or prejudice, agree to pay the grievant, Frederick Harjes, for two hours at the prevailing rate.
The two hours represents a payment for a period of time from when the grievant accepted the original callout to the time he declined the subsequent callout, which was within the minimum three-hour period.

+ Exhibit 95
Item 18A of 1991 Negotiations (Amended 5/1/2003)
The Company will modify its scheduling and assignment of Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) as follows:
1.	Previously, Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) have been scheduled to work Sunday at all locations. The Company anticipates that it can meet its operating needs by scheduling Commercial Representative - Specials
+ Exhibit 95 (Cont’d)265
(No. 207.0) to work Monday through Saturday. However, these individuals may be scheduled to work on Sundays to respond to specific operating circumstances in each area as determined by management.
As this change applies only to scheduling Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0) and Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) with more than 18 months as Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3), the following procedure would apply:
If the Company elects not to work Sundays, then when an employee working a Tuesday through Saturday schedule is to be rotated to a Monday through Friday schedule, such employee’s days off will not be consecutive that week (i.e. the employee will be off Sunday and the following Saturday that week). When an employee working a Monday through Friday schedule is to be rotated to a Tuesday through Saturday schedule, such employee will receive three consecutive days off (i.e. the employee will be off Saturday, Sunday and Monday).
2.	Holidays will not be considered as a basic work day for employees in the classification of Commercial Representative - Special (No. 207.0) or Commercial Representative 2/C (207.3) with more than 18 months* experience as a Commercial Representative 2/C, and considered a shift worker under paragraph 3 below, and any assigned work on that day will be considered as an overtime assignment. The overtime assignment will be made in accordance with Exhibit 17 of the Labor Agreement (no later than two weeks prior to the holiday to be worked), from the combined overtime list of Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) and 1/C (207.2), Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0), District Representatives (No. 207.1) and Commercial Specialists (No. 206.0). If after going through the list tn the district where the overtime is required, no one accepts the scheduled overtime, then the Commercial Representative -Special(s) (No. 207.0) and Commercial Representative(s) 2/C (No. 207.3) with more than 18 months’ experience as a Commercial Representative 2/C (No. 207.3), and considered a shift worker under paragraph 3 below, who is/are the lowest on the scheduled overtime list in that district will be selected and will be assigned to work.
266
+ Exhibit 95 (Cont’d)
3.	Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) in progression to Commercial Representative - Specials (No. 207.0), who have completed 18 months as Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3), will be considered a shift employee in accordance with Article III C of the Labor Agreement. The third sentence of Article III C of the Local 320 Labor Agreement will be amended to read as follows:
“Commercial Representatives Special, Commercial Representative 2/C (with more than 18 months’ experience as a Commercial Representative 2/C and in progression to Commercial Representative Special), Service Worker and Production Plant Cleaners shall be considered shift employees, but their hours of work need not conform to the foregoing schedule.”
The Commercial Representative 2/C (207.3) job specification will be amended as set forth in Attachment 1.
4.	The maximum number of Commercial Representative -Specials (No. 207.0) and/or Commercial Representatives 2/C (No. 207.3) (who have completed 18 months as Commercial Representatives 2/C (No 207.3) and are considered shift employees) will not exceed 24. This however, is not a commitment to permanent manning.
5.	Employees assigned to the classification of Commercial Representative - Collector (No. 207.6), on June 30,1991, will be assigned to work between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.; and, if requested by management, may accept assignments to work between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. All individuals who enter or reenter this classification, on and after July 1,1991, will be assigned to work between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. All aforementioned assignments in this paragraph 5, will include a 30 minute break for a regularly scheduled meal as stipulated in Article III E of the 320 Agreement.
6.	The Company will provide the required training to individuals who are assigned to lock and unlock meters.
7.	The Company will extend 1987 #28 (Exhibit C paragraph 6) as it relates to District Representatives (No. 207.1) for the term of the Labor Agreement. Additionally, the Company will continue to review its needs for District Representatives (No. 207.1) in areas where a residency is required, with special consideration being given to remote areas where the Company may establish new gas franchises.

2nd Step Settlement Grievance 92-264
Without commitment to permanent staffing, with no increase in complement, the Company will post for one (1) Working Foreman/Forewoman (LES&T) in the Splicer group.
Employees in the classification of Gas Mechanic Welder 3/C, 2/C and 1/C may not bid laterally to Gas Mechanic 3/C, 2/C or 1/C until such employee completes three (3) years as Gas Mechanic Welder 1/C.

Based on Management’s assessment of its current operating needs and without precedent or prejudice to the position of either party and without agreement to permanent staffing, the Company will agree to post for an additional two (2) Working Foremen/Forewomen (LES&T) assigned to the Operations Services group.
In addition, the parties agree that one Working Foreman/Forewoman may be assigned as a “rover” provided there are a minimum of six (6) Working Foremen/Forewomen assigned to the Operations Services group.

Without prejudice to the Company’s right to use contract consultants to conduct the gas heating contractor basic combustion school, if the Company elects to conduct such school itself, it does not intend to change its current practice of assigning employees to such school as follows:
1.	One or more bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classification(s) shall be assigned to conduct the “hands-on” part, if any, of such school, the first three of which shall be Commercial Specialists (Job Spec. No. 206.0), if available. The “hands-on” part of such school shall refer to work of the type normally performed by bargaining unit employees.
2.	Management, or one or more bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classification(s) [one of which shall be a Commercial Specialist (Job Spec. No. 206.0), if available], or a combination thereof, may be assigned to conduct the lecture (and any demonstration by the lecturer incidental to the lecture) part of such school.
3.	If Commercial Specialists are not available where required above and other bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classification(s) are assigned, no such employee shall be upgraded. If Management elects to assign bargaining unit employees of the appropriate job classifications(s) in addition to those Commercial Specialists referred to above, no such employee shall be upgraded.

Settlement in Local 320 Grievance 92-234
In settlement of the above mentioned Grievance, the parties agree as follows:
278
+ Exhibit 105 (Cont’d)
The maximum time in grade of an Equipment Operator (No, 102.2) to Equipment Operator - Dynamite Handler (No. 102.3) will be reduced from 36 months to 24 months. If such employee qualifies as an Equipment Operator - Dynamite Handler, such employee will be placed in Pay Group 16 until such time as such employee obtains any required qualification and/or certification or license (collectively the “license”) which is required to handle and use explosives; at which time such employee shall be placed in Pay Group 17. Such employee shall apply for such a license when he/she is first eligible to do so and shall take the next available examination. Failure to so obtain and maintain such license will result in removal of such employee from the employee’s then classification. Job Specifications No. 102.2 and 102.3 shall be amended to reflect the foregoing.
In consideration of such time in grade reduction, the parties confirm the long-standing principle that any employee in an automatic progression series can perform, without upgrade (except as otherwise provided for in the Labor Agreement), any job of a higher classification in that automatic progression series for which such employee is trained and qualified. Thus, an Equipment Operator in progression to Equipment Operator - Dynamite Handler can perform, without upgrading, any duties of an Equipment Operator -Dynamite Handler for which such employee is trained and qualified.

employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee.
e.	Such other family care reason permitted at the discretion of the Company.
In the event the reason that an employee was granted a Family Care Leave of Absence changes or no longer qualifies under paragraph 1a, b, c, d, or e above, the Leave shall be considered invalid and the employee shall return to work within a reasonable period of time not to exceed five (5) working days from the date of such change or cessation of qualification unless there are extenuating circumstances necessitating the continuation of such Leave as approved by the employee’s supervisor.
2.	Family Care Leave of Absence shall be permitted for a maximum period of up to six (6) months. Any Leave time in excess of the federally mandated 12 weeks, must be taken consecutively. There shall be a one-year (1) waiting period from the last day of the Family Care Leave of Absence previously taken before the TOC employee would be eligible for another Family Care Leave of Absence except such employee would be eligible for a Leave of Absence pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (not to exceed 12 weeks) measured from the first day the previous Leave of Absence started.

3.	Family Care Leave of Absence shall be permitted for a maximum of up to 12 weeks during any 12-month period. Such 12-month period shall be measured from the first day the Leave of Absence is started.
Notice requesting a Leave of Absence and stating the reason therefore shall be given to the employee’s immediate supervisor, at least 30 days, or when the reason for such absence is to begin in less than 30 days, such notice as is practicable, in advance of such requested leave period, unless unforeseen circumstances dictate otherwise. Employees who believe that their reason for requesting a Family Care Leave of Absence is of such a nature as to be inappropriate to discuss with their immediate supervisor may give the reason for such Leave of Absence to the Human Resources Division and only the notice of such Leave need be given to their immediate supervisor.
4.	a.	Leave of Absence under paragraphs 2A and B above
shall not be taken on a reduced leave schedule or intermittently unless the employee and Company agree otherwise. The reasons for denial of a reduced leave schedule or intermittent leave schedule will be discussed with the employee by Human Resources, if requested.
b.	Leave under paragraphs 2C and D above may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary.
c.	If an employee requests an intermittent Leave of Absence, or such Leave on a reduced leave schedule that is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the Company may require such employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that has equivalent pay and benefits.
5.	Any employee granted a Leave of Absence of less than 12 weeks may request an extension to bring the total leave to 12 weeks subject to the following condition:
Such extension shall be granted for any reason set forth in 2 above and provided that notice to request such extension is received by the employee’s immediate supervisor before the end of the first requested Leave of Absence. Employees who believe that their
Exhibit 108 (Cont’d)293
reason for requesting an extension of a Family Care Leave of Absence is of such a nature as to be inappropriate to discuss with their immediate supervisor may give the reason for such Leave of Absence to the Human Resources Division and only the notice of such Leave need be given to their immediate supervisor.
6.	The Company may require that a request for a Leave of Absence under paragraphs 2C and D above be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of the eligible employee or of the son, daughter, spouse or parent of the employee as appropriate.
7.	Employees on a Family Care Leave of Absence will be continued in all Benefit Programs and will be permitted to prepay their contributions if necessary to the Group Life Insurance Plan for the period of such Leave of Absence. The extension of these benefits will be coordinated by the appropriate supervisor with Human Resources and the Payroll Section. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary the following will be applicable during any such Leave of Absence:
Vacation entitlement for all employees is accrued for a completed calendar month of service on a 10-month basis starting with July of each year for vacation to be taken in the following calendar year. Employees on Family Care Leave of Absence or Leave of Absence under Article VIIIJ of the Labor Agreement will accrue vacation entitlement. However, such employees will forfeit 1/1 Oth of their vacation entitlement for each month while on such Leaves of Absence with the exception of the first and last calendar months of such Leaves of Absence, regardless of when any such Leave begins and ends in those calendar months. With reference to Leaves of Absence granted under VIII J, such employees will, under no circumstances forfeit more than 8/10ths of their entitlement.
Retirement Income Plan benefits shall accrue, except as may otherwise be provided under such Plan.
294
Exhibit 108 (Cont’d)
No holiday entitlement shall accrue, unless the holiday falls on the first or last day of such Leave, provided such employee returns to work immediately after completion of such Leave, in which case such employee will receive full pay for the holiday.
No payments will be made under the Company’s Disability Benefits Plan for any period of illness or sickness which occurs during such Leave of Absence, except to the extent such payments may be required under the New York Disability Benefits Law.
8.	An employee requesting to return from such Family Care Leave of Absence before the completion of such Leave may do so with at least five (5) working days’ prior notice to his/her immediate supervisor.
9.	When the employee returns from a Family Care Leave of Absence, he/she shall be returned, subject to the provisions of the Labor Agreement, to the same job classification, pay step, pay group and headquarters from which he/she left when the Family Care Leave of Absence was taken.
10.	Time taken as Leave of Absence will not be subtracted from
the total weeks Leave of Absence to which an employee is entitled under Article VIII, Section J, of the T&D and TOC Labor Agreements.
11.	An employee will be required to utilize all unused vacation except five (5) days for the current calendar year in which the Leave of Absence starts as the first part of the 12 weeks (or any lesser amount thereof) Leave of Absence for Leaves of Absence granted pursuant to paragraphs 2A, B and C above. For example, if an employee has 4 weeks of unused vacation at the time a Leave of Absence is granted, the employee will use 3 weeks’ vacation and 9 weeks’ Leave of Absence for the 12 week Leave of Absence total.
If a holiday(s) falls during the period of vacation being utilized as part of a Family Care Leave of Absence, such holiday(s) will be paid as a holiday and the vacation period will be extended the appropriate number of holidays which occurred.
Exhibit 108 (Cont’d}
295
12.	During a Leave of Absence, service and seniority shall continue to accumulate. If the employee overstays such leave without consent of the Company, or accepts employment elsewhere without consent of the Company, employment with the Company shall be deemed to have been terminated by the employee’s resignation on the date of such overstay or acceptance of employment.
13.	Written notification shall be provided to the President and Business Manager of Local 320 on each January 1 and July 1 of the number of employees requesting Leave of Absence, both granted and denied according to the above provisions and the duration of such leaves, including any which were extended according to the terms of such Leave of Absence.
14.	An employee may bid for posted positions during the period of posting and/or accept posted positions while on Family Care Leave of Absence. The acceptance of any job while on Leave of Absence is valid provided the employee returns to work within 31 calendar days of such acceptance. This provision shall not alter paragraphs 3, 4 or 8 of this agreement. An employee who bids for and/or accepts a posted position while on Leave of Absence shall still have the two-week returnable rights (reference in Article IV F 6 of the T&D Labor Agreement and Article IV E 10 of the TOC Labor Agreement) to their former position. However, if the employee elects to return to their former position, their Leave of Absence will have been terminated except as may be provided in the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
15.	Employees in an automatic progression series classification or employees under Article IV F 5 of the T&D Labor Agreement or Article IV E 7 of the TOC Labor Agreement shall have their progression time or their training time, respectively, extended an equivalent amount of time to the amount of time off on Leave of Absence, unless such employee requests to waive this extension of a) the entire amount of time, or b) one-half the amount of time taken; provided, however, that employees under Article IV F 5 of the T&D Labor Agreement or Article IV E 7 of the TOC Labor Agreement shall not have their training time extended beyond the time remaining for completion of their training time under such Article.

ASSIGNMENT OF VEHICLES
1.	This Agreement is made for the term of the Labor Agreement commencing 7/1/98.
2.	Item 29 of the 1977 Memorandum of Agreement is hereby superseded by this document for the term of the Agreement.
3.	The Company will offer vehicles to Commercial Representatives, District Representatives and Commercial Specialists as designated below to be taken home and used for commutation between their home and their work headquarters. All District Representatives (207.1), District Representatives Special (207.7), Commercial Specialists (206.0), Commercial Representatives 1/C (207.2), Commercial Representative - Special (207.0) and Commercial Representatives 2/C (207.3) with 18 months’ time in grade will be offered a vehicle, provided that each such employee has a 30% or greater response record under the Callout Response Program.
+ Exhibit 110 (Cont’d)301
Any individual so assigned a vehicle (including those previously assigned a vehicle who thereafter became ineligible for such assignment) will be required to pay the fleet operating rate (at a rate of $.18 at April 30,2003) for all their commutation miles to and from work. Such rate may be adjusted annually each July 1 by the Company to be at the same rate charged to Management employees. However, such rate shall not be adjusted beyond $.18 during the term of the Labor Agreement.
However, those 34 employees assigned vehicles, on June 30, 1998, will not be subject to such costs, so long as they continue to be assigned a vehicle and they do not transfer (including by promotion) from the headquarters to which they are assigned as of July 1, 1998; if they become ineligible for such an assignment and thereafter become eligible, they shall be subject to such costs.
4.	The Company will review the callout response record, as determined under the Callout Response Program, (for the past 12-month review period, July 1 through June 30) of employees who are assigned, or eligible to be assigned, such vehicles on such annual basis on July 1 of each year. Copies of such records will be provided to the President and Business Manager of Local Union 320, I.B.E.W. Employees who have a callout response record below 30% under the Callout Response Program (dated 8/11/93) will become ineligible for the assignment of a vehicle for the next 12-month review period commencing July 1 except as provided for by the following:
(i)	If the employee’s callout response record is below 20%, the employee will become ineligible for assignment of a vehicle for the next 12-month review period. For any subsequent review period, if the employee’s response record is 30% or higher, the employee will be offered a vehicle.
(ii)	If the employee’s callout response record is below 30%, but is 20% or higher, the employee will remain eligible for the assignment of a vehicle for the next 12-month review period. If the employee’s callout response record during this subsequent period is 30% or higher, the employee will retain the vehicle. If the employee’s callout response record during this subsequent period is below 30%, or if the employee has previously been permitted to retain the vehicle under this paragraph (ii), the employee will become
302
+ Exhibit 110 (Cont’d)
ineligible for the assignment of a vehicle and will be treated as provided for in paragraph (i) above.
5.	The Company maintains the right to call employees who can respond most promptly in cases of a nature which, in the consideration of Management (which includes System Operations and the Control Center outside of an employee’s basis work week), require immediate attention. This includes the right to call employees out of turn on a callout list and to call employees who live closest to the problem regardless of the callout list they are on.
6.	All callouts will be made in accordance with Exhibit +17 and Item 16 of the 1962 Memorandum of Agreement.
7,	Reserved.
8.	Reserved
9.	Company radios shall	be	left on while commuting between
home and work headquarters	and	vice	versa.	Employees
will communicate their departure and arrival information over the radio in accordance with the Company Radio Procedure. Employees called out on the Company radio prior to, or following, the employees’ basic workday will be paid fora callout in accordance with the terms of the Labor Agreement.
10.	Any employee who is assigned a vehicle will require a minimum of 23 callout attempts over the 12-month review period referenced in Section 4 above before his/her callout response record will be utilized to determine his/her eligibility to retain a vehicle under this Agreement.
11.	Except as provided in this Agreement, all employees covered by this Agreement will continue to be subject to the terms of the Callout Response Program dated 8/11/93.
12.	If an employee and his/her supervisor cannot resolve issues
related to the assignment of vehicles pursuant to this Agreement, these issues will be submitted to the President and Business Manager of Local 320, and the Company’s Manager of Labor Relations and Benefits.
Exhibit 111
303
Exhibit 111 July 1, 1998
The Company will continue the past practice of permitting the incumbent (as of 7/1/98) Union Presidents and Business Managers to take time off without pay (but with continuation of benefits) for Union Business (“UB”) and of paying for Company-related Union Business (“Co/UB”) for each Union President and Business Manager. The Company will continue this custom and practice for such incumbents while either or both remain in any “Local Union Position” (as defined below).
If there is only one incumbent in a Local Union Position and a second employee is elected or appointed to serve in a Local Union Position, the Company will pay for the Company/UB and the Company work time and one-half the premiums for the Health, Dental and Vision Plans for such second employee as well as continuing such second employee in the Group Life Insurance Plan and Retirement Income Plan at the Company’s cost. Such second employee shall be eligible to participate in SIP. Any coverage for such second employee will be subject to any required employee contribution except that no such contribution will be required for Health Benefit Plan coverage.
When such incumbents are no longer in Local Union Positions the Company will continue such past practice for no more than (1) representative of the Local Union, taking both Locals as a whole, and such representative shall be either the President and Business Manager, the Assistant Business Manager or the Business Representative (“Local Union Positions”) provided that any such individual has a membership of 50% or more of Company employees.
If the two incumbents are no longer in a Local Union Position and if a second employee is elected or appointed to serve in a Local Union Position and does not continue to work in his/her normal Company classification, such employee’s salary for Company/UB and UB and all holidays, vacation, personal time and sick time and all benefit plan premiums will be paid by the Union provided that any such individual is an employee of the Company and further provided that the Local Union of such individual has a membership of 50% or more of Company employees. Such second employee will be continued in the Retirement Income Plan at the Company’s cost. Such employee shall be eligible to participate in SIP.

304
Exhibit 111 (Cont’d)
If an employee who is elected or appointed to serve in one of the Local Union Positions continues to work in his/her normal Company classification (works four consecutive hours or more of his/her job in a day) the parties will meet to fully discuss what amendments to these provisions are necessary in that particular case.
There will be no change to the practice of allowing additional employees (not in Local Union Positions) to be released for unpaid UB or paid Co/UB with prior notice to the Company by the appropriate Local Union.
If employees of Central Hudson do not make up more than 50% of the membership of a particular Local Union, employees who choose to remain in their Local Union Positions (in that Local Union) full time will be placed on a leave of absence under Article VIII 1.2., not to exceed two years, but will not receive any benefits during that period of time except that they would continue to participate in the Retirement Income Plan, subject to the provisions thereof. Such employees will have returnable rights to the Company for a maximum of two years unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
The Leave of Absence provisions of Article VIII I. 2. and any other provisions of this Exhibit will not extend to employees elected/appointed to Local Union Positions if the existing Locals become combined with a Labor Union not currently representing Company employees. The Leave of Absence provisions in Article VIII 1.2. and any other provisions of this Exhibit will not extend to employees appointed as International Representatives unless otherwise mutually agreed to.

(Amended July 1,1998)
(Amended 5/1/2003)
Construction Maintenance Job Area Reporting Program
1.	In consideration for increasing the pay of Construction Maintenance Man/Woman 1/C to Pay Group 17.1 and Chief Construction Maintenance Man/Woman to Pay Group 19.1 (top step only), the Company will expand the duties of Construction Maintenance personnel to perform general construction work associated with site preparation, construction and demolition of structures (including
+ Exhibit 112 (Cont’d)
305
buildings, substations and poles), trenching, earth moving, and property maintenance.
2.	The Pay Group of Chief Construction Maintenance Man/Woman shall be increased to Pay Group 19.1 (top step only); the pay group of Construction Maintenance Man/Woman 1/C shall be increased to Pay Group 17.1.
3.	The Company shall have the right to assign Construction Maintenance personnel ^temporarily to any job site with sanitary facilities, drinking water and provision for storage out of the weather, prior to job site reporting or temporarily to any of the existing normally staffed Company headquarters, in each case within a radius of 20 miles of the employee's assigned headquarters. It is agreed that both the existing Ellenville and Stanfordville headquarters shall be included with the existing normally staffed Company headquarters to which Construction Maintenance personnel may be temporarily assigned under this agreement. Those assigned Construction Maintenance personnel will report at the beginning of the work day to and be dismissed at the end of the work day from that temporary job site or temporary headquarters.
Additionally, when required to report to a job area within said 20-mile radius other than the employee’s assigned headquarters, the employee will be reimbursed for travel costs related to any additional tolls and any additional mileage from the employee’s home to the designated job area in excess of the mileage from his or her home to the assigned headquarters. Reimbursement will be based on the road miles driven and paid in accordance with the mileage rate established in Article V P of the Labor Agreement.
For the purpose of job site reporting, projects must start with a minimum of 3 consecutive days and also have an estimated completion date. In order to equitably distribute overtime, job site reporting projects that last longer than 3 months or that are suspended for longer than 4 weeks will be reassigned to available rovers based on the then current rover list.
Mobilization and de-mobilization will be on Company time.
A pointer, similar to callouts will rotate among the Construction Maintenance Men/Women within the District, based on the number to be assigned which is declared by
306
+ Exhibit 112 (Cont’d)
management. The foregoing excludes the Chief Construction Maintenance Man/Woman (141.8).
Notification will be at least 5 working days and “swaps” will be allowed within 48 hours. Swaps between employees are confined to employees assigned to the same headquarters unless approved by management. An employee already assigned to a roving job cannot swap out of such job assignment without permission of management.
The Company retains the right to declare, from the roving list, the number of employees required to “rove” and from which district or districts they will be chosen.
4.	In addition, the duties of these two job classifications will be expanded as set forth in the revised Exhibit 19 and the revised job specifications attached thereto. This will allow the performance of skilled maintenance and construction work at any of the Company’s offices, properties, rights-of-way, or plants, in accordance with such attached revised job descriptions.
5.	Reserved.
6.	Employees in job specification numbers 141.8, 128.1 and
128.2 will be eligible for the 6-month Family Care Leave of Absence Program.
Exhibit 113
(Grievance 1993-20 & 21)
The Company will reimburse the grievants for their 2nd CDL permit application fee.
Without precedent or prejudice to the position of either party, the parties agree that Central Hudson is only obligated to pay for the initial CDL permit application and initial road test.

(07/01/98)
(Amended 5/1/2003)
The following will be effective upon the sale/transfer of both of the Company’s fossil fueled production plants:
Exhibit 114 (Cont’d)307
For the purpose of this program only, the Company is willing to permit a full-time employee of the Company whose driver’s license has been suspended/revoked to transfer to the position of Cleaning Worker until the employee’s driver’s license is restored. Employees who lose or have their driver’s license suspended/revoked for other than medical reasons (which are unrelated to substance or alcohol abuse), will be assigned to the position of Cleaning Worker under the following conditions:
1.	Consistent with the operating needs of the Company, a limited number of positions of Cleaning Workers at South Road shall be made available. If because of such limitation, no such position is available to such an employee, the Company and Union shall mutually agree on an alternate assignment that can be performed in Pay Group 10 where the requirement to have a driver’s license can be waived.
2.	Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 1 above, employeeswill be assigned to the classification of Cleaning Worker at South Road at Pay Group 10 (Step 3) if the position from which the employee comes is in Pay Group 10 or greater otherwise at their existing Pay Group, with a 40-hour basic workweek and the benefits of a full-time employee. An employee so assigned will be paid at Pay Group 10 for a period of three (3) years after which the pay will be reduced to the rate for Cleaning Worker (139.1). During such assignment, the requirement to have a valid driver’s license will be waived.
3.	Such employees may be assigned to a work schedule in accordance with the job specification and Labor Agreement.
4.	Employees who have their driver’s license restored within two (2) years of the suspension/revocation shall be returned to their former classification, headquarters and pay applicable thereto. After two (2) years, the employee must bid a classification to be transferred out of the Cleaning Worker’s position.
5.	Any employee who has his/her driver’s license suspended/revoked a second time in his/her career shall be assigned to the classification of Cleaning Worker and pay applicable thereto. Any such employee who had his/her driver’s license suspended/revoked a second time will not be returned to his/her former classification except through the post and bid procedure.
308________________________________________Exhibit 114 (Cont’d)
6.	Any employee who has his/her driver’s license suspended/revoked a third time may be discharged.
7.	Any such employee who elects not to transfer to the position of Cleaning Worker shall be subject to discharge.
8.	The TOC job specification of Cleaning Worker is not required to have a valid driver’s license. Cleaning Workers who possess a valid driver’s license may be assigned to operate a Company vehicle to perform duties consistent with their job specification. All of the job specifications, except Cleaning Worker will be amended to include the following language: Must possess and maintain a valid driver’s license.
If a long-term employee has not maintained a driver’s license, the Company will consider the circumstances of that employee and their job duties and will give consideration to waiving the license requirement for such individual.
9.	Item 1977-M24 will be amended to include the following sentence: In the event a temporary position is posted as a result of backfilling a vacancy created by an employee losing their driver’s license, such one-year period may be extended up to an additional year upon the mutual agreement of the Union Business Manager and the Company’s Labor Relations Manager.
10,	Employees who have had their driver’s license suspended/revoked for reasons other than drug or alcohol violations shall be transferred in accordance with the terms of Exhibit 114. However, such employee’s pay shall not be reduced to the Cleaning Worker level for a period not to exceed 90 days in order for the employee to deal with the appropriate authorities concerning the reinstatement of such driver’s license. Such 90-dav suspension of the pay reduction will be valid only as long as such employee notified the Company of such loss of license immediately following his/her knowledge of such loss.

CALLOUT RESPONSE PROGRAM For T&D Employees
I.	Purpose
Timely and effective callout response by all Central Hudson employees to emergency and other work situations is an essential ingredient in providing safe and reliable gas and electric service to our customers. The purpose of this Program is to improve the present level of callout response and to maintain adequate callout response to provide safe and reliable service to customers.
II.	Scope
This Program is designed to standardize the method of calculating callout response records for each T&D employee as well as the procedure for addressing employees who fail to maintain an acceptable callout response record as defined by this Program-
All T&D employees are subject to the provisions of this program and will be required to accept a minimum of 20% of the calls chargeable to him/her during the review period in order to be considered to have an acceptable callout response record.
E X H
III.	Definitions
A. The number of calls accepted as a percentage of calls made will be used to determine callout response. The callout data to be maintained and calls charged to an employee’s record will be as follows:
1.	Total calls made.
2.	Total calls accepted.
3.	Total calls refused.
322
+ Exhibit 124 (Cont’d)
4.	Total calls unavailable or no response.
a. No answer (minimum of 10 rings), b. Line busy.
c. Not home (including responses by answering machines).
Note: 1. An employee will be charged with only one call categorized as not available or no answer and not home for repeated calls within any four-hour time period, subject to a maximum of two chargeable calls in any calendar day,
2.	A. All “platform calls” (i.e. callouts made to employees at the headquarters prior to the start of the workday) shall be included in calculating an employee’s callout response record. A reasonable attempt will be made to distribute such “platform calls” equitably to available employees. Employees accepting “platform calls” will receive a skip unless they were called first in rotation.
B.	Any callout made to an employee after the end of the workday while the employee is still at the work headquarters shall be included in calculating an employee’s callout response record.
3.	Employees may leave a forwarding telephone number with the Company at any time to enable the Company to contact them instead of trying to call them at home. Also, an employee may give the Company a second telephone number where the employee may be reached.
4.	An employee who is mistakenly passed over in the callout process shall be credited with an acceptable call and maintain his/her position on the callout list. If an employee is called out of turn and accepts, he/she will receive a skip.
5.	If an employee returns a call within fifteen minutes of being called by Central Hudson and the need for such an employee still exists and the employee accepts, the employee will receive credit for the call. If the need no longer exists, the employee will still be charged for the original call.
+ Exhibit 124 (Cont’d)
323
B. Employees will be taken off the call list on the day(s) of an absence until the start of the next calendar day (midnight) when full days are charged to the following, unless the employee notifies the Company they wish to remain on the callout list.

2.	Personal Dav
3.	Leave of Absence
4.	Union Business/Companv-Union Business
5.	Jury Duty
6.	Death in the Family
7.	Military Leave
8.	Illness or Injury (Employees	who report to work and
subseguently leave due to illness or injury will also be removed from the call list until the start of the next calendar day. Employees who are called the next calendar day after being absent due to illness/injury and who indicate they are still ill/iniured will not be charged for such call).
9.	Vacation - When vacation is charged for a full week (40 hours within one payroll week), the employee will be removed from the call list for the entire payroll week plus the last portion of their last work day and the remainder of that calendar week and the next Sunday (for example, a day worker will be removed from the call list from 4:30 PM Friday to 11:59 PM the following Sunday), In addition, when an employee is charged for a full payroll week of vacation, any other vacation days or scheduled days off which are contiguous with the payroll week vacation period shall also be included in the time when an employee is removed from the callout list. For example, when an employee takes vacation on Friday and the following Monday through Friday, and the next Monday the employee will be removed from the callout list from the end of their last workday (e.g. 4:30 PM on the first Thursday through 11:59 PM the second Monday). Employees who take a full week of vacation which includes a holiday or holidays will be taken off the call list for the entire payroll week plus the last portion of their last work day and the remainder of that calendar week (e.g. 4:30 PM Friday to 11:59 PM the second Sunday).

E.	A refused call will not be charged to an employee’s record if the employee is called during a rest period.
F.	A call will not be charged to an employee’s record if direct contact is not made with the employee if the employee is called a) during the first hour immediately following the completion of work or b) during the first hour immediately prior to the commencement of a scheduled work period. This one-hour grace period is designed to recognize the travel time required for employees to reach home from work or work from home.
G.	A call will not be charged to an employee’s record if the employee is called while working. The Company will make every effort not to call an employee who is already working.
IV.	When physical limitations or hardship cases might preclude an employee from responding to callouts, the Company will review each case in advance and make reasonable allowances. However, in no case will permanent exceptions be made. The President and Business Manager of Local 320 will be advised of exceptions made under this paragraph.
V.	Administration
A.	An acceptable callout response record shall be an acceptance rate of a minimum of 20% of the total calls made to the employee during the review period. A cap of 30 chargeable calls shall be used so that an employee shall have met the 20% minimum acceptance rate when he/she has accepted 6 calls within the first 30 chargeable calls; if an employee has met the 20% acceptance rate within the first 30 chargeable calls or has accepted a minimum of nine (9) calls, he/she shall not be subject to the 20% minimum acceptance rate during the remainder of the applicable

4.	Applicants will be required to be fluent in the language specified in the Notice and such competency shall be demonstrated through a jointly administered examination.
5.	Any CSR who may request an upgrade due to intermittent use of a second language shall notify Supervision in advance of the language they are capable of speaking. In the event that any Customer Service Representative reasonably determines during a telephone conversation
Memorandum of Agreement
419
to use bi-lingual skills in any language other than English, such CSR shall be compensated at an upgraded rate for a minimum of one hour. In the event there are numerous phone calls during the course of a workday each call will receive an upgrade; provided however, the maximum number of upgrades for the use of bi-lingual skills in any one day is two.
6.	This Agreement does not modify any other agreement in the Labor Agreement as the agreements may pertain to the various Customer Service Representative job classifications.
7.	The Company has no obligation to provide any language training to any individual in this program.
8.	Item 1987-25 shall not apply to CSRs in job specifications 350.8 and 350.9.

A part-time CSR who is called out in accordance with 1987-50 will be compensated at the prevailing overtime rate for all hours worked outside their normal schedule and it shall not be considered as a reschedule of their work schedule. In the event such CSR-PT declines such callout it shall not be counted as one of the 4 unavailables within any 30 day period under Exhibit 54 of the Labor Agreement.
For the term of the Labor Agreement commencing 5/1/03, Item 50 of the 1987 Memorandum of Agreement will be amended to read as follows:

Procedure for Covering Absences of Service Workers in the Kingston, Newburgh, and Poughkeepsie Districts
The following procedure shall be followed when covering absences of Service Workers.
All Service Worker A's and Service Worker B's (assigned to a shift) in the District are eligible to be called for any shift. Service Worker B's will only be called to cover a shift if a Service Worker A is scheduled to work the same shift. Service Worker B's will not be assigned to cover a shift alone or be paired with another Service Worker B.
1.	Call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on their first day off.
2.	Call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on their second day off.
3.	Assign, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the prior shift to work an additional four hours and call, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the following shift to report to work fours hours ahead of such Service Worker’s scheduled shift. The selection of the Service Worker to work an additional four hours shall be made from the scheduled overtime list. The selection of the Service Worker to report to work four hours early shall be made from the callout list.
4.	Assign, if available, a Service Worker in the District on the prior shift to work eight additional hours. The selection of such Service Worker shall be made from the scheduled overtime list.
5.	Call, if available, a Service Worker on the following shift to report to work eight hours early. The selection of the Service Worker shall be made from the call out list.
The off Service Worker is defined as a Service Worker who is not scheduled to work for the entire calendar day and shall be called using the callout list. Consideration shall be given to the Service Worker's respective position on the list and the number of skips already assigned to each Service Worker. If a 11 el ig i bl e
Memorandum of Agreement 431
Service Workers have the same number of skips they shall be called in the order they appear on the call out list. If the Service Workers have different numbers of skips, the Service Worker with the lowest number of skips shall be called first. (See Example)
A skip shall be applied to those Service Workers called to work. No skip shall be applied if the pointer was at a Service Worker called. Skips are only removed when the pointer moves past a Service Worker during a normal call out.
If, after going through the above procedure, no Service Worker is available to cover a shift and the Company has determined that coverage is required, the shift may be filled in accordance with the terms of Exhibit 74 of the Labor Agreement.
Pay and meals for the employee called shall be administered in accordance with Exhibit 32 of the Labor Agreement.
EXAMPLE
The following example is a call out to fill an unscheduled Service Worker vacancy. The call out order would be SW 3, SW 2, and then SW 1. In this example SW 3 accepted the call. SW 3's skip total will be increased by one. SW 1 and SW 2's skip total will remain unchanged.
