1.	GENERAL,.CLERKS
There shall not be any limitation or restriction on either the nature or the amount of bargaining unit work that may be performed by employees that are employed in the “General Clerk” classification of employment except that such employees shall not be assigned the duties and responsibilities of a department head.
Employees that are employed in the "General Clerk” classification will neither be scheduled nor employed more than thirty-two (32) hours in a workweek except in the case of emergencies beyond the Employer’s control, including but not limited to employee absences, temporary increases in business, etc., in which a store does not have sufficient qualified employees available to perform the work.
2.	OVER-RATIQ
Effective January 4, 1987, the Employer will implement the hours ratio in Article 7 Seniority. No employee will be promoted to full-time until all stores have achieved a proper ratio and the Employer shall have the right to transfer employees by seniority to achieve ratio balance. Any employee who chooses not to transfer a reasonable distance to maintain a forty (40) hour schedule or refuses a full-time job, such employee will be reclassified to the proper rate of pay (General Clerk, Prepared Food Clerk, Non-Food Clerk) with the next immediate schedule.
Over ratio employees will retain their average of hours (which may fluctuate over a four (4) week period) which they worked during the calendar year 1986, unless such employee is replacing an employee on a leave of absence. Such assurance shall not apply if such employees are displaced due to store closings, fire, flood, loss of sales due to the opening of a major competitor, etc., beyond the control of the Employer.
Hours added to the store because of increased sales, resignation of another employee, etc., will be assigned to the General Clerk classification at the discretion of management until the ratio of hours has been achieved.

Mr. William H. Hopkins President

Dear Mr. Hopkins,
This Letter of Agreement should be attached to and become part of the Agreement between UFCW Local #455 and Kroger Texas L. P. titled Houston Clerks, effective upon ratification through April 3, 2004.
The Employer agrees to meet once per quarter to discuss and resolve issues surrounding the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The above captioned meeting will be between the Manager of Human Resources and the Vice President of Operations for Kroger Texas L. P., Southwest Marketing Area and the President of the UFCW, Local #455. The parties may include other representatives as deemed necessary.
Sincerely,
Charles Barfield
Human Resources Manager

April 2, 2000
Mr. William H. Hopkins President UFCW Local #455 121 Northpoint Drive Houston, TX 77060
Dear Mr. Hopkins,
The following Agreements should be attached to and become part of the Agreement between Local No. 455, United Food and Commercial Workers and Kroger Texas L. R, effective April 2, 2000 through April 3, 2004.
Non-Food Work
This Agreement will confirm discussions which took place during our 1981 contract negotiations regarding the identification of Non-Food work in our stores. The concern of the Union at the time stemmed around an arbitration case between a Denver Company and the Denver Local of the UFCW which took place as a result of that company making wholesale transfers of items to their Non-Food departments.
As stated in those negotiations, it is not the intention of Kroger Texas L. R to take the position of the Denver company. We do not plan to declare everything non-edible as non-food for the purpose of classifying work. At the same time, as we have discussed, merchandising decisions from time to time dictate the greatest sales potential can be achieved on a particular product by changing location and merchandising responsibility from food to non-food or vice-versa. Therefore, we must maintain flexibility for some movement to achieve what is best for the Company, our employees, and members of the bargaining unit, that of maximizing sales achievement. Nothing contained in either the above agreement or this letter shall be construed or interpreted as limiting or impairing such flexibility.
I hope the above clarifications of intent will settle any concerns you may have.
51
San Antonio Jurisdiction
This Agreement will confirm the intent of the parties regarding the San Antonio Contract as it relates to the jurisdiction.
The intent of the parties is:
1.	The parties agree That Lucal #455 will retain jurisdiction coverage of the San Antonio Contract.
2.	Company and Union agree to bargain a new contract if a new store is opened in one of the jurisdiction counties.
Nacogdoches and Angelina Coverage
This Agreement will confirm the intent of the parties regarding coverage of Nacogdoches and Angelina Counties by UFCW Local #455, Houston, TX.
The intent of the parties is:
1.	The Employers present location, Store #990 & Store #566, Nacogdoches, TX, will continue to be covered by the Agreement between the parties known as the Houston Clerk Agreement.
2,	Future stores of the Employer in the above named counties would be covered by the Agreement between the parties known as the Outstate Clerk Agreement.
