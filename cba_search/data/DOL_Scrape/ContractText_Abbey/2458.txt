THIS AGREEMENT, dated the 15th day of August, 2016 is by and between FOURINOX, INC., 1015 Centennial Drive, Green Bay, Wisconsin, or its successor or assigns, hereinafter referred to as the "Employer" or "Company", and LOCAL LODGE NO. 177, of THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF BOILERMAKERS, IRON SHIP BUILDERS, BLACKSMITHS, FORGERS AND HELPERS, hereinafter referred to as the "Union", and this Agreement embodies the sole agreement between the aforementioned parties.
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Company and the Union have engaged in collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of work, and other conditions of employment on behalf of those employees who constitute the bargaining unit as hereafter set forth:
NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby mutually agreed between the Company and the Union as follows:
ARTICLE 1	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1	Purpose. It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to set forth herein the entire agreement covering rates of pay, wages, and hours of employment, to be observed in good faith between the parties hereto, and to provide procedure for the prompt peaceful settlement of all differences, alleged grievances, and disputes which may arise between the Company and its employees or the Union, to the end that there shall be no interruption or impeding of the production process, work stoppages, strikes or other interferences with production during the life of this Agreement.
1.2	Union Recognition and Security.
1.2.1	Recognition. The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to wages, hours of employment, and other conditions of employment, for all of the Company's hourly paid production and maintenance employees employed at the Company's plant at 1015 Centennial Street, Green Bay, Wisconsin, but excluding office and plant clerical employees, professional employees, guards, foremen, supervisory employees, technical employees, research and development employees and engineering employees, as defined in the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
1.2.2	Union Membership. All existing and newly hired employees (hired after the ratification date of this Agreement) may, during the continuance of this agreement or any extension thereof, voluntarily become members of the Union in good standing immediately following the one hundred twenty (120) days worked from the date of their hiring. Employees who wish to opt out of the Union may, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Company and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. In the event the current Wisconsin Right to Work law is ruled to be invalid, the Union and the Company will meet within sixty (60) days and confer regarding the impact of the ruling on this provision and the wording of the voluntary authorization.
1.2.3	The Company agrees, upon written voluntary authorization of any Union member to deduct from the first paycheck of each month initiation fees, dues, and such other uniform obligations owed to the Union as may be legally deducted, except that initiation fees so authorized shall be deducted from the first paycheck following the completion of one hundred twenty (120) worked days. Deductions made in accordance with the forgoing shall be marked for deposit only and remitted to the Union officer designated by the Union.
1.2.4	The Union shall, initially, notify the Company as to the monthly sums to be deducted in accordance with the foregoing. Any subsequent change in amounts shall be certified to the Company in written form over the signatures of duly authorized officers of the Union, and shall take effect on the first paycheck following fifteen (15) days after such notification is given as may be authorized by the dues authorization.
1.2.5	The Company shall notify the Union, through the Local Financial Secretary, of all new employees who have completed one hundred twenty (120) worked days with the Company.
1.2.6	Voluntary authorization forms shall be furnished by the Union to the employees.
1.2.7	If an employee who has signed a voluntary dues authorization does not have sufficient earnings to pay his uniform obligation to the union from his first paycheck of the month as outlined above, then this amount will be deducted from the first paycheck when he has sufficient funds to pay same.
1.2.8	Indemnification. The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Company harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders, or judgments brought or issued against the Company as a result of any action taken or not taken by the Company pursuant to any written or oral communication from the Union under the provisions of this Article.
1.3	Non-Discrimination. Neither the Company nor the Union will discriminate against any employee in the administration of this Collective Bargaining Agreement because of the employee's race, color, creed, sex, age, national origin or marital status, or Union or lack of Union affiliation.
1.4	Management. All rights not abridged by the terms of this Agreement shall remain the sole rights of management including, but not limited to, the right to determine the size and make-up of the work force, hire, discipline and discharge for good cause, to transfer and to relieve employees from duty due to lack of work or for other legitimate reasons, to prescribe rules of conduct not inconsistent with this Agreement, to subcontract, and to change methods of operation or design of product. It is understood by both parties that the rights of management which are not abridged by the Agreement are not subject to grievance or arbitration. Such management rights shall not be used for the purposes of discriminating against any employee, nor shall they be applied in any manner inconsistent with any of the terms of this Agreement.
1.5	Separability. Should any portion of this Agreement conflict with Federal, State or Municipal Law or any directives issued by the President of the United States or any
authorized governmental agency, such portion of the Agreement shall be inoperative to the extent and for the period necessary to conform to the law or directive without prejudice to any other portion of the Agreement.
ARTICLE 2	SENIORITY
2.1	Seniority. Seniority shall be computed from the employee's last date of hire. Seniority is an employee's length of continuous service with the Company in days, months and years.
2.2	Orientation Period. New employees hired by the Company after the date of ratification, shall be classified as orientation employees for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days worked from the date of employment, and during such orientation period seniority rights shall not apply, and such new employees may be laid off or discharged by the Company for any reason without recourse. When the orientation period has passed, seniority shall date from an employee's last date of hire or rehire.
2.3	Lay-off and Recall.
2.3.1	In the event of a reduction in the work force, the following procedure shall be followed:
(1)	Temporary and part-time employees shall be laid-off first.
(2)	All orientation employees shall be laid-off after temporary and part-time employees.
(3)	When it becomes necessary to lay-off employees, the lay-off shall be on the basis of plant-wide seniority in inverse order within the same job classification and skill level and on recall, the employees with the most seniority will be recalled.
2.3.2	It is the responsibility of the employee to keep the Company informed of his correct home address and telephone number, and the Company shall be entitled to rely on the last address and telephone number for an employee as furnished by him to the Company.
2.3.3	Seniority will continue to accrue for three (3) years for employees who had five (5) or more years of seniority prior to the layoff. For employees with less than five (5) years of seniority prior to the layoff, their seniority will accrue for two (2) years during a layoff.
2.3.4	In cases of emergency repair or urgent work, if the senior qualified employee cannot be contacted or is unable to report in sufficient time, the next senior qualified employee may be called in for the job.
2.4	Break in Seniority. All seniority and other rights of an employee shall terminate if:
(a)	He is discharged for just cause.
(b)	He voluntarily quits.
(c)	He is absent from three (3) consecutive working days without
having given notice to the Company before the close of such three-day period, unless the employee is mentally or physically incapable of giving such notice or arranging to have such notice given for him due to illness or injury, or unless the employee has no access to a telephone, telegraph or mail due to circumstances beyond his control.
(d)	After being laid off, he fails to return to work within three (3) days after notice from the Company by telephone notification to him personally and by certified mail to the employee's last known address appearing on the Company's records, requesting him to return to work.
(e)	He overstays a leave of absence, except extenuating circumstances that prohibit his/her return which have been agreed to by the Company, however the employee must call the employer within twenty four (24) hours of the initial return date stating the extenuating circumstances and the expected return date,	or
engages in gainful employment except when special provisions shall have been made therefore in the employee's behalf by agreement between the Company and the Bargaining Committee.
(f)	He is absent from work for three (3) consecutive workdays without
good reason.
(g)	He is absent continuously for any reason, unless due to a shop injury or illness, for two (2) years if he/she had two (2) or more years of seniority with the Company prior to their absence. If the employee had less than two (2) years of seniority with the Company prior to his/her absence then the break in seniority will occur after a period of time equal to their length of service prior to the absence for any reason, unless due to a shop injury or illness.
2.5	Supervisory Positions Out of the Bargaining Unit.
2.5.1	An employee within the bargaining unit may take a supervisory position in the Company. If such employee remains in the supervisory position for more than six (6) months, he/she shall forfeit all seniority in the bargaining unit for job rights. The bargaining unit seniority for such employee shall continue to accrue until forfeiture.
2.5.2	If the employee relinquishes the job of supervisor within the six (6) month period, the right to re-enter his previously held classification shall be offered. (This does not mean the employee has a right to the particular job he left.)
2.6	Seniority Lists. The Union will be advised in writing upon request, but no less than every six months, of new hires, part time employees, separations and temporary employees with their start dates. Seniority lists, including classification, and department will be submitted to the Union upon request. The Union Steward can request a wage list of Union employees through the Shop Superintendent on December 31 and June 30 of each year.
2.7	Shift Preference - Job Preference.
2.7.1	Once every three (3) months, employees will be allowed to exercise shift preference within their classification on the basis of plant wide seniority.	It is
understood, however, that such preference will be granted subject to the necessity of maintaining a balanced work force of qualified employees and Union committeemen and stewards on all shifts.
2.7.2	Any employee who is denied shift preference due to the “balanced work force” provision will be transferred within six (6) months. This provision cannot be exercised until after your one (1) year anniversary date.

Step 3 - If the grievance is not settled at Step 2, the Union shall present the grievance in writing to a Company officer to be designated by the Company within five (5) regular working days after the Shop Superintendent has advised the Union Steward of his decision. Within six (6) regular working days thereafter, at a time and place to be mutually agreed upon, the Union Grievance Committee, consisting of not more than three (3) members, and a Company committee, consisting of not more than three (3) members, shall meet to attempt to settle the grievance. The Shop Superintendent shall furnish a signed copy of his decision to the Company, and the Company shall furnish one (1) copy of his decision to each member of the committee before the committees meet.

If the two committees do not reach an agreement on the grievance, the Company shall give its written decision to the employee and the President of the Local Union within four (4) regular working days after the meeting.
Step 4 - If the grievance is not settled at Step 3, and the Union desires to proceed to Step 4 of the grievance procedure, the Union shall so notify

The order of striking shall be determined by a coin flip. The arbitrator shall schedule a hearing as soon as possible. The decision of the arbitrator shall be rendered in writing and shall be final and binding on all parties, including the employee, the Union and the Company.

However, the arbitrator shall also have the further authority, if he finds that the discharge or suspension was not justified, to order reinstatement with such loss of rights and without compensation for loss of income sustained or with such partial compensation for loss of income sustained as he deems just under the circumstances.
3.3.2	The arbitrator shall have authority only to interpret and apply the provisions of this agreement and to decide the particular grievance(s) submitted to him. He shall not have authority to add to, delete from, or in any way modify, alter, or amend, any provisions of this Agreement. If the arbitrator is willing, he may, at the request of both parties, issue a bench decision.
3.4	Additional Points Regarding Grievances and Arbitrations.
3.4.1	If the Company does not answer an appeal of a grievance within the specified time limits, the employee or the Union may elect to treat the grievance denied at the step and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step, including arbitration.
3.4.2	Failure of the employee or Union to comply with the time elements set forth in the grievance and arbitration procedure for reporting a grievance and taking appeals, shall result in waiver of the rights of the employee or Union to proceed further.
