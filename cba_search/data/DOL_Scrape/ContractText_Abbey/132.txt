Posting and distributing unauthorized literature throughout the mill is contrary to our Plant Rules and Practices and should be observed.

Gambling is not allowed in the Mill. The soliciting of bets is a violation of the Plant Rules and violators subject themselves to possible disciplinary action, suspension or discharge.
Some individuals have been participating in various physical development and competitive activities while on the job. The work place Is not designed to accommodate this kind of action. More importantly, anyone engaged in non-work related activity is obviously not attentive to the work at hand and these practices must be stopped.
It has become apparent that employees are on occasion using Company phones to make unauthorized long distance toll calls. Company telephones are not to be used for long distance toll calls without proper permission. Unauthorized use of Company phones will place the user's job in jeopardy.
Vending Machines
This will remind all users of vending machines that manipulation of the machines so that Items are received at no cost or reduced cost Is considered an act of theft and subjects an employee to being discharged.
-36-
Any employee who loses money in the machines can get a refund by contacting the Labor Relations Department during week day hours 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

A maintenance employee who qualifies under this paragraph (4) and who elects to begin work at 25 9:00 a.m. or 12:30 p.m. rather than to continue into his regularly scheduled shift at 7:00 a.m. will have up to 8 of the hours worked consecutively from 9:00 a.m. or 12:30 p.m. counted in the computation of weekly overtime.	30
8
(5)	The preceding paragraph shall not be interpreted so as to pyramid the computation of time and one-half for all hours worked in excess of 40 in one week or in excess of 8 hours in one day.
(6)	Under paragraph (4) of this Section, normal 5 time taken out by an employee for meals between the beginning and end of the time he works shall be included for the purpose of determining whether he has been required to work in excess of 16 hours but such mealtime shall not be paid for,	10
(7)	There shall be paid a shift differential of 25C per hour on the second shift (3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) and 350 per hour on foe third shift (11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) to regular shift employees; that is, those who work during these shifts on jobs 15 which are on rotating shift basis, and also to employees who, although not regular shift employees, are working on jobs with regularly scheduled hours falling entirely between 3:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m. These shift differentials shall not 20 apply, however, in foe calculation of payments for call-in time, hold-over time, reporting time, wire time, clothing time, vacations, holidays not worked, or for any other time not worked.
(8)	Wherever the term “day” is used in this Sec- 25 tion VI, it shall mean a 24-hour period starting from the beginning of the first hour worked. For foe purpose of computing overtime under this Section when legislative action changes foe time to or from stand
9
ard time, 7:00 a.m, to 7:00 a.m. the following day will be treated as a 24-hour period.
(9)	In the filling of jobs where an employee’s relief fails to report and overtime cannot be avoided, the Company, in assigning overtime during the week 5 in which the vacancy occurs, will on the first 3 days of such absence give preference to the employee whose relief fails to report. The preference of the overtime will also be given to the employee whose relief fails to report on the fourth consecutive day 10 of the absence if it is a holiday. Otherwise, the preference of the overtime will be given to employees in that particular job classification. This shall not have the effect of prohibiting the use for filling-in purposes of employees used as spares, helpers, 15 laborers or utility people in the department or who are carried as extras on the shift.
(10)	If a maintenance employee is held over beyond his designated shift having been given instructions as to specific work assignments to be performed and 20 during the holdover is given another work assignment that is not related to the previous work, he will be paid a minimum of 4 hours at his regular rate for such newly assigned work provided that he does not request to be relieved from the assigned job and 25 such request is met. Any limitations that might apply to the payment of a call-out will apply to this provision.
The above does not apply when an employee is held over for general work assignments such as, but 30 not restricted to, the start-up of a machine, shutting down or starting up the mill, troubleshooting a bleach line, etc.
10
SECTION VII
CALL-OUT TIME, REPORTING TIME AND WIRE TIME

An employee who works on a complete paper machine stock chest wash-up at a time other than his scheduled shift will receive not less than 8 hours 20 pay at his regular straight-time rate for the time spent by him in such work.
(3)	Time which an employee is required to work immediately following his regularly scheduled working time shall not be considered call-out time. 25 Time which an employee is required to work immediately preceding his regularly scheduled working time shall not be considered call-out time if he had notice at or before the end of his previous scheduled shift or as much as 16 hours in advance 30 of the time he is scheduled to report.
12
(4)	During a shutdown of the mill or any department thereof, failure by the Company to give 16 hours notice will not constitute a call-out, so long as the employee is called back to the shift that he would have been scheduled to work had the mill or 5 department been operating.
(5)	When an employee is unable to report for work at his regular time, he shall make every effort to notify the Company at least 4 hours in advance,

SECTION VIII
HOLIDAYS
(1)	13 days during the year are hereby designated as holidays (holiday hours are from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. the following day), namely:
Memorial Day	15
Fourth of July
Labor Day
Day after Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
December 23	20
Christmas Eve
Christmas Day
December 26
December 27
Employee’s Birth Date	25
Employee’s Anniversary Date of Hire
Personal Holiday
14
An employee’s birth date and anniversary date shall be no-work holidays for that employee. If birth date or anniversary falls on another holiday, the day following the holiday will become the birth date or anniversary holiday. He will, however, be scheduled 5 as though the holiday were a regularly scheduled work day unless be notifies his supervisor by 1:00 p.m. on Thursday of the preceding week of his intent to observe (not work) the holiday.
An employee may elect to observe (not work) his 10 birth date or anniversary date holiday any one day of the week in which his birth date or anniversary date holiday falls provided that he notifies his supervisor by 1:00 p.m. on Thursday of the preceding week. An employee will not be denied the oppor- 15 tunity to observe the holiday on a day other than his birth date or anniversary date without good and sufficient cause.
(2)	Any employee working during any of the hours above designated as holidays will be paid double 20 his straight-time hourly rate for all said hours worked.
(3)	No work will be required during the holiday hours specified for Labor Day, If the Company desires to require work on this holiday, it will so 25 notify the Unions at least 30 days before the holiday, and within 14 days after such notice the Unions will advise the Company whether or not they agree to work on said holiday.
15
Work on a voluntary basis may be performed during Labor Day on assignments which are not usually accomplished during normal mill operations.
(4)	The Company may elect to operate the mill on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and December 26.	5
In this event employees will be granted a day of leave of their choice for each full day worked on December 24, 25 or 26, during the twelve-month period following provided that the absence is not detrimental to the efficient operation of the depart- 10 ment. Pay will be based on 8 hours at the regular rate which applies at the time the compensatory day of leave is taken.
Although volunteers and call-outs may be used, the Company will not schedule the following to work 15 on December 24, 25 or 26:
Day Maintenance
Day Storeroom Personnel
Sheet Finishing
Roll Finishing Rewinder	20
Wood Yard/Round Wood Operations Checkers in Sheet Plant
Chip Sampler
Assistant Sample Room Clerk
The Company will notify the Unions at least 60	25
days in advance of the Christmas holidays as to its intention with regard to operating.
An employee who works in excess of eight hours on December 24, 25 or 26 will be paid an additional
16
one-half times the straight-time hourly rate for those hours worked in excess of eight.
The Company does not consider the feet that overtime in and of itself is required in order to accommodate an employee who is requesting a day 5 off, having worked December 24,25 or 26, as being detrimental to the efficient operation of the department. This does not include, however, situations which would require an employee to work in excess of 16 hours in a 24-hour period.	10
(5)	The Company may, however, require such work as it chooses during the holiday hours above specified for Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Day after Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, December 23, and December 27, and may also require on any of 15 the holidays named in this Section any work necessary to the protection of life or property and the usual work necessary for starting full operations at the conclusion of the holiday.
(6)	After an employee has been with the Com- 20 pany for a period of 60 days or more, he shall be entitled to receive holiday pay for 8 hours at his regular straight-time rate for each of the holidays named in paragraph (1). The holiday allowance of 8 hours for any employee eligible to receive it, will 25 be counted as hours worked in the computation of weekly overtime if the employee is regularly scheduled to work on the holiday but does not work because of the holiday. A temporary employee who otherwise qualifies and who has been employed 30 by the Company for the 60 days immediately preceding the holiday shall receive holiday pay.
17
A temporary employee who otherwise qualifies who is terminated within 15 days prior to a holiday and rehired within 15 days following said holiday will be eligible for holiday pay.
(7)	If an employee is scheduled to work on the 5 holiday named in paragraph (3) he shall, if he requires it, receive a day off later in the week or a day off within the next two pay periods if the employee’s absence is not detrimental to the efficient operation of the mill.	10
(8)	If an employee is scheduled to work on any of the holidays named in paragraph (1) and fails to report without justifiable cause, he shall not receive the holiday pay called for by paragraph (6).
(9)	If a holiday occurs during a period when an 15 employee, who otherwise is eligible for holiday pay, is laid off or on a leave of absence, he will receive pay for said holiday when he returns to work provided the entire duration of his layoff or leave of absence has not exceeded 90 days.	20
An employee, otherwise qualified, who is absent on sick leave will be paid for recognized holidays at the time they occur up to an absence of 52 weeks; if absent due to a disability compensated for under the Workmen’s Compensation Law, pay for 25 recognized holidays will be made at the time they occur for a period of up to 104 weeks.
(10)	If an employee is not scheduled to work on one of the above holidays, he shall nevertheless not receive pay for any such holiday if he fails to report 30
18
for work, without justifiable cause, on either of the 2 scheduled work days preceding or either of the 2 scheduled work days following any such holiday.
(11)	In the event that either of these holidays fells during an employee’s vacation period, he shall, in 5 order to prevent the creation of an inequity, receive pay for the holiday which falls during the vacation period in addition to his regular vacation pay.
(12)	It is understood and agreed that an employee shall be considered absent for justifiable cause, as 10 the term is used in this Section, if he is:
(a)	Away on vacation, or on leave for Union business.
(b)	So sick that he is unable to report for work and is able to prove such sickness. (This does not 15 mean sickness growing out of the use of alcohol or drug abuse.)
(c)	If the sickness of some member of his family makes his attendance impossible and he is able to prove such sickness.	20
(d)	If he has been advised by his supervisor that his services are not required.
(e)	If he is otherwise absent because of direct action initiated by the Company.
(f)	If his absence for whatever reason is an 25 excused absence.
19
SECTION IX
SENIORITY
(1)	There are three types of seniority used in this Agreement: Mill (time in a bargaining unit job), Department, and Job. In reducing or increasing the number of employees, or in laying off, discharging, promoting, demoting, or transferring employees, temporarily or permanently, or in the case of reemployment after temporary suspension of work or layoff, the controlling factors shall be (1) length of continuous service in the department affected, and (2) ability, skill, qualification and efficiency. In keeping with the mutual desire of the Company and the Unions to follow in general the principle of seniority, it is agreed that in such cases factor (1) must always prevail when factor (2) is equal. Factor (1) shall not be controlling, however, when there is not equality as to factor (2). As to whether or not there is equality as to factor (2), the Company shall be the judge; but in cases of promotion or demotion other than by seniority, the Company’s judgment that there is not equality under factor (2) shall be subject to the grievance procedure herein set out, including arbitration.
The Company will not use the experience in-and-of itself which an employee gains in a higher rated job because of an agreement to use on-shift promotions for absences of more than a week as justification for use of the ability, skill, qualification language.

When an employee does not have enough seniority to hold a bottom-rated job in his line of progression during a layoff, he may displace an employee with less Mill seniority on a base-rated job in any department subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) that 5 apply to transfer.
Base rated jobs are: Automotive Maintenance Mechanical Maintenance Instrument Maintenance Electrical Maintenance Paper Mill Power Plant Pulp Mill Quality Assurance Roll Finishing Sheet Finishing Storeroom Wood Yard

—Chip Sampler 15
—Spare
—Machine Helper
—Day Clerk
—Spare Hand
—Mill Spare	20
(2)	Seniority is to be on a departmental basis. However, Job seniority shall be used instead of Departmental seniority where there are lines of progression. When an employee refuses a promotion, temporary or permanent, or refuses to train for a 25 promotion, refiisal shall be recorded on a waiver of promotion form and he shall, insofar as promotion is concerned, lose seniority to: (1) the first 3 men junior to him in seniority for promotion; (2) the employee who accepts the promotion; and, (3) all 30 those senior to the employee who accepts the promotion.
21
The employee’s eligiblity for promotion will be reinstated effective 3 months from the date he submits a written request to the Company with a copy to the Union Local for cancellation of the waiver of promotion. He will give up seniority for promo- 5 tion to all those noted above and each employee who by-passes him during the period that the waiver of promotion is in effect.
(3)	When a temporary vacancy occurs because of the absence of an employee, any of the following procedures may be used by the Company.	10
(a)	Use employees on an overtime basis who are employed in the job in which the vacancy occurs.
(b)	Leave vacancy unfilled.
(c)	Divide the duties of the job among other employees.	,	15
(d)	If no overtime will result, promotions may be made according to paragraph (1) on the shift on which the vacancy occurs. However, when the Company has knowledge that such absence will continue until the end of the full week commenc- 20 ing on the Monday following the day on which the vacancy occurs, promotion shall be made on the Monday following the day on which the vacancy occurs in accordance with paragraph (1) considering all 4 shifts. If the Company receives 25 such knowledge prior to 1:00 p.m., Friday, all changes will be made the Monday following the receipt of such knowledge.
The schedule established as of Friday, 1:00 p.m., will be the basis on which all job changes for the 30
22
following week will be made. No employee with the possible exception of employees used as spare or relief will be required to change shifts due to information received after 1:00 p.m., Friday, that an employee will be absent for the entire week 5 or will be returning to work following an absence.
When the employee whose absence caused the temporary vacancy referred to above returns to work, the Company may assign him, at his regular rate, 10 to any work on any shift. He will be reassigned to his regular job on Monday following his return to work.
(4)	Any shift employee working temporarily for an hour or more on a job having a higher rate than 15 his usual rate shall be paid the higher rate for the time actually worked on such higher rated job. Any employee who works 50% of a full shift on a higher rated job shall receive the higher rate for the entire shift. In either case the employee must perform 20 the work without the help or supervision of an hourly paid employee.
(5)	Except as provided in paragraph (6) below, an employee temporarily working on a job having a lower rate of pay than his usual job shall be paid 25 his regular rate of pay. An employee permanently demoted shall receive the pay of the job to which he is demoted.
(6)	Employees other than regular maintenance workers who, when the mill is down and work on 30 their regular job is not available, do some work at some job other than their regular job shall be paid their regular rate of pay, except as provided in paragraph (7) below.
23
(7)	In case of a shutdown of the mill or any part thereof which is not to continue more than 7 consecutive days, the provisions of paragraph (1) will not apply. In case of such a shutdown which is to continue more than 7 days, paragraph (1) will apply 5 as to which employees will be kept at work, but during such shutdown, the rate of pay will be the usual rate for the job performed, regardless of the regular rate of pay of the employee who is so retained for work. If the equipment is scheduled to be inoperative 10 for a period of 7 days or less, but does in effect actually continue for more than 7 days, paragraph (1) will then on the eighth day apply as to which employees will be kept at work.
(8)	Any employee promoted shall be given a trial 15 period not to exceed 30 days (Crane Operator not to exceed 90 days) to determine his ability for holding the job. If he fails to qualify during his trial period, he shall return to his former position and former status as to pay and seniority. If an employee 20 elects during the trial period of 30 days to refuse the promotion, the provisions of Section IX, paragraph (2) will apply.
(9)	Employees who have completed six months of continuous service in a department following the 25 90-day probationary period may apply for transfer to another department or to base jobs in other progression lines within the same department by filing a written application with the Industrial Relations Department. This application will remain active 30
24
for a 12-month period. Any refusal by the Company to grant the transfer applied for may be processed as a grievance, provided, however, that an arbitrator may not rule on the selection criteria but only on the instant application of such criteria.	5
An employee who is transferred under this provision will retain for 30 days the Job and Department seniority that he held at the time of transfer and he will begin to accumulate seniority in his new job and department from the date of transfer. While ac- 10 cumulating seniority in his new department, an employee will not be considered for promotions in his old department. The employee’s seniority rights under this provision may be exercised at any time during the 30-day period if, during that time, either 15 the Company or the employee has determined that the employee is not suited for the new assignment.
An employee who uses the transfer procedure to go from one line of progression to another when there is a job common to both, e.g. Spare Hand 20 (Paper Mill, Roll Finishing), Relief (Pulp Mill) will be required to reestablish job seniority in the base job by working that job for at least one month.
(10)	If the Company should contemplate making a promotion or demotion other than by seniority, it 25 will, prior to making its decision, so advise the president of the Local in the department involved, and discuss with him its reasons for departing from seniority, and will, if the president indicates that he so desires, meet with the Union Committee in 30
25
the department involved whenever within a reasonable time the president calls the committee together for that purpose, and discuss with said committee its reasons for departing from seniority.
(11)	An employee hired into a temporary vacancy 5 will develop no seniority other than for benefits. Said employee will be considered probationary and the Company shall have the right in its discretion to retain or discharge the employee and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Both the 10 employee and the appropriate Union will be informed of the temporary status of the employee. When a temporary vacancy becomes permanent, the job will become open to the transfer procedure at which time transfer requests will be considered 15 which were appropriately filed prior to there being a permanent vacancy.
The Company does not intend to hire employees into temporary status for the purpose of filling regular jobs which are projected, to the best 20 knowledge of the Company, to be eliminated at a time greater than nine months from the date of employment.
Employees who are hired into temporary status will be allowed to participate in the benefit program 25 from the date of employment if the employment is projected to continue for a period in excess of three months. The benefit program is not provided to employees hired on a temporary basis as vacation relief.	30
26
A temporary employee who has been employed for more than 90 consecutive days in a single department will, if made permanent, be probationary for a period of 30 days provided that he is placed in a permanent position in the same department in which 5 he has worked the 90 consecutive days. The probationary period for regular employees is 90 days. The separation of an employee during his probationary period shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.	10
(12)	An employee’s seniority ceases when:
(a)	He quits.
(b)	He is discharged.
(c)	He is absent from work for 3 consecutive work days without notifying the Company. 15
(d)	He does not return to work within 3 days after recall, or fails to give satisfactory reason for not returning.
(e)	He is laid off; provided any employee laid off after having been employed by the Company 20 3 consecutive months or more will retain his seniority so long as he gives to the Company during every other calendar month after said layoff notice of the fact that he desires reemployment by the Company and notice of his then cur- 25 rent mailing address, which notice may be either by certified mail to the Company or by personal communication with the Industrial Relations Department of the Company; and provided further, that any layoff which extends for a 30
27
continuous period of more than one year in the case of employees who at the time of such layoff have been employed by the Company not less than 3 months or more than 3 years, and any layoff which extends for a continuous period of more 5 than 2 years in the case of employees who at the time of such layoff have been employed by the Company for more than 3 consecutive years, shall have the effect of breaking continuous employment.	10
(f)	An employee covered by this agreement is promoted to a salaried position and placed on salary.
(13)	In lines (c) and (d) above, an employee may be discharged without further notice.	15
28
SECTION X
VACATIONS
(1)	Except as noted in paragraph (3), May 1 is the qualification date for vacations. The vacation year is the twelve-month period beginning on June 1.

(Vacation pay allowance to be computed on the basis of hours at the employee’s regular straight-time rate 20 or percentage whichever is greater if employee has worked a minimum of 520 hours during the vacation year.)
(3)	An employee will first qualify for his 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th week of vacation on his an- 25 niversary date as noted on the preceding table. An employee whose employment date was June 1-November 30, both inclusive and prior to 1968, will also qualify on the anniversary dates noted
29
above for an additional pay allowance of 40 hours or 2% of his previous vacation year earnings. An employee whose employment date was December 1-May 31, both inclusive, or who was employed during 1968 or later will qualify on June 1 following 5 the anniversary dates noted above for an adjustment in the amount of 2 % of his pay from said anniversary date through May 31.
(4)	Absence due to sickness, accidents, jury duty, military call-up, or layoff beyond the control of the 10 employee shall not be considered a break in service in determining the eligibility of the employee for vacation.
Employees who retire during the year and who otherwise qualify for vacation will be paid their full 15 vacation allowance provided they have worked a total of 520 hours ending on the eligibility date. The vacation allowance of deceased employees who otherwise qualify and who have worked a total of 520 hours ending on the eligibility date will be paid to 20 the employee’s beneficiary.
(5)	The period for vacations will be from June 1 to May 31. The Company will try to meet the wishes of individual employees who are eligible for vacations as to the date of their respective vacations dur- 25 ing that period, but in all cases will take into consideration the efficiency and economy of operations.
The Company reserves the right to decide (1) that in any or all departments all vacations shall be taken at one time, and (2) that in any department in which 30
30
employees are employed as relief to aid in operations during vacations the said usual period may be shortened, but not to a period shorter than June 1 to August 30, and (3) that in any or all departments vacations must be taken consecutively, so that a full 5 working force may be maintained at all times in the department or departments affected. So far as is practicable, it will be arranged that the choice of dates for the various employees in each department will be given in the order of seniority in that depart- 10 ment, but no employee shall have preference to more than 2 weeks of his vacation until all other eligible employees in his department have had an opportunity to express their choice of vacation dates. No employee will be required to change vacation dates 15 which have been selected by him and confirmed by the Company unless he is given 2 weeks’ notice in advance of the beginning of such vacation.
(6)	Employees must submit vacation requests to their foremen during the period of March 1 to 20 April 5 subject to guidelines published prior to March 1. The Company will use the period of April 5 to May 1 to reschedule in case of conflicts. An employee must take the first 2 weeks of his vacation as scheduled and confirmed on May 1 if the 25 scheduled weeks fell within the months of June, July and August or include the week before, the week of, or the week following Christmas.
The Company may give consideration to an employee’s request to reschedule or cancel a vacation 30 scheduled for the above noted periods only upon the
31
