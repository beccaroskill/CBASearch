Section D Procedure
Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the timetable specified at each level should be considered as a maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits specified may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.
In the event a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in this Grievance Procedure by the end of the school year, the time limits set forth herein will be reduced so that the procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school year or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
Level I A An employee with a grievance shall first inform the immediate supervisor or the appropriate administrator within fifteen (15) days of awareness of the incident or condition which is the basis of the grievance with the objective of resolving it informally.
Level I B If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance a meeting with the school head shall be held with the objective of resolving the grievance informally.
Level I C If the grievance is not resolved informally the grievant may file the grievance in writing with the immediate supervisor or appropriate administrator. The immediate supervisor or appropriate administrator shall respond in writing within three (3) days.
Level II If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level I C, or if no decision has been rendered within three (3) days after receipt of the grievance, the grievant may within ten (10) days submit the written grievance to the Superintendent/designee with copies to the administrator, and the Association.

The Superintendent/designee shall have a hearing within five (5) days after receipt of the written appeal. The Superintendent/designee shall have a written decision within seven (7) days.
Level III If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level II, or if no written decision has been rendered within twelve (12) days after the grievance has been submitted at Level II the Association may submit the grievance to arbitration. The Association shall notify the Superintendent/designee within twenty-five (25) days. If a question as to the arbitrability of an issue is raised by either party, such question shall be determined in the first instance by the arbitrator.
Within five (5) days from the date of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the Parties shall request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to provide a list of five (5) impartial persons qualified to act as arbitrators. The Parties shall meet within three (3) days after the receipt of such a list. The Parties will each strike one arbitrator's name from the list of five (5) and will then repeat the procedure. The remaining person shall be the duly selected arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall have authority to hold hearings and make procedural rules consistent with this Agreement. Such hearings shall be held as promptly as practicable after the request for arbitration and the arbitrator shall issue the decision within a reasonable time but no later than sixty(60) days after the date of the close of the final hearing. If the Parties mutually agree, hearings may be waived and the arbitrator's decision made on the basis of final statements and evidence submitted to the arbitrator.
The arbitrator shall be without power or authority

Prior to the Board voting the Association shall have the right to have a representative appear and present the Association's position. The costs for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses if any, travel and subsistence expenses and the cost of any hearing room will be borne equally by the Parties. All other costs will be borne by the party incurring them.
Section E Grievances Filed at Level Above Immediate Supervisor
If grievances arise from action or inaction on the part of an administrator at a level above the immediate supervisor the grievant may file such grievance in writing at Level II after first attempting to resolve it informally. If the grievance is not resolved it shall be processed through the applicable steps of Section D. The Association may process such a grievance through all levels of the procedure.

All meetings and hearings provided for by this Grievance Procedure shall be held in private and shall include only such parties in interest, their representative(s), and witnesses as necessary.
