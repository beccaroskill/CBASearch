Agreement by and between the Puget Sound Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association, and Local Union No. 46, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. It shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by this Agreement. As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term "Association" shall mean the Puget Sound Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association and the term "Union" shall mean Local Union No. 46, IBEW. The term "Employer" shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an assent to this Agreement.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
The Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the Employer, the Union and the Public. Progress in the industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Employer and the Union. All will benefit
by continuous peace and by adjusting any difference by rational common sense methods. Now, therefore, in consideration of mutual promises and Agreements herein contained the parties hereto agree as follows.
This Agreement shall cover all inside electrical construction work and workers within the territorial jurisdiction of Local Union No. 46 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
ARTICLE I EFFECTIVE DATE - TERMINATION AMENDMENTS - DISPUTES

The terms
2
and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the ten (10) day period.

ARTICLE II
EMPLOYER RIGHTS - UNION RIGHTS
Section 2.01 Members of the Union, with the exception of those meeting the requirements of an electrical contractor, as defined herein, shall not contract for any electrical work.
Section 2.02(a) The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agency between itself and the Employees covered under the scope of the Agreement.
(b) The Employer shall have the right to determine the competency and qualifications of its Employees and the right to discharge such Employees for any just and sufficient cause. The Union may institute a grievance procedure under the terms of this Agreement if it feels any Employee has been unjustly discharged. In applying the above provisions the Employer shall not discriminate against Employees in regard to hire or tenure of employment by reason of Union member
5
ship; provided, however, all workers, Union or otherwise, shall be classified and receive the wage scales as provided under the wage schedules attached to this Collective Bargaining Agreement,
(c) All Employees covered by this Agreement shall be required to become and remain members in good standing of the Union as a condition of employment from and after the eighth (8 th) day following the date of their employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. All Employees who may be accepted into membership shall thereafter maintain their continuous good standing in the Union, as a condition of employment, by paying regular monthly union fees uniformly paid by other members of the same classification in the Union in order to defray the costs of the collective bargaining agency in accordance with its rules. In the event that an Employee fails to tender the admission fee or a member of the Union fails to maintain his or her membership in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Union shall notify the Employer in writing and such written notice shall constitute a request to the Employer to discharge said individual Employee.
Section 2.03 Certain qualifications, knowledge, experience and responsibility are required of everyone desiring to be an Employer in the Electrical industry. Therefore, no individual firm or corporation shall be considered qualified to become a party to this Agreement unless it meets the following requirements; Furnishes a Fringe Benefit Guarantee Bond as specified in Section 4.01; having a suitable financial status to meet the payroll requirements each and every week; shall maintain a permanent place of business and/or shop with a business telephone and open to the public during normal business hours located in a recognised business location and area, aside and separate from any residence or place or abode; employing not less that one (1) Journeyman continuously.
Section 2.04 Restriction on Owners Performing Electrical Work, One person (with substantial owners interest)
6
per firm will be allowed to work with the tools while employing not more than four (4) workers. However, nothing in this rule shall be construed as preventing any individual from making a temporary repair or adjustment where an emergency exists involving a hazard to life or property. Owners performing electrical work shall pay an equivalent total package as provided in this Agreement.
Section 2.05 For all Employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall carry Workman’s Compensation Insurance and such other protective insurance as may be required by the laws of this state and shall furnish satisfactory proof of such to the Union. The Employers shall also make payments to the Washington State Unemployment Compensation Commission and Federal Government Social Security Department for all Employees covered by the terms-of this Agreement.
Section 2.06 Management's Rights. The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall therefore have no restrictions, except those specifically provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, in planning, directing and controlling the operation of all work, in deciding the number and kind of Employees to properly perform the work in hiring and laying off Employees, in transferring Employees from job to job within the local Union’s geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as Foreman, in requiring all Employees to observe the Employer’s and/or Owner's rules and regulations not inconsistent with the Agreement in requiring all Employees to observe all safety regulations, and in discharging Employees for proper cause.
(a)	Foreman by Name Clause. To clarify the intent of this clause, it is hereby agreed that when this clause is utilized the individual called out as Foreman shall work as Foreman and be paid as Foreman. If contractors make such a call out and do not adhere to this understanding, a complaint shall
7
promptly be filed by the Union. The Business Manager and Chapter Manager shall promptly investigate the complaint and the matter will then be promptly resolved.
A Foreman as compared to a Journeyman has some distinct responsibilities which include: supervision of the workers, material requisition, Employee planning and scheduling, keeping good relations with other trades and owners representatives; study and understand electrical, structural, and mechanical specs; knowing electrical code and keeping a copy of the code book on the job; and special responsibilities to the Employer.
A Foreman may be the first person on the job, but under the call for Foreman by Name Clause it is expected he or she will be supervising electricians as the job progresses to the point where other electricians arc required.
In the event that it is found that the above is not the intent of the Employer, the Business Manager may refuse to dispatch a Foreman to the Employer.
(b)	The Employer shall be permitted to request by name, any applicant the Employer desires to employ as Foreman, provided the individual has successfully completed the JATC Foreman Training Class. Then the Union will refer such applicant to the Employer, if the applicant’s name appears on the referral register and, has not quit their former Employer less than two (2) calendar weeks prior to the Employer's request for said applicant, and all other “eligible” applicants in higher seniority referral groups have first been referred. Then the Employer shall immediately upon employment of said applicant, classify said applicant (Employee) as a Foreman and pay such applicant (Employee) Foreman's wages as established in Section 3.08 (a) of this Agreement for a period of ninety (90) days unless terminated sooner.
Foreman shall have a valid first aid card and adhere to any other state laws, which are required by statute, and have completed a JATC Foreman Training Class. A Joumey-
8
man may act as a Foreman if they have signed up for the next available JATC Foreman Training Class but may not continue to work as a Foreman if he or she docs not successfully complete that class. Training provisions shall apply to all existing foremen.
(c)	Favored Nations Clause. The Union agrees that if, during the term of this Agreement, it grants to any Employer in the electrical contracting industry any better terms or conditions for any of the work covered by this Agreement, all the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall be made available to the Employers signatory to this Agreement. The Union agrees to notify the Puget Sound Chapter, NECA of any such Agreements made by the Union covering work on any single project, and NECA agrees to notify all Employers signatory to this Agreement. However, an exception to this clause is as follows: The Union may, with prior notification to NECA, offer some modifications if necessary to organize a non-signatory electrical contractor.
(d)	Administrative Maintenance Fund. Effective June 1, 2001, Employers signatory to this Labor Agreement with Local Union No. 46, IBEW, shall contribute one half of one percent (.5%) of productive labor payroll as reported on their fringe benefit report to the Administrative Maintenance Fund. The monies are for the purpose of administration of all trust funds as delineated in this Agreement, and other administrative costs. The administrator of the Administrative Maintenance Fund shall be appointed by the Puget Sound Chapter, NECA. No portion of this fund shall be used contrary to the Local Union No. 46, IBEW. The Local shall have the right to inspect the books of this fund. Any Electrical Contractor bound to this Labor Agreement with Local Union No. 46, IBEW, shall contribute one half of one percent (.5%) of productive labor payroll to the Administrative Maintenance Fund (AMF). The AMF contribution shall be submitted with all other fringe benefits as delineated in the Labor Agreement by the fifteenth (15th) of the following month in which they are due to the Administrator receiving said funds.
9
In the event any Employer is delinquent in submitting the required Administrative Maintenance Fund to the designated Administrator, the Administrator shall have authority to recover any funds, along with any attorney fees, court costs, interest al one percent (1%) per month and liquidated damages receiving said funds.
Section 2.07 Each electrical contractor employing members of Local Union No, 46, 1BEW shall be required to have identification signs, seals, decals, stickers or painted signs on their trucks, bearing the company's name, not less than three (3) inches high and visible from the outside of each of its trucks.
Section 2.08 Discipline of Union Members. The Union reserves the right to discipline its members for violation of its laws, rules and agreements.
Section 2.09 Union Assistance to Other Local Unions. This Agreement does not deny the right of the Union or its representatives to render assistance to other organizations by removal of its members from jobs when necessary, and when the Union or its proper representatives decide to do so; but no removal shall take place until notice is first given to the Employer involved. When such removal takes place, the Union or its representatives shall direct the workers on such job to carefully put away all tools, material, equipment or any other property of the Employer in a safe manner. The Union will be financially responsible for any loss to the Employer for neglect in carrying out this provision, but only when a safe place is provided for these by the Employer.
Section 2.10	Loaning of Employees. The Employer shall not loan, or cause to be loaned, the members of the Union in his employ to any other Employer without first securing permission of the Union and then only when applicants possessing the required skills are not available under the referral procedure.
10
Section 2.11(	a) Job Stewards. The Union shall have the right to appoint a Steward at any job where bargaining unit members are employed. Such appointed Steward shall remain at such job, except when terminated for cause, until such job has been reduced to core personnel. Stewards appointed under this Section of the Agreement shall have received Steward training by the Union, and other training as developed by the Joint Labor-Management Committee that would assist a Steward in the performance of their duties.
(b)	The Steward shall in no case cause a stoppage of work. In case of any trouble on the job, he or she shall immediately notify the Business Manager who will take up any grievance, dispute and/or any other subject matter with the Employer. (It is understood between the parties to this Agreement that the Steward will not discuss any violation of this Agreement, disputes of any nature or grievances with Employers, but will report them to the Business Manager.)
(c)	Stewards shall work under the direction of the Business Manager and be subject to his or her authority. Such Steward shall see that this Agreement and working rules are observed and shall be allowed sufficient time to perform the duties during regular working hours. The Business Manager shall notify the Employer of the appointment of a Steward. Under no circumstances shall an Employer dismiss or otherwise discriminate against an Employee and/or Shop Steward for making a complaint or giving evidence with respect to an alleged violation of a provision of this Agreement.
(d)	The Employer shall notify the Union representative twenty-four (24) hours prior to termination of a Steward except for discharge for just cause. Just cause is defined as intoxication or insubordination. In case of discharge of a Steward for just cause, the Employer shall immediately notify the Union office.
(e)	In no event shall the Employer discriminate against a Steward in the matter of overtime, layoffs, or rehires. In the event a Steward is to be laid off, a Committee representing
11
the parties to this Agreement may review the action upon request.
Section 2.12	Union Access to Shop and Jobs. The representative of the Union shall be allowed access to any job at any reasonable lime where workers are employed under the terms of this Agreement. The Union will call the Employer's office at least one (1) hour before a visit. If an emergency to life occurs or if there is a strike by any craft, the one (1) hour notice will not apply. The Employer will provide the Union with a list of ongoing job sites upon request.
Section 2.13	No Rebate of Wages. No Employer or . member of the Union or their agent shall give or accept directly or indirectly any rebate of wages. Any Employer ‘ found violating this provision shall be subject to having the Agreement terminated upon written notice thereof being given by the Union.

Section 2.15	The policy of the Local Union and its members is to promote the use of materials and equipment manufactured, processed or repaired under economically sound wage, hour and working conditions by the members of the IBEW when possible.
Section 2.16(	a) Annulment and Subcontracting. The Local Union is a part of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and any violation or annulment by an individual Employer of the approved Agreement of this or any other Local Union of the IBEW, other than violations of paragraph (b) of this Section, will be sufficient cause for the cancellation of his Agreement by the Local Union, after a finding has been made by the International President of the Union that such a violation or annulment has occurred.
12
(b)	The subletting, assigning or transfer by an individual Employer of any work in connection with electrical work to any person, firm or corporation not recognizing the IBEW or one of its Local Unions as the collective bargaining representative of their Employees on any electrical work in the jurisdiction of this or any other local union to be performed at the site of the construction, alteration, painting or repair of a building, structure or other work will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
(c)	All charges of violation of paragraph (b) of this Section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering the procedure for the handling of grievances and final and binding resolution of disputes.
Section 2.17 Outside Contractors - Provision for Bringing in Workers. Contractors from outside the jurisdiction of Local Union No, 46, IBEW doing work in the jurisdiction of Local Union No. 46, IBEW may bring in one (1) Journeyman Wireman except as modified by the Ninth District Construction Manpower Reciprocal Agreement.
