Section 5.	Adjustment of Grievances: Any written grievance submitted will be with the consent of Education Minnesota - OSSEO. A teacher filing a written grievance without the consent of Education Minnesota -OSSEO will bear all costs of the grievance.

The School Board, the teacher, and Education Minnesota - OSSEO representative will attempt to adjust grievances that may arise during the course of employment of any teacher within the School District in the following manner.
Subd. 1. Informal Discussions: Before a written grievance is submitted, informal discussions will take place between the aggrieved party, the principal or supervisor and Education Minnesota - OSSEO representative. Through these discussions the parties will attempt to resolve the problem.

A copy of such written grievance must simultaneously be filed with Human Resources. The Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources will set a meeting date within five (5) days of his/her receipt of the written grievance. The Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources will give a written decision on the grievance to the parties involved within ten (10) days after the meeting.
Subd. 3. Level II: In the event the grievance is not resolved in Level I, the decision rendered may be appealed to the superintendent of schools, provided such appeal is made in writing within five (5) days after receipt of the decision in Level I. If a grievance is properly appealed to the superintendent, the superintendent or his/her designee will set a time to meet regarding the grievance within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the appeal. Within ten (10) days after the meeting, the superintendent or his/her designee will issue a decision in writing to the parties involved.
Subd. 4.

If a grievance is properly appealed to the School Board, the School Board will set a time to hear the grievance within twenty (20) days after the receipt of the appeal. Within twenty (20) days after the meeting, the School Board will issue its decision in writing to the parties involved.

In the event the School Board reviews a grievance under this section, the School Board reserves the right to reverse or modify such decision.
Section 7.	Arbitration Procedures: In the event that the teacher and the School Board are unable to resolve any grievance, the grievance may be submitted to arbitration as defined herein:
Subd. 1. Request: A request to submit a grievance to arbitration must be in writing signed by the aggrieved party, and such request must be filed in the office of the superintendent within ten (10) days following the decision in Level III of the grievance procedure.
Subd. 2. Selection of Arbitrator: Upon the proper submission of a grievance under the terms of this procedure, the parties will within ten (10) days after the request to arbitrate, attempt to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator. If no agreement on an arbitrator is reached, either party may request the Bureau of Mediation Services to appoint an arbitrator, pursuant to the PELRA, providing such request is made within twenty (20) days after the request for arbitration. The request will ask that the appointment be made within thirty (30) days after receipt of the request. Failure to agree upon the arbitrator or the failure to request an arbitrator from the Bureau of Mediation Services within the time periods provided herein will constitute a waiver of the grievance.
Subd. 3. Hearing: The grievance will be heard by a single arbitrator and both parties may be represented by such person or persons as they may choose and designate, and the parties will have the right to a hearing at which time both parties will have the opportunity to submit evidence, offer testimony, and make oral or written arguments relating to the issues before the arbitrator. The proceeding before the arbitrator will be a hearing de novo.
Subd. 4. Decision: The decision by the arbitrator will be rendered within a time schedule mutually agreed to. Decisions and awards by the arbitrator in cases properly before him/her will be final and binding upon the parties, subject however, to the limitations of the arbitration decisions as provided in the PELRA of 1971, as amended.
Subd. 5. Expenses: Each party will bear its own expenses in connection with arbitration, including expenses relating to the party's representative, witnesses, and any other expenses which the party incurs in connection with presenting its case in arbitration. A transcript or recording will be made of the hearing at the request of either party. The parties will share, equally, fees and expenses of the arbitrator and any other expenses that the parties mutually agree are necessary for the conduct of the arbitration. The cost of a transcript or recording will be borne by the party requesting it.
Subd. 6. Jurisdiction: The arbitrator will have jurisdiction over disputes or disagreements relating to grievances properly before the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this procedure. The jurisdiction of the arbitrator will not extend to proposed changes in terms and conditions of employment as defined herein and contained in this Agreement; nor will an arbitrator have jurisdiction over any grievance which has not been submitted to arbitration in compliance with the terms of the grievance and arbitration procedure as outlined herein; nor will the jurisdiction of the arbitrator extend to matters of inherent managerial policy, which will include but are not limited to such areas of discretion or policy as the functions and programs of the employer, its overall budget, utilization of technology, the organizational structure, and selection and direction and number of personnel. In considering any issue in dispute, in its order, the arbitrator will give

EFFECTIVE DATES:	November 16, 1989 TO N/A
REVISION DATES:	January 3, 2002
Posting1:
The department chair and team leader positions are to be posted annually along with the current job description. The posting could include information concerning special projects, curriculum implementation and intervention activities for which leadership will be needed.
Application / Nomination:
The members of the team or department will meet as a group and nominate up to three candidates who they feel will provide the appropriate leadership and communication. Applicants may provide information relative to why she/he would be suited for the leadership position.
Interview Process:
The principal will conduct interviews with each candidate. Interview questions will be contributed by the staff and principal based on the expectations of the affected group and principal for that position.
Selection of Candidate:
The principal will make the final selection.
Annual Review:
The affected department/team and principal will annually review the accomplishments of the leader/group.

Extended Illness Sick Leave Pool Procedures
EFFECTIVE DATES:	November 16, 1989 TO N/A
REVISION DATES:	August, 2007; October 21, 2003; January 3, 2002; November 1995
Administration:
Human Resources will administer the extended illness sick leave pool. An accounting of the pool’s operation will be given to Education Minnesota - OSSEO annually (July).
Membership:
Teachers as defined in this Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment between Independent School District 279 and Education Minnesota - OSSEO are eligible to be members of the extended sick leave pool.
All teachers hired after July 1, 2004 will be required to join the pool. The new teacher will contribute one (1) day of sick leave to the pool.
Any teacher employed prior to July 1, 2004, who did not join the pool when he/she was initially eligible, may join when the pool is replenished or during open enrollment which occurs within thirty (30) days of each contract ratification. A teacher joining because of the need to replenish the pool or during open enrollment after contract ratification must donate the number of days equal to the number of days he/she would have donated had he/she been a member of the pool from the time he/she was first eligible.
Once a teacher is a member of the extended illness sick leave pool he/she may not withdraw from membership.
A minimum of five hundred (500) days must be in the pool at the start of each school year. If the number of days is less than five hundred (500), each member must contribute one (1) additional day of accumulated sick leave to the pool. All days donated to the pool are non-returnable. However, if a teacher has donated a day to the pool within three (3) years of their retirement the donated day may be used for their Retirement Incentive Pay (Article VII, Section 7) or their School Board Contribution for Health Insurance for Retirees (Article VIII, Section 7) provided the teacher has not utilized the pool within the same three (3) years, that day will be restored to their accumulated sick leave balance.
Operation:
The purpose of the pool is to provide extra sick leave days to those teachers suffering from a long-term/extended/recurring illness. A long-term illness or extended illness is defined as an absence of twenty-four (24) or more consecutive duty days. Sick leave pool days will be used only for personal long-term illness of the teacher.
In order for teachers to be eligible to draw from the pool, they must be contributing members. A request for use of pool days must be in writing and must be accompanied by a licensed physician’s verification that the applicant is/was unable to work.
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 2
A member is not eligible to use pool days until five (5) consecutive duty days after the depletion of individual accumulated sick leave (five day pay deduct). Available personal leave and/or substitute leave days may be substituted for the five (5) day pay deduct.
Benefits from the sick leave pool will end upon a member’s qualification for benefits from the long-term disability insurance plan, the Teachers’ Retirement Association, or Social Security. The maximum benefit from the pool by any member is fifty-five (55) days as long as the absence is uninterrupted and verified by a licensed physician.
Sick leave days from the pool may be drawn only for designated teacher calendar duty days.
Teachers on leaves of absence or sabbaticals are not eligible for benefits from the pool. Teachers receiving workers’ compensation are not eligible to draw from the pool.
The fiscal year of the pool will be the teacher contract year. A maximum of five hundred (500) days may be drawn from the pool in any one year.
Exceptions may be made at the discretion of the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources.
Topics Subject to the Meet and Confer Process
EFFECTIVE DATES:	January 3, 2002 TO N/A

EFFECTIVE DATES:	July 18, 1995
TO N/A
REVISION DATES:	January 3, 2002; July 1, 2005
Elementary and secondary library media specialists may voluntarily choose to participate in staff development activities sponsored by the School District Media and Technology Department for a maximum of five days during the summer that may be exchanged for a maximum of five days during the regular school year.
Library media specialists may exchange these staff development days for five contract workdays during the regular school year. Exchange days selected from the regular school year contracted days must be scheduled by mutual agreement with the building principal(s). Conflicts with scheduling of exchange days will be mediated by the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources.
Library Media Specialists Exchange Days for Set Up

Health Insurance Cost Containment
EFFECTIVE DATES:	September 4, 2007 TO February 29, 2008
It is mutually understood that the School District and Education Minnesota-OSSEO will establish a Health Insurance Cost Containment Labor Management Committee with the assistance of the Bureau of Mediation Services (BMS) to review health insurance renewal rates to determine cost containment provisions that will result in approximately a zero percent (0%) change in premiums for a new health insurance plan effective July 1, 2008 that provides an acceptable level consumerism.
The Health Insurance Cost Containment Labor Management Committee will be comprised of members of the teachers unit appointed by the Education Minnesota-OSSEO President, and individuals appointed by the Superintendent of Schools. The committee will be co-chaired by an Education Minnesota-OSSEO representative and a School District administrator. The administrative costs related to the committee’s work will be borne by the School District.
The following provisions will be implemented only if the Education Minnesota - OSSEO Committee on Health Insurance Cost Containment fail to reach agreement that will result in the required cost containment:
Effective July 1, 2008, the School Board will pay $473.77 of the cost of single insurance; any additional premium will be borne by the teacher and paid by payroll deduction. The School Board will pay $710.77 of the cost of employee + 1 insurance; any additional premium will be borne by the teacher and paid by payroll deduction. The School Board will pay $1,137.49 of the cost of family insurance; any additional premium will be borne by the teacher and paid by payroll deduction.
The following provisions will be implemented if the Education Minnesota - OSSEO Committee on Health Insurance Cost Containment is able to reach an agreement that will result in the required cost containment:
Effective July 1, 2008, the School Board will offer a health insurance plan that was developed by this Labor Management Committee and the School Board will pay one hundred percent (100%) of the premium for single coverage and seventy-five percent (75%) of the premium for employee + 1 and family coverage for this plan.

ADDENDUM A
TEACHER TRANSFER PROCEDURES
Subd. 1. Distribution of FTE's within the Building/Site or Program:
The specific process for distribution within the building/site or program of the Full Time Equivalents (FTE's) will be governed by the Site Decision Making Matrix as identified in the School Improvement Guidelines and Parameters Handbook. Principals will be provided the names of those teachers who have a right to return to a previously held position. Teachers with return rights include:
a.	Teachers returning from approved leaves pursuant to return right guidelines disclosed in Article IV-Leaves of Absence of the Teachers Terms and Conditions of Employment.
b.	Teachers returning from a Teacher Exchange (see Subd.10 of this Addendum).
c.	Teachers in identified positions who have indicated an intention to return to their former position (see Subd. 16 of this Addendum).
Subd. 2. Internal Site Reassignments of Continuing Contract Teachers:
All openings created by retirements, resignations, terminations or new programs known by March 1st will first be made available to continuing contract teachers who are currently within the building/site or program. All continuing contract teachers requesting an internal site reassignment must be interviewed in accordance with established guidelines of the Site Decision-Making Matrix or by a team of affected teachers, including the Principal/Director/Coordinator. The Principal/Director/ Coordinator will make the final decision. However, the building/site or program must submit a similar or equal position to the Initial Voluntary Transfer of Continuing Contract Teachers Process.
(Exception: If the building/site or program has an overall reduction in their FTE’s any FTE opening created by retirements, resignations, terminations or new programs that are filled at the building/site or program by a continuing contract teacher in this process exempts the building/site or program from having to submit a similar or equal position to the Initial Voluntary Transfer of Continuing Contract Teachers Process. Probationary teachers cannot be moved from their current level and/or assignments into a newly vacated position if a similar position cannot be delivered to the initial voluntary transfer process)
Subd. 3. Internal Site Reassignments of Probationary Teachers:
Probationary teachers may be reassigned within the building/site or program. However, this reassignment will only be done with the consent of the probationary teacher(s). The reassignment of probationary teachers cannot reduce the number of FTE’s that a building/site or program submits to the Initial Voluntary Transfer Process of Continuing Contract Teachers. The Principal/Director/Coordinator will make the final decision on any reassignment of probationary teachers in the Internal Site Reassignment of Probationary Staff.
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 9
Subd. 4. Initial Voluntary Transfer of Continuing Contract Teachers:
Positions created by retirements, resignations, terminations or new programs that are known by March 1st will be open to all properly licensed continuing contract teachers who may seek a voluntary transfer except when a building/site or program filled the position within the Internal Site Reassignment Processes as outlined in Subd. 2 and Subd. 3.
a.	Interviews in the Initial Voluntary Transfer for Continuing Contract Teachers:
Continuing contract teachers who seek a voluntary transfer must notify the Human Resources Department within a five (5) day posting period for positions in this Initial Voluntary Transfer process. All continuing contract teachers requesting a voluntary transfer must be interviewed in accordance with established guidelines of the Site Decision-Making Matrix or by a team of affected teachers, including the Principal/Director/Coordinator. The Principal/Director/Coordinator will make the final decision. When there is more than one open position at a building/site or program and a continuing contract teacher applies for multiple positions, the building/site or program is only obligated to interview the continuing contract teacher two (2) times. Reasons, if requested, must be presented within five (5) days to the teacher not selected with appropriate feedback about the interview and why the decision to deny the transfer was made.
b.	Availability of New Opening for the Internal Reassignment Process:
The position previously held by a continuing contract teacher who receives a reassignment in this Initial Voluntary Transfer Process will be made available for internal site reassignment following the procedures of Subd. 2 with a 24 hour posting, or will be made available through the Involuntary Transfer Process.
Subd. 5. Identification of Continuing Contract Teacher for Involuntary Transfer:
The following procedures will be followed to identify the continuing contract teacher who will be an Involuntary Transfer.
a.	Probationary Teacher within Affected Grade Level, Department or Program:
When an Involuntary Transfer is required at a grade level, department or program and there is a probationary teacher within the grade level, department or program, the probationary teacher will be removed from the position and may be placed in a hiring pool provided the teacher meets District standards based on the teacher performance appraisal system. Probationary teachers not placed in the hiring pool will have their contracts non-renewed at the end of the current school year. Placement in this pool does not guarantee employment. However, following the Involuntary Transfer Process teachers in the hiring pool of displaced probationary teachers will be considered first for any remaining open positions. Probationary teachers selected for the pool but not placed by June 1st will have their teaching contract non-renewed.
b.	Probationary Teacher within Affected Grade Level, Department or Program:
If there are no probationary teachers at the affected grade level, department or program, continuing
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 10
contract teacher volunteers within the grade level, department or program will be sought to become the Involuntary Transfer see Subd. 5c.
c.	Continuing Contract Teacher within Affected Grade Level, Department or Program wants to be the Involuntary Transfer:
Continuing Contract teachers in the affected grade level, department or program may volunteer in seniority order (most to least) to become the Involuntary Transfer.
d.	No Continuing Contract Teacher within Affected Grade Level, Department or Program wants to be the Involuntary Transfer:
If there are no volunteers at the affected grade level, department or program, other continuing contract teachers holding the same licensure as the least senior continuing contract teacher of the affected grade level, department or program may volunteer, again in seniority order (most to least), to become the Involuntary Transfer. The Principal or Program Director/Coordinator must approve the request to allow these building/site or program volunteers because the least senior teacher of the affected grade level, department or program must transfer to the position held by the teacher who volunteers to become the Involuntary Transfer.
e.	Least Senior Continuing Contract Teacher within Affected Grade Level, Department or Program:
If there is not a qualified volunteer, the least senior continuing contract teacher in the affected grade level, department or program will be the Involuntary Transfer.
f.	Opportunity to Transfer to a Probationary Teacher's Position:
The least senior continuing contract teacher will have the opportunity to transfer to another position at the current building/site or program if the position is open or the position is held by a probationary teacher and the continuing contract teacher is properly licensed. The continuing contract teacher who indicates a desire to transfer to a position within the building/site or program must meet with the Principal/Director/ Coordinator regarding the transfer. If the requested transfer is approved, the displaced probationary teacher will then be assigned as an Involuntary Transfer because the displacement does not cause a continuing contract teacher to become the Involuntary Transfer.
g.	Exemption from being the Involuntary Transfer if on Building or District Level Assistance:
A continuing contract teacher on a building or district level assistance program will not be eligible to become the Involuntary Transfer, except under STRAND conditions outlined in Subd. 13.
h.	Major changes in a building/site and/or unique circumstances:
Education Minnesota-OSSEO and the District may enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to allow continuing contract teachers to enter the Involuntary Transfer Process where appropriate.
Subd. 6. Principal Responsibility for Notification of Openings to Human Resources Department:
When the internal building/site or program staffing process is complete, the Principal or Program Director/Coordinator will list the teacher(s) who will be the Involuntary Transfer(s) and any remaining vacancies by grade level or by license area and provide the list to the Human Resources Department. This list must be provided during the staffing process each year.
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 11
Subd. 7. Human Resources Department Responsibility for Involuntary Transfer:
The Human Resources Department will contact each teacher on the Involuntary Transfer list to ascertain the desired grade level (elementary) or division (elementary, junior or senior high) to be selected in the Involuntary Transfer process. The desired positions must be within the licensure area(s) of the continuing contract teachers. Human Resources will provide information on possible open positions or positions held by a probationary teacher to assist each teacher in the Involuntary Transfer Process to identify their desired grade level (elementary) or division (elementary, junior or senior high) to be selected in the Involuntary Transfer process.
a.	Seniority List:
The Human Resources Department will compile a list of all teachers identified for Involuntary Transfers on the Involuntary Transfer list, their licenses, and seniority dates. Education Minnesota-OSSEO will be supplied this list as soon as it is compiled.
b.	Involuntary Transfer Notification:
Teachers identified for Involuntary Transfer will be notified in writing not later than five working days before the Involuntary Transfer Meeting. The notice will contain:
1.	A complete list of all vacancies available to the individual teacher based on his/her current license(s) including the grade level, department, building/site or program, a description of the position and/or program, and
2.	The date and time for the Involuntary Transfer Meeting for the individual's license area(s).
c.	Vacant Position List:
The Human Resources Department will work with Assistant Superintendents, Principals, Directors or Coordinators to ensure an appropriate position is available in the Involuntary Transfer for identified teachers.
1.	There must be an open position at one grade level on either side of the desired grade level for elementary teachers, an open position at the desired division (junior high or senior high) for secondary teachers, and an open position at the requested level for other teachers. The process of making appropriate positions available may necessitate the placement of additional probationary teachers into the hiring pool for probationary teachers. Human Resources and Education Minnesota-OSSEO will assist all teachers in the Involuntary Transfer Process to identify and/or select an appropriate position.
2.	It is understood that the requirement to ensure an appropriate position as stated in Subd. 7c-1 will only be enforced when there are open positions or there is a position(s) held by probationary teachers in the desired levels or licensure areas.
3.	The positions will only be guaranteed at the beginning of the selection process. Once the selection process begins, seniority will dictate available positions. A teacher must select a
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 12
position based on the open positions at the time their name is called based on their seniority date and licensure. Teachers are encouraged to select a position within the framework of Subd. 7c-1.
Subd. 8. Involuntary Transfer Meeting for Teachers:
All teachers who have been involuntarily transferred should attend the Involuntary Transfer Meeting so that they may select their position in seniority order (most to least).
a.	Selection of Assignments by Seniority:
Specific assignments will be made exclusively on seniority and license. The most senior Involuntary Transfer will select first. The next most senior by license area will then have the second choice, and so on. The process will continue until all involuntarily transferred teachers have received an assignment.
b.	Official Notification of Assignment:
All involuntarily transferred teachers will be notified by the Human Resources Department of their assignment for the following year no later than three (3) days following the Involuntary Transfer Meeting.
c.	Right of Continuing Contract Teachers to Return to Their Previous Assignment:
The Human Resources Department will notify any continuing contract teachers who are involuntarily transferred if the position they were transferred from becomes available between the Involuntary Transfer Meeting and the first teacher workshop day. If a continuing contract teacher wishes to return to their previous assignment, they must notify the Human Resources Department within three (3) days of notification, or before their first scheduled work day, whichever occurs first. The position to which they had been involuntarily transferred will then be posted for a voluntary transfer except when the notification is given within five (5) days of the first teacher workshop day.
Subd. 9. Second Voluntary Transfer Process:
All open positions not filled in the Involuntary Transfer Process will be made available to current contract teachers and probationary teachers who were placed in the hiring pool for displaced probationary teachers. Teachers who seek a voluntary transfer must notify the Human Resources Department within a five (5) day posting period for open positions they seek in this Second Voluntary Transfer process. All continuing contract teachers requesting a voluntary transfer must be interviewed in accordance with established guidelines of the Site Decision-Making Matrix or by a team of affected teachers, including the Principal/Director/Coordinator. The Principal/Director/Coordinator will make the final decision. When there is more than one open position at a building/site or program and a continuing contract teacher applies for multiple positions, the building/site or program is only obligated to interview the continuing contract teacher two (2) times. Reasons, if requested, must be presented within five (5) days to the teacher not selected with appropriate feedback about the interview and why the decision to deny the transfer was made.
Subd. 10. Teacher Exchange:
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 13
To provide different teaching options, two or more continuing contract teachers may request to exchange positions for one school year.
a.	The request to exchange positions must be made in writing to the principals involved, to the appropriate Assistant Superintendent, and to the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources. A teacher exchange may be approved without following the posting notice or the transfer policy.
b.	Requests to participate in a teacher exchange must be received in Human Resources no later than June 30th.
c.	Approval will be made by the principals involved, the appropriate Assistant Superintendent, and the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources in conjunction with the continuing contract teachers making the request.
d.	All teacher exchanges will begin on the first day of the school year.
e.	Upon expiration of the time period for the exchange, the teachers will return to their prior positions or exchange teachers may request to continue in their new assignment thereby giving up their rights to the previous assignment. A request to continue in the new assignment must be submitted to Human Resources no later than March 1st.
Subd. 11. Positions Known After the Involuntary Transfer Process:
Following the Second Voluntary Transfer Process, all available positions created by new funding, changes in enrollment, additional resignations, retirements, leaves of absences, or vacancies created by other voluntary transfers will be made available for voluntary transfer. The Human Resources Department will post or publish any remaining positions that are still open for the coming school year. The notification will specify licensure requirements, any special conditions, special needs and skills unique to the position.
Positions will be posted for three (3) working days until the end of the school year and five (5) working days after school is out for the summer until August 1st. Effective August 1st posting duration will be reduced to three (3) days until five (5) days prior to the 1st teacher workshop day. Continuing Contract, probationary teachers and outside candidates may apply for these positions. Continuing Contract Teachers must be granted an interview. The granting of interviews for probationary and outside candidates is at the discretion of the principal/director/coordinator.
Subd. 12. Transfer Process within five (5) days of the first teacher workshop day:
District teachers may receive a voluntary transfer within five (5) days prior to the first teacher workshop day in the following ways:
a.	By mutual agreement between Principals/Directors/ Coordinators.
b.	To positions as approved by a Labor Management Committee.
c.	To a position where the licensure area has a shortage of candidate
Subd. 13. STRAND Realignment:
ISD279 / Education Minnesota - OSSEO Agreement on Terms and Conditions of Employment
Memorandums of Understanding
July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2009	Page 14
Definition: A Minnesota Supreme Court decision requires school boards to reassign continuing contract teachers in a reasonable manner to preserve their employment. The shifting or realignment of these teachers saves the jobs of other less senior continuing contract teachers who are facing layoffs.
Subd. 14. Early Hiring of Staff:
The Human Resources Department each year will determine the probable distribution of FTE's to buildings/sites or programs for the next year. The Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources may, after conducting a Meet and Confer process with Education Minnesota - OSSEO, authorize the early hiring of a targeted number of unassigned new hires in selected areas. These unassigned new hires will be assigned to specific positions immediately following the Involuntary Transfer assignments.
Subd. 15. Unique Circumstances:
Occasionally it may be in the best interest of a continuing contract teacher and the School District to involuntarily transfer the teacher due to situations that are unique and are not related to performance. When a teacher makes a request for an Involuntary Transfer for a unique situation, a Labor Management Committee will convene.
a.	Labor Management Committee Membership
The Labor Management Committee will include the following
1.	The Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources
2.	The affected licensed staff member
3.	The affected licensed staff members current Principal/Director/Coordinator
4.	The affected licensed staff member's current Assistant Superintendent
5.	The Education Minnesota Field Staff
6.	The Education Minnesota - OSSEO President
b.	Labor Management Committee Process
This committee will review the request and MUST mutually agree that a transfer would be in the best interest of all involved in order for the teacher to be placed in the Involuntary Transfer Process. If the request is granted, the position held by the affected teacher will not follow the building/site or program selection process, but be placed as a vacancy as noted in Subd. 4.
c.	Exclusion from Returning to the Vacated Position
Once the affected teacher is placed in the Involuntary Transfer Process he/she will not be allowed to return to the position in the building/site or program he/she vacated.
Subd. 16. Process to return to a classroom teaching assignment for continuing contract teachers in an identified position:
