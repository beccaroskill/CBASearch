Qualifications and Certification:
1.	The parties signatory hereto have established a Certification Examination for all operators of cranes in excess
of a 5-ton lifting capacity. A committee of not less than three (3) management representatives and three (3) union representatives appointed by the Training and Retraining Trust shall establish the protocol for the Certification Examination and its revisions. Each member of the committee must have full knowledge of the skills and necessary requirements for the crane operations that the examination (s) will cover.
2.	The address for testing shall be at the Operating Engineers and management’s training site at 2190 Pfellisier Place, Whittier. In addition, the testing site maybe designated at an employer's place of business or some other location designated by the management/union committee to give a test to all operators.
