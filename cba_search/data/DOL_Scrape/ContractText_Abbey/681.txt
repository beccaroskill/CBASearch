APPENDIX "A"
The minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.
Rale Determination
Employees hired before March 27,2005 who remain in their classification after commencement of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the "hired and assigned in the bargaining unit prior to March 27, 2005" wage schedule while they remain in chat classification.
Demotions, Step Downs and layoffs: An employ ee who is demoted, steps down, or who is laid off in accordance with this Agreement, shall be placed back into the same wage schedule in which the employee was working immediately prior to their assignment into management or promotion into the classification from which they are being demoted, stepping down or laid off. In determining the proper progression level for an employee demoted, stepping down, or laid off from a classification with a higher "thereafter" hourly rate to a classification with a lower "thereafter" hourly rate, such affected employee shall be placed in the appropriate progression level in the rate schedule referenced in this paragraph based on their experience in the newly assigned classification, regardless of whether such assigned rate results in a reduction in hourly rate. In determining prior experience hereunder, the Employer will give recognition to the verified number of hours of actual work experience in the same classification which said employee may have performed for the Employer and the verified number of hours of actual work experience on a comparable job which said employee may have performed within the previous five (5) years for any other employer in a similar retail grocery operation.
Rate Determination - Promotions, new hires and new entrants into the bargaining unit: Employees hired into, or assigned lo. or promoted to a different classification, the bargaining unit on or after March 27, 2005 shall be assigned to the "EMPLOYEES HIRED INTO THE BARGAINING UNIT OR ASSIGNED OR PROMOTED ON OR AFTER March 27. 2005" w age scale. Employees w ho are promoted lo a different classification after March 26,2005 shall not receive a reduction in their hourly rate of pay if when promoted to such classification they are being paid an hourly rate of pay greater than the minimum, unless they are above the "thereafter" hourly rate in which case they will immediately be paid the "thereafter" hourly rate. When such employee is paid less than the "thereafter" hourly rate, prior to receiving an increase in their hourly rale of pay, they must work 1,040 hours at their current rate before promotion to the hourly rate in Ihe new classification that would give them an increase in their hourly rate of pay.

Sabbath. Unsigned and Undated agreement between Safeway and UFCW Local 7
PROCEDURE FOR SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES WITH
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO
WORKING ON THEIR DAY OF SABBATH
We have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath Safeway has entered into an agreement with LTCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.
Problems can result in a grievance under the contract as well as a possible violation ofthe laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Safeway Inc. Human Resources if necessary
This procedure, ot course, applies only to any employee who advised you:
1.	that they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.
2.	the nature of their conscientious objections, and
3.	the particular day of the week which they are unable to work
If you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter You also should complete the form attached to these instructions, ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Safeway Inc. Human Resources Department for future reference.
The procedure for scheduling is as follows
1.	UntilnoononSa turda y for th e fol 1 'awing w eek's sc hed u le an em pl oy ee may i de nti fy and reques t
an exchange of shifts with any employee junior io him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.
2.	As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with a senior employee
who is willing to make such an exchange Again, you may deny this request if ihe exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are nol trained, or for some other equal ly substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shaJJ prevail and the senior employee may refuse to make the trade.

3.
As a third alternative, un employee mat simply decline to work on their day of Sabbath it they cannot trade shifts with anyone else. Such an employee will not be disciplined under the Absenteeism Program except for tai lure to notify the Company prior to a scheduled shift that he will not work on their day of Sabbath. You will then assess points tor failure to call, hut not fur the absence itself.
4	. [fan employee cannot make a change of shifts and is scheduled on their day of Sabbath tor the entire bid period or for any extended period of time, it is permissible fur that employee to advise you al the beginning of the bid period or other extended period of tune that they will nut work on suchday lorthe entire three months. Such an employee, if fall-time, will not in fact be scheduled 4ft hours, but 32 hours. The Company has no obligation to pros ide 40 hours work under these circumstances.
Attached you will find a form tor keeping a record of any such scheduling accommodation.
