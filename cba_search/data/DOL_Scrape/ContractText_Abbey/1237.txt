Once implemented, the Policy shall remain in effect unless otherwise agreed toby the Unionand the Individual Employer.
An Individual Employer which is regulated by the United States Departmentof Transportation (“DOT") Codeof Federal Regulation CFR382and 49 may elect not to implement the testing provisions ot this Policy for its Employees who are not regulated by DOT.

agency of the federal government which has responsibility for establishingstandards for drug testing. All such agencies shall be collectively referred to as "SAMHSA.”

Laboratories. All laboratories which perform tests underthis Policy shall be SAMHSA certified.
Testing Procedures and Protocols. All SAMHSA standards for testing standards and protocols shall be followed. All specimens which are determined to be positive by the SAMHSA approved screening test shall be subject to a SAMHSAcertified confirmatory test (gas cliromatography/mass spectrometiy).
Second Test The laboratory shall save a sufficient portion of each specimen inamannerapprovedbySAMHSAsothat an Employee may have a second test performed. Immediately after the specimen is collected, it will be labeled and then initialed by the Employee and a witness. If the sample must be collected at a site other than the drug and/or alcohol testinglaboratory, the specimen shall then be placed ina transportation container. Thecontainer shall be sealed in the Employee’s presence and the Employee shall be asked to initial or sign thecontainer. Thecontainer shah be sent to the designated testing laboratory on that day or the earliest business day by the fastest available method. Any Employee whose specimen is tested positive and who challenges a test result may have the second portion of the sample tested at his/her expense and at a laboratory agreed upon by the Employee and the MROso long as that laboratory is SAMHSA certified and has been or is approved by the parties and the Employee requests the second test within seventy-two (72) hours of notice of a positive result. If the second test is negative, the Employee will be considered to have been tested negative,
Cut-OH Levels. SAMHSA standards for cut-off levels will be complied with when applicable.

Medical Review Officer. A Medical Review Officer (“MRO") shall verify alt positive test results. The MRO must be a licensed physician. The MRO shall be a member of the American Society of Addictive Medicine (“ASAM") if available. If no ASAM members are available, the MRO shall be certified by the Medical Review Officers’ Certification Council. The Union shall approve all MRO's. Upon verification of a positive test result, the MRO shall refer the affected Employee to ARP for assessment and referral to treatment, if appropriate
Consent Form. Anv Employee directed to submit to a test in accordance with this Policy will sign aconscnt and release form, a copy of which is attached hereto (Fbrm “A"). The consent and release form will only authorize (1) the facility where the specimen is collected to collect the specimen, (2) the laboratory which performs the test to perform the test and to provide the results to the MRO, and, if negative, to the Individual Employer, and (3) the MRO to verify tests and report to the Individual Employer whether the test is positive or negative. The consent and release form shall notify the Employee that he/she may have a Union representative present if available.

The laboratory will report positive test results to the MRQ The MRO will verity whether the test is positive or negative. The MRO shall report to the Individual Employer whether the Employee tested positive or negative for one of these substances. The MRO will not identify the substance(s) for which the Employee tested positive unless specifically required to do so by DOT regulations.

A. TIME OF DISPATCH TESTING
An Individual Employer may require an Employee to be tested for the presence in the Employee's body of one of the drugs or by products thereof set forth above at the time the Employee is dispatched (on one of the first three (3) days of employment). It must test all Employees at the time they are dispatched if it tests any Employee.The Individual Employer shall put the Employee to work or pay the Employee pending the test results unless (he Employee has been dispatched to a DOT regulated assignment and the Individual Employer does not have any work for the Employee to perform which is not subject to the DOT regulations or if it has probable cause to believe the Employee is impaired, intoxicated, or under the influence of a drug. The standards tor probable cause are set forth below in Section B. If the Individual Employer does no! allow an Employee to work pending the test results because it believes it has probable cause, it shall make the Employee whole for all lost wagesand benefits if the Employee tests negative. Employees who test positive will be referred to ARP. The Individual Employer shall not be obligated to employ any such Employee after ARP releases the Employee to return to work but may employ such Employee under the terms of a return-to-work agreement. An Employee who refuses to submit to a dnig/alcohol test when dispatched shall not be paid show-up time.
An Individual Employer may test Employees who are recalled from layoff as provided tor in the Job Placement Regulations who have not worked (or thirty (30) days. If the Individual Employer tests any Employee who is recalled, it must test all such Employees. An Individual Employer may test all Employees at the time they are dispatched under this Section except for those who are recalled.
Time of Dispatch Screening by the Job Placement Center The parties shall establish a joint committee to determine whether there is a feasible means by which theJob Placement Centers can conduct the drug/alcohol screen before dispatching an Employee so that only Employees with a negative test will be referred.
R PROBABLE CAUSE TESTING
An Individual Employer may require an Employee to submit to a drug test as provided for in this Policy if it has probable cause that the Employee is impaired, intoxicated, and/or under the influence of a drug. Probable cause must be based on a trained management representative's (preferably not in the bargaining unit) objective observations and must be based upon abnormal coordination, appearance, behavior, absenteeism, speech or odor. The indicators shall be recognized and accepted symptoms of intoxication or impairment caused by drugs or alcohol and shall be indicators not reasonably explained as resulting from causes other than the use of such controlled substance and/or alcohol (such as,

but not by way of limitation, fatigue, lack of sleep, side effects of proper use of prescription drugs, reaction to noxious fumes or smoke, etc.). Probable cause may not be established, and thus not a basis for testing, if it is based solely on the observationsand reports of third parties. The trained management representative's observations and conclusions must be confirmed by another trained management representative. The grounds for probable cause must be documented by the use of an Incident Report Fbrm (see Fbrm “B" attached). The Management Representative shall give the Employee a completed copy ot this Incident Report Fbrm and shall give the Union Representative, if present, a copy of the Incident Form before the Employee is required to be tested. After being given a copy of the Incident Report Fbrm, the Employee shall be allowed enough time to read the entire document and to understand the reasons for the test.
