The ratio of apprentices in training to joumeypersons should not exceed one (1) apprentice to eight (B) journeypersons. However, the Union agrees that local Management can establish a ratio of apprentices to joumeypersons in excess of the one (1) to eight (6} ratio, but not to exceed a ratio of one (1) apprentice to five (5) journeypersons. Deviations below the one (1) to five (5) ratio may be agreed to by the Apprentice Committee. Favorable cnnsidorAtion will k?. gh'9.n to requests for deviation below the one (1) to five (5) ratio in instances in which it is anticipated the impact of early retirement will create a manpower workforce shortage. Disputes concerning such deviations or the enrolling of new apprentices at a time when seniority journeypersons in the same classification are laid off due to a permanent reduction in force will be referred to the DDC-UAW Apprentice Committee for decision.
(6.6)	Ratio - Reduction In Force
(A) In the event of a reduction of force, the apprentices in excess of one (1) to eight (8) ratio will be laid off before any . journeyperson in that trade is laid off. The ratio of apprentices in training to journeypersons will be based on the average number of journeypersons employed for the program computed on the last Monday of each of the twelve preceding months. The average thus computed shall remain in force until a new computation is made on the last Monday of the next succeeding month. If, during periods when journeypersons are laid off, any monthly computation
67
results Ina ratio in excess of one (1) apprentice to eight (8) journeypersons, such excess apprentices will be laid off by the end of the pay period during which the last Monday of the month falls except that a minimum of one apprentice may be retained in each trade.
(8)	In the event the reduction in force is due to unusual circumstances, including, but not confined to: a transfer or discontinuance of an operation, major technological developments, the elimination or consolidation of classifications, the discontinuance of a shift, or a drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled work force; Management, the Shop Committee and the Union members of the Apprentice Committee shall mutually agree to an acceptable layoff and recall plan. Such a layoff plan may provide for reducing the ratio below one (1) to eight (8), or for laying off all apprentices in a particular trade.
(6.7)	Standard Work Week
(A)	To maintain the proper schedule for graduating apprentices, their standard work week, including time spent in connection with related training, shall be forty (40) hours.

(B)	In case an apprentice is required to work overtime, credit shal be given on the term of apprenticeship for only the actual hours of work.
68
(C)	Upon graduation, an apprentice will be credited with the mean hours in the skilled trades equalization group to which they are assigned on the first Monday {Tuesday if Monday is a. holiday), following the date of graduation. They will remain in their respective Apprentice Equalization group until such time.
(6.8)	Allowance-Tools, Books, Supplies.......................

(6.10)	Apprentice Training Schedule
The present shop and related training schedules will remain in effect until replaced by revised schedules. The revised schedules will be adopted for those apprentices presently in the training program to the extent that they can be integrated into such revised programs without interfering with the progress of the apprentice. If plant requirements indicate deviation should be made in such shop or related training schedules, proposed changes must be referred to the DDC-UAW Apprentice Committee for consideration.
In order to gain knowledge and experience in their particular trade, apprentices are given the opportunity to work with the machinery and equipment pertinent to their trade. In addition, experienced joumeyper-sons are available for necessary advice and assistance, and will work with apprentices until they display sufficient skills to work by themselves.
Apprentices should be given job assignments based on acquired skills and experience, knowledge of the job and confidence in their abilities. At this point, when apprentices display sufficient skills to satisfactorily complete an assignment on their own, the apprentice should be assigned to such jobs. This decision, by the apprentice's supervisor, can be from direct observation of the apprentice’s abilities while performing jobs or from discussion between the supervisor and the respective journeyperson with who the apprentice is working. In any event, Management will continue to assign apprentices pursuant to the provisions of the DDC-UAW Apprentice Plan and applicable Master Agreement provisions and understandings according to the apprentice’s skills and abilities.
In the event situations arise within specific apprentice classifications, for example significant shop or related training schedule changes, and it is recognized these specific changes involve all apprentices of a particular trade, Management is agreeable to arrange clarification meetings provided it is pertinent information for all apprentices concerned and the most practical method available to communicate the change.

71
uniform shop training schedules, ma/ be developed by the Apprentice Committee.
(F)	Optional hours provided in each shop training schedule to be used as follows:
(1)	To give additional training over and above the hours designated in the shop training schedule in those phases which would be most beneficial to the I	apprentice in acquiring journeyperson status.

Apprentices will not exercise shift preference during the related training semester if it would result in a conflict in the related training schedule of the apprentice exercising shift preference or the apprentice being displaced, as an example the employees not being able to continue the same related training course during different hours. It will be the responsibility of the apprentice initiating the shift preference change to furnish evidence in the form of a letter from the school that a conflict does not exist. If a conflict does exist, the shift transfer will be made at the conclusion of the related training semester. Any unusual situations will be subject to review by the Apprentice Committee to be resolved in line with the purpose of the shift preference procedure for apprentices.
Management must reserve the right to place an apprentice on other than his desired simi'if it is found that he is delinquent in any phase of his shop training and/or related training.

ARTICLE 10 WORKING CONDOTONS
(10.1)	Production Standards
(A) Production standards shall be established on the basis of
I	fairness and equity consistent with the quality of work, effi-
1	ciency of operations, and the reasonable working capacities
।	of normal operators. Management will not condone time
।	studies being conducted under threat of intimidation and any
'	such claims may be raised directly to Industrial Relations.
'	(1) Model mix shall be taken into account in establishing	I
'	and/or changing production standards on assembly
operations. The speed of such assembly lines will not be increased beyond the level tor which they are staffed for the purpose of gaining additional production or for the purpose of making up for loss of production due to breakdowns or unscheduled line gaps or stops.
(2)	Work assignments on conveyor lines will be made in accordance with line speeds and available work space and the expected normal ratio of model mix and optional equipment. When it is necessary to adjust the normal scheduled mix on conveyor lines which results in more or less work being required, compensating adjustments in work assignment, workforce, spacing of units, line speed or any combination thereof will be made. Arrangements will be made locally to establish procedures which will provide advance knowledge of mix changes that require compensating adjustments so that such adjustments wifi be made in a timely manner. On conveyor line operations, Management will designate specific off-line operations from which employees will be
132
made available to compensate for such mix changes when one of the compensating adjustments requires an increase in employees and in such case the assignment of employees will be given priority over the off-line operation. Upon request, Management will advise the Union of the arrangements made.
(3)	After the time or the requirements for a normal operator to perform an element has been established oh an assembly operation and the element is subsequently changed because of engineering changes, a change in method, machinery, equipment, layout or tools, only the time or the requirements of the elements affected by such change will be adjusted.
(4)	If a standard is to be established on a new off-line or machine operation and has not been established when the operation is placed in production, the operator will be advised of the reason for not establishing the standard and the expected requirements of the operation.
(5)	Job standards will be on file in each department and wilJ be kept current at all times. Each employee will be presented with or have access to information showing his production requirement.
(6)	Any employee desiring to check the job standards i.e., (cycle time, speeds, & feeds and/or pieces per hour), may do so by means of a request to the supervisor. It is agreed that job requirements will be available to all operators; however, the method of implementing this will necessarily differ in various departments.
(7)	When a time study, spot check or work sample is to be made lor time study purposes, the employee will be advised beforehand.
133
(8)	Hourly production records are used as an orderly means of maintaining efficiency and production counts and they are not intended to be used to harass employees, nor will they be used as the sole basis for assessing disciplinary action,
(9)	When a dispute arises regarding standards established or changed by the Management, the complaint should be taken up with the supervisor. If the dispute is not settled by the supervisor or if the complaint is not taken up by the employee with the supervisor, the committeeperson for that district shall, without regard to the restrictions on his time as provided in Article 1 (3.4)(G) of the Representation Section shall upon i reporting to the supervisor of the department involved, examine the job to determine the merits of the complaint, The employee may then file a grievance. The supervisor or the time study person will furnish him with all ot the facts of the case. If there is still a dispute after the committeeperson has completed the examination, the operations may then be re- | examined in detail with the supervisor or the time study person. The committeeperson will, upon request, be given in writing the work elements of the job without undue delay, which means as soon as reasonably possible under circumstances existing at the time the request is made for the work elements of the job. When available, the cycle lime or other pertinent data that is relevant to the dispute will be provided in writing upon request; however, It is mutually recognized that it would be impractical to provide this information during periods of production acceleration, or due to the volume of production standards, grievances filed etc. On these occasions the information requested by the Committeeperson cannot be t furnished as promptly as under normal circum-	1
stances. If the matter is not adjusted at this stage, it	J
134
may be further appealed as provided in the procedure below. If the dispute is settled at any stage of this procedure, the parties to the settlement wiil, upon request of either party, specify in writing what the elements are that constitute the job as settled including a notation of the then current model mix and line speed and this information will be initialed and dated by the parties.
(10)	After the supervisor has had reasonable time to consider a grievance filed claiming violation of production standards, which shall be not more than two working days, the supervisor shall thereafter answer the grievance:
(a)	Within one working day after requested to do so by the committfleoerson, or
(b)	In any event after ten (10) working days of the date the grievance was filed with the supervisor.
The above time limits may be extended by mutual agreement.
(11)	If the case is not adjusted by the supervisor, it may, within three (3) working days of the supervisor's written answer, be appealed by the Shop Committeeperson for the Zone, or another member of the Shop Committee, or the Chairperson of the Shop Committee to the next step, as provided below, by giving written notice to the Industrial Relations Department,

more than three representatives of Management, at least one of whom shall be a member of higher supervision. Time spent in the Special Step meeting by the District Committeeperson will not be charged '	against the time allowed under Article (3.4)(G).
-	(a) In the multi-shift operations, the District
Committeeperson or the Shop Committeeperson from the opposite shift(s) may, by mutual agreement, attend the Special Step Meeting when a standards dispute exists on the same operation on more than one shift. An additional representative of management may also attend the Special Step Meeting in these situations. The schedule for such meetings will be established at a time mutually convenient to the participants.
(13)	After a case is appealed to the Special Step and prior to the meeting on the case at that step, a member of the Shop Committee who will participate in the Special Step meeting may make a further investigation of the case as provided in Article (2.3).
(14)	Within five (5) working days of this Special Step meeting, higher supervision will give a written answer. If the case is not settled at this step, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may, within three working days appeal the case by submitting to Management a “Notice of Unadjusted Grievance." Thereafter the case will be handled in accordance with Step Three of the Grievance Procedure Section, except that "Statements of Unadjusted Grievance’ need not be exchanged and
136
the 30-day time limit for “Notice of Appear by the Regional Director, shall run from the date of the answer given by Management at the Special Step of the Grievance Procedure. Plant entry may be made after the “Notice of Unadjusted Grievance" has been filed and before the Appeal Meeting.
(15)	The time limits specified above may be extended by mutual agreement in writing. Any case not appealed from one step of this procedure to the next within the time limits specified will be considered closed on the basis of the last decision given.

137
(19)	It is important to DDC to retain its right to transfer employees in order to maintain and improve efficiency in our operations. It is also important to respect the right of employees to file legitimate grievances regarding production standards or disciplinary action. DDC does not consider it proper to transfer, reassign or separate employees because they file such grievances.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
During the 1998 negotiations the parties have committed to focus joint efforts and cooperation to improve environmental conditions in the plant. The “floor to ceiling" scope of the discussions centered around many areas of the plant which included coolant, housekeeping, mist, dust control, and ventilation.
A major subject of concern is coolant, the concentrated level of coolant, blocked coolant flumes, which cause backups and overflow situations, and the contamination of coolant which contributes to deteriorating air quality, as well as the high cost associated with frequently dumping systems.
The parties have identified department 561 as the initial area to focus these joint efforts with the understanding that this approach will be expanded to other areas of the plant. The following procedures have been agreed upon:
Adding Coolant
In order to minimize unauthorized coolant additions, oil stores will be instructed to deliver exact quantities of coolant to affected departments upon proper authorization from the Metallurgical Laboratory.
Coolant Contamination and Blockage
The prevention of coolant contamination begins with the education of the workforce as to the effects on air quality and housekeeping due to putting foreign matter into the coolant system. Specific steps to be implemented, initially in Department 561 are:
1.	Maintain Departmental Housekeeping on all shifts.
170
2.	Keep machines and equipment free from chip build up on a daily basis.
3.	Changing coolant at regular intervals.
4.	Dedicate a Skilled Trades Pipefitter to Department 561 (M-1 Zone).
5.	Schedule a four (4) hour maintenance window every two (2) weeks. In the event a scheduled maintenance 'window is missed It will be rescheduled as soon as practically possible.
6.	Heighten awareness through employee meetings across all shifts conducted by the UAW/DDC Health and Safety Team.
Additionally the parties are committed to a joint approach in the evaluation of requirements prior to the new installation and/or relocation of coolant dependant systems in the plant.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING MANUFACTURING SERVICES INCIDENTAL WORK
During these negotiations the parties discussed the need for the Company to be competitive in all aspects of its operations. Among the issues discussed were the existing skilled trades and maintenance classification structure, work rules, and practices which originated at a time when competition was less threatening, in an effort to ensure our long term job security and enhance our competitiveness, the parties agree that Skilled Trades and Service employees will perform incidental work.
Incidental work is defined by the complexity and duration of the task. If a task in question does not require the skill and training of a primary craft; compromise the safety of individual(s), and can be performed in a short period of time then and only then will the work in question be deemed incidental work.
If either of these parties feel that abuses of the spirit and intent of this agreement exists, they may request the issue be reviewed by appropriate parties from the International UAW Region 1A andfor Solidarity House, and the Senior Vice-President of Administration for DDC.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING DDC/UAW JOB SECURITY PROGRAM
During the 1998 negotiations, the parties reached an understanding on a comprehensive job security program. The cornerstone of this program is the major commitment by the leadership of the Corporation and the UAW to jointly improve operational effective* ness by which to become the dominant force in the diesel engine market. As evidenced by our success since the inception of Detroit Diesel Corporation in 1988, the parties recognize that we are striving toward competitive superiority in the marketplace through the dedicated efforts of all employees. The extent to which we continue in this direction is directly dependent on building engines of the highest quality while remaining competitively priced in world markets. With this objective in mind the parties have agreed for the life of this agreement to provide Detroit Diesel employees with protection against layoffs for virtually every reason other than volume related market conditions and Acts of God.
I.	Employees with two (2) or more years of Seniority are guaranteed employment security against layoffs. No eligible employees will be laid off unless it is tor one of the specified reasons below;
a.	Volume related declines
b.	Sale of business
c.	Cessation of major operation due to market preference
d.	Acts of God or other such reasons beyond the control of the Corporation
e.	Strikes or work stoppages by major suppliers, that impact operations
173
f,	The layoff of an employee recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary
g.	Plant rearrangement/causing temporary reduction in force
In the event an employee is laid off for one of the above reasons, if otherwise eligible, such employee will be covered by the appropriate DDC-UAW Supplemental Agreement, l.e. Supplemental Unemployment Benefits.
In recognition of the fact that true long term job security can only result from cooperative efforts to improve operational effectiveness, DDC and the UAW agree to the following:
a.	The establishment of a joint Operational Effectiveness which will be empowered through the Corporation and the international Union to make any and all changes to the Redford Manufacturing Systems work rules, practices, processes and conditions, that in the end increase the effectiveness of the system. The only requirement in effectuating the intent of this paragraph is mutual agreement by the Company and Union,
b.	For a period commencing with the effective date of this Agreement and for the life of the current agreement, no eligible employee will be laid off for any event other than those described above.
c.	An eligible employee whose regular job is impacted by an event not covered by Paragraph I above, will be placed in accordance with the DDC-UAW Seniority Agreement.
174
V
d.	If an eligible employee impacted by events described in Paragraph II above, would other wise be laid off, such employee would be protected by the applicable provisions of the Job Security Program. Such employee would be transferred to the Bank classification, while retaining the rate of pay (and relative progression position) of the job classification last held prior to placement in the Bank classification. Shift premium will be paid in accordance with Master ’Agreement provisions. Supplemental Unemployment Benefit credits will not accrue while an employee is assigned to the Bank,
e.	Employees assigned to the Bank will be given job assignments that may include but not be limited to: traditional work such as backfilling for absentees or other regular employees that have training requirements. Employees assigned to the Bank will constitute a separate EOT group (by shift), shift preference group, and seniority division. Consequently the Transfer Agreement would not apply to employees assigned to the Bank. If an employee is in the Bank and there is a job opening in his previously held classification and he is eligible to come out of the Bank this job will not be posted. The eligible Bank employee will then be placed In the opening.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SOURCING
During these negotiations the parties held discussions on the effect of sourcing and the job security of employees. It was mutually agreed that in order to continue as a viable and growing business entity, a very high level of cooperation and understanding must exist between the Corporation and the Union. The parties therefore com' mit to improving the operation and providing job security to the workforce while focusing on our primacy objective of building the highest quality, competitively-priced diesel engines.
To assist in accomplishing these goals the parties have agreed to form a team whose primary function will be to evaluate sourcing issues that directly impact bargaining unit headcount. Sourcing actions at our location have historically included the basic criteria of quality, timing, cost, equipment and legally mandated requirements. Decisions made by the team will also meet these requirements. The additional criteria to be considered must now also include financial viability of the company and job security of employees.
Sourcing can take the form of bringing work into the bargaining unit which requires additional headcount as jobs are added to the workforce or it can also mean sending work out of the facility resulting in less jobs being in the bargaining unit. In the event sourcing work affects represented employees where jobs are added or eliminated, such employees will be placed according to the Seniority Agreement. If the sourcing event would otherwise cause an active employee to be laid off, such employee will be protected by applicable provisions of the Job Security program.
tn the case of potential loss of work which affects bargaining unit headcount the team, where practicable, will be given pertinent information as early as possible, prior to the decision to send work out. Information provided will include description of the work, reason for sending it out, impact on the workforce, and financial calculations.
190
The team will evaluate the data within thirty (30) days and make recommendations to the Corporation and the Union that the work could be competitively completed in house as a result of work rule or operational changes or deviation from local practices, etc. If such changes make it feasible for the Corporation to continue with performing the work in house without being economically disadvantaged, the Union will be apprised of the decision not to send the work out and given appropriate time to implement the proposals. It is understood by the parties that this process cannot adversely affect the responsiveness of the operation. If difficulties of this nature arise, discussions will be held to address these concerns.
Discussions regarding bargaining unit type work that is not currently in the bargaining unit was also held between the parties. Accordingly, the parties agree that work of this nature, specifically identified by Ihe Union, can be brought to the team for discussion. Pertinent information to be reviewed by the team will include work description, workforce impact ano financial data, if it is established through these discussions that the work can be performed competitively in house (including work rule, operational or local practice changes) the parties can mutually agree to bring such work into the bargaining unit and formulate the necessary timetables and other pertinent details necessary to accomplish this. It is also understood that these decisions will be periodically reviewed to assure that projected cost savings targets are tn fact being met.
The parties also discussed the need for DDC to maintain the flexibility to react to emergency situations, such as machine breakdown, interruption of product flow because of vendor problems, power failure, etc. and that such issues are excluded from protest under Article (2.6)(B) of the Master Agreement.
191
11 at the conclusion of a sourcing discussion, the parties cannot agree to mutually resolve the issue, the Union may exercise its option to utilize the provisions of Article (2.6)(B).

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING VENDOR REVIEW AGREEMENT
The parties have agreed during the current set of negotiations to implement a joint DDC-UAW Vendor Review process. The goal of this program is to identify reliable, high quality suppliers of components used directly in the manufacture of DDC heavy-duty diesel engines. If such suppliers are competitive with the existing suppliers based on the decision criteria specified below, they will be given a chance to bid for the component in question at the earliest opportunity the existing supplier contract permits.
Vendor Review Process
1.	Management shall submit to the Union as soon as practical after the effective date of this agreement, a listing of its manufacturing vendors and the components they supply to DDC. After reviewing this information, the Union shall submit to Management a list of suppliers who in the UAW’s opinion are both reliable and high quality and currently manufacture the same type of components currently sourced from DDC suppliers.
2.	For specific components identified by the UAW, the parties will jointly evaluate which vendors, based on cost competitiveness, quality, long-term financial stability, delivery reliability, tooling investment, engineering capability, and any other pertinent cost factors, i.e. monetary penalties for breaking contract early, could be potential suppliers of product to DDC.
3.	Once identified, these suppliers will be given an opportunity to participate in future quotation of components to be purchased.
4.	When new components that are used in the manufacturing
200
5.
6.
7.
process are to be purchased from outside vendors, the Union will be notified through attendance at the regularly scheduled Production Readiness meetings so that they may participate fully at the earliest stage in the subsequent vendor selection process.
For those specific components identified in Paragraphs two (2) and four (4) above, the parties will jointly discuss all factors involved in the vendor selection in order to arrive at a mutually satisfactory decision by which to determine the most competitive supplier, If disagreements in the selection process result, the parties will review the decision in an attempt to resolve the matter.
If the parties cannot mutually agree as described in five (5) above, the Union may protest Management's decision within thirty rnn1* daws a; described <n Article } cf the Master Agreement.
It is understood that in certain circumstances experimental work, pre-production work, technology or timing may require the selection of vendors without formal utilization of a bid process. Both parties recognize the potential of these circumstances and will work together to minimize their occurrence and attempt to identify mutually acceptable vendors who might be considered as potential suppliers in such situations. It is also understood that this will be excluded from protest under Article (2.6)(B) of the Master Agreement.
201
The parties will periodically review the progress being made in more fully utilizing reliable, high quality suppliers in the DDC manufacturing process to insure that the process continues to be responsive to the competitive needs of DDC’s business.

SUBJECT:	Fraud
Genliemen:
Since the beginning of Detroit Diesel Corporation, we have attempted to create the type of working atmosphere that we have ail desired. An atmosphere that leads to mutual respect, team play and increased cooperation. However, throughout this time, a smalt percentage of employees have continued to violate the rules of fair play and honesty. These violations include situations of employees receiving pay for period of time spent oft company property while on the dock as well as assisting tn this activity by ringing the card of another employee.
Situations such as these constitute fraud and cannot be condoned or tolerated by Detroit Diesel Corporation. The last such instance occurred in August 1990 and has caused us to reiterate our position that this type of fraudulent behavior is a dischargeable offense, and that anyone found guilty of committing fraud will be discharged.
We ask for your cooperation in resolving this continuing problem to ensure the future success of our company.
Sincerely,
R F. Walters

Dear Paul:
I'm writing in response to your letter of September 9, 1990 to the Shop Committee and the type of atmosphere we are trying to create at ODC. First let me commend ODC on the job they have done to create that atmosphere. We feel the hourly workforce is being treated with mutual respect and increased cooperation. We do not feel it is too much to ask that we, ths hourly workforce, return that respect with honesty and fair play.
We the union recognize that employees who are guilty of fraud are subject to discharge. We, further, will make every attempt to inform our membership of the seriousness of this type of conduct and its impact on the company.
Thank You,
Jim Brown

SUBJECT: Reinstatement of Grievances
Gentlemen:
During the current negotiations, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, tairand final resolution of employee grievances.The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose lor which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or Union representative Involved, the Regional Director of the International Union may inform the Company’s Senior Vice President Administration in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the Grievance Procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.

It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees Involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Company in the Grievance Procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, State, or municipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and Its members, the employee or employees involved and the Company and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be consrruea as modifying in any way eiiiiwriria itgi'iis or obligations of the parties under the terms of the Master Agreement, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any decision by the Impartial Umpire or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter and the parties obligations to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
It is agreed that none ol the above provisions will be applicable to any case settled prior to January 1, 1988.

SUBJECT: Sub-Contracting Block Overtime
Gentlemen:
During the current negotiations the parlies discussed the use of outside contractors on site as it relates to associated overtime for DDC Skilled Tradespersons. A summary of the discussion follows:	■
•	6,14 Notice
The Parties agree that notices for sub-contracting are, in many cases, on short notice and are not detailed enough to properly identify scope of job. The parties agree to improve lead time (notice) where possible and will use the current form to provide information.
•	Associated Overtime
Associated overtime will apply when an outside contractor is utilized onsite to perform work historically performed by DDC maintenance and construction skilled trades.
Associated overtime is established as six (6) ten hour days (Monday through Saturday) for all journeypersons in trades affected on all shifts when a contractor is on-site during that week performing maintenance and construction work. Any additional claims for associated overtime for another trade after a 6.14 meeting has been held and a job has been started will be limited to a maximum of the actual extent of work performed (i.e. one person, one day) on a person for person, day to day match.

■ Incidental Work
Outside contractors will be allowed to perform tasks that are incidental to the scope of work of the entire contract on a seven day basis. This incidental work will appear on 6.14 notice forms and agreed to by the parties. This does not compromise the contractor's ability to perform tasks incidental to the job that were unforeseen at the start of the contract.
Contested Incidental work may be grievanced by the Union but claims would be limited to the actual extent of work performed on a person for person, day to day match.
•	Historical Patterns
If the maintenance and construction work performed on-site by an outside contractor does not have a historical pattern of being performed by DDC maintenance and construction trades, there will be no claim for associated overtime for such work by DDC skilled trades.
•	Purchase Complete Items
Agreement between the parties that items purchased complete outside of the plant (custom or shelf) will not fall under subcontracting language. These items will properly be viewed as sourcing decisions, subject to established sourcing guidelines (l.e. make vs. buy).

Your safety and the safety of everyone in this plant is vitally important.

In the final analysis, the safeness of these physical things that are used by DDC employees largely depend on how they are used. It is you, therefore, who are ultimately responsible for your own safety.
Remember, if any condition should arise which might be potentially hazardous you are to report this to your supervisor. If the condition is one for which you have a good solution, you are encouraged to process your idea through the “Suggestion Program"

259
36.	Moving Engines
When moving engines from one location to another (other than straightening engines, etc.) with the use of a fork lift truck, no more than one engine will be moved at a time. Regarding the transportation of engine blocks within the plant, this issue has been resolved on the basis that dividers with raised plywood edges are no longer being purchased for this purpose.

Air sampling reports of the Waste Treatment facility will be provided to the Union on a quarterly basis. On an annual basis employees permanently assigned to the Waste Treatment facility may report to the plant Medical department and request medical examinations.
Medical Service
The hours of operation of the Medical Department are necessarily based upon the number of employees assigned to a particular shift. When not in operation medical assistance is available through the Plant Security Department, in addition, area hospitals are utilized for emergency medical treatment on a twenty-four (24) hour per day basis. Currently, the Medical Department is open sixteen (16) hours per day Monday through Friday excluding holidays. On weekends the Medical Department is open when 250 or more employees per shift are scheduled to work.

Other examples would be project type work in a precarious location on the roof, for instance close to the edge of the roof; or cases in “pit" type locations with moving equipment which cannot be locked out. Furthermore, in cases where employees are assigned to work in isolated areas by themselves, they will be checked on a regular and continuous basis approximately every hour, when requested by the employee, ft is also recognized that if an employee is of the opinion that his particular assignment involves a hazardous element which may justify the assignment of another
262
	employee from a safety standpoint, they should raise the matter with their supervisor and they also have recourse to their ccmmitteeperson and/or the Union's Health and Safety Representative. In the event an employee classified Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Control and Maintenance is required to complete a regular tour on the roof in periods of darkness, a two (2) way radio will be available for the employee's use upon request of the supervisor in charge.

SKILLED TRADES SETTLEMENTS
1.	Employee Tools and Tool Boxes
In those cases where employees are required by Management to provide their own tools, Management will replace or repair such tools, turned in provided they are damaged or broken doing work for Detroit Diesel Corporation and there is no negligence on the part of the employee, tn the case of tools replaced under this Demand Settlement they become the personal property of the employee and they will not be marked with any company identification.
In the case of employees going on sick leave or other extended periods of absence, or where other circumstances would justify it, upon request of the employee the proper steps will be taken to effectively safeguard the employee’s tool box and tools during this abscnos (fof instance sealing the tool box and storing it in a safe place).
Furthermore, Management will provide roller type tool boxes to those skilled trades employees upon obtaining seniority, where it is required in the performance of their job. Management will continue to provide these type devices to skilled trades seniority employees, consistent with the existing provisions of this Demand Settlement,
2.	Leaders - Temporary
In situations where skilled trades leaders are absent or on a Leave of Absence for less than one ft) week with advance notice (i.e. training, vacation, etc.) a working leader will be temporarily established and paid accordingly for the duration of the absence.
281
3.
Lockers
Management will provide maintenance skilled trades employees who so desire two lockers (side by side) in the regular employee locker room. It is understood that this may require locker relocation of other employees.
4.	Related and/or Specialized Training
In the event technological changes affect job assignments in the plant, special training and instructions are afforded those employees assigned to that specific work whenever possible. When additional outside training is required, employees are selected on the basis of training needed to complete job assignments directly affecting the employee’s area of responsibility. In those cases where certain skilled trades employees may be sent to outside schools for specialized training, other skilled trades employees will be assigned to work with these employees in order to gain knowledge of specialized training as may be required in their job assignments. Employees receiving specialized outside training wit! be paid all lost wages in excess of eight (8) hours a day provided their respective EOT is scheduled full. In cases where their respective EOT is working partial the employee will not be charged for any overtime that would have been available provided it was not worked. Management is agreeable to continue this general policy of providing additional training where necessary for employees to progress with technological advancements, insofar as which employees will be chosen to receive specialized training, seniority will be the basis of selecting who will attend from skilled trades employees within a defined work area (i.e. department, zone).
Management is agreeable to train employees, time permitting, who express a genuine interest in learning to operate
282
new equipment (ie. gear cutting), which is required within the scope of their job assignments.
