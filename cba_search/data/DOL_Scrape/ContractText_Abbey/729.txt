The Company and the Union also recognize the moral principles involved in the area of civil rights and have affirmed their commitment not to discriminate with respect to bargaining unit jobs because of race, religion, color, age, sex, national origin, disability and marital status and to administer this Agreement in accordance with applicable fair employment practices, laws and regulations.
4.2	The Company and the Union recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (i) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use, where applicable, the grievance and arbitration procedures as the exclusive contractual method for the prompt resolution of all such complaints, (ii) to determine the cause of such complaints in order to reduce the probability of such claims arising or recurring, and (iii) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forms simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and, hence, non-productive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange
15
information, expertise and advice. The Union agrees that it wilt discourage its members from bypassing the grievance and arbitration procedure with respect to any claim or complaint against the Company which may be made the subject of a grievance under the Agreement.

42
7.9.2
7.9.3
union appeals procedure under the Constitution of the International Union, U.A.W.
In the event of a final decision by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction that the resolution of any complaint or grievance resulted from, or was otherwise due to, a violation by the Union of its responsibility under the duty of fair representation, or in the event of a final decision to that effect by any internal Union appeals tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the Company, upon written request at that time, agrees that it will reopen and further process any such complaint or grievance in accordance with the grievance-arbitration procedure. However, in no event shall the Company be responsible or held liable for any damages or costs relating or pertaining to the period between the initial complaint resolution or grievance resolution and the date on which the complaint or grievance is reopened for further processing.
If the above right to reinstate grievances is abused by any Local, the Company shall have the right to appeal such abuse to the respective Regional Director. A meeting will then be convened with representatives from the Company and the Regional Director or the Director's designee in a good faith effort to resolve and correct such problem.

48
reduce work load build-ups; to provide special skills where full-time employment is unavailable or where there is an insufficient need for such skills on a full-time basis; and to provide for short-term peaks in the daily work load. Concerns arising regarding the utilization of part-time employees shall be the subject of discussions between the Company, the Union and the employing department.

(c)	Additionally, a • full-time employee with seniority who is being laid-off and who is unable to displace a less senior full-time employee may displace a regular part-time employee with less seniority in the same displacement sequence as that set forth in the Seniority Article with respect to other full-time employees.

Employees reduced in grade by a reduction of workforce are eligible in order of their seniority for recall to any equal or lower level in the Base from which they were reduced for which they are qualified for a period commensurate with their seniority at the . time of reduction of workforce for up to four (4) years. It is not the intent of the Company to provide formal training for reduced employees when trained employees are eligible for recall. This does not preclude the employee from applying for higher level posted positions. An employee who refuses a recall to a job within two (2) salary grades of the employee's salary grade at
58
8.9.2
8.9.3
the time affected by a reduction shall be deemed to have waived recall rights. The employee has the option to decline recall to a job which is not within two (2) salary grades. The employee's acceptance of any position that is not within two (2) salary grades completes the recall process. This does not preclude the employee's right to recall to any position within the employee's original base seniority unit and within the salary grade from which the employee was initially laid off, as long as the employee has the ability to do the work.
Recall from Layoff
Recall rights for an employee on layoff shall continue equal to the amount of seniority a bargaining unit employee has, not to exceed four (4) years.

This does not preclude the employee's right to recall to any position within the employee's original base seniority unit and within the salary grade from which the employee was initially laid off, as long as the employee has the ability to perform the work.
Recall Disputes
(a)	In the event a placement involving a reduction and/or recall is disputed by the Union, it will be discussed with the Employee
59
8.10
8.10.1
8.10.2

(b)	The Company and the Union recognize the aforementioned Reduction and Recall provisions may not adequately address all Union and Company employee/operational concerns. Consequently, the Company and the Union agree it is mutually beneficial to periodically review these provisions in order to resolve identified concerns.

10.5.4	During the fourteen (14) day period, the Union may request, in writing, a review of any new or modified job classification for the purpose of assessing reasonableness of the Company's action. A review meeting will be convened by the parties to address the Union's concern.
10.5.5	Should the Company eliminate a Job Title or Code no longer in use, Employee Relations will notify the four Local Presidents of the Job Title and Code being eliminated, with rationale. If the Union requests further review, Employee Relations will convene a Job Classification Review Meeting. Should agreement not be reached, a grievance may be filed at Step 3 of the grievance procedure, in accordance with Section 10.6.
10.5.6	The Union may through its Job Classification Representative request, in writing, a review of any new or modified bargaining unitfrion-bargaining unit job classification for the purpose of insuring that all bargaining unit work is property classified in a Union represented job.

JOB CLASSIFICATION GRJEVANCE/ARBJTRATION
If the Union still disagrees with a new or modified job classification established by the Company (10.5.3) or with the Company's response to a Union-requested job review (10.5.6), the Union may within ten (10) days of the Job Classification Committee meeting, file a grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure. If the grievance is processed to arbitration, however, the following provisions apply.
Job Classification Arbitration
In the event of an arbitration proceeding involving a new or modified job classification, the sole issue before the arbitrator shall be the reasonableness of the salary grade, job description and/or job specifications determined by the Company. The arbitrator shall have no authority to establish a salary grade, job description and/or job specifications different from those established by the Company.
In the event an arbitrator decides that the Company's determination with respect to the salary grade, job description and/or job specifications for a new or modified job classification is unreasonable, and in the event the Company and the Union are unable to satisfactorily settle a dispute within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Union may authorize a general bargaining unit strike with respect to such dispute and commence the strike seven (7) days following notification, in writing, to the Company of such authorization. Alternatively, and with respect to a salary grade determined by the arbitrator to be unreasonably low, the Union may accept a five percent (5%) promotional increase or an increase
79
to the minimum of the next higher salary grade than that established by the Company, whichever is greater, on behalf of employees covered by the grievance. This does not preclude the Union from holding the dispute for future contract negotiations
10.7 RATE OF PAY FOR CHANGED JOBS
If an existing job classification is upgraded in salary grade, the incumbent employee(s), if he or she has the ability to do the work, shall be retained in the job and be granted a five percent (5%) promotional increase, but not to exceed the maximum of the range. If there is a disagreement regarding the determination that the incumbent does not have the ability to do the work, the Union may file a grievance at the third step. If an existing job classification is downgraded in salary grade, the rate of pay of the incumbent employee(s) at the time of such action shall not be reduced, unless in excess of the newly established maximum. Additionally, such downgraded employee(s) will be eligible for recall in accordance with Article 8.

CHALLENGE PROCESS
Employee Challenge: If an employee has a problem concerning the reasonableness of a particular production or quality standard, the
85
11.8.2
employee may initiate a complaint through the normal grievance procedure as described in Article 7. The Union may call in the respective Union Time Study Representative at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.
Union Challenges
(a)	Within thirty (30) calendar days following the implementation of a new standard or a change in the elements comprising a job measured by a standard, the Local President may determine that further investigation is necessary, and shall notify the appropriate Employee Relations Representative to arrange a session with the Union Time Study Representative at a mutually acceptable time during normal working hours. After such request, the Union Time Study Representative will be afforded reasonable access to the work area(s) accompanied by the appropriate Company representative for the purpose of reviewing production/quality standard(s) issues up to and including actual time study of disputed production operations. Any such recheck will include the use of a continuous stop watch reading method. The Union Time Study Representative shall arrange with his/her immediate supervisor before engaging in such activities during normal working hours and shall notify the appropriate management of his/her presence in the area in a manner prescribed by the Company. In the event the aforementioned review by the parties confirms that a problem exists, any related discipline will be reviewed on a case by case basis.
86
(b)	In those situations where the parties are unable to resolve the problem, the Union may file a Step 3 grievance within ten (10) calendar days following the expiration of the thirty (30) days from the implementation date, challenging the reasonableness of the standard. The Union may request any such information relative to the new or modified production/quality standard(s) or the change in the elements comprising the job measured by the standard(s) as will enable the Union to adequately perform its designated representation function.
(c)	In the event such a grievance is not satisfactorily resolved following progression through the normal grievance procedure, the Union's review of such information and/or joint time study of the production standard(s) in question, the Union may appeal the same to arbitration. The sole issue before the arbitrator shall be whether the production/quality standard is reasonable. The arbitrator shall have no authority to establish a standard different from that established by the Company.
I ’
(d)	In the event an arbitrator decides that the production/quality standard is unreasonable, and in the event the Company and the Union are unable to satisfactorily resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days thereafter, the Union may authorize a general bargaining unit strike with respect to that dispute and commence the strike seven (7) days following notification, in writing, to the Company of such authorization.
87
11.9	COACHING AND DEVELOPMENT
The Coaching & Development Process (See Appendix G) details a proactive approach to working with employees to prevent or minimize performance problems. This process is intended to be used when observable or measurable performance fluctuations occur, and to aid in the full and effective development of all employees. (Reference Letter of Understanding #11.2, RE: Coaching/Development)
11.10	DISCIPLINE
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an employee receives discipline for failing to meet an existing production/quality standard, and if the Steward/Committee Person/Bargaining Committee Zone Representative/Chairperson and line management are unable to resolve the discipline issue, a grievance may be filed by the employee at Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure.

ARTICLE 12 HOURS OF WORK
12.1	PAY PERIOD
The normal payroll period shall consist of fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days beginning at 12:01 a.m. on a designated Saturday and ending at midnight on the second Friday thereafter. The starting time of a shift shall determine the payroll period within which the hours worked that shift fall.
12.2	WORKWEEK
The normal work week shall consist of five (5) days of 7.75 hours each scheduled between 12:01 a.m. each Monday and midnight the following Sunday. This shall not preclude the continuation of current normal work week scheduling. Future variations will be discussed in advance by the Company and the Union. The starting time of a shift shall determine the work week within which the hours worked that shift fall.
12.3	SHIFT PREMIUM
12.3.1	Employees whose shift is regularly scheduled to
commence work between 12:01 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. shall be paid a premium of ten percent (10%) of the employee's base pay for all such hours worked.
12.3.2	Employees whose shift is regularly scheduled to commence work between 4:00 p.m. and 12:00 a.m. midnight shall be paid a shift premium of six percent (6%) of the employee's base pay for all such hours worked. Employees whose regular shift ends between 6:00 p.m. and 12:01 a.m. shall

be paid the six percent (6%) premium for those hours worked beyond 6:00 p.m.
LUNCH AND BREAK PERIODS
Employees, if scheduled to work a regularly scheduled shift (7-3/4 hours), shall receive a separate, unpaid thirty (30) minute lunch or dinner break, as the case may be, and one (1) paid fifteen (15) minute break, in 1st half of their shift and one (1) paid break in the 2nd half of their shift. Current travel time policies (five minutes for each relief break and lunch period) shall be continued for Local 2500. Employees in those facilities represented by Locals 1781, 2145 and 2256 shall receive a forty-five (45) minute, unpaid lunch/dinner period each working day. Also, they shall receive a twenty (20) minute paid break in the first half of their scheduled shift and a twenty (20) minute paid break in the second half of their scheduled shift. (Reference Letter of Understanding 12.2 Re: Morning Breaks)
OVERTIME PAY
Daily and Weekly Overtime
Employees shall be paid time and one-half (1-1/2) their hourly rate for all authorized time worked (in units of not less than 15 minutes) beyond 7.75 hours a day. Employees shall receive time and one-half (1-1/2) their base hourly rate for all authorized time worked on Saturdays.

12.5.3
12.5.4
12.5.5

hourly rate for all authorized time worked that holiday. Employees required to work one (1) or more designated Christmas - New Year's holidays may in lieu of holiday pay elect an equal number of scheduled days off with pay.
Sunday Pay
Employees required to work on a Sunday shall be paid double their base hourly rate for all authorized time worked that day.

INCLEMENT WEATHER
It is to be understood by all employees that BCBSM is committed to providing uninterrupted services to our customers, providers and subscribers. In keeping with our commitment, business activities are rarely suspended. Therefore, it is expected that in the absence of an official suspension of operations, all employees are expected to report for work.
In those instances of severe weather conditions (inclement weather) where there has been no suspension of operations and after a good faith effort the employee has determined that he/she is unable to report for work, he/she may utilize either personal time, vacation time, or unpaid time without an occurrence.
OVERTIME VOLUNTARY/MANDATORY
Voluntary
(a)	The Company understands the Union's concern about the solicitation of non-department volunteers for overtime needs. In that regard, prior to scheduling mandatory overtime, the Company will solicit volunteers from the Base Seniority Unit, as well as consider individuals outside these departments for voluntary overtime. Every effort will be made to schedule overtime as much in advance as possible. (Reference Letter of Understanding 12.3, Re: Overtime for Non-Departmental Volunteers)
(b)	Each department shall maintain a Voluntary Overtime Registration Log. On this log the Company will identify the job classification(s),
94
section, department and office/factlity where the work exists as well as the hours available and the number of hours required. Employees in that department may volunteer to work scheduled overtime, if any, during the following pay period. This log will be published by Tuesday (a.m.) before the end of the pay period in the requesting department and simultaneously in the departments within the Base Seniority Unit.
(c)	The Voluntary Overtime Registration Log will be centrally posted within each department. In the event there are more volunteers than - work available, hours shall be distributed first to most senior qualified within the section until all sectional employees are used then Department employees will be assigned based on the most senior qualified.
(d)	Non-department volunteers from the Base Seniority Unit or from elsewhere within the Area Seniority Unit, may be considered for voluntary overtime in order to alleviate or reduce the need for prolonged mandatory overtime. For such employees it is the employee's responsibility to advise the affected department management of the employee’s availability for overtime by submitting an Overtime Opportunity Request. The request form will remain active for 90 days. Department management may reject unqualified volunteers. Scheduling overtime during a defined pay period shall be assigned first to those qualified volunteers in the affected classification(s), section and department. For the purpose of this provision, "qualified" pertains to an employee
95
	who is immediately capable of performing the work. (e)	The Company may offer voluntary overtime to qualified employees outside the classification(s) and department provided all employees within the affected classification(s), section and department have had the opportunity to accept or refuse the overtime offer and provided the employee outside the department or classification is immediately capable to perform the work. Selection of volunteers from outside the affected department will be based on seniority as reported on the Overtime Opportunity Request. (f)	Overtime hours will first be offered by department to available permanent full-time employees prior to part-timeftemporary employees being offered any additional hours over their regularly scheduled hours.
12.8.2	Mandatory (a) The Company reserves the right to call mandatory overtime as required. Such mandatory overtime shall be assigned on Thursday (a.m.) before the end of the pay period for overtime commencing for the following pay period. In the event there are insufficient qualified volunteers to meet sectional overtime requirements, qualified sectional employees, by classification, will first be assigned overtime up to the maximum. Should there be an insufficient number of employees within the section to meet the mandatory overtime requirements,
96
all other qualified departmental employees within the classification will be assigned mandatory overtime. Mandatory overtime will first be assigned to the least senior qualified up to the maximum specified in tine contract.
(b)	No employee shall be mandated to work more than twenty-four (24) hours of scheduled overtime in any pay period; nor shall an employee be required to work more than one (1) Sunday per month or two (2) consecutive Saturdays provided the employee worked the employee's scheduled hours during the week of an entitled Saturday or Sunday off, and if the employee notifies his/her Supervisor in writing of their intent not to work that Saturday or Sunday at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance. Employees new to a job will not be mandated to work overtime while in formal classroom training. Seven day work week operation employees, however, shall not be required to work more than two (2) consecutive Saturdays and/or Sundays in a month. In addition, employees working the last Saturday and/or Sunday in a particular month will not be scheduled for the first Saturday or Sunday in the succeeding month. Having volunteered or been scheduled for mandatory overtime, an employee shall be required to work the scheduled number of hours. In all cases, the employee's primary responsibility is for overtime work in his/her section and department.
(c)	No employee shall be mandated to work a Saturday following a Friday holiday except when production is required to meet the
97
customer expectations or standards. In the event of exceptions, the Company will advise the Union forty-eight (48) hours in advance of the holiday and provide pertinent information justifying its need to schedule the Saturday.
(d)	Further, the Company recognizes the employee's need for flexibility in working overtime while balancing personal life and job requirements. Normally, therefore, the Company will provide the employee the option to fulfill mandatory overtime requirements through the week. This language is not to be interpreted to prevent an employee's use of flextime schedule in areas where available. The parties also recognize, however, that such options are not available in departments engaged in multi-shift and/or six (6) and seven (7) day operations.
(e)	Management will prorate overtime hours when an employee has been absent due to illness, vacation, personal time or union business, etc., during the notification process or at any time during the week in which overtime is required. (Reference Letter of Understanding 12.1 Re: Overtime Exemption for Educational Leave) The proration will be calculated as follows:
♦	Number of hours divided by number of normal work days equals average hour/day.
♦	Average hour/day multiplied by number of days employee available equals required hours.
98
12.8.3 The Company and the Union understand the need to provide timely service to Subscribers/Providers and agree to cooperate in whatever way possible to accomplish this mutual goal. However, it is not the Company's intent that employees be required to work maximum hours of overtime for prolonged periods of time. Where the Union deems mandatory overtime is excessive over a prolonged and continuous period, the appropriate UAW International Servicing Representative may request the Regional Director - Human Resources to review the conditions which warrant such overtime.
12.9 WORK SCHEDULES
Working hours, rest periods and lunch periods are scheduled according to departmental and Company operational need. There are three (3) types of’ work schedules: (Reference Letter of .	Understanding #12.4 RE: Telecommuting)
12.9.1	Standard Hours
Is a schedule of predetermined start time for all employees in a work unit.
12.9.2	Staggered Hours
Schedule in which segments of a work unit begin the work day at different but prearranged times. Employees affected by this schedule may have their start and quit time changed on a weekly or monthly basis and must get prior approval by management in order for them to change their schedule.
99
12.9.3	Flextime
(a)	Schedule which indudes flexible start and quit times with basic core hours which allows employees to determine for themselves, on a daily basis without advance notice, when they will work the necessary 7.75 hours required.
(b)	The Company is not opposed to continuing or implementing flexible work schedules in those departments where operational needs permit.
(c)	For those departments currently using a flexible schedule, Flextime scheduling shall be determined by a vote of the employees in that department. Where only a section of a department has flexible hours, the schedule shall be determined by employees in that section. Once the department or section chooses one of the following flextime models:
♦	7:00 a.m. - 8:30 a.m.
♦	7:30 a.m. - 9:00 a.m.
it shall continue subject to operational requirements.
(d)	The Union may from time to time request and discuss with the Company implementing Flextime, as currently described in the Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to other bargaining unit employees.
(e)	In regard to afternoon breaks, and subject to operational requirements, it is understood that due to normal turnover, affected employees may request the opportunity annually to express their preference whether
100
to retain or discontinue the afternoon break, thereby adjusting the quitting time accordingly.
(f)	The use of one of the flextime models does not preclude the Company from scheduling special hours in the department for a designated number of employees to assure adequate support coverage at either end of the shift.
(g)	Whenever a permanent change is deemed necessary, the Company shall notify the Local President and the affected employee(s) thirty (30) days in advance of implementation. In the event the Local President disputes the reason for change, a grievance may be filed at the third step of the grievance procedure.
12.9.4 FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES
Any work schedule not conforming to the traditional five (5) day, 7.75 hour definition, shall be considered a flexible work schedule.
12.10 ADDITIONAL SHIFT
When an additional shift is placed into operation, the Company and the Union will negotiate employee shift selection, shift premium, job bidding and layoff provisions.

13.1.1	PURPOSE OF CLASSIFICATIONS
The purpose of classifications are:
(a)	To distinguish between work assignments having different prime functions or basic elements; and
(b)	To distinguish between work assignments requiring different types or levels of skill, responsibility, or knowledge.
13.1.2	PURPOSE OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS
(a)	The purpose of the classification description for each classification is to describe the prime functions or basic elements, and where appropriate for identification purposes, the type or level of skill, responsibility, or knowledge required. All secondary or incidental duties, or duties which are the prime function of other classifications, which may be required in the performance of an employee’s job assignment, are not necessarily set forth in the classification description if they are not required for the identification of the prime function or type or level of skill, responsibility or knowledge required.
(b)	The Company will classify all employees in the proper classification, consistent with the duties and responsibilities of each individual

The Company shall have the continuing obligation and right to apply the proper classification to an employee based on assigned duties and responsibilities consistent with the classification description of her/his classification.
(c)	The Company will furnish to the Union new or changed material in the Job Classification Book.
SALARY GRADES AND PROGRESSION
Automatic Progressions - Automatic progression increases will be provided for all grades up to the Top of Automatic Progression established for each grade. An employee whose salary is below the Top of Automatic Progression for her/his grade, will receive a progression increase of 3% of base salary, which advances her/his salary to the top step of progression or into the merit range. Such automatic progression will be provided each employee after every twelve (12) months of seniority in the salary grade, unless otherwise affected by promotions, transfers, or downgrades, as further described in Section 13.3. For the purpose of computing twelve {12) month progression increases, credit will be earned only for those months in which an employee works ten (10) days in the month. Days worked will include regular vacation, holidays, leave of absence for union business for up to six (6) weeks and all days actually worked on their regular work week schedule.

If an illness which has been medically documented recurs within ten (10) calendar days of the employee's return to work date, it is considered a continuation of the same benefit period.

EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
24.1	PURPOSE
Both Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) and the UAW recognize that substance abuse problems, such as alcoholism and drug dependency, are illnesses that can be successfully treated; and that treatment of these and other personal problems (Marital, Family, Emotional, Financial, etc.) is in the best interest of the employee, Union and Company. It is further agreed that no discrimination will result when employees utilize the Employee Assistance Program (EAR) or similar professional assistance.
24.2	OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of the EAP are to provide an opportunity for effective assistance and short term treatment to those individuals in need; and to help the Union/Company deal more effectively with employees experiencing personal problems causing deteriorating job performance and absenteeism.
24.3	JOB PERFORMANCE
This program's concern with personal problems is strictly limited to their effect on the employee's performance on the job. The decision to accept involvement in the program is the personal responsibility of the employee. Persons participating in the program will be expected to meet existing job performance and attendance standards. Any exceptions to this requirement will
182
be by mutual agreement between the Union and Company.
24.4	CONFIDENTIALITY

COMMON INTERESTS
The Union and its members, and the Company, in the , spirit of labor-management cooperation, recognize that they have common economic, job security, work preservation and other employment-related improvement interests in the achievement by the Company of goals and objectives.
CHANGES AFFECTING EMPLOYEES
In the event that the goals and objectives of the Company necessitate that an employee or group of employees be subject to loss of their job by way of job classification consolidation, job classification elimination or obsolescence due to technological change, merger of operations, office closure, transfer of operations to a distant location, subcontracting or outsourcing, the Company will solicit Union participation in its decision making process by providing notice to the affected Local(s) sixty (60) days prior to position elimination or loss of existing bargaining unit work. Upon request, the Company shall provide the Union with the reasons for the proposed action and supporting documentation. The Company shall meet with the affected Local Unions to discuss alternatives. Any such decisions will not be made in an arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory manner, but rather will be determined by business necessities, with sincere consideration for the interests of employees, the Union, subscribers, providers and other customers. Changes resulting
186
25.3
25.3.1
25.3.2
from approved Joint Program/Business Process Improvement work redesign, will be handled in accordance with Letter Of Understanding #25.1.
JOB SECURITY COMMITTEE
In efforts to maximize job security and to minimize detrimental effects on the employees, the parties will establish a Job Security Committee to address such situations. The Job Security Committee will be comprised of four members of the Union and four members of the Company. The actual composition will be dependent upon the Local Unions affected, e.g., if all Locals are affected, then each Local will have one representative. The Job Security Committee shall convene as soon as possible upon knowledge of the planned occurrence, but in no event, later than forty-five (45) days prior to the occurrence, and at other times as mutually agreed to. In any event, no employee will be displaced without thirty (30) days notice, or as required by law. Upon request, the Company shall provide the Union with the reasons for the proposed action and supporting documentation.
The Committee will develop action steps so as to minimize adverse effects on the employee(s) which could include:
(a)	placement into open positions within the Area Seniority Unit;
(b)	special training programs to enable employees to qualify for other jobs;
(c)	a special separation plan with a severance allowance and waiver;
187
(d)	a voluntary layoff process with recall rights;
(e)	special transfer return rights;
(f)	special consideration for most senior employees with respect to more advantageous options.
25.3.3	The Job Security Committee will address employee hardships and resolve such to the degree possible. Such resolutions may require that the parties agree to mutually waive or hold in abeyance other provisions of this Master Agreement in the best interests of resolving the hardships. Such waivers could include and/or . affect the Post and Bid Process, the Request to Transfer Process, the Layoff Process and the like.
25.3.4	The parties further acknowledge that any such agreement might be subject to membership approval.
25.4	TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
25.4.1	When work performed by employees covered by
this Agreement is altered as a result of technological changes, it shall be the Company's policy to give employees the opportunity to progress with advanced technology. Where practicable, the Company will make available specialized training programs for qualified employees within the unit.
25.4.2	When situations in the department permit training, the Company agrees to include seniority as one of the criteria used in the selection process for such
.. training.
188
25.4.3
25.4.4
25.5
25.5.1
With the expansion or introduction of new technology, such as mechanical innovations having potential/projected impacts upon bargaining unit employees, work currently performed by bargaining unit members may be rendered obsolete or eliminated. In the event of such situations, the Company shall provide mutually beneficial training programs to affected members of the bargaining unit in order to improve their existing skills or to develop new skills. These new skills are intended to provide work opportunities as well as promotional opportunities to the bargaining unit employees so affected.
The Job Security Committee will explore the impact of technological changes on affected employees. They will be responsible for taking an inventory of the skills and aptitude of the affected employees as well as review their individual training needs and transferable skills. One of their responsibilities will be to make recommendations regarding the training needs, proposed training and implementation schedule and time frames, and placement of the affected employees. Finally, they will follow-up all placements and relay their findings as well as make any recommendations they deem appropriate.
SUBCONTRACTING
The Company and the Union during negotiations discussed the subject of subcontracting. Ordinarily, but without limitation, such outside assistance would be engaged where particular skills are involved, where specialized equipment not readily available at the Company is required or where for other reasons economies can be realized because special contractors can better
189
25.5.2
25.5.3
perform the work in question. Work may also be contracted out on occasions when the volume precludes the possibility of its completion within time limits by Company employees, or where necessary to temporarily cover lost time situations.
We believe the above to be a clear statement of the policy which the Company intends to follow with respect to subcontracting. It is impossible, of course, to enunciate the policy in more detail. Necessarily, questions may arise from time-to-time regarding work which is contracted to outside concerns and which may have a significant impact on employees and Company operations. On those occasions, the Company will notify the Union and afford the Union an opportunity to comment and will give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.
However, the Company must reserve the right to make the final determination as to whether work shall be done by outside contractors. In making that determination, however, the Company intends always to keep the interests of BCBSM personnel in mind.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
26.1	Role of Training: The parties recognize the critical role of training in creating a learning organization where continuous improvement and employee development are encouraged and supported. (Reference Letter of Understanding 26.2, Re: Training [Intent])
26.2	Definitions: Training is a set of learning activities designed to Increase an individual's job skills, job knowledge and job experiences, or facilitate change of an individual's behavior. It provides the employee the opportunity to learn the skills required to successfully perform the job and plays a part in a total approach to improving job performance. Training plays a critical role in not only the initial skill development for individual job performance but also provides the foundation for an individual's development toward future growth within the organization.
26.2	.1 Formal training at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan is defined as having multiple delivery strategies including, but not limited to, classroom training, structured On-the-Job Training (OJT), partnering with experienced/proficient employees, self-study, or a combination of these strategies. Performance activities and assessments shall be included in all training strategies delivered to measure trainee skill attainment and proficiency. Additionally, skills testing may be used as one of the means of determining proficiency and training needs.
193
26.3
26.4
26.5
Responsibilities: We believe that while training is one of several approaches to optimize job performance, it cannot solve problems due to deficiencies other than job skills and job knowledge. Further, that it must be reinforced by on-the-job application and coaching; that the organization is responsible • for providing the means for employees to develop their job skills and job knowledge and that the employees bring basic skills to the job and are responsible for their own competencies and careers.’ The parties recognize that the development of a skilled workforce is a shared responsibility between the organization and the individual employee.
Employee Development: Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan is committed ' to employee development. Employee development is defined as a process whereby a series of activities allow opportunities for the employees to grow both technically and professionally. Activities such as training, feedback, coaching and job placement opportunities create an environment conducive to employees moving toward their career potential. The organization will work with the employees by referring various internal and/or external developmental opportunities which could emphasize the enhancement of vocabulary, reading comprehension, , spelling, number operations and/or problem solving skills.
Expected Results: We believe that as a result of our efforts, training at BCBSM will be cost effective, timely, performance-based, based on individual training needs and realistic to the impacted work environment.

COACHING AND DEVELOPMENT
DEFINITION
The concept of coaching was formally introduced into the 1990 UAW contract negotiations, became a part of the new agreement, and demonstrated a renewed corporate commitment to this process.
The terms coaching/cfevelopment and counseling, although often used interchangeably, approach their common goal, performance improvement, from different perspectives which are encompassed in these definitions:
♦	Coaching/deveiopment is an ongoing process with an employee to evaluate and provide feedback regarding job performance expectations with the intent of optimizing their potential.
♦	Counseling is a planned review with an employee to discuss work performance deficiencies and necessary corrective actions which are utilized when an individual is failing to meet job expectations, and includes documentation of the problem and a plan for improvement of the employee's performance.
In the BCBSM work environment, and in the context of this document, these perspectives are being combined and henceforth are referred to as coaching and development.
Coaching and Development represents an additional effort at employee performance/recovery and shall be utilized prior to, in conjunction with, and throughout the formal discipline process.
It is anticipated that effective Coaching and Development will generally result in performance improvement for the benefit of BCBSM and the employee. It will also reflect in reduced
229
turnover replacement, as well as the training costs associated with performance related issues.
It is therefore the intent of BCBSM and the Union to assist all employees in avoiding, or correcting, work performance deficiencies through the application of Coaching and Development techniques. The process shall occur when a problem is identified and prior to disciplinary action. Coaching and Development is a continuous process to be utilized in an effort to improve employee performance. The following guidelines will assist both Management and the Union in applying this concept:
GUIDELINES
Supervisors should be proactive to help prevent employees from developing performance problems. Guidelines include but are not limited to the following:
♦	Routinely give employees feedback that defines both positive and negative performance.
♦	Positively reinforce desired performance.
♦	Regularly provide employees with current performance data (quality and quantity).
When a supervisor recognizes that an employee has a performance problem that has not been resolved through informal interaction, they shall:
♦	Initiate a Coaching and Development Profile.
♦	Arrange to discuss the issue in detail with the employee and notify the appropriate union representative via the C&D Profile.
♦	Devise a jointly agreed upon plan, with the employee, to resolve/correct the issue.
230
HOW TO BUILD AND PROMOTE THE COACHING AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
CLARIFY EXPECTA TIONS
Coaching and Development is always purposeful and directed at achieving specific performance expectations. The expectations for productive behavior are based upon open communication, mutual respect, fulfilling commitments, and participating in the achievement of sectional/departmental/corporate goals.
DEFINE SUPPORTING BEHAVIORS - Superusers and Enwiovees
Positive behaviors that will help meet performance expectations may include:
♦	Lead by example
♦	Take the initiative to make things better
♦	Request help when you need it
♦	Identify problems and offer solutions
♦	Be innovative, look for better ways of performing tasks
♦	Take responsibility for individual performance
♦	Focus on work, not other's personalities
ASSESS BEHAVIOR
Assess the employee's current behavior relative to the desired behavior. The employee may correct a problem just based on a restatement of expectations and positive behavior.
231
PROVIDE CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK
Discuss options, suggest corrective action and acknowledge positive aspects of performance.
♦	Be sure that your feedback is phrased in terms of observable, objective behavior
♦	Describe specifically what you have observed
♦	Give the employee an opportunity to respond
♦	Offer specific suggestions
ACRON PLAN AND COMMITMENT-Supervisor and Employee
Commitments should include completion of the Coaching and Development profile and a follow-up date, and assessment of suggested corrective action.
ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS
Clearly state what will happen should the action plan fail; identify available options.
REINFORCE
Summarize and express your support.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #1.2
RE: RECOGNITION

♦	Is new and the Company did not assign to bargaining unit classifications.
♦	Has been excluded historically from the bargaining unit.
To that end, the parties agree to meet and confer during the life of the Agreement to identify those classifications that belong in the bargaining unit. The parties further agree that all employees holding those classifications will be placed in the bargaining unit under the following terms:
♦	All classifications performing bargaining unit work which are no longer in the bargaining unit because of various technological or other significant changes will be returned to the bargaining unit.
♦	All new classifications performing bargaining unit work which are not in the bargaining unit will be included in the bargaining unit after a card check of the employees holding those classifications is conducted by a neutral third party demonstrating the Union’s majority status.

The parties further agree to establish a joint committee to examine the work outsourced by the Employer to determine the feasibility of returning that work in-house and including the classifications performing the work to the bargaining unit. (All classifications so identified will be included in the bargaining unit after a card check of employees holding those classifications is conducted by a neutral third party demonstrating the Union’s majority status.)

249
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #6.2
RE: UNION REPRESENTATION
During the 1993 negotiations, the parties attempted to negotiate, state-wide, a redefinition of the roles, duties and responsibilities of various union representatives.
The purpose of such discussions was to explore the feasibility and cost effectiveness of designating certain union representatives as full-time released personnel to handle the multiplicity of normal day-to-day issues and the variety of cooperative efforts recognized through the bargaining process.
Because of the unique needs of the four (4) UAW Locals, the parties were unsuccessful in negotiating a single state-wide application.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to defer this issue to the Director of Human Resources and UAW Local for post negotiation resolution. -
Pursuant thereof, a joint committee will be established within sixty (60) days following ratification for each Local for the purpose of exploring, discussing, resolving and implementing, by mutual agreement, the redefinition of union representation.
In the interim, the existing representation language will continue to be applied.
250
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #6.3
RE: REPRESENTATION

252
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #8.2
RE: 2145 AND 2255 SENIORITY APPLICATION
The Company and the Union recognize that multiple departments may exist in Base or Facility Seniority Units in the 2145 and 2256 Area Seniority Units.

258
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #8.6 RE: TRAINING/INTERIM ASSIGNMENTS
The parties recognize the importance of training employees to perform their assigned duties. When an employee is placed on an interim assignment, the company will provide adequate training to enable the employee to successfully perform such assignment.
259
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #8.8
RE: STAFFING OF NEWLY CREATED DEPARTMENTS
The Company and the Union recognize the need to maintain adequate staffing levels in production departments and to provide service to our customers. From time to time, new departments are established, in response to major product/program implementation efforts. Bargaining Unit personnel from existing operating units often bid on openings in newly created departments, causing staffing shortages in existing departments.
Both parties recognize the need to take operational requirements into consideration when staffing for major implementation efforts while at the same time allowing opportunity for employee's professional growth. The Company also understands the Union's obligation to protect the seniority rights of all members.
During negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed at length the subject of newly created departments and the impact this activity has on existing departments. As such, when the need for a new department is identified (not including a reorganization of an existing department) the Company and the Union agree to initiate proactive collaborative efforts to explore options and alternatives which may address the impacts to:
♦	Customer Service
♦	Quality
♦	Employee’s Professional Growth
♦	Seniority Rights
♦	Seniority Unit Structure
♦	Training
♦	Operational Efficiencies
♦	Socio-Technical Systems
260
This effort may address alternatives such as:
♦	Advance Hiring
♦	Transferring employees in phases
♦	Employee Incentives in lieu of leaving
♦	Backfilling
♦	Placement Thresholds
These collective efforts will develop action plans so as to minimize the adverse effects of staffing a new department.
261
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #8.9

During the 1993 Negotiations, discussions ensued regarding the use of temporary employees.
The parties agreed that the use of temporary employees is controlled by the language of Article 8, Section 8.12
Therefore, it is not the intent of the Company to utilize temporary employees to replace bargaining unit members nor to erode the bargaining unit.
During the 1999 Negotiations, the parties recognized the need to address issues related to providing coverage for fluctuating volumes, peak receipts, expanded servicing requirements, interruptions to service and other customer servicing expectations. The parties also discussed pilots to address these issues.
To this end, two pilots will be implemented to study the efficient use of Company Temporary Employees and department clerical personnel. After the initial six (6) month implementation, extensions may be approved by the Local, International, Statewide Chairperson and the Vice President of Human Resources based on the pilot results.
□	The first pitot will apply to departments with a demonstrated need for supplemental employees. Company Temporary Employees may be used to supplement the workforce on a pilot basis. The time restrictions outlined in Article 8 will not apply during the pilot period.
□	The second pilot will be implemented in customer service units which provides for the career pathing of incumbent and departmental clerical personnel. Such
262
employees will be afforded the opportunity on a voluntary basis to be trained and used in a customer service capacity, prior to meeting tenure. Participation is contingent upon successfully meeting the established CSR Selection criteria.
The intent of this pilot will be to provide departmental clerical personnel in customer service units the opportunity to work part-time in a clerical capacity and part-time in a customer service capacity prior to full-time CSR job openings. During the pilot period, such departmental clerical employees shall remain in their current salary grade and be compensated for time worked as a Customer Service Representative. As a result, the CSR tenure will apply. Additionally, Company Temporary Employees will be used to back fill clerical personnel during the pilot .without restrictions to time limits. .	•	.	-

RE: JOB CLASSIFICATIONS - PROJECT TEAM
The parties are desirous of utilizing the most progressive and effective job classification and evaluation system which supports the dynamic and rapidly changing business environment now and in the future.
Both parties envision a job classification system which ensures:
♦	Equity of value across the company;
♦	Consistency of the job classification process for all jobs;

267
also be streamlined. Furthermore, the design of this job classification system will be able to accommodate the requirements of a rapidly changing business environment.
To this end, the parties agree to establish a work team, within the life of the Agreement, to make recommendations for a comprehensive strategy for career paths. The intent is to structure career paths in a manner which fosters employee growth, company loyalty, improved workforce skills and proficiencies for service to our customers.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #11.1
RE: PRODUCTION/QUALITY STANDARDS
QUALITY STANDARDS METHODOLOGY:
The basis for the setting of quality standards as referenced in Section 11.3 of Article 11, Production/Quality Standards, is found in the document entitled Individual Quality Assurance Program, dated May, 1986, copies of which were provided the Union during 1987 negotiations.
NOTIFICATION/CHALLENGE PROCESS:

SPACE REQUIREMENTS:
The Company will provide sufficient space to a Time Study Representative during the investigation of a specific standard to perform the duties designated herein. Each Time Study Representative will be assigned a file cabinet at their respective place of work.
EXCLUSIONS DURING PRODUCTION STANDARDS TIME STUDIES:
The Company agrees in principle, that temporary employees, probationary employees, and employees on loan from another department will not be studied when establishing a production standard. In extenuating circumstances the Company will discuss the situation with the respective Union Time Study Representative.
272
EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS:
The Company will continue its practice of addressing individual employee performance problems that are due to reasons beyond the employee's control on a case-by-case basis.

The supervisor will advise Employee Relations and the matter will be investigated in conjunction with the Union Time Study Representative.
273
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #11.2 RE: COACHING/DEVELQPMENT
Management realizes that there may be times when an individual’s performance may fall short of the production and quality standards. Management alsorealizes that there may be a variety of reasons for this temporary set back. Management will utilize the coaching and development as a way to identify the performance problem and as a way to identify, with the support and help of the individual, what the cause of the problem is. When management, through the contractual Coaching and Development process, develops and institutes an improvement plan, and the employee meets the improvement plan goals-both intermediate and final--no discipline will apply for that issue during that episode. Improvement plans should be realistic and include individual circumstances of the work setting as well as the employee. If the employee fails to meet the plan goals and/or the performance difficulty re-occurs, discipline may be applied concurrently with Coaching and Development.
274
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #11,3 RE: “BEST IN CLASS” QUALITY

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #12.5
RE: FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING
During the course of the 2002 Negotiations, the parties discussed at length, the need to remain flexible in our approach to the way we service our customer's needs. Specifically, the parties discussed various work schedules to meet the needs of the company. The parties agreed such work schedules will enhance employee satisfaction, recognize the need for work family balance, and lead to improved customer satisfaction. To that end, the Company will develop and implement, with Union input, work schedules to meet customer expectations and service requirements.

285
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #15,1
RE: ABSENTEEISM
During negotiations the parties agreed that absenteeism is costly and disruptive to operations. The Company and Union also agreed that absenteeism places an unfair burden on those employees who regularly report to work and use sick time only when necessary. The parties, therefore, agree to establish a procedure separate from the normal disciplinary process, to deal with the small number of employees who appear to continually have problems with absenteeism.
The initial step of this procedure will entail a joint Union and Company counseling of the employee by the employee's Department Manager, Zone Representative/Chairperson and an Employee Relations Representative. During this session the employee will be apprised of her/his absenteeism record and the parties will discuss the reasons for the absences. If the absences are considered to be of a confidential nature, a member of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Committee and Joint Attendance Coordinators will be contacted to work in a support role.
This letter should not be construed as limiting management's right to impose discipline for absenteeism up to and including discharge, or the Union's right to grieve such action if believed to be inappropriate, nor is it intended to address an employee who had previously exhibited a good attendance record over the years but more recently developed a poor record due to legitimate reasons and where management's expectation is that such an employee will return to an acceptable attendance level. Rather this procedure is intended to apply to those individuals who have definite patterns of excessive absenteeism.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #20.8 RE: WORK AND FAMILY PROGRAM
Purpose
The Company and the UAW recognize that the competing demands of the workplace and the family create stress at home and on the job. When work and family responsibilities are out of balance, employees often are unable to reach their full potential. Productivity, job performance and family harmony all can suffer.
When employees are able to balance their work and family lives, they can be more productive both at work and at home. The Work and Family Program provides workplace based support and assistance to help employees achieve that balance.
Joint Family Care Committee
The Joint Family Care Committee will consist of four (4) members from the Union and four (4) from the Company. This committee will consist of one union representative from each Local. The committee will oversee and make recommendations, as appropriate, for the family care fund, childcare consortium activities, and the resource and referral program. In addition, the committee will recommend alternative providers, which may include union providers, for childcare programs. The committee will pursue a childcare initiative aimed at providing onsite or near on-site quality childcare in one or more BCBSM communities.
304
Resource and Referral Program
A 1-800-telephone service will continue to provide employees with information, referrals, education and consultation to meet their family care needs. Employees experiencing childcare, elder/adult care, and other such needs can access the service. The Detroit and Southfield locations will be provided with 4-8 hours on-site consultation with a family care expert and the outstate locations will be provided on-site consultation as jointly determined appropriate. The service provider has been selected.
Consortium Opportunities
In an effort to expand employee access to childcare services in the Metropolitan Detroit Community, the parties will review the feasibility of joining the Alliance for Children and Working Families.
Additional consortium opportunities will be explored as available in communities where employees live and work.
Family Cane Fund
All employees covered by this Agreement shall have access to a family care fund to be used for direct childcare, elder/adult care, and adoption services. The Company will contribute $600,000.00 each year for the life of the Agreement. Employees can access up to $750.00 per year from this fund for direct dependent care as follows:
Eligible Family Members/Eliqible Expenses:
Childcare - child, adopted child or stepchild up to 12 years of age
♦	Direct Childcare:
♦	Summer Day Camps ♦ School Holiday Care
305
♦	Preschool Programs
♦	Summer School
♦	Emergency Care (Snow Day & Sick Childcare)
♦	Latch Key Services
'♦ Tutoring
Childcare - child, adopted child, or stepchild 13 to 18 years of age	.
♦	Day Camps
*	Summer Camps
♦	Tutoring
Elder/adult Care - spouse, child, stepchild, adopted child, father, stepfather, father-in-law, mother, stepmother, mother-in-law, grandfather, grandmother
♦	Home Health Care
♦	Home Health Aids
♦	Handicap Accessible Modification to Homes
♦	Durable Medical Equipment (not covered by insurance) ♦ Transportation to medical appointments
Adoption
♦	Legal Fees
♦	Agency Fees
The Joint Family Care Committee will oversee the administration of the Family Care Fund. Annual funding, distribution amounts and distribution schedules may be adjusted due to projected or actual usage as determined by the Joint Family Care Committee, but in no event will exceed the total amount generated at the $600,000,00 rate plus interest earned.
306
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #25.1
RE: JOB SECURITY
In undertaking the Joint Program/Business Process Improvement initiative, BCBSM and UAW have committed themselves to creating an affirmative environment that encourages and empowers our work force to review current work processes, systems, and organizational structure for the purpose of recommending how these components can be redesigned to maximize customer service and cost effectiveness. Direct employee involvement, participation, and leadership can result in much needed productivity gains, improved quality and reduced administrative costs.
Realizing that our BCBSM employees, who are UAW members, may be reluctant to apply their innovative energies and talents to this endeavor if it is perceived that their recommendations and ideas for improvement will simultaneously jeopardize their future employment, the Company, in an effort to encourage a creative environment that stimulates the free flow of ideas, hereby provides the following protection to bargaining unit employees:
No bargaining unit member within the "pilot” department(s) will lose employment, be reduced in wage rate, or hours of work as a result of the implementation of joint recommendations generated through the Joint Program/Business Process Improvement process. This protection will also be extended to include any/all bargaining unit employees of departments other than pilot departments who are impacted by Joint Program/Business Process Improvement recommendations.
307
Temporary Employees
It is in our collective best interest to establish a “reserve pool” concept to provide full-time bargaining unit positions to perform that work previously assigned to non-union, contracted Temporary Agency Employees for extended periods of time. The parties will meet to mutually develop a plan to implement the reserve pool for the expressed purpose of phasing out non-union contracted Temporary Agency Employees who may be performing bargaining unit work for such extended periods in violation of the Master Labor Agreement
The Company and the Union should recognize that there may be a continuing need to utilize temporary employees for short duration’s as outlined in Article 8 of the Master Labor Agreement. The Company will routinely utilize Company Temporary Employees to cover new business or new product implementations, extended employee absences from work, special projects, and other situations which may not require the use of full-time employees.
To ensure that time frames and other contractual obligations are met according to the terms of the Master Labor Agreement, utilization of all temporary employees will be administered and approved by Employee Relations. Any violations in this regard may be referred by the Statewide Bargaining Chairperson directly to the Director of Human Resources.
Outsourcing
Both BCBSM and the UAW agree that it makes good business sense to utilize our “own” employees to perform work for which they are qualified. Toward that end, we are committed to reviewing every opportunity to minimize outsourcing.
The parties agree to establish a work team in each Local Union to review outsourcing. First priority will be given to areas of the corporation that are scheduled for Joint Program/Business Process Improvement pilot activity.
308
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #26.1
RE: BASIC SKILLS ASSESSMENT PROGRAM
Since the parties recognize that successful training performance and resulting job performance are linked to solid foundational skills, the Company and the Union agree to explore the feasibility of implementing a Basic Skills Assessment Program. The intent of the Basic Skills Assessment Program is to allow UAW represented employees an opportunity to assess reading, writing, math and keyboard/typing skills.
Such a program, if determined to be viable to meet anticipated needs, will provide the avenues for addressing skill needs. Among the issues to be explored are:
1.	Timelines
2.	Assessment Procedures
3.	Skill upgrade alternatives such as a pilot co-sponsored by the Company and the Union or community education programs
4.	Location, facilities and hours
5.	Exclusions and limitations
6.	Joint Funding
309
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #26.2
RE: TRAINING (INTENT)
The Company and the Union recognize the importance of providing training to the employee, as soon as possible, after placement into a new position. During the 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed many ways to address this concern such as:
♦	Identifying the requisite skills for the job on the job posting;
♦	Assessing the employee's skills within thirty (30) days of placement into a position;
♦	Classroom training and/or training alternative delivery methods to begin within thirty (30) days following assessment.
To this end, the Company agrees to make every effort to provide the required training within the appropriate tenure period. The Company will not arbitrarily extend tenure. The members of the Corporate Training Council will define appropriate tenure guidelines and criteria for extension.
The parties also recognize training to be a dynamic process with shared responsibilities between the Company and the individual employee. The Company must continue to provide opportunities for learning, technical and professional growth and development that encourages continuous improvement. Simultaneously, the employee must commit to the learning process, self development and achievement. Therefore, the parties agree that the Trainee must be an integral part of the complete training process; actively participating at each step including assessment(s), coaching, feedback, alternative training strategies, and training plan.
310
With Trainee involvement and the Company s commitment to encourage and support employee development, training can become a vehicle for maximizing successful job performance.
311
I
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #26.3
RE: GAP TRAINING
The parties will implement a structured plan within the terms of this Agreement, for the purpose of providing cross training to all phone and written Customer Service Representatives. Such training will be offered on a voluntary basis, with most senior volunteers considered first.
In addition, the parties agree that fully trained employees are more productive and able to meet customer service needs. To achieve this end, GAP training needs for Customer Service Representatives will be assessed, and the required training provided to employees .in accordance with Article 26.10.
312
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #27.1
RE: BCBSM/UAW COOPERATIVE PROCESS COMMITTEES
During the 1993 negotiations, both the Company and the Union recognized the need to continue to pursue a mutual gains approach to identify and address employee needs and corporate strategic business goals. This commitment is being met by the formation of joint committees to develop and address long range plans, and has resulted in recommendations under the auspices of the Cooperative Process Coordinating Group (CPCG).
These committees recommendations were approved by the Union Bargaining Committee and subsequently brought before the Union-Management Action Committee (UMAC) for endorsement of each committee, allocation of resources, and establishment of priorities for cooperative process activities. The process defined above, will continue throughout the life of the 2002 - 2005 Master Labor Agreement.
The Cooperative Process Coordinating Group will continue to assist in the development of project summaries which enable UMAC to prioritize and allocate resources for these committees. The project summaries will consist of definition of committee purpose, deliverable(syproduct(s), meeting frequency, time frame for completion and anticipated resource needs. It is understood that the committees listed below are in addition to any Cooperative Process activities identified in Article 27 of this Master Labor Agreement.
With UMAC’s authorization, the Cooperative Process Coordinating Group will assume responsibility for coordinating activities for the following joint committees:
313
। COMMITTEE	CHARGE	I (In accordance with Master Labor | Agreement, and Union Bargaining 1 Committee/Management Policy) |
TQM/Self Managed Teams (including Horizons) ♦ Implementation Team ♦ Self-Directed Teams	Develop and administer training in work redesign processes. Participate in the drafting of joint recommendations for work redesign in accordance with jointly approved guidelines.
Attendance	Establish and monitor attendance reports: ♦	Coordinate the administration of the Salary Continuation Program ♦	Coordinate the administration of the waiver policy ♦	Recommend policy changes based on trend analysis ♦	Review and implement joint recommendations regarding the rehabilitation process.
Production/Quality Standards-Coaching and Development	Facilitate implementation of Coaching and Development Process.
Joint Training Centers (Prudence M. Humphrey Center)	Under the direction of Joint Administrators (appointed by the Company and the Union, respectively), administer programs to promote training opportunities to bargaining unit employees.
314
It is understood that Cooperative Process activities are intended to realize the goals set forth in the Master Labor Agreement. The Cooperative Process Core Group, UMAC and the Joint Committees referenced by this letter are specifically not authorized to modify the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
315
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #27.2
RE: QUARTERLY MEETINGS
Both the Company and the Union agree that review of any plans and concerns raised by either party would be addressed during quarterly “State of the Union and Company" meetings, which will be beneficial to both parties by fostering an open and harmonious working relationship.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #30.1
RE: LOSS OR SALE OF BUSINESS
In the event BCBSM or one of its subsidiaries closes as a result of the loss or sale of business, employees affected by such action will be afforded placement consideration at the remaining companies prior to the hire of any external candidates. Such employees will receive preferential employment consideration for a period equal in their seniority, but not to exceed two | years.
। Affected employees must contact BCBSM or any subsidiary for which they wish to apply no later than 30 days following their last day of employment. An employee who declines a job offer will forfeit further placement consideration with BCBSM or any subsidiary under the terms of this letter. Affected employees are subject to all employment and job requirements of BCBSM and/or the subsidiary for which they apply.
316
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #A
RE: NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION
The Company has implemented a New Employee Orientation (NEO) program. The Union participates in this process by providing a module which describes the Union and its objectives and goals. This helps build better understanding of the legitimate and valued roles the Union plays with respect to building amiable Labor-Management relationships. The Union will provide the Company with the names of the individuals who will facilitate for each Local Union in the process.
317
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING #B RE: MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
With regard to all Locals, the following understandings will apply:
1.	Training Time - Whenever possible, the Company will hold training sessions during regular working hours.
2.	Out of Territory - The Company, when the need arises, will offer out of territory work on a voluntary basis. If there are not volunteers, selection for such work will be the least senior employee who is qualified to perform the function.
Work Between Local Jurisdictions
3.	Split Assignments - On rare occasions, the Company will have need to split an employee’s work schedule between different facilities, e.g., one day at one office and four days at another office. The Company will make every effort to assign an employee from a location that is within the jurisdiction of the Local that represents both offices. When the Company is unable to do so, and finds it necessary to assign an employee from another Local, the Company will provide rationale, including business needs, to the Leadership of both Locals, and solicit their input in an effort to make a mutually agreeable decision. In the event of an impasse, the Company may implement and the Union retains its rights under Article 7 to grieve this decision.
4.	Lodging - For those employees who require overnight lodging (i.e., training, out of territory) the Company shall provide appropriate lodging. Should
318
the employee prefer other accommodations, any additional cost exceeding Company-provided lodging is the employee's responsibility. When overnight lodging is required, two employees are expected to share a room. Travel Cash Advances will be made available when requested. When Cash Advances are not available the Company will provide lodging with food service available.
5.	Mileage - Employees on temporary work assignments or training sessions in another facility will be paid for reimbursable business mileage. Mileage will be paid at the corporate approved rate in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Changes from that rate must be mutually agreed upon.
6.	Overtime - If the "work day" including appropriate travel time exceeds 7.75 hours, overtime will be paid at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the employee's base salary rate. Travel time required is based on the normal travel time from the employee’s facility to the temporary assignment or training session.
7.	Cots - The Company will provide cots in those district office facilities where there is adequate space.
8.	Office Equipment - As facilities are remodeled or relocated, the Company will consider the installation of microwave ovens and the inclusion of separate employee lounge areas in the design plan.
9.	Personnel Files - The official employment personnel file is maintained in the Human Resources Department. Employees may arrange to see their files in accordance with corporate policy and an applicable law.
319
