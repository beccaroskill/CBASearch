Preamble
STATE OF CONNECTICUT, acting by and through the Office of Labor Relations, hereinafter called “the State” or “the Employer” and the Administrative and Residual Employees Union,
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS the parties to this Agreement desire to establish a state of amicable, understanding cooperation and harmony, and
WHEREAS the parties to this Agreement consider themselves mutually responsible to improve the public service through increased morale, efficiency, and productivity;
NOW THEREFORE, the parties mutually agree as follows:
Article 1 Recognition
The State of Connecticut herein recognizes the Administrative and Residual Employees Union, hereinafter the “Union”, as the exclusive representative of the State Employees whose classifications were assigned to the certified unit by action of the Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations under Certification SE-5971, subject to such modifications or clarifications of the unit as the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction may order, or to which the parties may agree.
Article 2
Contract Coverage
Section One. This Agreement shall pertain only to those employees whose job titles fall within Certification SE-5971 or by mutual Agreement of the parties and shall not apply to non-permanent employees appointed to nonpermanent temporary, emergency or seasonal positions, nor to durational positions of six (6) months or less. Employees appointed originally on a provisional basis, and/or employees appointed to durational positions established for six (6) months or more shall be covered by this Agreement, but shall have no right of appeal from termination due to expiration of position or failure to
1
successfully complete the required examination and appointment process. Persons serving a Working Test Period are not excluded except as otherwise indicated in this Agreement.
(a)	New Classes. The Employer will notify the Union of the establishment of new classes and its position concerning the bargaining unit placement. Said notice shall precede the filling of any positions within said classification including the transfer of incumbents from existing titles.
(b)	Changes in Job Specifications. The Employer shall notify the Union as far in advance as practicable to permit the parties to negotiate the impact of changes in job specifications.
Section Two. Provisional Employees. Provisional employees are employees who are initially appointed to permanent positions pending State examination or examination results. Provisional appointees are subject to the requirements of the merit system in all respects, including but not limited to certification from an examination list and completion of the Working Test Period. Permanent appointment is contingent upon meeting all said requirements, and failure to do so will result in termination of employment without right of appeal except as provided by the merit system. In all other respects, provisional employees are subject to the provisions of this Agreement and can utilize all benefits as if they were initially appointed as permanent full time employees. Seniority shall be retroactive to the date of last hire upon successful completion of the Working Test Period.
Section Three. Temporary Employees. A temporary employee is defined as an employee who is hired to fill a temporary, durational or emergency position of six (6) months duration or the length of leave of absence of the employee replaced, whichever is longer. Due to the nature of temporary employment, temporary employees cannot be guaranteed continued employment beyond the termination date of the appointment. Termination is therefore without right of appeal. In other respects, this Agreement shall apply to a temporary
2
employee after completion of six (6) months of continuous service. When the service of such employee has been satisfactory for a period of six (6) months and a non competitive vacancy exists in the bargaining unit which he/she is qualified to fill, the Employer shall offer the position to the employee after permanent employees have been considered. Upon appointment to a permanent position the employee shall serve a Working Test Period as provided in this Agreement. Seniority shall be retroactive to the date of last hire upon successful completion of the Working Test Period. The period for advance notice to durationals who are employed without a specified termination date of the impending termination of their employment shall be not less than three (3) weeks.
Article 3
Management Rights
Section One. Except as otherwise limited by an express provision of this Agreement, the State reserves and retains, whether exercised or not, all the lawful and customary rights, powers, and prerogatives of public management. Such rights include, but are not limited to, establishing standards of productivity and performance of its employees; determining the mission of an agency and the methods and means necessary to fulfill that mission, including the contracting out of or the discontinuation of services, positions, or programs in whole or in part; the determination of the content of job classification; classification and pay grade for newly created jobs; the appointment, promotion, assignment, direction and transfer of personnel; the suspension, demotion, discharge or any other appropriate action against its employees; the relief from duty of its employees because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons; the establishment of reasonable work rules; and the taking of all necessary actions to carry out its mission in
emergencies.
Section Two. Those inherent management rights not restricted by a specific provision of this Agreement are not in
3
any way, directly or indirectly, subject to the grievance procedure.
Article 4
Employee Bill of Rights
Section One. Each employee covered herein shall be expected to render a full and fair days work in an atmosphere of mutual respect and dignity free from significant abusive or arbitrary conduct.
Section Two. An employee's off-duty conduct, speech, beliefs, politics or preferences shall not in and of themselves impact on his/her employment unless clearly job related.
(a)	In any off-duty conduct involving criminal charges or criminal investigation, which yields no charges, statements made by the accused shall not be admissible in a later administrative action unless clearly job related.
(b)	Any complaints not alleging criminal conduct shall be given to the affected employee within four (4) business days of receipt by the employing agency.
Section Three. An employee shall be entitled to Union representation upon his/her request at each step of the grievance procedure and all predisciplinary hearings.
Section Four. No employee shall be requested to sign a statement of an admission of guilt to be used in a disciplinary proceeding without being advised of his/her right to Union representation. If the employee waives right to representation in this instance, such waiver shall be in writing.
Section Five. No record of complaint against any employee shall be kept in an employee's personnel file unless such record includes identification of the complainant.
Section Six. No employee shall be compelled to offer evidence under oath against himself/herself in any disciplinary action. Testimony by the employee in his/her own behalf shall constitute waiver of this protection. (See Article 14, Section Six [b]).
4
Article 5
Non Discrimination
Section One. The parties agree that neither shall discriminate against any employee, because of the individual's race, color, religious creed, age, sex, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation, history of mental disorder or mental retardation, except on the basis of bona fide occupational qualifications. The parties further agree in all aspects to follow the provisions of C.G.S. Sections 46a-81c,d,e, regarding the prohibition of discriminatory employment practices.
Section Two. The parties agree to work jointly to eliminate and to prevent discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity in the application of this Agreement.
Section Three. The Employer shall not discriminate against any employee who has utilized the statutory “whistle blower” provisions and filed information with the appropriate statutory officials.
Section Four. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Employer will have the right and duty to take all actions necessary to comply with the provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 2101, et seq. (ADA). Upon request, the Employer will meet and discuss specific concerns identified by the Union; however, this shall not delay any actions taken to comply with the ADA.
Section Five: Neither party shall discriminate against any employee on the basis of membership or non-membership or lawful activity on behalf of the exclusive bargaining agent.
Article 6
Concerted Activity
Section One. Neither the Union nor any employee shall engage in, induce, support, encourage, or condone a strike, sympathy strike, work stoppage, slowdown, concerted withholding of services, sickout or any interference with the mission of any State Agency. This Article shall be deemed to prohibit the concerted boycott or refusal of overtime work, but
5
shall be interpreted consistent with any provisions of this Agreement on distribution and assignment of overtime work.
Section Two. In any appeal of disciplinary action taken as a result of an alleged violation of this Article, the arbitrator shall have no authority to alter or modify the disciplinary penalty imposed if such penalty is less than the equivalent of a five (5) day suspension.
Section Three. The Union shall exert its best efforts to prevent or terminate any violation of Section One of this Article. Immediate written notice to employees involved of their obligation under this Section, with copies of such notice served on the Employer, shall constitute compliance with this Section.
Section Fou	r. The Employer agrees that during the life of this Agreement there shall be no lockout.
Section Fiv	e. The Employer will provide security for employees who continue to meet job obligations in spite of any illegal strike, picket line or other job action posing a hazard to the employees' safety.
Article 7
Union Security and Payroll Deduction
Section One. During the life of this Agreement, an employee retains the freedom of choice whether or not to become or remain a member of the Union, which has been designated as the exclusive bargaining agent.
Section Two. Union dues and/or assessments shall be deducted by the State employer biweekly from the paycheck of each employee who signs and remits to the State an authorization form. Such deduction shall be discontinued upon written request of an employee thirty (30) days in advance.
If a change in salary causes a change in the amount of dues or assessment, which should be withheld, the change in dues or assessment shall be made simultaneously with any change in salary.
6
Section Three. An employee who, within thirty (30) days after initial employment in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, fails to become a member of the Union or an employee whose membership is terminated for nonpayment of dues or who resigns from membership shall be required to pay an agency service fee under Section Four.
Section Four. The State shall deduct the agency service fee biweekly from the paycheck of each employee who is required under C.G.S. 5-280 to pay such a fee as a condition of employment, provided, however, no such payment shall be required of an employee whose membership is terminated for reasons other than nonpayment of Union dues or who objects to payment of such fee based on the tenets of a religious sect. The amount of agency service fee shall not exceed the minimum applicable dues and/or assessments payable to the exclusive bargaining agent.
Section Five. The amount of dues or agency service fees deducted under this Article shall be remitted to the Treasurer of the Administrative and Residual Employees Union as soon as available after the payroll period together with the list of employees for whom any such deduction is made.
Section Six. No payroll deduction of dues or agency service fee shall be made from workers' compensation or for any payroll period in which earnings received are insufficient to cover the amount of deduction, nor shall such deductions be made from subsequent payrolls to cover the period in question (non-retroactive).
Section Seven. No other organizations shall be entitled to deduction of its dues or service fees from the payroll.
Section Eight. The State employer shall continue its practice of payroll deductions as authorized by employees for purposes other than payment of Union dues or agency service fees, provided any such payroll deduction has been approved by the State in advance.
7

Section Ten.	(a) The existing system of voluntary payroll deductions for the Union's Political Action Fund shall be continued.

Article 8
Union Rights
Section One. Employer representatives shall deal exclusively with Union designated stewards or representatives in the processing of grievances or any other aspect of contract administration.
Section Two. The Union will furnish the State employer with the list of stewards designated to represent any segment of employees covered by this Agreement, specifying the jurisdiction of each steward, and shall keep the list current on a monthly basis unless there is no change.
Section Three. Access to Premises. Union staff representatives shall be permitted to enter the facilities of an agency at any reasonable time for the purpose of discussing, processing or investigating filed grievances, or fulfilling its role as collective bargaining agent, provided that they give notice of their presence immediately to the supervisor in charge and do not interfere with the performance of duties.
The Union will furnish the State employer with a current list of its staff personnel and their jurisdictions, and shall maintain the currency of said list.
Section Four. Role of Steward in Processing Grievances. The steward will obtain permission from his/her immediate supervisor when leaving the work assignment to carry out steward duties in connection with this Agreement. When contacting an employee, the steward will first report to and
8
obtain permission to see the employee from the employee's supervisor. Such permission will be granted unless the work situation or an emergency demands otherwise. If the immediate supervisor is unavailable, permission will be requested from the next level of supervision. Such requests shall include names (employee's), work location and approximate time (anticipated) that will be needed. The steward will report back to his/her supervisor upon completion of such duties and return to work without a loss in pay or benefits. The Union will cooperate in preventing abuse of this Section. Steward coverage shall be no greater than sixty-five (65) stewards, eight (8) of whom may be designated for general jurisdiction. Only one (1) steward shall represent a grievant at any given time.
(a)	The selection and designation of stewards are recognized as exclusively Union functions.
(b)	Stewards shall carry appropriate identification, provided by the Union, when performing steward duties.
(c)	Stewards shall have reasonable access to work areas when performing steward duties associated with contract administration.
(d)	Stewards shall be deemed to have the highest seniority in their classifications; on the condition they have permanent status therein, except as provided otherwise.
Section Five. Bulletin Board. The State will continue to furnish reasonable bulletin board space in each institution, which the Union may utilize for its announcements. Bulletin board space shall not be used for material that is of a partisan political nature or is inflammatory or derogatory to the State employer or any of its officers or employees. The Union shall limit its posting of notices and bulletins to such bulletin board space.
Section Six	. Access to Information. The Employer agrees to provide the Union, upon request and adequate notice, access to materials and information necessary for the Union to fulfill its statutory responsibility to administer this Agreement. The Union shall reimburse the State for the expense and time spent
9
for photocopying extensive information and otherwise as permitted under State Freedom of Information Law. The Union shall not have access to privileged or confidential information.
Section Sev	en. Union Business Leave. Subject to prior written approval of the Office of Labor Relations, paid leave may be granted to Union officers, stewards, delegates or designees as follows:
(a)	For each year of the contract, a bank of one and three quarter (1.75) hours per employee in the bargaining unit as of July 1 to be used for Union business and steward training shall be established.
Union business leave shall be granted as follows:
(1)	Usage shall be for no more than two (2) days per week per person. If the Union seeks additional usage, the State and the Union shall discuss the situation and may, by mutual Agreement, grant the leave usage.
(2)	Usage shall not be unreasonably denied except where an agency emergency exists. However, if the usage would cause significant impact on the agency operations, the State and the Union shall discuss the situation and may, by mutual Agreement, postpone or cancel the leave usage.
(3)	Unless mutually agreed otherwise, the Union will give seven (7) full working days written notice requesting Union Business Leave to the Office of Labor Relations. The Union shall provide a concurrent copy to the affected agency.
(b)	Leave in the first year may be supplemented by not more than ten percent (10%) of the bank from year two. Leave in the second year may be supplemented by not more than ten percent (10%) of the bank from year three. Leave in the third year may be supplemented by not more than ten percent (10%) of the bank from year four. Likewise, a sum not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the annual bank may be carried over into a succeeding year, but all leave excess shall expire on the final date of this Agreement.
10
Upon expiration of this Agreement and prior to approval of a successor agreement, the Union shall continue to have available leave time as provided in subsection (a) of this Section Seven. Upon approval of a successor agreement, the leave time utilized during this transition period will be deducted from what approved leave time has been incorporated into the successor agreement.
(c)	Officers Leave. Three (3) employees elected or appointed to a full-time office with the Union shall be eligible for an unpaid leave of absence not to exceed two (2) years. Extensions of said leave shall be requested and favorably considered on an annual basis.
One (1) additional employee elected or designated by the Union to a full-time Union assignment shall be eligible for fulltime paid leave, which shall be remunerated by the Employer as follows:
(1)	The Employer shall pay all salary and benefits. For the purpose of meeting this obligation, the Department of Administrative Services, at its discretion, may establish and fund a position at the level necessary to cover the paid leave until return to service can be arranged.
(2)	Not less than half of the annual work hours shall be deducted from the Union leave bank.
(3)	Upon request from the State, the Union shall make reimbursement for any gross salary not compensated from the Union business leave bank (pursuant to Subsection (c) [2]).
Upon return from such leave, the Employer shall offer the employee a position at least equal to the former position in pay, benefits and duties at the wage rates in force at the time of return
11
from such leave. It is intended that the employee on leave shall return to service with all the classification and benefit adjustments attendant to the vacated position, which have accrued in his/her absence. This Article does not obligate the Employer to offer the employee a position in the employee's former agency unless such placement is practicable.
Upon return from leave, the employee on unpaid leave shall have the right to purchase back retirement credits for the period of the leave, provided that, in addition, the employee or the Union contribute the State's share of the cost of such retirement credit.
Section Eight. Orientation. The Employer will provide each new employee with a copy of the collective bargaining Agreement then in force and will furnish such employee with the name of his/her steward. The Employer shall notify the Union of new hires not later than the date of the first paycheck after hire.
Section Nine. The Employer shall provide space for Union meetings during non-working hours (including lunch periods) provided rooms are available and there is no disruption of work.
Section Ten. The existing practices within Agencies for paid leave time for employees serving as witnesses in administrative or judicial proceedings involving contract administration or enforcement shall continue for the duration of the Agreement.
Article 9
Working Test Period
Section One. The Working Test Period shall be deemed an extension of the examination process. Therefore, a determination of unsatisfactory performance during a Working Test Period shall be tantamount to a failure of the competitive exam. Dismissal of employees during the original Working Test Period shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure.
12
Section Two. (a) The Working Test Period for classes in the A&R Unit shall be six (6) months except for those classes established under C.G. S. Section 5-234, in which case the Working Test Period shall be for the duration of the established training program. Within ten (10) days preceding the termination of the Working Test Period, and at such other times as the Commissioner of Administrative Services requires, the appointing authority shall report to said Commissioner of Administrative Services whether such employee is able and willing to perform the duties in a manner so as to merit permanent appointment. The Working Test Period may, with the approval of the Commissioner of Administrative Services, be extended on an individual basis for a definite period of time not to exceed six (6) months.
(b) The Working Test Period for a promotion is four (4) months.
There shall be no Working Test Period for any employee with permanent status in the position who is involuntarily transferred in that job classification.
Any employee who is promoted to a position, which requires a Working Test Period, shall be advised by the immediate supervisor of his/her performance at the midway point of the Working Test Period. At the employee's request, such progress report shall be put in writing within ten (10) working days.
(1)	If the employee's performance is “less than good”, the immediate supervisor must offer suggestions for improvement, if requested by the employee. These suggestions shall be reduced to writing within two (2) weeks.
(2)	If at the end of the Working Test Period the employee's performance in the new position is rated as unsatisfactory, he/she must be returned to the previous position or a comparable position without loss of any benefits or seniority rights.
Section Three. The Working Test Period shall commence on the date of appointment from the employment list if the
13
position is competitive. Otherwise, the Working Test Period shall commence on the date of original appointment. Employees provisionally promoted will have said provisional service credited toward completion of the Working Test Period when/if a permanent appointment is made.
Section Four. This contract shall not be deemed to terminate any right of appeal which may have existed prior to the Agreement alleging patent unfairness of the Working Test Period due to evaluator bias or variance from the pertinent job specification, provided, however, no such claim will be processed under the grievance and arbitration procedure, and further provided this provision shall be deemed subordinate to Article 14 (Dismissal, Suspension, Demotion or Other Discipline), Section One.
Section Five. The State will waive the Working Test Period for trainees and pre-professional trainees who satisfactorily complete two (2) year training programs. For trainees and pre-professional trainees with program duration of less than two (2) years, the total time which may be served before permanent appointment shall not exceed two (2) years, assuming satisfactory performance. Employees successfully completing a one (1) year training class shall be subject to a four (4) month Working Test Period in the target class. In all other instances, the State retains the discretion to count time spent in professional trainee or pre-professional positions toward completion of the prescribed Working Test Period.
Section Six. Appeal rights for employee in two (2) year training classes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section Four above, the following applies to employees in two (2) year training classes:
The parties acknowledge that training classes are created for the purpose of preparing employees for their target class. It is agreed that one (1) year of employment in pay status is sufficient to evaluate the potential of an employee, but said evaluation period may be extended by the equivalent of any long term illness (greater than five (5) consecutive days) or leave without 14
pay. Training class employees who have performed in the class as defined above, for the equivalent of one (1) year and are subsequently determined by the Employer to be incapable of performing the job duties of the training class, shall be entitled to the right of appeal to the third step of the grievance procedure, when the employee alleges patent employer unfairness, or variation from the assigned job classification.
An employee who is determined by the Employer to be incapable of performing the job duties of the training class, but who is considered by the Commissioner of Administrative Services to be suitable for employment in some other department, may be restored to the employment list.
Article 10
Service Ratings
Section One. All employees shall receive an annual evaluation three months prior to their anniversary date (January 1, or July 1, as applicable). (C.G.S. Section 5-210(b) for reference). When the month end falls on a holiday or weekend the rating shall be deemed timely if tendered on the first business day after said weekend or holiday. Service ratings may be issued: (1) during any Working Test Period, (2) when the employer wishes to amend a previously submitted less than good rating due to marked improvement, (3) and at such other times as the appointing authority deems that the quality of service of an employee should be recorded.
No second "less than good" rating shall be given until the employer has implemented a remedial plan which specifically identifies the deficiencies and the steps the employee needs to take to cure the deficiencies. In any event, said remedial plan must be in place for at least six (6) months before a second "less than good" rating is issued.
The Employer retains all other contractually or statutorily permitted mechanisms for assessing employee performance. Any files maintained concerning interim conferences shall be in the form of supervisory notes and shall not be on the established rating form.
15
Section Two. A service rating will be conducted by the management designee familiar with the employee's performance in his/her current job assignment. No supervisor shall make comments within a service rating where such comments are inconsistent with said rating. However, constructive suggestions for improvement shall not be considered to be inconsistent with the rating.
Section Thr	ee. Ratings of fair in two (2) categories and/or unsatisfactory in one (1) or more categories shall constitute an overall rating of “less than good”. Any other rating shall be considered good, except that a fair rating shall indicate a need for improvement. An employee who has received a “less than good” rating should be counseled.
Section Fou	r. An employee may appeal any overall evaluation or evaluation category in which the rating was other than “good or better”. The evaluator bears the burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of said evaluation.
Section Fiv	e. The service rating form remains a negotiated document.
Article 11
Personnel Records
Section One. An employee's personnel file or “personnel record” is defined as that which is maintained at the agency level, exclusive of any other file or record, provided however, in certain agencies which do not maintain personnel files or records at the agency level, the defined file or record shall be that which is maintained at the institution level.
Section Two. An employee covered hereunder shall, on the employee's request, be permitted to examine and copy, at a cost of ten (10) cents per page, all materials in his/her personnel file, other than preemployment material or any other material that is confidential or privileged under law. The State employer reserves the right to require its designee to be present while such file is being inspected or copied. The Union may have access to any employee's records upon presentation of written
16
authorization by the appropriate employee. The Union and/or member has the right to take an inventory of the contents of the personnel file at any time.
Section Three. No new material derogatory to an employee shall be placed in the employee's personnel file unless the employee or the Union Steward has been afforded an opportunity to sign (indicating receipt of such material) and has received a copy of such material. Notices of proven or accepted discipline and stipulated resolutions thereof are recognized as records to be retained in the personnel file unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, and such agreement is incorporated as part of the terms of said stipulation.
Within thirty days of receipt an employee may file a written rebuttal to such derogatory materials or request that such material not subsequently merged in a service rating be VOIDED in the record. For purposes of this Section VOIDED SHALL BE DEFINED AS: 1) the document has been removed and placed in another non-personnel file, 2) no negative presumption can be drawn from the document, and 3) the document is not usable in the future as a reference or a document.
Section Four. This Article shall not be deemed to prohibit supervisors from maintaining written notes or records of employee's performance for the purpose of preparing service ratings. However, such notes or records shall not be admissible in any appeal unless the material has been included in the employee's personnel file in a manner consistent with this Section. The supervisor shall forewarn or notify the employee of any deficiency in advance of the preparation of service ratings or taking disciplinary action.
Section Five. When an employee seeks access to his/her personnel file, the Employer shall provide time off, charged as work time, to travel to the agency office to examine the file or have the file or copies of its contents transferred to the employee's work site for inspection in accordance with Section
17
Two, but not more than a total of twice per calendar year, except in conjunction with grievance processing, service rating review and/or merit promotional procedures.
Section Six. Requests for information contained within a Personnel File (“Record”) shall be complied with to the extent required under existing law (e.g. court order, Freedom of Information).
Article 12 Seniority
Section One	. (a) Seniority shall be defined as an employee's length of state service since date of last hire.
For part-time employees, seniority shall be pro-rated in accordance with the number of hours worked by the employee.
(b)	An employee's seniority shall accrue during the following periods:
(1)	War service (including service prior to State employment)
(2)	Military leave
(3)	Paid leave
(4)	Workers' Compensation
(5)	Unpaid sick leave, disability, family emergency due to illness, and authorized leaves of absence
(6)	Non-disability maternity leave of up to six
(6)	months
(7)	Layoff, to a maximum of twelve (12) months or the length of employee’s service, whichever is less; Union leave of any length; and/or sick leave bank time.
(c)	For purposes of vacation selection, Union stewards with permanent status shall be deemed to have the highest seniority in their agency.
Section Two	. Seniority shall not be computed until after completion of the initial Working Test Period.
18
Section Three. State service while working in a provisional or trainee position shall not accrue until permanent appointment, whereupon it shall be retroactively applied to include such service. This limitation shall not apply when the employee has achieved permanent status prior to appointment to the trainee position or on a provisional basis.
Section Four. Seniority shall be deemed broken by: (a) termination of employment caused by dismissal, (b) failure to report for five (5) working days without authorization unless the employee provides a valid reason for not notifying the agency or (c) any other termination not in good standing.
Credit will be granted to any employee with permanent status who is reemployed within one (1) year after termination in good standing, including reemployment from retirement.
Section Five. Seniority lists shall be maintained annually with September 1 the target date for completion of seniority lists.
Section Six. Seniority shall be the controlling factor for: (a) holiday staffing, (b) overtime, or (c) shift assignments providing the more senior employee is capable of doing the available work.
Section Seven. Seniority as defined above shall be utilized for the following purposes: (a) longevity, (b) length of vacation leave, and (c) vacation period selection. Effective July 1, 1984 and limited to leaves which begin on or after said date, longevity shall not include those leaves described in Section One(b)(5) and Section One(b)(6) supra. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all periods of state service shall count towards the determination of an employee's longevity entitlement.
Article 13
Order of layoff or reemployment
Section One. (a) A layoff is defined as the involuntary, non-disciplinary separation of an employee from State service because of lack of work or economic necessity.
19
(b) Employees who have not attained permanent status in the classification in which the layoff is to occur shall be removed before any permanent employee.
Section Two. (a) For the purpose of layoff selection, seniority shall be defined as accumulated service in the P-5 bargaining unit. If seniority of two (2) or more employees is exactly the same, the more senior employee shall be determined by considering: 1) total state service 2) time in classification; 3) a coin toss.
(b) The Employer may designate certain persons as “key persons” within the agency. A key person shall be deemed to have greater seniority than any other bargaining unit employee who would seek to displace him/her under the provisions of Article 13(3), following layoff from another agency. A “key person” shall be bypassed by the lateral displacer, who shall displace the next, more senior person in that title, if one exists.
A “key person” may not be retained over another, more senior, agency employee, nor may the privilege be asserted against an employee with super seniority, under the Article.
The agency shall resolve any conflict(s) caused by competing claims for employees with rights asserted under this section and Section (b), above. Agencies shall be entitled to the designation, based upon the following formula:
Agencies with fewer than 75 unit employees	2 key persons per year.
Agencies with fewer than 125 unit employees	3 key persons per year.
Agencies with 125 + unit employees	4 key persons per year.
No employee may be designated as “key” until that person shall have either one (1) year in the classification; or three (3) years in the job series.
The agency lists shall be forwarded, annually to the Union; no later than April 30, of each year. The list may be changed for
20
the next declaration period; but there shall be no right of substitution (during that contract year) unless the designee leaves the bargaining unit, or the employ of the agency.
The decision to designate or not, is deemed to be an exclusive managerial decision. No employee may grieve the Employer's decision to exercise said right; nor may an employee grieve the loss of designation as “key person”.
Section Three. No employee shall be laid off if any employee within the same class with less bargaining unit seniority is retained (subject to Section Two supra). This provision shall not apply to Union stewards who are deemed to have the highest seniority in their classification.
(a)	An employee whose position is to be eliminated who is not the least senior in his/her classification shall laterally displace the least senior employee in that classification in his/her agency who may then elect as follows:
(1)	To accept the layoff and exercise Section Six rights
(2)	To laterally displace the least senior employee in the classification statewide, or
(3)	To bump down within his/her agency pursuant to Subsection Five infra.
If the employee elects (3) above, that employee shall have an absolute right to the first agency vacancy in his/her former classification, in addition to and notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this article (See Section Six [e]).
(b)	Any employee displaced from his/her classification by exercise of Section Three (a) (2) or (3) supra shall exercise bumping rights as defined in Section Five, infra in the agency from which the original layoff occurs, if his/her employing agency cannot arrange to absorb the employee to be displaced.
Section Four. The State employer shall give an employee and the Union not less than one six (6) weeks written notice of layoff, stating the reason for such action. When practicable, additional advance notice shall be given. An employee shall have four (4) weeks from receipt of notification of layoff in
21
which to exercise bumping rights pursuant to Section Five, herein. The Commissioner of Administrative Services shall arrange to have the employee transferred to a vacancy in the same or comparable class or in any other position which, in the judgment of the State employer, the employee is qualified to fill within the department, agency or institution in which the employee works. If the employee refuses to accept the transfer, an eligible employee may exercise bumping rights as specified in Section Five.
(a)	The Employer shall attempt to provide training for employees who, but for the absence of certain identifiable skills, would be eligible for employment in currently vacant positions within the bargaining unit.
(b)	When addressing questions of position to be considered as comparable the comparability listing promulgated by the Department of Administrative (DAS) dated October 1995 shall be utilized. As new classifications are established or existing classifications are restructured, DAS shall identify the proper and appropriate comparability for these new/restructured classes using the same or similar criteria utilized for the October 1995 comparability tables.
Section Five. In lieu of layoff, an employee with more than two (2) years of continuous State service may bump into a lower class within the same classification series or a class declared comparable within the agency in which the layoff occurs, and shall bump the employee with the lowest bargaining unit seniority in such lower class subject to the provision of Section Two.
The bumper shall be paid for service in such lower class as provided in Regulation 5-239-2(f).
Section Six. Reemployment List. (a) The names of permanent employees who are eligible for reemployment shall be arranged on appropriate reemployment lists in order of seniority in the State service, and shall remain thereon for a period of three (3) years.
22
(b)	Employees shall be entitled to specify for placement on the reemployment list for any or all classes in which they formerly held permanent status or which are deemed comparable. In the event that an employee is appointed to a position from a reemployment list but such position is in a lower salary group than the class or classes for which his/her name is entered upon a reemployment list, he/she shall remain eligible for certification from the latter list.
(c)	An employee appointed from a reemployment list to a position in his/her former salary group will be appointed at the same step in such group as he/she held when he/she last worked in State service. An employee so appointed to a position in a lower salary group will be appointed at the same step in the salary group as he/she held when he/she last worked in State
service.
(d)	There shall be no appointment from outside State service until laid-off employees eligible for rehire and qualified for the position involved are offered reemployment.
(e)	Any employee who elects to accept another position in his/her former classification shall forfeit the absolute right described in Section Three (a)(3) of this Article.
(f)	For the purpose of layoff selection, it is understood that an employee in a training class is deemed to be an incumbent in his/her target class. This provision shall not alter the reemployment rights, if any, to which such individual is entitled by contract.
Section Sev	en. For the purposes of this Article, the Employment Security Division may, at the discretion of the Labor Commissioner, be excluded from the remainder of the Labor Department and deemed to be a separate agency.
Section Eig	ht. Impact of Contracting Out. (a) During the life of this Agreement, no full-time permanent employee will be laid off as a direct consequence of the exercise by the State employer of its right to contract out.
23
(b)	The State employer will be deemed in compliance with this Section if:
(1)	The employee is offered a transfer to the same or similar position which, in the Employer's judgment, he/she is qualified to perform, with no reduction in pay; or
(2)	The Employer offers to train an employee for a position, which reasonably appears to be suitable based on the employee's qualifications and skills. There shall be no reduction in pay during the training period.
(c)	Sunset Clause: The provisions of this Section expires automatically on the expiration date of this Agreement.
Article 14
Dismissal, Suspension, Demotion or Other Discipline
Section One. (a) No employee shall be suspended, demoted, or reprimanded except for just cause.
(b) No permanent employee in the classified service who has completed the Working Test Period and no unclassified employee who has completed six (6) months of service or the pre-tenure period, whichever is longer, shall be dismissed except for just cause.
Section Two. Grievances concerning dismissal, suspension or disciplinary demotion shall be submitted directly to Step II of the grievance procedure within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of official notification of such action. The fifteen (15) days referenced herein commence with receipt by the Union (Union representative) of a copy of the notification of discipline. In the event the notification is mailed to the Union, it shall be by certified mail. When feasible, the Union will provide the agency with a concurrent copy of the Step II filing. All other grievances shall be filed at Step I.
Section Three. The grievance procedure shall be the exclusive forum for resolving disputes over disciplinary action and will supersede any preexisting forums.
24
Section Four. Employer Conduct for Discipline. Whenever it becomes necessary to discipline an individual employee, the supervisor vested with said responsibility shall undertake said talks in a fashion calculated to apprise the employee of shortcomings, while avoiding embarrassment and public display.
Section Five. Placement of an employee on a paid leave of absence shall be governed by Regulation 5-240-5a to permit investigation. Provided, however, nothing shall preclude an employee from electing to be placed on an unpaid leave of absence for up to thirty (30) days. In such event, the employee may draw accrued vacation pay.
At the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the employee shall be either:
(1)	charged with the appropriate violation;
(2)	reinstated and reassigned to other duties determined appropriate by the appointing authority pending completion of the investigation; or
(3)	reinstated from leave.
Section Six. Interrogation. (a) An employee who is being interrogated concerning an incident or action which may subject him/her to disciplinary action shall be notified of his/her right to have a Union Steward or other representative present upon request, provided however, this provision shall not unreasonably delay completion of the interrogation. The interrogation shall not in any case be delayed beyond twelve (12) working hours irrespective of the ability of the Union to provide the required representation. However, no employee will be forced to appear on the day/shift of such notice. This provision shall be applicable to interrogation before, during or after the filing of a charge against an employee or notification to the employee of disciplinary action.
(b) No employee shall be compelled to offer oral or written evidence against himself/herself in any investigation or (pre)
25
disciplinary action. Statements by the employee in his/her own behalf shall constitute waiver of this protection.
Section Seven. Whenever practicable, the investigation, interrogation or discipline of employees shall be scheduled in a manner intended to conform with the employee's work schedule, with an intent to avoid overtime. When any employee is called to appear at any time beyond his/her normal work time and actually testifies, he/she shall be deemed to be actually working. This provision shall not apply to Union stewards. The applicability of this Section to employees on unscheduled work weeks shall be a subject of continuing discussion at local unit levels by the appropriate Labor Management Committees.
Section Eight. C.G.S. Section 5-240 and the regulations appurtenant thereto in effect on January 1, 1994 are hereby incorporated by reference.
Article 15
Grievance Procedure
Section One. Definition. Grievance. A grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint involving an alleged violation or a dispute involving the application or interpretation of a specific provision of this Agreement.
Section Two. Grievances shall be filed on mutually agreed forms which specify: (a) the facts, (b) the issue, (c) the date of the violation alleged, (d) the specific controlling contract provision, and (e) the remedy or relief sought. Any grievance may be amended up to and including Step II of the grievance procedure so long as the factual basis of the complaint is not materially altered.
Section Three. Grievant. A Union representative, with or without the aggrieved employee, may submit a grievance, and the Union may in appropriate cases submit an “institutional” or “general” grievance in its own behalf. When individual employee(s) or group of employees elect(s) to submit a grievance without Union	representation, the Union's
representative or steward shall be notified of the pending grievance, shall be provided a copy thereof, and shall have the 26
right to be present at any discussion of the grievance, except that if the employee does not wish to have the steward present, the steward shall not attend the meeting but shall be provided with a copy of the written response to the grievance. The steward shall be entitled to receive from the Employer all documents pertinent to the disposition of the grievance and to file statements of position.
Section Four. Informal Resolutions. The grievance procedure outlined herein is designed to facilitate resolution of disputes at the lowest possible level of the procedure. It is therefore urged that the parties attempt informal resolution of all disputes and to avoid the formal procedures.
Section Five. A grievance shall be deemed waived unless submitted at Step I within thirty (30) days from the date of the cause of the grievance or within (30) days from the date the grievant or any Union representative or steward knew or through reasonable diligence should have known of the cause of the
grievance.
(a)	In an arbitration proceeding developing from Article 4, the arbitrator's remedy shall be limited to a “cease and desist” order or comparable corrective action.
Section Six. The Grievance Procedure.
Step I. Agency Head or Designee. A grievance shall be submitted to the Agency Head or designee. A meeting with the Union representative and/or grievant shall be held within ten (10) days of receipt of the grievance and a written response shall be issued within ten (10) days thereafter.
Step II. The Office of Labor Relations. The parties acknowledge that orderly administration of the contract grievance procedure requires the Director of Labor Relations to play an active role in the contract grievance procedure. Accordingly, no grievance shall be deemed ripe for submission to arbitration unless and until the Director of Labor Relations has had an opportunity to resolve the grievance. An unresolved
27
grievance may be appealed to the Director of Labor Relations within twenty (20) days of the date of the Step I response. Said Director may hold a conference within sixty (60) days of receipt of the grievance and issue a written response within fifteen (15) days of the conference.
Step III Arbitration. Within ten (10) working days after the State’s answer is due at Step II or if no conference is held within sixty (60) days, within ten (10) working days after the expiration of the sixty (60) day period, an unresolved grievance may be submitted to arbitration by the Union or by the State, but not by an individual employee(s) except that individual employees may submit to arbitration in cases of dismissal, demotion or suspension of not less than five working days.
Section Seven. For the purpose of the time limits hereunder, “day” means calendar day unless otherwise specified. The parties by mutual agreement may extend time limits. The State Employer may waive Step I by notifying the steward and/or notifying the Union Office.
Section Eight. In the event that the State Employer fails to answer a grievance within the time specified, the grievance may be processed to the next higher level and the same time limits therefore shall apply as if the State Employer's answer had been filed timely on that last day.
The grievant assents to the last attempted resolution by failing timely to appeal timely said decision or by accepting said decision in writing.
Section Nine. Arbitration. (a) The parties shall agree on an expanded arbitration panel of five (5) arbitrators from which a specific arbitrator shall be selected on a rotational basis. Each party retains the right, following three (3) case experiences to strike any particular arbitrator from the panel. In such case, a replacement arbitrator shall be jointly agreed upon to replace each rejected arbitrator. Submission to arbitration shall be by letter, postage prepaid, addressed to the Director of Labor
28
Relations. The submission shall specify that the arbitrator must be available to schedule the beginning hearing within twenty (20) days of his/her appointment.
The expenses for the arbitrator's service and for the hearing shall be shared equally by the State and the Union, or in dismissal or suspension cases when the Union is not a party one-half the cost shall be borne by the State and the other half by the party submitting to arbitration.
On grievances when the question of arbitrability has been raised by either party as an issue prior to the actual appointment of an arbitrator a separate arbitrator shall be appointed at the request of either party to determine the issue of arbitrability. Cases involving discharges, transfers, layoffs, or actions in which delay might render any remedy moot shall be given preferential scheduling.
(b)	The arbitration hearing shall not follow the formal rules of evidence unless the parties agree in advance, with the concurrence of the arbitrator at or prior to the time of his/her appointment.
In cases of dismissals, demotions or suspension in excess of five (5) days, the parties may request the arbitrator to maintain a cassette recording of the hearing testimony. Costs of transcription shall be borne by the requesting party. A party requesting a stenographic transcript shall arrange for the stenographer and pay the costs thereof.
The State will continue its practice of paid leave time for witnesses of either party.
(c)	The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, alter, or modify this Agreement, nor to grant to either party matters which were not obtained in the bargaining process, nor to impose any remedy or right of relief for any period of time prior to the effective date of the Agreement, nor to grant pay retroactively for more than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date a grievance was submitted at Step I. The arbitrator shall
29
render his/her decision in writing no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, unless the parties jointly agree otherwise.
The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on the parties in accordance with C. G. S. Section 52-418, provided, however, neither the submission of questions of arbitrability to any arbitrator in the first instance nor any voluntary submission shall be deemed to diminish the scope of judicial review over arbitral awards, including awards on competent jurisdiction to construe any such award as contravening the public interest.
Late Arbitration Awards. On those cases in which an arbitrator fails, without permission of the parties, to render a decision within the contractual time limits:
(a)	The award shall be void.
(b)	The arbitrator shall be dropped from the panel.
(c)	The arbitrator shall not be paid.
Expedited Arbitration. Expedited arbitration shall be available in those cases where time based issues are critical and for other grievances where the parties agree that such speedier process is mutually advantageous.
The procedure for said grievances shall be as follows:
(1)	Grievance files at Step II within ten (10) days of notice of the action.
(2)	Step II conference within ten (10) work days of receipt.
(3)	Employer response within three (3) work days of conference.
(4)	Claim for arbitration to be filed within seven (7) work days of receipt of the Step II response.
(5)	Arbitration to be scheduled within twenty (20) work days of claim.
(6)	Arbitration decision may be issued as bench decision, by mutual agreement of the parties, but in all cases the award will be issued within ten (10) days of the close of the hearing.
30
All deadlines specified in this section may be waived by mutual, written consent of the parties. It is recognized that in scheduling an expedited arbitration, a regular grievance scheduled for arbitration may be replaced by the expedited grievance with mutual agreement of the parties. Furthermore, it is recognized that the failure to meet the appeal time frames established for the Union to move the grievance forward serves as removal of the grievance from expedited status to regular grievance status.
Section Ten. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following matters shall be subject to the grievance procedure but not to arbitration:
(1)	compliance with health and safety standards covered by CONN OSHA:
(2)	disputes over claimed unlawful discrimination shall be subject to the grievance procedure but shall not be arbitrable if a complaint is filed with the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities arising from the same common nucleus of operative fact.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following matters shall not be subject to either the grievance procedure or arbitration:
(1)	dismissal of non-permanent employees.
(2)	the decision to make a layoff and non-disciplinary termination of employees.
Section Eleven. (a) The existing procedures for handling appeal of rejection from admission to examination and disputes over reclassification shall remain in force, except that the final step of the reclassification procedure shall be the same as the final step in the appeal of rejection from admission to examination, with the decision to be rendered within forty-five (45) days.
(b) The Union shall be entitled to have a representative attend all deliberations of the reclassification panel and to offer input during the said deliberations.
31
Section Twelve: Conferences and Hearings. All Step II Conferences, Arbitrations, Facilitations and grievance related meetings shall be closed to the press and the public, unless the parties jointly agree to the contrary.
Article 16
Hours of Work
Section One. (a) The standard workweek for all full-time employees shall be forty (40) hours, normally Monday through Friday, eight (8) hours per day between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
The establishment or disestablishment of non-standard workweeks or schedules shall be made only to meet changing agency operation needs and only after advance approval by the Office of Labor Relations, and prior negotiation with the Union and not less than two (2) weeks advance notice to affected employees, except when:
(1)	The standard workweek is being established; or,
(2)	An emergency situation exists. For such exception, notification and/or consultation shall be made as soon as practicable. As soon as the emergency is alleviated, the employee shall revert to his/her regular schedule.
(b) Employees' request for compressed work schedules (including a four (4) day work week) may be implemented when the following conditions prevail:
(1)	The employee initiates said request along with supportive justification.
(2)	Such a request is compatible with agency operating needs.
(3)	Such a request receives the review and approval of the Agency Head.
(4)	The Agency Head shall forward said endorsement to the Office of Labor Relations and it shall be treated as a request for a non-standard work week.
(5)	Disputes hereunder are neither grievable nor arbitrable.
32
Section Two. For the purpose of determining hours of work, a duty station shall be defined as the State-owned or leased building, or other locations at which an employee reports for duty. An employee's work day shall begin at the duty station except as outlined below.
(a)	For designated field employees, the duty station shall be defined as the first business call. However, if the first or last business call is more than thirty (30) minutes from home (if by personal vehicle), pickup point (if by State vehicle) or hotel/motel (if traveling outside of the State on State business), the excess over thirty (30) minutes shall be considered as time worked. Provided, however, if the employee resides outside of the State of Connecticut, the standard work day will be measured from the State line when conducting field assignments in Connecticut or passing through Connecticut on field assignments. Such employee conducting field assignments in his/her State of residence will use his/her personal residence as the point of reference for measuring the thirty (30) minute time period above. Provided, however, designated field employees who conduct field assignments in other States will use the hotel/motel in which they stayed the night prior to the call as the point of reference for measuring the thirty (30) minute time period above. The out of State lunch reimbursement policy shall not apply to designated field employees living out-of-state who perform field assignments in their State of residence and/or in Connecticut. Meal reimbursement shall apply for all field assignments outside of Connecticut and outside the individual's State of residence.
(b)	For designated office employees whose duty station is periodically rotated to meet agency operating needs, said provision (a) shall be equally applicable, except that the facility to which the employee is assigned shall be considered as the first (and last) business call.
Any such employee whose duty station is changed shall be given a minimum of two (2) weeks advance notice of such change except in unusual circumstances.
33
Section Thr	ee. Meal Periods. Meal periods shall be scheduled close to the middle of a shift consistent with the operating needs of the agency. Airport Managers assigned by the appointing authority to be on call during the meal break shall be paid for such meal breaks.
Section Fou	r. Rest Periods. Unless precluded by existing agency policy and subject to the operating needs of any agency, employees will be scheduled to receive a fifteen (15) minute rest period in each half shift.
Section Fiv	e. Overtime. (a) The provisions of this Section shall be interpreted consistent with C.G.S. Section 5-245 except when specifically provided otherwise.
(b)	(1) Time and one half shall be paid for all hours in excess of forty (40), except as may otherwise be provided in Article 16A, or C.G.S. Section 5-245 for employees on approved rotating shifts, unscheduled positions or classes, and averaging schedules.
(2)	Employees shall continue to be paid overtime consistent with this Agreement, although the parties recognize the statutory obligation that eligible employees be paid overtime in compliance with the provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
After the payment of overtime in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement (see generally, this Article), an employee's additional FLSA payment, if any, shall be computed according to the rules set forth in the FLSA (29, CFR Part 778 et seq). In determining whether said employee is eligible for FLSA overtime payment, only “hours worked” as defined in the Act shall be counted. Furthermore, the FLSA liability shall be offset by the amount of overtime payments already paid to said employee in accordance with this Agreement and existing practice, for that FLSA work period.
(c)	Call Back Pay. Employees who have left work after the end of their scheduled work shift and who are called back to work or called to perform business related tasks, shall receive a
34
minimum of four (4) hours of overtime, including portal-to-portal travel, if applicable. This provision shall not apply to employees who are called in early prior to their regular starting time and work through their regular shift.
(d)	Exempt Employees. (1) Except as may otherwise be provided by specific terms of this Agreement, C.G.S. Section 5-245(b)(1) shall be deemed to exempt from overtime payment all employees being paid above Salary Grade 24, and those unclassified positions which on June 30, 1977 were deemed exempt positions. Subject to the operating needs of the agency:
(2)	Exempt employees who are required by the State to attend regular and recurrent evening meetings or otherwise to be called out regularly and recurrently to perform work outside the regular scheduled workweek shall be authorized to work a flexible work schedule or to receive compensatory time off, and;
(3)	Exempt employees who are required by the State to perform extended service outside the normal workweek to complete a project or for other State purpose shall be authorized to receive compensatory time off.
(4)	In no event shall such compensatory time be deemed to accrue in any matter or be the basis for compensation upon termination of employment.
(5)	Employees who are consistently denied compensatory time off under Subsection 1 or 2 may grieve up to but not beyond the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The Commissioner may direct the granting of the compensatory time or request that the Office of Policy and Management authorize payment of such compensatory time in lieu of time off. The employee will either receive compensatory time off or payment.
(6)	In cases of national or State emergency or where prior approval has been given by the Office of Policy and Management, exempt employees may be paid overtime
35
consistent with this Article. This paragraph is not intended to preempt or nullify any existing provisions which vary the exemption rules.
(e)	Overtime pay shall not be pyramided. When practicable, overtime checks shall be paid no later than the second payroll period following the overtime worked.
(f)	Employees assigned to work out of state shall be compensated at the same rate of compensation as would be applicable if the work was performed in the state.
Employees assigned to travel out of state as part of a regular work assignment, shall be compensated for the actual time spent in such travel.
(g)	Each organization unit of a State agency shall establish a volunteer overtime list. An employee may remove/add his/her name from/to the list with two (2) weeks notice. In the event no volunteer is available, the State has the right to require overtime when practicable. Overtime equalization shall be practiced consistent with agency operating needs. An employee who has not volunteered for overtime shall not be penalized for such refusal. The State shall designate job titles where mandatory paid overtime can be required. There shall be no compensatory time for employees eligible to receive overtime pay.
Section Six. When the employee is late for work due to inclement weather, hazardous driving conditions, or mass transportation failures, the employee shall not be charged for such lateness provided that he/she arrives at work within an hour of the start of the shift. In exceptional circumstances, up to 21/2 hours may be excused without charge to the employee's leave balances if the severity of conditions so warrants. In assessing whether or not to excuse lateness in excess of an hour, consideration will be given to the time the employee arrives at work when compared to other employees traveling to work under similar circumstances.
Failure to excuse lateness of up to 2-1/2 hours shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this
36
Agreement. In any arbitration of a dispute under this Section, unless the Employer can be shown to have acted arbitrarily and capriciously, the arbitrator shall give substantial weight to the judgment of the Employer.
In those cases in which either the additional 1-1/2 hours are not credited to the employee, or the lateness exceeds 2-1/2 hours, said employee may opt to either make up said time or charge said excess time to accrued leave.
Section Seven. Consistent with C.G.S. Section 5-248c and the regulations promulgated there under, a permanent employee may submit a request to the appointing authority for a voluntary schedule reduction. The appointing authority shall promptly review such request and notify the employee of the approval or denial of the request. The approval or denial of such request is neither grievable nor arbitrable.
Article 16 A
Alternative Work Schedules
Section One. The State shall continue to implement and operate for employees in all agencies, AWS schedules; the degree of employee free choice and band-width may vary from agency to agency or subunit to subunit, but the preference shall be for maximum employee free choice where feasible. Any bargaining unit employee not otherwise exempted by agreement, or by action of the employer as set forth below, may participate in the available options.
Employees whose salaries are currently below the (Article 16, Section 5 [d]) Overtime Cap may nevertheless participate in pure flextime, averaging and compressed workweek options to the same degree as those above the cap. Any such employee who voluntarily chooses such a schedule option, shall be allowed to work up to eighty (80) hours in any pay period before qualifying for paid overtime. This provision shall supersede relevant statutes in accordance with the provisions of the State Employee Relations Act, C.G.S. Section 5-278b.
37
(a)	Each State Agency will have established a menu of alternative work schedule options. The menu of options shall be available to full-time permanent employees. Said menu may include the following:
1.	unrestricted daily starting/quitting time; around a core hour structure.
2.	5/4 or 4/5 bi-weekly.
3.	weekly variable starting and quitting time.
Agencies may be exempt from offering alternative schedules based on business needs. In requesting such exemption the agency must provide its justification to the Office of Labor Relations, who shall in turn inform the Union of its determination concerning the exemption. Upon request from the Union, through the Office of Labor Relations, the parties shall meet and discuss the exemption.
(b)	Assignment to any variation of the standard workweek, is not considered an alternative work schedule.
(c)	There shall be an AWS Facilitator, who shall be knowledgeable in flexible schedule issues. The Facilitator shall be available to resolve such matters as are set forth hereafter. The State and the Union shall share equally the Facilitator’s expenses.
(d)	Each agency shall maintain an AWS Committee of an equal number of representatives of the Union and the Agency. The Committee shall review and vote upon all new and/or revised, AWS programs and offerings. No dispute shall be deemed ripe for arbitration until the Committee has reviewed same; or has failed to meet within fifteen [15] days of notice of a pending dispute.
Section Two	. Employees shall submit quarterly the schedule from the menu of options that the employee wishes to be working for the following quarter. The submittal will be to the employee’s supervisor (non-bargaining unit). The grant
38
or denial of this submitted schedule will be based on business needs. Staffing compliments required during a workday are to be determined solely by management.
Section Thr	ee. Reduction and/or Elimination
Except as otherwise provided herein, the employee and the Union must receive not less than ten (10) days notice of an Agency’s intent to modify, suspend, or discontinue any alternative work schedule. Agencies may reduce, or eliminate alternative work schedules based upon written supportive factual evidence of one or more of the following:
(a)	increased cost or unduly burdensome
(b)	inconvenience or decrease in service to the public

Section Five. Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the State from instituting a class reevaluation on its own initiative after prior consultation by the Union. The Union shall be given two (2) weeks notice prior to a class reevaluation. The State's decision shall be final unless the Union can meet its burden under Section Three above.
Article 28
Temporary Service in a Higher Classification
Section One. Temporary Service in a Higher Classification is defined as the assignment by an appointing authority to perform service in a higher classification when there is a bona fide vacancy which management has decided to fill temporarily rather than permanently, or when an employee is on extended absence due to illness, leave of absence or other reasons, provided such assignment is approved by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Extended absence is one which is expected to last more than thirty (30) consecutive working days.
Section Two. (a) An employee who is assigned to perform temporary service in a higher class shall, commencing with the thirty-first (31) consecutive working day, be paid for such actual work, retroactive to the first day of such service, at the rate of the higher class as if promoted thereto.
(b)	An appointing authority making a temporary assignment to a higher class shall issue the employee written notification of the assignment and shall immediately forward the appropriate form along with a copy of the written notification seeking approval of the assignment from the Commissioner of Administrative Services in writing. The form certifying the
66
assignment shall specify the rights and obligations of the parties under Section Two (c) and (d).
(c)	If, by the thirty-first consecutive working day, the assignment has not been approved, the appointing authority shall immediately reassign the employee to his/her former duties and compensate the employee for assigned service pursuant to Section Two. No appeal rights shall accrue in this instance.
(d)	In the event the Commissioner of Administrative Services disapproves the requested assignment on the basis of his/her judgment that the assignment does not constitute temporary service in a higher class, the employee may continue working as assigned with recourse under the appeal procedure for reclassification but not under the grievance or arbitration procedure, or may request reassignment. If reassignment is denied by the appointing authority, the employee may appeal such action as outlined above. If reassignment is granted, no appeal rights shall accrue. In those cases in which an employee makes separate claims for reclassification and temporary service coverage, the employee shall be entitled to back pay, if successful, retroactive to the earliest contractual date permitted by either procedure (as if the cases had been jointly filed).
Article 29
Out of Title Work
Section One. Working out-of-title shall be defined as the temporary assignment by an appointing authority to perform duties not within any existing job classification for a period which exceeds ninety (90) days, provided such assignment is approved by the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Said assignment, in order to qualify for treatment hereunder, shall meet the conditions outlined herein.
Section Two. In determining out-of-title work hereunder, the employee shall not be entitled to coverage of this section if: (a) The duties alleged to be out of title are:
(1)	Normally performed by employees in the grievant’s title and are not described in another title; or
67
(2)	reasonably related to the class specifications for the grievant’s title; or
(3)	new duties which are a reasonable outgrowth of duties assigned to the grievant’s class.
(b) The grievance or complaint is more appropriately addressed by use of the procedures providing for
(1)	class reevaluation
(2)	temporary service in a higher classification
(3)	reclassification grievances.
Section Three. The appointing authority making such assignment shall immediately issue to the employee a written notification of such assignment and concurrently submit a request seeking approval of the establishment of a temporary new class in accordance with the following:
(a)	Requests must give complete justification for both need to fill position immediately and for establishment of the class. Such requests shall include therewith a completed duties questionnaire and a copy of the written notification to the employee. An outline of the proposed specification listing typical duties, experience and training requirements and suggested minimum qualifications must be enclosed. Salary determination for temporary class title will be subject to evaluation by the Personnel Division and to the Commissioner of Administrative Services and Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management approval of new classes.
(b)	(1) The Commissioner of Administrative Services will notify Agency Head of the temporary class title and salary group and will request submission of appropriate forms to establish the position. Appointments may be made after approval. Appointments to temporary classes are temporary and normally will not exceed ninety (90) days. Extension of an additional ninety (90) days may be required to complete the evaluative and approval process.
(2)	In the event the assignment is approved the Commissioner of Administrative Services, the employee shall be 68
compensated for the performance of duties retroactive to the thirty-first working day of service.
(3)	If the Commissioner of Administrative Services has not approved the assignment within two (2) months of receipt of the request, or in the event the Commissioner of Administrative Services disapproves the request on the basis that in his/her judgment the assignment does not constitute working out-oftitle, the employee shall have recourse for appeal of such action under the appeal procedure for reclassification, but not under the grievance or arbitration procedure.
Section Four. Upon notification that the Commissioner of Administrative Services and the Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management have established a permanent class, the following procedure should be followed:
(a)	As soon as notification is received that the Commissioner of Administrative Services and Secretary of the Office of Policy and Management have approved the establishment of a permanent class to replace a temporary class title, appropriate forms requesting the establishment of a new position with the approved permanent title and canceling the temporary class title should be submitted. The effective date should be the date of establishment of the class.
(b)	After receipt of approval, appropriate transactions transferring the employee from temporary to provisional status and requests to start the examining process should be submitted.
Article 30 Transfers
Section One. Transfer is the movement of an employee within job classification, (or class declared comparable by the Commissioner of Administrative Services) from one geographic location or operational (work) unit to another geographic location or operational (work) unit. The geographical relocation of an operational (work) unit is not considered a transfer.
69
Section Two. Transfers Within an Agency. Permanent and temporary (less than six (6) months) transfers within an agency may be made when the appointing authority determines the good of the service will be served, and shall be in accordance with the following:
(a)	An employee requesting a transfer shall submit a written request to his/her immediate supervisor, who shall immediately forward it, with any comments and recommendations, to the appointing authority or designee.

Transfer request will be kept on file for eighteen (18) months unless withdrawn or extended in writing by the employee.
(b)	When a transfer is to be made, the agency designee will review requests of eligible employees. Of those individuals who are equally qualified, preferences will be given to the employee with the greatest seniority. For purposes of transfers, seniority as defined in Article 12 shall be utilized.

(a)	An employee requesting transfer shall submit a written request, through his/her immediate supervisor and appointing authority, to the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Requests for transfers will not be denied by the appointing authority unreasonably, or unless an employee has transferred within the past six (6) months.
(b)	When a vacancy is to be filled from an open competitive list, the Commissioner of Administrative Services will forward the names of eligible employees on the transfer list, ranked in order of seniority within the class, along with the certification 70
from the appropriate examination list. Stewards shall not be deemed to have super-seniority for purposes for inter-agency transfer. The appointing authority, before making an open competitive appointment, shall consider one (1) or more individuals on the transfer list.
(c)	(1) An employee who voluntarily transfers to another agency may request a return to his/her former position within three (3) weeks following transfer.
(2)	The Agency [which has received the transferee] shall have six (6) weeks to evaluate the transferee, and may elect to return the employee to the agency from which he/she transferred. This election shall be without documentary comment by the agency, and the permanent records will be limited to a notation that the employee was “returned by agreement”
(3)	A transferee returned to his/her original agency under Subsections (1) or (2) above, must be returned to the previous position or a comparable position (in the original agency) without any loss of pay or benefits.
(4)	The returning employee will remain in the Agency to which he/she transferred until the original Agency has approval from the Office of Policy and Management to refill the position. The original Agency will process the appropriate paperwork immediately. In no event shall such potential delay affect the employee’s right to return to a position in the original Agency or the Agency’s right to return the employee. The actual transfer date shall always be effective the first day of a payroll period.
Section Four. No employee shall be involuntarily transferred except within the agency. Before any involuntary transfer, volunteers shall be solicited from those qualified, and if no volunteers are available, the least senior employee in the class who is qualified for said position shall be transferred.
71
Section Five. Nothing herein shall restrict the appointing authority’s right to fill vacancies by any means other than voluntary transfer.
Section Six. The Employer will not transfer an employee for disciplinary purposes. In any case in which the employee alleges that said transfer was disciplinary, expedited arbitration shall be appropriate. This provision shall not apply in cases where there is a combining or transfer of functions from one department to another or from one location to another.
When a grievance has been filed hereunder, all action shall be stayed until the question of whether the transfer is for disciplinary purposes has been considered by the arbitrator.
Section Sev	en. Transfer shall not affect the accumulation of an employee’s benefits or seniority provided herein.
Section Eig	ht. Except as provided herein, no employee who has been transferred shall be required to serve a new Working Test Period if such Working Test Period has been satisfactorily completed in the position transferred from.
Section Nin	e. Except as provided herein, the rules, regulations and practices shall remain in force.
Section Ten. Legislative Merger/Consolidation of Agency Functions. (a) In a case where an identifiable division of any agency is relocated to another agency, the employees thereof shall be similarly relocated without any loss of compensation or benefits. The parties shall, within thirty (30) days following implementation negotiate the impact of such relocated employees.
(b) In those cases where only a segment of an agency function is transferred to another agency, volunteers will be solicited from those in each affected job classification. In the absence of sufficient volunteers, the least senior employee(s) shall be transferred from such segment in each affected job classification. In those cases wherein there are more volunteers
72
than are necessary, employees within the affected segment shall have right of first refusal, and thereafter vacancies shall be filled by seniority.

Section Four. The State shall continue to offer training programs, which are aimed at skills development and improvement in order to afford employees greater opportunity for performance improvement and promotional growth. When such programs are available to a group of employees, the selection of the employee(s) to be trained shall be predicated on the needs of the State, the potential of the employee to benefit and contribute to the operational program, and with due regard to the principle of fair opportunity for all eligible and qualified employees within the group. Seniority (but not steward seniority) shall be a factor in the selection process. Where practicable, volunteers will be solicited for training opportunities.
Section Five. (a) Professional leave is defined as leave to attend seminars, classes, lectures, workshops, conventions, or other related activities in aid of the development, maintenance or
73
exchange of professional skills, techniques or experiences which clearly relate to an employee's primary job assignment or logical career progression.
(b)	The Employer recognizes that certain benefits accrue to both the State and the employee through participation in professional leave and will support such leave consistent with agency operating needs and budgetary constraints.
(c)	Employees may request and, subject to the conditions outlined herein, shall be granted up to ten (10) days leave with pay per contract term for professional development.

(2)	No overtime or expenses other than time off without loss of regular day's pay will accrue to the State.
(3)	Professional leave, if not used in any contract year, shall be neither accruable nor payable.

Upon final and non-appealable decision by appropriate State authority that an employee is entitled to receive workers' compensation benefits, said employee shall receive his/her first payment no later than four (4) weeks following such determination. Accrued leave time may be used to supplement workers' compensation payments up to but not beyond the regular salary.
Section Two. Regular paychecks will be available for distribution at the agency by 3:00 p.m. on alternate Thursdays.
Article 37

Additionally, any such employee who is ordered to active duty as a result of an unscheduled emergency (natural disaster or civil disorder) shall be entitled to military leave with pay not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days in a calendar year. During such leave, the employee’s position shall be held, and the employee shall be credited with such time for seniority purposes. Other requests for military leave may be approved without pay. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent an employee from attending ordered military training while on regularly scheduled vacation.
Section Seven. Hazardous Duty. The Union, and not any individual employee, shall upon request be granted a hearing by the Office of Labor Relations concerning a claim for hazardous or unpleasant duty pay differential. Disputes under this section shall not be subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Article.

Section Twel	ve. Except where a greater benefit currently exists, all leave accrual and deduction shall be recorded on an hour-for-hour basis.
Section Thir	teen. Whenever the word spouse is referred to (husband/wife) in this Agreement, it shall also mean domestic partner. A domestic partner is a person who has qualified for

Dinner	$4.00
Section Two. Housing. The Employer reserves the right to select among applicants for housing, and to terminate occupancy in accordance with State Housing Regulations.

The Employer shall not remove an employee from housing or refuse to consider an application for housing as a form of discipline for matters unrelated to housing, but this provision shall not restrict the Employer's right to remove from housing an employee whose employment is terminated.
The Employer shall have the right to establish rental rates for employees in State-owned Housing.

82
Article 40 Entire Agreement
This Agreement, upon ratification, supersedes and cancels all prior practices and Agreements whether written or oral unless expressly stated to the contrary herein, and constitutes the complete and entire Agreement between the parties and concludes collective bargaining for its term.
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understanding and agreement arrived at by the parties after exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, the State and the Union, for the duration of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter whether or not referred to or covered in this Agreement, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Agreement. The parties agree, however, that the duty to bargain to the extent required by law over the decision to terminate or amend regulations, general letters, administrative directives, and agency rules or orders, reduced to writing and uniformly applied to employees since July 1, 1977, which are mandatory subjects of bargaining and which are herein incorporated by reference, shall be neither waived nor diminished except as indicated otherwise herein.
Article 41 Supersedence
The inclusion of language in this Agreement concerning matters formerly governed by law, regulation, or policy directive shall not be deemed a preemption of the entire subject matter. Accordingly, statutes, rules, regulations and administrative
83
directives or orders shall not be construed to be superseded by any provision of this Agreement except as provided in the Supersedence Appendix to this Agreement or where by necessary implication, no other construction is tenable.
Article 42
Legislative Action
The cost items contained in this Agreement and the provisions of this Agreement which supersede preexisting statutes shall become effective in accordance with the procedures in C.G.S. Section 5-278. If the Legislature rejects the Agreement, the parties shall return to the bargaining table.
Article 43
Savings Clause
Should any provision of this Agreement be found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in force.
Article 44
Duration of Agreement
This Agreement shall be effective on July 1, 2003 and shall expire on June 30, 2007.
The parties acknowledge that the resolution of this Agreement resolves and discharges all other claims which from the Contract reopener provisions of their predecessor Agreement.
Unless otherwise stated to the contrary changes to language provisions shall take effect upon Legislative Approval.
Negotiations for the successor to this Agreement shall commence with the timetable established under the C.G.S. Section 5-276a(a). The request to commence negotiations shall be in writing, sent certified mail, by the requesting party to the other party. The provisions of C.G.S. Section 5-270, et seq., and the regulations thereto notwithstanding, the next window period for this bargaining unit shall be no earlier than August 2006.
84
Article 45 Temperature Variation
Contingent upon the employer’s ability to restore the temperature to the prescribed guidelines, the agency shall release or reassign/relocate affected employees. If released, it shall be without loss of pay or benefits.
Memorandum of Understanding - I
The parties agree to meet and discuss as a subject of the Labor Management Committee the adequacy of parking facilities, security provided by the State, appropriate notice to the employees in the event of parking dislocation, and any need for additional parking facilities or security. No charge shall be imposed for parking facilities presently provided without charge and no existing charge for parking facilities shall be increased or decreased without negotiations.
Employees who are required to transport large quantities of cash, securities or other negotiable instruments from one building to another shall be provided with adequate security.
Memorandum of Understanding- II
Section One. Reclassification Appeal Procedure. An appeal panel shall be appointed consisting of two (2) Human Resource professionals from separate agencies, appointed by the Commissioner of Administrative Services and two (2) Union representatives experienced in job classification, appointed by the Union. The Commissioner shall designate the chairperson for the panel. The panel shall, at all times, consist of four (4) members and report on the appeal within sixty (60) calendar days from the date the appeal was received in the Office of the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Continuances or changes in scheduled hearings shall be granted by the panel chairperson only for good cause, but must be rescheduled within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the originally scheduled hearing. Hearings will ordinarily be open to the public. However, they may be closed or witnesses sequestered
85
at the discretion of the panel. The panel chairperson may exclude any person who engages in improper conduct. No formal transcripts or stenographic records of proceedings shall be required. Technical rules of evidence shall not prevail. The panel may not grant any remedy other than the specific remedy requested in the grievance filed at Step I or as modified by mutual agreement of the parties concerned and may not add to, subtract from, alter or modify bargaining agreement or grant either party matters which were not obtained in the bargaining process. The chairperson shall authorize paid leave for a reasonable number of witnesses including the grievant and Union representative as necessary. Management may be represented by either the appointing authority (or designee), the Commissioner of Administrative Services designee(s) or both. The burden of proof shall be on the employee to show that management’s denial of the reclassification was arbitrary or unreasonable.
Section Two. The Panel shall hear and decide and report in writing within forty-five (45) days of communication to the Commissioner of Administrative Services. The decision may be any of the following.
(a)	The appeal is sustained and reclassification to the position in the classification requested is recommended.
(b)	The appeal is sustained and payment for service in the higher class is authorized, consistent with Section Four, but reclassification is not recommended because:
(1)	existing examination or employment list conditions do not permit appointment;
(2)	the organizational structure and/or staffing conditions do not support the additional position;
(3)	of other reason (state reason).
(c)	The appeal is denied.
86
Section Three. In any finding referred to in Section Two (b) above, the panel must issue a cease and desist order, or may order back payment as a remedy if deemed appropriate consistent with this Article.
Section Four. An employee whose appeal is sustained shall be eligible for payment in the higher class beginning with the thirty-first (31) working day from the date which the panel finds the employee began working in the higher class. In no case may this latter day be earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the submission of the grievance at Step I.
Section Five. Panel Action. The decision of the panel shall be in writing and shall be signed by the panel chairperson. Such decision shall include a brief statement of the findings of fact and agenda supporting the decision of the panel. The original grievance, along with all documents, evidence, and other written data relating to the case shall be filed with the Commissioner of Administrative Services. Copies of the decision only shall be forwarded to the Union representative (or grievant), the appointing authority and any other party deemed by the panel to be entitled to such copy. The decision of the panel shall be binding on all parties.
Section Six. The existing procedures for reclassification grievances shall be continued in effect unless clarified or superseded herein.
Memorandum of Understanding- III Holiday Party/Picnic
For the life of this Agreement, employees of the A&R bargaining unit will continue to be eligible to receive one-half day off with pay to attend one (1) annual picnic and one (1) holiday party. Said picnic and holiday party must be sponsored by the A&R Union or the employing agency of the employee.
Memorandum of Understanding - IV
Meal Grievance Arbitration
The parties agree that the intent of the arbitrator in the above cited case was to extend the meal related reimbursement to an employee based upon the following:
87
(a)	the reimbursement should be for the actual meal taken, if during the overtime period, or;
(b)	if no meal is in fact taken, then reimbursement shall be for (1) the meal missed during the shift, or if (1) is not applicable, then (2) the meal period closest to the end of the shift.
Memorandum of Understanding- V
Effective March 29, 1989, trainees and preprofessional trainees who satisfactorily complete the training program will be promoted effective the date corresponding with such completed training and on the anniversary date of appointment to the training program.
Memorandum of Understanding-VI
The parties herein express the mutual recognition of service rating (performance appraisal) intent and purpose.
The mechanism utilized to evaluate employee performance is intended to be a module for development and improvement of the individual being appraised. This purpose is served by identification of both strengths and weakness possessed by the employee. The goal of the rating is to build on employee strengths and set goals to overcome and/or minimize the effects of weakness. The measure of determining success in applying this evaluation system lies in the standards identified coupled with the approach used to evaluate performance against those standards.
Memorandum Of Understanding-VII
The State of Connecticut and the Administrative and Residual Employees Union acknowledge that there are occasions when exchange (swap) of employees between two (2) agencies is of mutual benefit. The State also recognizes the advantage of Agency involvement in arranging such swaps.
Swaps may be considered under the following circumstances:
1.	The approach for an exchange (swap) must be initiated by the Union or an Agency.
88
2.	The employees involved must understand and accept that the swap is a voluntary transfer.
3.	The employees involved must accept that upon being transferred the swap is final with no opportunity to return to the employee's former agency.
4.	Swaps may only be within classification and the impacted employees transfer at salary step and grade.
5.	Swaps do not represent vacancies and the Union agrees that such transfers (swaps) will not result in any grievance activity by any employee.
6.	There shall be no ripple effect over movement of employees resulting from the swap.
7.	The Agencies retain veto power over participating in any proposed swap of employees and there shall be no grievances honored or filed over such denial.
8.	Discussions over swaps will be between the Union and the Agencies. Full disclosure of the employee’s personnel records and disciplinary records will be provided each agency involved.
9.	Final Stipulated Agreement allowing the swap to be concluded will be prepared by the Office of Labor Relations. The agreement will be signed by the Union, Agencies, employees impacted and the Office of Labor Relations (on behalf of the State).
Side Letter: Special Revenue Holidays
Under Article 17, Section Four
Beginning September 1, 1984 the following shall be applicable to employees of the Division of Special Revenue:
1.	On any timesheet which includes a holiday the employee shall make a binding election, by way of appropriate coding, of either pay or compensatory time for those hours over 35, in the holiday half of the pay period, which are attributable to the holiday. If the employee elects compensatory time said employee may do so, but not in excess of a bank of 108 hours.
89
Once 108 hours are in the bank all holidays must be coded to pay. However, this will not preclude the employee from replenishing the bank for any earned time taken, in order to return the bank to a 108 hour balance.
2.	An employee who elects payment in lieu of holiday compensatory time, as set forth in paragraph 1, shall be paid for said service at straight time.
3.	This holiday compensatory bank shall be separate and apart from any other earned leave bank.
Clarification Notes
All time worked on premium holidays shall be paid at time and a half plus compensatory time which may be banked or paid out at straight time only.
The side letter applies to all employees whether above or below the overtime cap because holiday compensation is not limited by the overtime cap provisions.
