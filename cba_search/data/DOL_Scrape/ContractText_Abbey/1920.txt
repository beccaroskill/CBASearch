This AGREEMENT is made and entered into by and between the Trustees of COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY in the City of New York (hereinafter called the "University”) and LOCAL 2110, INTERNATIONAL UNION, UAW (hereinafter called the "Union"), acting herein on behalf of the Employees of the University, as hereinafter defined, now employed and hereinafter to be employed and collectively designated as the "Employees".
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, Columbia University recognizes the Union aforesaid as the collective bargaining representative for the Employees covered by this Agreement as hereinafter provided; and
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, promises and agreements herein contained, the parties DO HEREBY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
ARTICLE 1
RECOGNITION
A.	The University recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent for the unit certified by the National Labor Relations Board in Case No. 2-RC-19005.
B.	Confidential Employees, Columbia University student Employees (including Teachers College and Barnard College) and temporary Employees are excluded from the unit.
C.	A temporary Employee is one who is hired for a period of up to four (4) months and who is so informed at the time of hire and who is hired for a special project or to replace an Employee on leave of absence or vacation or to fill a job vacancy in the bargaining unit while an active search is being made for a regular replacement. The said four (4) month period may be extended for the length of a leave of absence. If a temporary full-time Employee is selected to fill a vacancy within the bargaining unit, or if the temporary position becomes a permanent position, the Employee will be included in the bargaining unit. In such cases, the immediate previous period of temporary employment shall be credited toward benefits under this Agreement; it being understood, however, that such period shall not result in any retroactive coverage or in any retroactive contributions to any benefit plan. SEE Appendix D.
D.	Effective March I, 1995, the University agrees to notify the Union of temporary employees who have been on the payroll of the University for sixty (60) days. The notice shall include name, date of hire, replacing who or for what purpose and department.
Departments will notify the Office of Employee and Labor Relations whenever a temporary or casual employee has been employed longer than 60 days in a position which otherwise would be covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and that Office will notify the Union.
E.	(1) The parties agree to establish a joint labor/ management committee consisting of three representatives from each side. A neutral member will be added to serve as facilitator of committee meetings. The University will bear the facilitator’s fees and expenses. The facilitator for the term of this agreement will be Ralph Berger.
The committee shall meet at least quarterly. The University agrees to notify the Union of positions that fall into the following categories:
a.	Situations where a bargaining unit position is upgraded or reclassified to a position outside the bargaining unit; and
b.	Situations where a bargaining unit position is eliminated or significantly altered (through reorganization or for any other reason) and replaced by a newly created or existing position outside the bargaining unit.
c.	Any newly-created officer position below grade 13.
(2)	The Committee shall discuss the positions identified above to determine whether the position is appropriately excluded or included in the bargaining unit.
a.	The University agrees to cooperate fully with the Union in providing relevant information in order to meaningfully review the positions. Such information will be provided in a timely fashion.
b.	Disputes which cannot be resolved by the joint labor/management committee shall be arbitrated by the Facilitator. Like cases and/or cases from the same department, school or division may be consolidated by mutual agreement.
The 1986 Side Letter shall survive for whatever value it has. [See Appendix A.] All cases arising on or before September 30, 2003, are settled in accordance with the side letter on page 66.
F.	The University will provide new employees with information packets at time of hire. The packets will be provided by the Union, and will include copies of the collective bargaining agreement and union membership cards. The University will notify the Union monthly of the names of employees who received the packets.
G.	The Union will not be required to pay rent for use of the premises located at 430 West 119th Street.

All Employees covered by this Agreement who have previously joined and are members of the Union on the date of the ratification of the Agreement by the Union, or who become members thereafter, shall maintain their membership in the Union for the duration of the Agreement as a condition of continued employment.
All Employees who become employed by the University and covered by this Agreement on or after July 1, 1985, and who fail voluntarily to acquire and maintain membership in the Union, shall be required as a condition of continued employment to pay to the Union each month, beginning not later than thirty-one (31) days after commencement of their employment, or after the ratification of this Agreement, whichever is later, a service charge as a contribution toward the cost of administration of this Agreement and the representation of such Employees. The amount of such service charges shall be equivalent to the amounts uniformly required to be paid as dues and initiation fee by those Employees who choose to become members of the Union.
For purposes of this Article, an Employee shall be considered a member of the Union if he/she tenders his/her initiation fee and periodic dues uniformly required as a condition of membership.
An Employee who has failed to maintain membership or to tender service charges as required by this Article shall, within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of a written demand from the Union requesting his/her discharge, be discharged if, during such period, the required dues and initiation fee have not been tendered.
The Union agrees that it will indemnify and hold the University harmless from any recovery of damages sustained by reason of any action taken under this Article.
Upon written notice from the Union, the University will deduct all Union membership dues (or service charges) as provided for in the authorization form set forth below, upon condition that at the time of such notice, the Union shall furnish the University with a written authorization executed by the Employee in the following form:
"I hereby authorize and direct my Employer to deduct from my wages and to pay over to the Union on notice from the Union such amounts including initiation fees and assessments (if any owing by me) as my membership dues in said Union (or service charges) as may be established by the Union and become due to it from me during the effective period of this authorization. This authorization may be revoked by me as of any anniversary date hereof by written notice signed by me of such revocation, received by my Employer and the Union, by registered mail, return receipt requested, not more than sixty (60) days and not less than fifty (50) days, before any such anniversary date, or on
3
termination date of the collective bargaining agreement covering my employment, by like notice, prior to such termination date, whichever occurs the sooner."
The University will notify the Union promptly of any revocation of such authorization received by it.
The University shall provide the Union with a weekly list of new hires. The University will continue to supply the Union with notice of leaves, weekly hires (new hires, promotions, lateral transfers and recalls) and terminations.
The University shall provide new hires with an introductory letter signed by the Union per Exhibit C.

ARTICLE 4
NO STRIKE NO LOCKOUT
Each of the parties acknowledges the rights and responsibilities of the other party and agrees to discharge its responsibilities under this Agreement
The Union, its officers and representatives at all levels, and all Employees, are bound to observe the provisions of this Agreement.
The University, and its representatives at all levels, are bound to observe the provisions of this Agreement.
During the life of this Agreement, the Union will not cause, or cause the Employees represented by it to cause, nor will any such Employee take part in any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, or any other concerted interference with the University’s work. No officer or representative of the Union shall authorize, instigate, aid or condone any such activity and no Employee shall participate in any such activity.
4
Should any Employee or Employees take part in any strike or other activities contrary to the terms of this provision, the University shall immediately notify the Union, and the Union through its representatives shall take steps, as described herein, to have the Employee or Employees concerned immediately returned to work in the case of a strike or to cease any other activity prohibited by this Article:
1)	Publicly disavow such action by the Employees.

Any Employee or Employees engaged in an unauthorized strike, slowdown, work stoppage, or any other concerted interference with the University's work in violation of this Agreement, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
ARTICLE 5 GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
A.	The following procedures should not be construed, in any way, to limit informal discussions between any Employee and representatives of the University which may be utilized, as in the past, for the purpose of resolving disagreements.
B.	Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, a grievance is a dispute between a bargaining unit Employee and the University, or the Union and the University, over the application or interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement or an alleged violation of it.
Step 1, Before filing a grievance, the aggrieved Employee and/or the Union Steward will present it to the immediate supervisor promptly after the occurrence of the alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication, and will try to resolve the grievance without formal proceedings.
Where the employer representative designated at Step 1 agrees that he or she lacks authority to settle the grievance, or where the Department determines that the employer
5
representative designated for Step 1 and Step 2 is the same person, the Union may initially present the grievance at Step 2,
C.	Grievances which are not settled with the immediate supervisor which the Union elects to submit formally will be processed as follows:
Step 2, The Union must present the grievance in writing with the provisions alleged to be violated to the Department Head not later than five (5) working days after the conclusion of Step 1 and in no event later than twenty (20) working days after the occurrence of the alleged violation, misinterpretation or misapplication.
The grievance will be discussed at a conference between the Union Steward or a member of the Union Grievance Committee, the aggrieved Employee and the Department Head or his/her designated representative. It will be held within five (5) working days after the grievance was submitted and the Department Head or his/her representative will respond in writing to the Steward and the Union within five (5) working days of the conference with a copy to the Employee.
D.	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2 and the Department’s response is to be appealed, the Union will process the grievance to Step 3 by submitting, within seven (7) working days of the receipt of the Department's response, a written request to the Director of Employee Relations for a Step 3 conference.
Step 3. The aggrieved Employee, Union Steward or Grievance Committee Member, and Union representative shall meet with a designated representative of the Employee Relations Office within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the Step 3 grievance, to discuss the written grievance. Within ten (10) working days of the meeting, the Employee Relations representative will respond in writing to the Steward and the Union, with a copy to the Employee.
If the oCnion so requests within seven (7) days of the notice period referenced in Article 12 E (Layoff)^ the University will hold the Step 3 no less than ten (10) days prior to expiration for a Step 3 grievance. Included in the grievance meetings will be a discussion of ways to avert the layoffs. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as a waiver of any existing contractual rights with respect to filing Step 3 grievances pertaining to layoffs.
E.	The Union may pursue a grievance not resolved in Step 3 to arbitration if within fifteen (15) working days of the Step 3 response the grievance is submitted to a panel of three arbitrators selected by agreement between the University and the Union, with a copy of the submission to the University.
Cases will be rotated in alphabetical order among the members of the panel.
The panel will hear:
6
a.
b.
all discipline cases all other cases.
The members of the panel will be:
Robert Douglas
Howard Edelman
Susan MacKenzie
F.	Failure on the part of the University to answer a grievance within the time limits provided for in any step shall allow the Union to proceed to the next step. Any disposition of a grievance from which no appeal is taken within the time limits specified herein shall be deemed resolved and shall not thereafter be considered subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement. The time limits specified in this Article may be extended only by written agreement between the University and the Union.
G.	The arbitrator shall not be empowered to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties. The costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally by both parties.
H.	The parties agree that the maintenance of a peaceable and constructive relationship between them requires the establishment and cooperative use of the machinery provided for in this contract for the discussion and determination of grievances and disputes, and that it would detract from this relationship if, except as provided for herein, individual employees or groups of employees would, either as such individuals or groups, seek to interpret or enforce the contract on their own initiative or responsibility. No individual worker may initiate any arbitration proceeding or move to confirm or vacate an award.
1.	Grievances related to layoff shall be filed at Step 3.
J.	Expedited arbitration for discharges and layoffs shall be instituted.
K.	[Deleted.]
L.	The parties may agree not to use outside counsel in any arbitration involving discipline.
M.	The University agrees to provide relevant information concerning a Step 3 grievance
hearing on a timely basis prior to the date of the hearing upon receipt of a timely request.

(5)	In the event that an employee with less bargaining unit seniority than specified in paragraph 4 above is scheduled to be laid off in one department and there exists a vacant position in another department for which the employee is qualified on the basis of skill, ability, work record and experience, then he/she will be considered for the vacant position before other candidates. When two or more employees are scheduled to be laid off who are qualified, first consideration will be given to the one with the most bargaining unit seniority.
15
(6)	If a regular part-time Employee has greater equivalent seniority than a full-time Employee in the same classification who is to be laid off, the part-time Employee must be willing to accept full-time employment to continue working.
(7)	In all of the above cases, the employee who is assigned to a new position shall serve the same probationary period in such new position as a new hire. If he/she is removed from the new position during the probationary period, he/she shall be laid off.

Based on operational needs, Cashiers will be retained during the summer months in order of their seniority within their location. Replacement or additional Cashiers, as needed, will be recalled in the same seniority order. If there is no Cashier from within the location who is available to work, Cashiers scheduled to be laid off or on layoff from other locations will be recalled in order of their seniority prior to the University hiring a temporary employee or outside applicant, except in an emergency situation.
(10)	The University shall maintain a current layoff listing which shall be sent to the Union monthly.

If a vacancy occurs in a Department in a job classification where no Employee in that classification has recall rights or is deemed to be qualified, then the laid-off Employee in that Department with the most bargaining unit seniority will be recalled to that vacancy if he/she has the skill, ability, work record and experience to be qualified to do the work, and, if not, the next qualified senior Employee on layoff in that Department will be recalled and so on. If a vacancy occurs in a Department where no Employee is on layoff or is deemed qualified, and if there are employees on layoff who have four or more years of bargaining unit seniority, then the laid-off Employee with the most bargaining unit seniority will be recalled to the vacant position if he/she has the skill, ability, work record and experience to be qualified to do the work and, if not, the next qualified senior Employee with four or more years of bargaining unit seniority will be recalled and so on. Consideration of laid-off employees with less than the specified seniority for vacant positions will be governed by paragraph E (5) above.
(2)	An employee who is recalled and assigned to a new position shall serve the same probationary period in such new position as a new hire. If returned to layoff status during the probationary period, the period of active employment shall not be deemed to be time on layoff for recall purposes.

G.	Promotions and Lateral Transfers
(1)	Whenever a vacancy occurs in a department, the vacancy shall be posted (together with department and grade) simultaneously for five (5) days both within and outside the department. Preference for such vacancy shall be given to the employee within the department, who bids for the position (except where a laid off employee has recall rights), taking into account an employee's work record, experience, skill and ability to perform the required duties, and Affirmative Action considerations. Departmental seniority shall prevail where employees are equal based on the aforementioned factors. If the position cannot be filled from within the department, the same procedure shall be followed for filling the position from outside the department, except where such qualifications are equal, bargaining unit seniority shall prevail.
(2)	When a lateral transfer is applied for, such applications shall be considered after applications of those seeking promotions except that employees who have more than one year in their current position and who apply for a lateral transfer, shall receive the same preference as those seeking a promotion.
(3)	An employee who is promoted or transferred to a different position shall serve the same probationary period in the new position as a new hire.

(4)	An employee must complete a minimum of six (6) months of continuous employment in the bargaining unit in his/her position before requesting a lateral transfer or promotion. If, however, no one with six months or more of continuous employment

(5)	The University will continue to provide promotional increases as heretofore.
(6)	The Union will be provided upon request with seniority sign-ups and interview dates of applicants for vacant positions.

(10)	Postings will state that the positions are Local 2110 U.A.W.
(11)	The Personnel Office shall send a cover letter concerning contractual obligations for transfers or promotions per attached Appendix A.
H.	Temporary Transfers
When an employee is temporarily transferred to a job classification higher than his/her regular classification for a continuous period of more than five (5) work days, he/she shall receive the minimum rate of the higher classification, or five percent (5%) above his/her regular rate, whichever is higher, for hours worked in the higher classification beginning with the first day of the temporary transfer.
ARTICLE 13
SEVERANCE PAY
A regular supporting staff employee with twelve months of completed service is entitled to a layoff allowance of one week's basic pay for each completed year of full-time service. Full-time employees reduced to part-time will receive a pro-rata severance amount. It is expected that the employee will be entitled to a minimum of two weeks layoff allowance regardless of the years of completed full-time service. Payment of the layoff allowance shall be in the form of a lump sum payment, less applicable tax deductions, and payable on the last day worked. If the employee is recalled and reinstated in a University position, the employee shall return to the University that portion of the layoff allowance not covered by the weeks spent in the layoff pool. (For example: An employee was given a layoff allowance based upon twenty weeks. The employee was recalled and reinstated after spending nine weeks in the layoff pool.
19
The employee must return eleven weeks layoff allowance to the University.) Part-time employees should return a pro-rated amount (Example: a 20 year full-time employee is reduced to a half-time position. Employee receives severance of 10 weeks and is reinstated to a full-time position in four weeks. The employee must return 8 weeks of severance pay). Should a supporting staff employee find employment outside the University within the period of the layoff notification or while in the layoff pool, the layoff allowance will not be reduced.
ARTICLE 14

In such event, the dispute shall be submitted and determined under the grievance and arbitration procedure hereinbefore set forth; however, commencing at Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
C.	Copies of all written warnings are to be sent to the Employee and the Union with a copy
to the Steward.
ARTICLE 15 WORK WEEK

(1)	Incumbent employees will not be required to work on a compressed work week schedule, except by mutual consent between the employee and the supervisor.
20
(2)	The University will notify the Union whenever an employee begins to work a compressed schedule, except that this requirement will be deemed to have been satisfied if the original posting indicates that the position is one with a compressed work week.
D.	The following procedure will apply whenever (1) the University is officially closed due to an emergency such as power failures, weather conditions, or similar occurrences; or (2) the University remains open but conditions make travel to work extremely difficult or hazardous and the President or designee, in consultation with the Emergency Management Operating Team, declares the day an emergency operation day:
1.	Non-essential employees scheduled to work will be paid for the day and will not be required to report for work. Non-essential employees who report for work may be required to remain at work to provide essential services and if so, will be paid for the day as essential employees.
2.	Essential employees are those designated in advance (including in a posting) as necessary to provide service during an emergency, or who are so designated due to the particular emergency or as provided in paragraph 1, above. Essential employees who work during the emergency will receive a premium payment equal to their regular rate of pay for all hours worked during their normal shift as additional compensation. Full time employees will receive overtime pay at the rate of time and one-half for all hours outside of their normal shift. An essential employee who is unable to report for work despite all reasonable efforts and so informs his/her supervisor or designated person will be paid for the day.
3.	If the University closes after the start of normal business hours or an individual employee’s regular shift, employees will receive their regular salary from the beginning of their shift until the closing, and will thereafter be covered by the provisions above for the balance of the day.
4.	Employees previously scheduled to be off for vacation, personal leave, holiday, sick leave or any other absence will be charged the appropriate type of leave, and will not be re-credited with the time. However, this paragraph shall not prevent the University from considering extenuating circumstances and re-crediting an employee previously scheduled for a single day off on the date of the emergency closing. Such consideration is at the University’s sole discretion, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 16
OVERTIME
A.	Employees shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half times their regular pay for authorized time worked in excess of the regular full-time work week, up to forty (40) hours, by receiving either pay for such overtime worked or compensatory time off. Compensatory time
21
off must be scheduled and used within sixty (60) days from the time worked and if not scheduled and used within sixty (60) days, shall be paid at the overtime rate. Any time worked after forty (40) hours shall be paid at time and one-half. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime.
B.	The University will use its best efforts to provide reasonable notice in advance of requiring an employee to work overtime. Job postings will state whether it is anticipated that a position will require substantial seasonal overtime.
C,	Overtime - Positions scheduled to work 24/7

* Active Plan Participants prior to 7/1/07:
Existing employees will continue to receive contributions according to the existing schedule and at termination vesting will be calculated using both methods, the better benefit being provided to the participant. Therefore current employees will get the benefit of the better of both vesting scales, meaning for example that for a current employee who leaves after 5 years (see example above), she/he would get a benefit value of $12,000 in the proposed plan example, as opposed to $9600.

The employee will participate in an annual discussion with his/her manager to review the above checklist of duties and to verify that the employee continues to perform the above duties in a satisfactory manner. If the manager determines that the employee continues to perform the above duties in a satisfactory manner, the employee will continue receiving the differential. The manager’s determination that the employee no longer performs these duties may be grieved through the grievance procedure.
Nothing herein will be deemed to change any existing practice with respect to performance of these duties by support staff or officers, respectively. The performance of lead worker duties shall not be a basis to remove a bargaining unit member from the bargaining unit, either as an officer or as a statutory supervisor.
Lead Worker Role Differential Requests
An employee in a 2110 grade 8, 9, or 9a position requesting consideration for the Lead Worker role differential is to complete the supplemental lead worker questionnaire and submit it to his/her immediate supervisor. The supervisor will meet with the employee to review the questionnaire. An employee may elect to have Union representation at the meeting. The lead worker questionnaire and the supervisor’s comments are to be sent to the respective local Human Resources liaison (if applicable) and then to Human Resources Organizational Services (HROS) for evaluation. Please note: incumbents in grades 8, 9, or 9a should not complete full standard position questionnaires to be considered for the Lead Worker role.
When creating a new grade 8, 9 or 9a position, supervisors may submit a lead worker questionnaire along with the standard position questionnaire to HROS for review and consideration.
Lead Worker Questionnaire Forms are available on the HR website at www.hr.columbia.edu/hr. Supervisors are to maintain a copy of the original lead worker differential paperwork for future reference.
The result of the evaluation will be sent to the employee, the supervisor and the Union. Approved differentials will be retroactive to the date of the request for review as submitted on the supplemental lead worker questionnaire. Please note that an exception will be made for questionnaires received in July 2004. Differentials for all qualified questionnaires received by August 31, 2004, shall be effective retroactively to July 1, 2004.
The result of the review will not change an employee’s current job grade and job title.
The University and Local 2110 will work together to promote this program with a view toward encouraging participation.

1.	Subject to the funding limitation set forth above, the parties agree that employees who have completed six months employment with the University may apply for funding for education or training programs, and will be awarded funds to be used for such programs.

Consistent with operational needs, time off (with or without pay) will not be unreasonably denied.
6.	In the event that the request for benefits under this agreement exceeds the available funding, the labor-management committee will determine how to allocate the
47
funding. The committee will endeavor to maximize the number of employees who receive at least some benefit. Bargaining unit seniority may be considered along with other factors in allocation of funds.
7.	a. Costs covered by scholarships or grants to the employee are not covered by this agreement.
b. Employees who receive funding are required to present satisfactory evidence that they successfully completed the particular program/coursefs) for which they received funding before being eligible for additional funding.

4.	An employee in the pilot program will be covered by the collective bargaining agreement except as provided herein.
5.	An employee who elects to participate:
a.	Will not receive the severance allowance provided in Article 13 of the collective bargaining agreement. In its place, the employee will be retained at his/her salary as of the date of layoff, and will receive the fringe benefits provided in the collective bargaining agreement, for a period of time equal to the number of weeks of severance pay the employee would have received under Article 13.
b.	Must accept all offered temporary, casual or training assignments and must work the same number of hours per week as the employee worked prior to the layoff, for the duration of time provided in paragraph 5(a). The University will attempt to accommodate work hour preferences, but cannot guarantee that the schedule and location of such assignments will be the same as those which the employee worked prior to the layoff. The University may assign any work which is of a general clerical nature for which the employee is minimally qualified.
c.	Will receive holiday pay for any holidays which occur, but will not be eligible to use vacation, personal leave or sick leave while in the pilot program, except as follows:
i.	Because of the temporary nature of the assignments, the use of sick leave for absences due to illness shall be limited to one (1) day per month.

f.	An employee will remain in a temporary assignment which extends longer than the length of time that the employee would otherwise be in the pilot program unless the employee accepts a regular position.
6.	An employee who fails to work on any day covered by paragraph 5 (except as outlined in paragraph 5c) when work is offered may be terminated from the pilot program and will receive a layoff allowance equal to the difference between the
50
employee’s original severance entitlement under Article 13 and the number of weeks they were in the program.
7.	If the department determines that the employee is not qualified or able to perform the
duties of the temporary assignment, the department may remove the employee from the temporary assignment and return the employee to the pool. Such action shall not be grievable or arbitrable.
8.	Upon expiration of the employee’s time in the pilot program, the employee will retain seniority for the balance of time as defined in Article 12 B (2).
9.	This procedure will not apply to summer furloughs.
10.	Any school or department outside of those covered in paragraph 1, above, that wishes to participate in the pilot program may do so on a voluntary basis.

In settlement of AAA cases Ford and Samuels, Liz Warren, the 33 cases to be heard by Goldsmith, the parties agree that the issue of the Grade placement of certain job positions shall be arbitrable under the terms of the LA if the job position has been upgraded from within the BU to outside the BU. This Agreement shall also apply to the arbitrability of future cases outside of the BU.
The issue in these cases shall be limited to whether the job in question belongs in or out of the bargaining unit, and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the grade level ranging from the grade level of the job position prior to its upgrade to the level of the job position after its upgrade or any grade level in between. The arbitrator shall have no authority to direct the University to create a new or replacement position in the bargaining unit.

Dear Maida,
This will confirm our agreement with respect to certain issues covered by the Memorandum of Agreement between Columbia University and Local 2110.
All cases which could have been brought to the labor-management committee arising on or before September 30, 2003 will be considered withdrawn on a non-precedent basis, and only cases arising thereafter shall be considered by the committee.
1.	The University will establish an account within the Office of Employee and Labor Relations for
use by Local 2110. The University will credit Local 2110 with $75,000 for each year of the five-year contract, in addition to any balance remaining from the 2003-2007 agreement, which may be used any time during the term of the agreement Local 2110 will follow University procedures to access funds in the account.
2.	The fund may be used for such purposes as payment for space for Union meetings; payment of the salary and benefits (fringe benefit factor) for release time for Union officials (to the extent not otherwise paid under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement); printing and communications; preparation of orientation materials; and similar purposes directly related to representation of the bargaining unit. The fund may be used to pay for release time for a union official to serve as a liaison for employees who may be laid off during the term of the agreement.
3.	Any money remaining in the fund at the expiration of the contract will be roiled over into the account of the subsequent collective bargaining agreement if such account continues, or, if not, will be used to provide an economic benefit of equivalent value to the UAW Local 2110 bargaining unit during the term of the successor collective bargaining agreement Any dispute regarding the equivalent economic value or any other term or application of this side letter shall be subject to the arbitration clause of the parties* collective bargaining agreement
Sincerely,

SIDE LETTER
The cases pending in the temporary and casual employment arbitration proceeding before the three contract arbitrators will be settled on the following terms:
1.	A pool of $22,000 will be established, to be distributed under a formula to be agreed upon between the parties (after payroll deductions), as liquidated damages to the named grievants (see attached list) whose cases were filed for arbitration in lieu of any other remedy, and an equivalent amount will be placed in the union activity fund as a one-time payment in lieu of any other remedy due to the union. This payment is made on a non-precedent basis and without regard to the merits of any individual grievant’s case.
2.	The chart above and the payment scale will be an appendix to the collective bargaining agreement, effective upon ratification.
3.	All pending cases not covered by paragraph 1 will be settled in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.
Departments will notify the Office of Employee and Labor Relations whenever a temporary or casual employee has been employed longer than 60 days in a position which otherwise would be covered by the collective bargaining agreement, and that Office will notify the Union.

Guidelines for same-sex domestic partner benefit coverage:
•	Your partner must be an adult of the same gender, not related to you by blood, and who is not eligible for coverage through Columbia as an employee.
•	You and your partner must have lived together in a committed personal relationship for at least six consecutive months before enrolling for coverage. Furthermore, you must anticipate continuing to live together in a personal relationship in which you have joint and reciprocal financial responsibilities.
•	You must complete a new enrollment form (available at the Benefits Office - 1901 Interchurch Center, Morningside Campus, or 112 Black Building, Health Sciences Campus.

=> designation of your partner as primary beneficiary in your will
=> designation of your partner as your beneficiary for your life insurance or retirement benefits

This income is subject to ordinary federal income taxation and Social Security taxes (FICA), which are normally withheld through payroll deductions.
The Benefits Office can provide you with more information about the program, as well as an enrollment form.
