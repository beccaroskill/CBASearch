RE: IMPACT OF C.A.S.E. PROGRAM ON LOCAL UNION NOS. 763,152.1306,1356C AND 13567
Dear Dick:
During the 1948 negotiations the Union expressed its concern regarding the potential impact of the new C.A.S.E. Program on the Local 152, Local 763, Local 1306, Local 1356C and Local 1356T bargaining unto. |n response to this concern I assured you that the Company will not use the new CjA.S.E. program for the purpose of eliminating or significantly reducing the Local 763, Local 152, Local 1206, Local 13S6C end Local 12567 bargaining unto. Should a change in the present business conditions occur, which impacts the Company's requirements, I will notify you, at the earliest practical time, to discuss the situation and possible alternatives.

LETTER OF COMMITMENT
IMTRODUCTIOH
During the 1995 negotiation* the parties discussed the negative impact of ever increasing pricing and competitive pressures and constantly changing market conditions on these covered operations. Both parties also recognized that continuous real improvement in manufacturing efficiencies and flexibilities, as well as employee participation and ownership In th* process ot constant cost reduction, are critical if these particular operations
222
are to remain competitive and provide long-term employment opportunities, and agreed that if the Company is to survive tn today's Intensely competitive agricultural and construction machinery industries, the parties must cooperate in an unprecedented fashion in order to achieve the most efficient manufacturing operations. This Letter of Commitment is an integral step in the parties' joint effort to fully and completely Implement demand flow technology and the Case Production System, as well as the initiation of programs designed to transfer, in part, the responsibility for cost reduction to all employees.
In response to these manufacturing and marketplace concerns the parties have, in prior negotiation*, and in accordance with the C.A.S.E. Program, attempted to address the need for more efficient operalions and increased flexibility by agreeing to work rule and labor contract language change* and understandings. While the Union pledged it* continuing commitment to the concepts of flexible manning and production scheduling, optimum utilization of all resources and the manufacturing of the highest quality products at the lowest possible cost and the Company pledged an equal commitment to these concepts, to provide the resources needed and to promote the modifications in management practices and attitude* necessary at all level* of the Company to bring about the desired results, both parties recognize that Case will not improve or aven maintain its current competitive position without the Caso Production System ("CPS") and continuous cost reduction.
True employment security come* only from being more competitive in the marketplace by operating the most costeffective factories with the most efficient, skilled employees. The parties understand that employee* are more likely to direct their focus on continuous improvement of product quality and competitive costs and hence, to be more productive, if they have the opportunity to attain certain employment protections. However, the parties also recognize that the original C.A.S.E. program, while moderately successful in that It provided some measure of security for existing employees, may have actually hindered growth opportunities and did not generate growth. Consequently, the parties have agreed to a new C.A.S.E. employment security program, which applies a more realistic approach to job security - one that arises from a healthy, profitable and competitive enterprise.
223
CM IHPLEMtHTATlOH
Implementation or CPS Wilf not only be revolutionaiy, but alto evolutionary in nature. White the parties have attempted to address tome ot the work rule issues which must be modified to provide the Company with the flexibility necessary to successfully Implement CPS in order to create a more efficient and productive manufacturing environment, the parties recognize and understand that during the term of thia Agreement other work rule and contract modifications may bo necessary. Thus, It is agreed that work rules and contract application issues may be continually reviewed and modified where necessary to facilitate andlor expedite the successful implementation of CPS. Every effort will be made so that any modifications will be jointly developed and approved, giving equal weight to operating efficiency, quality and Job opportunities. The Union further agrees that in fulfilling its role In this process, its cooperation, approval and support for Implementation of such proposed changes will not be unreasonably withheld.
COST ripuctjon
An integral component to the Company’s continued success and hence, its ability to provide true job security, is continuous cost reduction. In the global markets in which Cas* competes, intense pricing pressures will be the norm, demanding that Case improve it* product year after year and offer it at a competitive price. This lofty goal can only be achieved if all Caso employees - salaried and hourly - take ownership of and responsibility for continuous cost reduction. The Union agrees with this need and pledges its support and cooperation for implementation of a process to accomplish this objective.
IMtOURCJNC OPPORTUNITY
The Company al*o agrees to continually review its work loads and schedules and, where appropriate, to insource work that is currently being produced elsewhere. The Union, in turn, recognizes that if the Company Is expected to tnsouree work, thereby providing a stronger commitment to employment security. It may be necessary to modify andior eliminate then existing work rules and practices based on than existing conditions or circumstances in order to make the insourcing an economically justified and cost effective decision. Again, the Union agrees that its cooperation, approval and support for such proposed changes wifi not bo unreasonably withheld.
224
MIBCOHTRACTIHC
Moreover, the Company Intend* to Lake Advantage of its improved competitive position by reducing its use of subcontractors where It* own employees can perform the work in a mor* economic, tlnwiy end efficient manner then can the subcontractor. As always, when making decisions regarding subcontracting, the Company will review such matters with an Intention to maintaining, as far as practicable in relation to its needs, a fully utilized, stable workforce. The Company shall make such decisions with a view toward enhancing the long term stability and health o* the enterprise as a whole.
CONClUSiOM
In this regard, the parties acknowledge that a central feature of the above commitments to CFS and secure and competitive employment is the Company’s long range goal of fully utilizing the skills and abilities of its employees and In the process more efficiently utilizing tha capacity and capabilities of its capital assets. The Union understands that the unprecedented job security commftmsnts provided herein have etiecuveiy transformed bargaining unit employees from a variable cost to the Company to a fixed cost, making it more important than ever to have a fully utilized and flexible workforce. To thia end, and to reemphasize the above commitments, jointly developed work rule modifications will be considered on an ongoing basis in order to more fully utilize tho workforce by insourcing new work and bringing back previously outsourced work to the extent practical.
On its part management recognizes that In order for employees to identify with and understand their important role in these operations, they should have an understanding oi developments affecting their plants. Therefore an essential part of management's commitment In the CPS and C.A.S.E. programs will be to communicate with all employees, and to familiarize them with relevant manufacturing developments relating to manufacturing goals and objective*.
It Is also recognized that employee* posses* unique experiences and knowledge pertaining to the operation* of the business. To hilly utilize this resource, the parties wWI cooperate to form Rapid Improvement Teams aimed at reducing costs. Improving quality, and Increasing efficiencies in all plants.

CASE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT COMPENSATION SYSTEM (CCICS)
During the IMS negotiations the Company and Union agreed to eliminate th* SHP individual incentive compensation system and replace SHP with a compensation delivery system which is based on a team rather than an Individual, and on continuous improvement rather than an inflexible standard. The Case Continuous Improvement Compensation System (CCICS) Is a framework for the development and application of a compensation plan which rewards teams of employee* for achieving continuous Improvement In iha operations to which they are assigned. CCICS Is based on th* following principles:
•	Continuous Improvement I* necessary for the Company to remain competitive.
•	Continuous improvement requires the cooperative efforts of all participating employee*.
<	Participating emptoyees must have th* opportunity, through continuous improvement, to increase earning* and maintain a consistent weekly pay level.
230
Section 1. Fundamental* of CCICS
A. The CCICS provide* group incentive earning* opportunity to an established CCICS Team of employees for attaining continuous improvement, measured on a weekly basis, above the baseline performance standards.
1| As set forth in the Letter of Understanding Rei Plan Process and Implementation, when possible, CCICS Teams will be Jointly developed (al) manning, schedule, measurement criteria and process decisions to be made by the Company). When the parties cannot agree on a CCICS Team, the Company may implement the Team in accordance with that Letter.
2)	CCICS Teams should be developed around a common factor (e.g.. process, component, department, end product, etc.).
3)	The objective of CCICS Is to eliminate SHP and transition all SHP operations to a CCICS Team application.
4)	Indirect operations (i.e.. non-SHP positions) may be included In a CCICS team application if such inclusion Is consistent with ths continuous improvement objective, will Increase team effectiveness and promotes tha team and plant goals.
Sj White the ultimate objective may be to have a single CCICS team which includes the particular plant's entire production/meintenance bargaining unit this is an evolutionary process and a plant may, consistent with this Section have many team* of various size*. Inclusion of any skilled trades employee on a Team is subject Io Section 1, A, 4 above.
0. As set forth in paragraph A, above, continuous improvement (or decline) is measured on a weekly basis (Identical to th* payroll week). Th* CCICS Weekly Performance Level is that team's calculated weekly share of productivity change expressed as a percent,
1)	Each CCICS Team will have a Weekly Performance Level calculated.
231
1)	Th* Weekly Performance Level Indicates that CCICS Toam'i share of the productivity change, expressed as a percent, and is determined by:
(a) Comparing a particular week's results with the Productivity Baseline, calculating the percentage change and, if an Improvement was generated,
<b) nMtfpfyfog W»t percentage improvement change by 67% (i.e., the employee's share).
i)	The Productivity Baseline may consist of one or more metrics, tf one metric is used, the norm (but not the requirement) shall be "productivity", defined as earned (output) hours divided by clock (Input) hours (as defined in paragraph C. 1. (a), below). Only the Corporate Administration Committee can approve the use of multiple metrics.
4)	if the Company elects to use multiple metrics (e.g., productivity, quality, linearity, safety, etc.}, each metric will be assigned a percentage weighting factor. The sum of the weighting factors assigned to each metric shall equal 100%.
(a)	If multiple metrics are used, the weekly performance for each metric is calculated and then multiplied by its respective metric weighting factor.
(b)	All of the individual weekly metric calculations are then added together to determine the total Weekly Performance Level.
S)	The Productivity Baseline Is defined as set forth in B. 3 above and shall be calculated based on the fifty-two (52) week period ending with the last full payroll period of the first calendar quarter of 1999.
C. Employees assigned to a position within a CCICS Team application will have their weekly pay calculated in accordance with this Section 1.C.
1)	While participating in a CCICS Team application during a particular week, the employee's CCICS pay will be computed by multiplying tha employee s current hourly
232
CCICS Rate time* tha employ*#'# clock (input) hours ter that weak.
(a) "Clock (input) hours" are defined as all paid time recorded after tha employee has "punched In" and before the employee has "punched out" (except for those items set forth in Section 1, F)-
jb) For purposes of this Section 1, the only other exception to a) above is if th* employee is assigned to perform a Job In a non-CCICS Team application. Such non-CCICS time will not be paid under this CCICS. In such case the employee will be paid the base rate of th* Job to which the employee is assigned, or if the employee is assigned to an S HP rated Job which has not yet been converted, his actual earnings.
(c) Ths CCICS Rate for a particular employe# will be either
(i)	the greater of the Red Circle Pay Level (“RCPL") for eligible employees as defined In th* Standard Hour Plan Buyout - Appendix A: or the applicable CCICS rate of tha job as set forth In wage schedule 1, or
(il)	for employee* hired prior to March 30, 1998, who are not eligible for an RCPL, the CCICS Rate of the Job (as modified try the 1995 new hire progression, if applicable) a* set forth in Wage Schedule 1: or
(ill)	for employees hired prior to March 30, 1998, who ars in a Schedule B wag* progression, their RCPL or th* applicable maximum CCICS rat* |i.*., 35 month level) as set forth In Wag* Schedule 1; provided however, that if their RCPL Is les* than the applicable maximum CCICS Rate In Schedule 1 when they first participate in a CCIC3 Team, the employee will continue in the wage progression until his hourly rate equal* or exceed* the applicabl* maximum CCICS rate in Wage Schedule 1; or
233
<rv) for all employee* hlrsd on or efter March 30, 1938. tho Maw Hiro CCiCS Rata d tho job (a* modified by the 1898 new hire progression) as set forth in wage Scbetluie 2.
2)	The CCICS Rate, as defined in C.1 above, will be paid only wten the Weekly Performance Level for that CCICS Team equal* or exceeds its Productivity Baseline.
(a)	When the Weekly Performance Level exceeds the Productivity Baseline, the employee’s weekly pay will not be affected for that week and the CCICS Rato will bo paid.
(b)	When the Weekly Performance Level exceed* the Productivity Baseline, sixty-seven percent 46784} of the earned hours in excess of the Productivity Baseline will ba allocated tn the CCICS Reserve Fund. If tho Company elect* to use multiple metrics, a conversion and pay out formula will be determined in accordance with tha Letter of Understanding Re: Plan Process and implementation.
3)	If the CCICS Weekly Performance Level for that CCICS Team is less than 100% of its Productivity Baseline, and there are sufficient earned hours in th* Reserve Fund, th* earned hour* required to raise the Weekly Performance Level to 100% of the Productivity Basetrn* will be provided equally from the CCiCS Reserve Fund and ths Company. In such case, the CCiCS Rate will be maintained tor that week in which a build-up occurred.
4)	If the CCICS Weekly Performance Level for that CCICS Team I* less than 100% of it* Productivity Baseline and there are no earned hours in th* Reserve Fund, the CCICS Rate will be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to the percentage shortfall of th* Weekly Performance Level under the Productivity Baseline for that week, tn such case, the hourly pay will be reduced for tbs same week in which the shortfall occurred
(a)	A shortfall Witt not result In tho applicable pay rat* being reduced below the applicable CCICS Base Rate; provided however, that employees with an RCPL shall have a CCICS Base Rate equal to the higher of iho Wage Schedule -1 CCiCS Base Rat* or
234
1
the employee's RCPL divided by 115%; provided further, that employees classified is Schedule A or C on the RCPL eligibility dates who are not entitled to an RCPL will be guaranteed the nori' CCICS/lndlrect rate times his clock hours a* the minimum weekly pay when initially assigned to a CCICS application. This guarantee will extend for six (6) month* from the date of this permanent assignment.
(b)	An employee's pay rate will return to the CCICS Rate for the first week in which the Weekly Performance Level equals or exceeds the Productivity Baseline.
6) It the CCICS Weekly Performance Level for that CCICS Team is les* than 100% of its Productivity Baseline and there are insufficient earned hours in the Reserve Fund (whan combined with tn* Company's matching hours) to raise the Weekly Performance Level to 100% of the Productivity Baseline all of the available Reserve Fund hours and th* matching Company hours will tn added to the Weekly Performance Level. After such application, th* CCICS Rate wiW be reduced by a percentage amount equivalent to th* adjusted percentage shortfall of th* Weekly Performance Level under the Productivity Baseline for that week. In such case, tha hourly pay will be reduced for the same week In which th* adjusted shortfall occurred.
6] When th* Weekly Performance Laval would provide an hourly rate less than the CCICS Base Rai* after the application of Reserve Fund and Company matching hours, th* Company win provide additional hours to raise the Weekly Performance Level to the point where tha CCICS Bis* Rate would be paid. Thereafter, th* Weekly Performance Level (and th* hourly rate) may ba built up tn accordance with paragraphs 0.3 and S above.
D. A CCICS Semester shall be twenty-six (26) consecutive calendar weeks, A CCICS Average Semester Plan Performance Level for each CCICS Team will be calculated at the end of each CCICS Semester.
t) When the CCICS Average Semester Plan Performance Level Is less man the Bas* Adjustment Level of tD5% lot the Productivity Baseline or, if multiple metrics are used.
235
J
for any metric), the Productivity Baseline (or individual metrics) will not be changed for the next semester. The Base Adjustment Level of 105% represent* only the Team's 67% share (e.g.. an adjustment occurs only if the semester average exceed* <07.46%).
2)	When the CCICS Average Semester Ran Performance Level equals or exceeds the Base Adjustment Level ot 105% (of the Productivity baseline or, if multiple metric* are used, for any metric), a Baseline Adjustment will be made to the Productivity Basetine (or, if multiple metric* are used, for any metric equaling or exceeding the Baseline Adjustment Level).
(a)	In such case, the Productivity Baseline (or, if multiple metrics are used, each eligible metric) will be adjusted upward by 6.65% (e g., the percentage factor equal to 67% ot the difference between the Improved productivity percentage rata that triggered th* adjustment (i.e., 107.46%) and the employee share level of that rat* (I.e., 105%)).
(b)	In exchange for this adjustment, the Company will distribute a Buy Back Allowance of additional paid hours to the Team participants equivalent to 6% of the Team's input hour*, factored by the performance metric’s weighting. Overtime premiums required by statute will be paid with th* Buy Back Allowance.
3)	If a Buy Back Allowance I* earned for a particular metric (single or multiple metric Baseline) during the currant semester, and a Baseline Adjustment was made, as set forth in D.2 above, and a Buy Back Allowance/Baseline Adjustment was made for that same metric in one or two of the Immediately preceding semesters, then an additional payment equal to the current Buy Back Allowance for that metric will be paid.
4)	Reserve Fund Hour* remaining at the end of the semester will be distributed to ■ that CCICS Team’s participants at the end of that CCICS Semester.
fa) Remaining Reserve Fund Hour* shall be defined as the accumulated weekly reserve fund hours less any hours used to raise the Weekly Performance Level.
236
(b) Th* next CCICS Semester witl start out with zero hours in the Reserve Fund.
5| The Reserve Fund Hours and the Buy Seek Allowance, if any, wilt be paid out to that CCICS Team’s participants In accordance with the following:
(a)	The pool value of tile remaining Reserve Fund Hours will be calculated by:
(I)	determining the number of remaining Reserve Fund Hours which are attributable to each of that Team's participants; and
(ii)	multiplying the applicable number ot hours for each participant by that participant’s applicable wage rate; and
(iii)	totaling these sums
(b)	The remaining Reserve Fund Hour pool value will then be distributed to each of the Team’s participants by multiplying each of the Team participant’s input factor by the pool value.
(c)	The input Factor is calculated by dividing each participant's input hours In that Team for that semester by the total Team's input hours for that semester.
E. The Productivity Baseline metric (or, If the Company elects to use multiple metrics, each of the separate metrics) will be established using historical data, if available. If historical data is not available, or is no! available In a usable manner, the applicable standards may be established through one of the following methods:
1)	comparative data; or
2)	time study; or
3} standard data; or
4)	plant data; or
5)	predetermined time systems; or
237
J
6)	vid»o or laboratory analyst*; or
7f work sampling; or
B)	part family analysis; or
9J any combination of tha above or any other accepted Industrial engineering technique, so that Weekly Performance Levels equal to the Productivity Baseline Standard (or metrics) will yield the CCICS Rate pay level.
F.	When establishing the Productivity Baseline (or, when multiple metrics are used, for the appropriate standards) or. when accumulating plan input hours Io calculate a Weakly Performance Level, the following categories of employee’s time will not be counted and will be excluded from such accumulations:
1)	paidlimch hours
2)	training of eight hours or more on a nomCCICS application or job; or for purpose* of establishing the Productivity Baseline, training unrelated to the position which was later Included in the CCICS application
3)	catastrophic downtime
4)	special projects/assignments outside of the CCICS plan; or for purpose* of establishing th* Productivity Baseline, special projects/asslgnments unrelated to a position which later became part of a CCICS application
G.	Afi clock hours not included as plan Input hours will be paid at the appropriate CCICS Base Rate (except for employees hired after March 30, 1998 remaining in the appropriate wage progression schedule, who will receive th* appropriate pay level for their seniority).
Section], Maintenance of CCICS Applications
A. In addition to the Baseline Adjustment described In Section 1 paragraph D. 2, adjustments will be made to the Productivity Baseiina (and Individual metrics where appropriate) and/or output metric* for other conditions. These conditions are a* follows;
238
1)	When the Company Invests $50,000 or more, or $5,000 per full-time Team participant, whichever Is less, in a CCiCS Team (e.g., new machinery or equipment; major repair or refurbishing; asset rearrangement or relocalion; Infrastructure Improvements, etc.).
(a)	if an investment results in improver) performance, Ute Baseline adjustment wilt account for only eighty per cent (80%) of the calculated labor improvement to allow employees time to adjust to the change.
(b)	If an Investment directly results In, or causes, performance deterioration, the adjustment will account for the full affect of tho deterioration.
2)	When tho Company and Union agree that a change is necessary to assure the on-going competitiveness of that CCICS operation.

APPENDIX A
STANDARD HOUR PLAN TRANSITIONAL BUYOUT
During ths 1998 negotiations, ths Company and the Union agreed to glhnlfiate the SUP individual incentive system and replace it with the CCICS. In order to provide employee* with the opportunity tor comparable earning*. the parties have alto agreed io this Standard Hour Plan Transitional Buyout.
The Transitional Buyout will be accomplished by providing eligible employees with a Red Circle Pay Level ("RCPL") which wilt be applied whsn that employee Is working under the new CCICS. An eligible employee’s RCPL will be used tor computing his earnings whan the employee Is working in a CCICS application.
A.	Eligibility
1.	To be etlgibfe for an RCPL, an employee must have been:
a)	permanently classified, and working, in a "Schedule 8" classification {as Set forth In the 199S Agreement) as of March 29,1998, or
b)	assigned (bid or transferred) to a Schedule B Job during the "no contract period' (March 29, 1998 to May 14,1398) or,
c)	eligible for recall (had recall rights) to a Schedule B Job on March 29. 1998, and will receive an RCPL upon recall to a Schedule B classification. Where no Incentive earning* history are available during the applicable computation period, th* RCPL shall be determined using th* elass/dept average method, a* of March 29,1998.
2.	Employees will not be eligible for an RCPL if they do not satisfy paragraph Art above. Example* of emptoyees not eligible for an RCPL Include the foliowfng:

S. For all purposes under this Buyout provision, "CP Clock Hours" shall be defined a*, and limited to, all hours in which the employee was In attendance at work as recorded by the labor reporting system. If such time was not recorded into tha system.
C. Apotication of the RCPL
1.	Employees eligible for an RCPL pursuant to paragraph A-1 above, shall receive the RCPL only when ths employee is working In a CCICS application.
2.	Employees eligible for an RCPL pursuant to paragraph A.t above, shall retain the RCPL if the employee successfully blds into a vacant position, is reduced to a
243
position or temporarily transferred to a position that la part of a CCICS application.
J. While working In a CCICS application, an employe* eligible for an RCPL may receive less than that rat* aa providedfor InSectfont C of tha CCICS Plan.
4.	Eligible employees will not receive the RCPL for any time worked In a norvCCICS application. In such cases, the employee will receive the base rate for that classification (plus incentive earnings, if applicable}*, provided however, that if an RCPL eligible employee is temporarily transferred to a non-CCICS indirect application the employee will receive the corresponding "non-CClCSrtndirect’ rate ot bls classification or the "non-CCiCSfindirect" rate of the job to which ha is transferred, whichever is greater or, if temporarily transferred to a non-CCICS direct application the employee will receive the "non-CCICSfSHP" rate of his classification or tha ’’non-CClCS/SHP" rate of the classification to which he is temporarily assigned, whichever is greater (plus incentive earnings}.
5,	Eligible employees who do not receive their RCPL because they are working in a non-CCICS application due to a reduction in force, permanent transfer or temporary assignment will regain tha RCPL when they return to a CCICS application.
6.	if an employee working in a CCICS application who is not entitled to, or eligible for, art RCPL is temporarily transferred to a non-CCICS application, the employe* will receive;

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Rian Process and Implementation
During the 1999 negotiations the parties recognized and agreed that if the Company is to remain competitive, it must continuously Improve its product quality, reliability and productivity. In order to maximize these efforts and minimize or eliminate the obstacles to an environment focused on teamwork, problem solving and continuous improvement th* parties Jointly concluded that the current compensation system based on individual Incentive payments is obsolete and must be replaced.
Achieving continuous improvement In the manufacturing environment will require the best effort* of all employee*. Therefore, th* compensation delivery system should encourage and motivate all covered employee* to utilize their knowledge, training, experience and talent in initiating, expecting and
245
accepting changes and in managing their workplace on a daily baste to promote and attain continuous improvement
Both parties realize that they must create and support a new culture which allows the Company to remain competitive and provide premium wages to its employees. An orderly, but timely, transition from the Case SHP system, set forth in Article XIII, Sections 5 and 6 at the 199$ Agreement {Exhibit A. herein), to the Case Continuous improvement Compernaticn System ("CCICS"), set forth In CCICS Plan, is critical to the continued competitiveness of the Company's manufacturing operations.
To facilitate thia transition and maximize employee support and involvement in this procees, a joint CCiCS Committee will be established at each manufacturing site. Each site specific committee will consist of three (3) Company representatives and Union representatives as follows;
Burlington
East Moline
Racine Tractor
Racine Transmission
Racine Foundry
•	3 (Local 60?) - 3 (Local 1304)
-	3 (Local ISO) • 3 (Local 190)
-	3(Local 100)
The Company will designate its representatives, one of whom shall be the Manager, Human Resources. The Local Union shall designate Its representatives, one ot whom shall be tha Chairman of the Bargaining Committee.
The role andfor function of the CCICS Committees will be to:
Plant Joint CCICS Committee
1,	Establish andlor review plan* and timetables for tho transition from SHP to CCICS in specific applications.
2.	Establish and provide guidance io, and oversight of, CCICS Implementation Teams.
3,	Discuss and resolve local plant CCICS issue*.
A CCICS Joint Implementation Team will comment on, and assist in, each CCICS application. It Is the intent of the parties that a Joint Implementation Team will exist for a specific CCICS
tv.-
245
application and transition from SHP. The tola and/or function ol these team* will ba ice
CCICS Joint Implementation Team
1. Develop CCICS applications within Ute parameters established by the Plant Joint CCICS Committee,
Z Identify communication and training requirements for CCICS participants.
3. Assist lr> implementing and maintaining that specific CCICS application.
Both parties believe this process will eliminate the Issues normally associated with these types of significant changes. However, In the event that issues Involving the Case Continuous Improvement Compensation System, or the details of a specific CCICS application established within its framework, cannot be resolved through this involvement process, the Company may elect to Implement that CCICS application. The iesuefs) wilt be referred, in writing, to a Centra) CC1C3 Committee composed of representatives from the International UAW and the Case Production System and Labor Relations departments. If this commutes cannot resolve the Issuefs) then the Union may refer the grievance to Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.
In accordance with Article V and Article VII of the Central Agreement disputes over CCICS, absent resolution by the parties, will ultimately he resolved in tha contractual grtevanceiarbiiraiion procedure. If such disputes are referred to Step 3 of the grievance procedure and the grievance is appealed to arbitration, the Union will have, as an alternative to arbitration, the option of moving the matter to the procedure sat forth in Article v. Section 2; provided however, that no strike will occur over these unresolved issues in that CCICS application prior to the end of the first semester of that CCICS application fi.e.. 2t weeks). The Company implemented CCICS application will remain In effect unless expressly changed by the outcome ot these proceedings.
It is further understood that the application of the Case SHP to a specific task or task* will terminate upon the implementation of a CCICS application and will not be reinstated.
The parties also recognize that, io maximize the success of this transition from SHP to CCICS, education and training in the CCICS
247
FiLE MH
Plan will be critical. This process rosy include the us* of outside consultants.
ATTACHMENT A
Re: RCPL's and Union Officials - Current Union Official RCPL Calculation and Use
Part Urn*
The Company will exclude ah union hours and equivalent pay for union lime from Union official* RCPL calculations. Therefore the calculation will then t>» similar to any other employee calculation. The Union official would then have a "clean" RCPL for use when they become a member of and are working in a CCICS application.
When they check out for "Aulhorteed Union Activity" as designated in the collective bargaining agreement, they would then be paid the CCICS rate (not their RCPL) which is the equivalent of 1iS% of old Schedule 0. Thia rate corresponds to th* payments In past and current labor agreements.
If that part time Union official leaves office, th* RCPL continues to be appropriate for use, as it doe* not contain any Union Pay. The RCPL will be the payment used for calculation of Vacation, Paid Absence Allowance, Attendance Sonus payments and Holiday Pay.
Full time
Full time officials who do not have arty regular hours of work on their job, (only work overtime or occasional performance on their jot*) would have union time dominate their RCPL calculation. Therefore, as with part time representatives, the RCPL win t>* recalculated. The representative* will be paid their CCICS rate (old B plus ts%) tor "Authorised Union Activity". They should have an RCPL developed, if they would otherwise have been eligible. for use when they perform work In a CCICS application. Averaging the RCPL'* of th* classification and department to which the Union Representative is assigned (home department and classification) will develop the RCPL. The RCPL is only applicable for use aa payment for Uma worked by the full time representative in a CCICS application and/or for use aa th*
24a
payment used in the calculation of » Vacation* Paid Absence Allowance, Attendance Bonus payments and Holiday pay rate.
Foil dm* representatives would likewise have this calculated RCPL for use it they leave office for any reason and return to work. It Is assumed that they would return to their home department and classification.
Page t. (Union Representatives and RCPL's coot)
Hew Union Officials (full time or part time)
Newly elected or Union officials who come into office after the date ot thia agreement (May 14,1998) shall bring their RCPL, If eligible, Into office with them and it shall be available for use when the official I* actively working in a CCICS application. When the official is checked out on Authorized Union Business they shall be paid the CCICS rate for Authorized Union time.
Newly elected officials who are not eligible for an RCPL shall receive their applicants CCICS rare for time worked in a CCICS application and shall likewise receive the applicable CCICS rate tor Union time as it Is equivalent to (old schedule B plus 15%)
RCPL eligible employees shall have the Vacation. Paid Absence Allowance, Attendance Bonus Payments and Holiday Pay calculated using the RCPL. RCPL Ineligible employees shall have the CCICS rate utilized for those calculations.
Exclusion of Union Hour* and the CCICS Application
All Union hours shall be excluded from the CCICS application, both in the calculation ot Team performance and an individuals participation In the team for purposes of dally participation, reserve fund distributions, buy back allowances and buy back bonuses.
Union Time and schedule A (Day Rate) and C (Skilled Trades) Employees
Thia Issue shall not effect Schedule A {Day Rate) and C (Skilled Trades) employees. They shall continue to receive their appropriate Skilled Trades rate or Day Rato from the wage schedule* for time worked as well as for pay for Authorized Union
249
Time. If they an in a CCICS application, their Union hours shall not be included In the team performance calculations, nor shall their Union hours count tor their participation In tha team for purposes of daily participation, reserve fund distributions, buy bach allowances and buy back bonuse*.

ARTICLE XIII WAGES
Section 5. Standard Hour Incentive Plan.
A. Principles.
Th* Union, the Company and the employees mutually recognize ■nd agree, that in order to provide maximum opportunities far continuing employment, good working conditions, lair and equitable wages, the Company must maintain or Improve its competitive position through maximum productivity and minimum costs; and further agree that the Company Vr4i be supported in its effort to improve productivity, eliminate waste, conserve materials and supplies, and improve quality or workmanship.
B,	Basic Plan
The bask incentive plan shall be a standard hour incentive plan in which the standard will be expressed in terms of standard minutes or hours for a specified quantity of production. However, other suitable time standards for incentive may be used in those situations where the standard hour plan is Inappropriate. Such situationswill be determined Car enough in advance so as to provide time for explanationsand discussions with th* Union as to th* reasons for utilizing any other plan. Any alternate plan will be designed to provide an incentive earnings opportunity in accordance with C (Establishmertt of Standanfs)of this section.
C.	Esublishmentof Standards.
(a) SUP incentive standards established after th* effective date of this agreement may be established by accepted Industrial Engineering techniques such a* time study, standard data, predetenninedtime systems, work sampling or a combinational these.
lb) A minimum personal and unavoidable delay allowance of 1TM will be applied to each work standard [made up or
251
8'4% personal and rest and 4% routine and unavotoable delay). Allowances over and above tha minimum will be applied when circumstances and conditions on the job warrant
Dv» to the nature of a particular operation other allowances, H appropriate (such aa toot change, multiple machine interference, etc.), will be applied In calculating the standard.
(c)	SUP incentive standards when set a* denned to (a) and (t>) above will be established to provide an earnings opportunity of approxlmatefy twenty-five percent (2S%) above standard on the manual portton of a job for a normal qualified operatorworking at normal Incentive pate
An incentive opportunity allowance of twonty-fivo percent (25%) shall be added to the machine or processcycle. This allowance will be added even though there exist manual elements, required by the established method, which are wholly internal to the machine or process cycle time; it being understood that manual elements may be added to more efficiently utilize such idle time without affecting the standard.
The objective in establishing new and revised standards under SH^ shell be to provide an opportunity tor a normal qualified operator working at a normal incentive pace to earn approximately twenty-five percent (2S%) above his bate rate. It is recognized that individual SHF standards may provide somewhat more or toss then the twnty-five percent (25%) earnings opportunity even though they are set as accurately as engineering techniques permitand the fact that employees do not achieve such performance and earnings I* not In itself grounds that tha standard is not correct In no case to the twenty-five percent (25%) to be construed as a minimum guaranteed aa an earning* limit However, an individual standard which does not provide an incentive opportunity of at feast twenty percent <20%) shall be considered unsatisfactory and subject to revision under subsection Id) below.
(d)	When a new or revised Incentive standard to established on a job, complaints and grievances shall be handled in accordance with the incentive Standards Complaint and Grievance Procedure (Section 8). Any change which 1*
252
made in the incentive standard pursuant to that procedure shall ba retroactive to the data that tha standard was established.
t») Before the Company observes any Job tor the purpose ot establishing or auditing a method or work standard, the employes assigned to tha lob and his steward shall ba notified in advance of its purpose.
|l) When establishing a standard by stopwatch study, such studies wWl bo ot sufficient duration to assure a sound standard. Sufficient duration would ba interpreted to mean a minimurn of ten <10) cycles - not to exceed an eight (S) hour period.
(g)	After the determination of a new incentive standard the employee sheeted will be informed of the new incentive standard. Where the standard was partiatty or wholly established by stopwatch study (and no estimated standard is involved) the now incentive standard will M used to compute the employee's Incentive earnings retroactive to the beginning of the week in which actual observation was started; provided, however, that during Iha period from the beginning of the week during which actual observation was started until the employee has been informed try his supervisor of the new standard, the employee will ba paid (lor hours applicable to work performed under the new standard) the greater of (1) actual earnings based upon a retroactive application of the new incentive standard, or (fifths Schedule A rate of that classification,
(h)	The use of video tape is an acceptable industrial engineering technique and win be used by the company's industrial engineering department under the following circumstances:
To develop improved methods and procedures.
To develop standards or standard data (using the MOST system)
To recheck existing methods, processes, or standards.
253
To record operations under Joint review 10 that tha parties rtiatf further attempt to resolve a disputed incentive standard following an actual joint study of such operation on the floor.
Recording methods, procedure* and operation* for subsequent use in training films for new employees and operator*.
Proper notification (minimum of IS minutes) wifi be made to the foreman, empioyeefs) and Union officials in the immediate area. Notification to the local chairman and respective committeeman will be provided In advance to the notice required above. The area or location being taped will be posted to inform all personnel entering the area. The video camera will be manned during the actual video taping of an operation.
Video tape sequence* taken for the purposes of work measurement will not be used for any promotional or advertising purpose* outside of the Company without written permission of the individual* shown in the sequence*.
The UWSR shall have access to all video tape* taken for th* purpose* of work measurement
All video tape sequences will be Identified as to date, plant work place, part number or other data as necessary to adequately identify the tap*.
The Industrial Engineering Department will maintain a video tap* library properly indexed and Identified for ready reference through use of sn official log of ad tapes and disposition.
Prior to its introduction, when new and/or revised data (developed from video tape) is available, the Union will bo notified and the UWSR may review such videotapes and/or data.	■
Whenever an employee working in an incentive classification is being video taped and is performing incentive work on an established permanent standard that is not currently subjectto a complaint or grievance, he will be paid a special rate of one hundred fifteen percent |11S%)
254
of the incentive bjSB rat* of his incentive earnings whichever Is higher if the video taping interfeces with hi* incentive esmirtgs. If he is not performing imcenUve work, the employee will receive th* payment provided in the contract for the situation Involved. Th)* ml* of payment shall not apply or change th* current pay practices at East Moline in effect under the Letter of Understanding regarding the conversion to SHP iocanbv* standards until the specific Job or task has been converted to the SHP standard. Prior to conversion, employee* at East Motine will be paid In accordance with the conversion Lecter and focal pay practices.
If an employe* who ia operating th* job scheduled to b* videotaped requests not to b* taped, a suitable qualified substitute will be assigned to perform the operation.
It I* also agreed that SHPtworkmassurament video taping will not b* allowed for the purpose of random audits, surveUianceor assessing discipline.
it is further agreed that video taping may also be used to develop processes that reflect improved Human Factors Engineering lErgonomfc* and other safety questions or disputes) subject to the above procedures and agreement*. The Local Union Safety Representative will have access to all video tapes taken for the purpose of health and safety.
(i)	During prior contracts the parties completed the conversion from an old Incentive system to the new SHP Incentive system. All agreements, memoranda or letter* of understanding, minute* and past practices relating to the establishment of standards or th* payment of employee* under the prior Incentive system and any and alt matters related thereto, whether written or oral are now null and void. The correctness of th* new SHP Incentive standards shell not be judged in any way by comparison to incentive standard* established under the prior incentive system or performance against such standards, buL rauwr by the provisions included in Xlll of this Agreemert.
(j)	The Company will notify th* appropriate steward approximately one workweek prior to th* installation of set up standards Into department* or cost centers where set ups have previously been unrated.
255
Ox Holte* at Job Requirementsand Standards.
An employee, upon assignment to a job to which a standard ha* been applied, shall be advised of the standard. A new or revised incentive standard shall be considered to be established when IM employees to whom It applies have been notified. Employees will be property instructed for the job* to which they are assigned and the Company will make available to the operator, either at his work stationer In the work area, the proper written method for the operation.
E. Changes in Work Standards
fa) Ah incentive standards in effect shall remain in effect for the duration ot this Agreement unless the standard shall become inapplicable and subject to replacement or revision resulting from changes of methods or procedures such a* feeds, speeds, tooling, material, workplace layout, quality level, or: an accumulation of any such changes which In total affects the time standard (or an individual standard which is part tt a group standard) by three (3) percent or more.
If changes, which affect a standard by less than three (3) percent are observed, no new standard shall be established, but the change win be documented and taken into account if future additional changes make the total change in IM standard time value three (3) percent or more. When the Company revises an incentive sandard because of accumulated minor changes which total to affect th* standard by three (3) percent or more, emptoyeefs) on the operation shall be advised of the basis for tha revision which shall be documented in accordance with the above; provided, that this procedure shall not prevent revision of the incentive standard with respect to other unrecorded accumulated changes under this Section so long as the documented accumulated changes equal three (J) percenter more
(b) When a standard is revised under (a) above, tn* extent of the change in the standard will be limited to those portions of the Job which have been recognizably altered or th* elements which have been changed of affected by the change-or accumulated change*. This limitation shall not apply in the case of a revamped method. In order to
256
determine whether a revamped method exteta ■ complete new study may be taken. Upon completion of the new study a comparison with the original standard will be made to establish the affect and extent of the revamped method. An Incentive standard once established shall not be changed merely because ol a change In name, symbol, part or operation number,
(c| Clerical or arithmetic error will be corrected when found and any necessary adjustment wiil tM made back to the day of the error but in no event mere than two (2) pay periods earlier than the day the error was called to either parlies attention,
jd) The three percent (3%J nite aa described above in Subsection (al does not apply to new or revamped (Subsection b) incentive standards whan timely complained and grieved under the Incentive Standards Complaint and Grievance Procedure In Section S of this article.
Section 4. Payment System,
A.	One tor One System.
The SHP shall be based upon the principle that an incentive employee will earn an additional one (1) percent of the incentive base rate for each one (1) percent of additional performance above the standard.
B.	Calculation of Incentive Eamlngs.
Incentive Eamlngs will be calculated for each employee for the total hours worked on incentive during each workday or for the period over which the Incentive eamlngs are computed If such period Is Kuigerthan a workday,
C.	Incentive Groups.
Wherever it is deemed to be practical, Incentive plans wider the SUP will tv based upon Individual performance. However, for some operations the Company may decide that individual ineentiveeare not practical and that the only practical incentive plan must bo administered on a group basis. In such cases the total performance hours earned by the employees comprising
257
the group Shalt be divided among the participating members of the group in proport Ion to the hour* spent in the group by each.
D.	Guarantee Rate.
The guarantee rat* for an incentive employe* who doe* not attain Incentive earning* during the calculation period set forth in paragraph B shall be the applicable incentive base rate for all hour* worked during such period.
An exception to th* calculation period set forth In paragraph B of this section shall be new and revised standards timely grieved as Io their correctness, in which case the guarantee of this paragraph shall be computed for the job or day. whichever is shorter (until 10 day* after the Union l» given the Company's 3rd Step answer or until the grievance is settled or withdrawn, whichever is sooner). Under this exception the guarantee rate is the incentive base rate.
E.	Hourly Rate lor IncentrveEmployeeB.
An employee working In an Incentiv* classification will be paid the applicable incentive base rata tor ail unrated work he performs in the classification except as follows:
fa) special rate of one hundred fifteen percent (115%) of the incentive base rate will bo paid to regular Incentive employees in the following circumstances:
(!) When he is assigned to make samples (display lobs).
12)	When he is assigned to rework another employee’* production; or to rework hl* own production if the need for tha rework was due to defective machinery or equipment (from the time the employee reports the condition to his supervisor); or to rework caused by an outside vendor.
Ths* subsection)!) shall only apply if th* employ** t* assigvwd to such rework and I* thereby deprived Of Incentive earning* opportunity. For example, it shall , not apply In cases where there i* no scheduled work to be run on incentive and the assignment constitutes "fill In" work nor shall such payment apply where the assignment Is made in a downtime situation.
258

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
R«: Principle; For The Converdon From IHP To CCICS
During the 1S98 negotiations the parties discussed tha Case Continuous Improvement Compensation System (CCICS), as the compensation delivery system to replace th* SUP incentive payment program.
The conversion from SHP to CCICS wilt be governed by the following Three (3) Principles:
A. The CCICS Plan is designed to incorporate continuous improvement and the teamwork concept while assuring that an eligible employees' historic SHP earning* level* for historic productivity will be maintained. No eligible employee will suffer a reduction In their earnings level for the same or greater productivity; however, this principle will not prevent the utitixation by mutual agreement of classification averages to determine an employee’s RCPL
This will be accomplished by providing eligible employees wth a Standard Hour Plan Red Circle Pay Level rate to be applied when working in the Case Continuous Improvement Compensation System. The intent of the Red Circle Pay level Rats Is to allow employees to preserve a comparable earnings opportunity. As stated above, a RCPL may be established for a teantigroup of employees by mutual agreement based upon the average of the employees in that classification. In this case. It is the Intent of the group RCPL to provide historic SHP earnings for historic productivity ot the group.
264
9. WMra differwca* between CCICS and tM CIPP program exist (earnings protection antiior plan features} that are not rotated WtM use of an RCPL retMr Wan 5HPCF and payment practices on temporary transfers C1PP will be followed subject to C below.
C, Difference* between CICCS application* and CIPP (eamlngs protection, plan features, ale.) will occur only where one at the following factors exists:
1. mutual agreement between the Company and the Union during ths transition period; or
X tn cases where historical differences, between a CCICS application at Case and the CIPP comparison, make a difference appropriate, e.g., historical earnings levels, productivity levels, data availability, manufacturing processes, etc.; or
tn order to provide for UAWfemployee input to the new program, the parties agreed that during the transition period (prior to January 1, 2000) they would meet and review the CCICS provisions related to employee eamlngs protection and/or other matter* rotated to the equitable application of CCICS terms in an effort to make the Plan’s Implementation lair and successful. Mutually agreed pilot program* may be developed and implemented at the facilities during this transition period.
TM procedure for addressing CCICS Issues during the transition period will be as follows:
1.	during tM transition period, prior to January 1.2000. tM parties will meet to determine whether meaningful differences in eamlngs protection exist between CCICS and tM CIPP;
2.	during this process each party will share ail Movant Information with tM other party which would Identify, or assist In the identification of, such meaningful differences between CCICS and CIPP in earnings protection;
3.	if a meaningful difference between CCICS and CIPP In earning* protection t* identified, th* parties will
265
m»*L review and wort toward finding a solution refecting tha employe* aaminga protection feature* contained In thia latter;
*. tha parties win also address other matters affecting the success of CCICS Implementation or which are related to tha equftsbta application of the CCICS formula for determining th* RCPL Or the cre»tkm of a Productivity Sasehne (e.g., Burlington Issue on significant “Input hours" out of class while on overtime);
5. unresolved differences during ths conversion will be subject to Uto CCICS Implementation and Process Letter of Understanding.
tn doing so, the parties both commit that these discussions will ba completed with the utmost good faith and with a sincere intent to resolve these issues.

Non-qualified individuals who become candidates for welding positions must complete the three phases of welder qualification training and testing within sixty calendar days from assignment into a welding classification.
2.	Phase I (approximately 16 hours of classroom training) Classroom training will be provided to each employee being transitioned into a welding classification as a resuB of layoff, recall or promotion.
Phase I training consists of the following:

b)	Safety considerations for welding.
c)	Welding principles and fundamentals.
d)	Welding quality standards.
e)	Welder qualification requirements.
A score of 60% or better is required on each of the three written tests administered during the classroom training. Any welder that fails to achieve a score of 60% on a written test will be given one opportunity to retake a similar (but not identical) test. Upon felling the retest, the welder shall be denied assignment, reduced from the classification and restricted from future openings.
Completed tests associated with the classroom training are maintained by the Weld Training Administrator for a minimum of six months.

A workmanship sample consists Of welding a Simple part from a dimensioned drawing that incorporates the same welding processes and types of weld joint configurations that the welder is likely to encounter in their welding classification.
A bend test consists of welding a vee groove joint on steel plates.
2.	Any welder who fails to meet the minimum acceptance criteria on a test has the following two options. Failure of the vision requirements disqualifies the welder from welding until corrective action is taken and the vision test is passed.
303
a) The welder may elect to take an immediate retest without additional training. In the case of a workmanship sample failure, the retest will consist of welding a similar (but not idenlicaJ) sample.
