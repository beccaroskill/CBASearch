The Chief or his designee shall, unless waived by mutual agreement, meet with or respond to, the grievant and his Association representative, if any, and shall give the grievant his written answer within ten (10) days of receipt of the grievance. The Chief of Police or his designee's written answer shall either sustain the grievance or give specific reasons for denial.

SECTION 5.4 - ARBITRATION: The parties shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of the receipt of notice of referral to arbitration. Absent agreement on an arbitrator, the parties by joint letter shall request that the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) provide them with a panel of not less than seven (7) neutral, qualified arbitrators, from which the parties may select a neutral party to resolve their dispute. The cost of this initial panel list of arbitrators shall be split evenly by the parties. Either party may reject one entire panel, provided such rejection notice occurs within five (5) days of the receipt of the list. The party rejecting the list shall be required to pay the full cost of the replacement panel. Each party shall have the right to strike three (3) names from the panel, using the alternate individual striking method, and the remaining person shall be the arbitrator. The order of striking shall be determined by coin toss. The arbitrator shall be notified by the parties by joint letter of his selection, requesting that he set a time and place for the hearing, subject to the reasonable availability of the representatives of both parties. All arbitration hearings shall be held in the City of Peoria, Illinois, unless otherwise mutually agreed.
SECTION 5.5 - AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR: The arbitrator shall act in a judicial, not a legislative capacity, and shall have no right or authority to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. He shall only consider and make a decision with respect to the specific issue(s) submitted, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue. In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the provision(s) of this Agreement specified in the grievance, he shall fashion an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator shall submit in writing his decision within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to a written extension of the deadline.

A decision rendered consistent with the terms of this Agreement shall be final and binding.
SECTION 5.6	- COSTS OF ARBITRATION: The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, if any, and the cost of a written transcript for the arbitrator, if any, shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and purchasing its own copy of the written transcript. Witnesses released from duty to testify at the hearing shall do so with pay.
SECTION 5.7	- GRIEVANCE TIME LIMITS: The time limits set forth in the grievance procedure shall
5
be adhered to strictly unless extended in writing by mutual agreement of the parties. All references to "days" shall be deemed to be calendar days. If the City fails to answer a grievance within the time limits set forth for a particular step, the grievant may treat the grievance as denied and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step. If the grievant fails to initiate or appeal within the stated time limits, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of the City's last answer. Waiver of any time limit in any case shall not create a precedent or practice for any other case. If the expiration date occurs on a Saturday or Sunday or holiday, the expiration date shall be extended to the following Monday if it is not a holiday, in the case of a holiday on that date, the expiration date shall be extended to the following day.
SECTION 5.8 - INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION: When investigating and settling a grievance, an employee(s)/grievant may be released from work without loss of pay for a total of not more than two (2) hours to investigate, write up the grievance and meet with the concerned parties.

The City shall not unreasonably withhold such permission. While meeting with management to resolve a grievance, the employee and the employee(s)/grievant will be paid only if the meeting is held during their normal working hours.
SECTION 5.9	- EXCLUSIVITY OF GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: Except as otherwise provided for, the procedure set forth in this Article shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for resolving any grievance, as defined in Section 5.1, which was or could have been raised by an employee covered by this Agreement or the Association.
SECTION 5.10	- WAIVER OF GRIEVANCE STEPS AND PROCEDURES: Grievance steps and arbitration procedures may be waived by mutual consent. Waiver of any grievance step or arbitration procedure shall not create a precedent or practice for any other case.
ARTICLE 6
RULES AND REGULATIONS
SECTION 6.1 - NOTICE: Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the right of the City to establish reasonable rules and regulations governing the conduct of employees and the performance of their duties, provided such rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 8 SAFETY
SECTION 8.1	- PROMOTION OF SAFETY: The City shall take reasonable steps for the protection and safety of officers during work hours and during the performance of their duties, other than the inherent risks of the job.

It is further understood that management requires a degree of flexibility as to the starting time of shifts in order to meet the needs of the public and to utilize manpower in the most efficient manner.
The shift starting and ending times for employees in each unit and division in effect at the time this Agreement was signed and executed shall be considered the normal duty shifts in effect.

Employees may request sick leave for pregnancy, childbirth and recovery there from or any period in which they cannot or should not on medical advice fully perform the duties of their position.
An employee who requests the use of sick leave shall make the request to his supervisor as far in advance as practicable but not less than one and one-half (1 1/2) hours before the beginning of his next scheduled tour of duty unless extenuating circumstances preclude such notification. Any employee who is in violation of this Section shall be considered absent without leave.
SECTION 13.2 - ACCRUAL OF SICK LEAVE: Sick leave may be accrued without limit and no employee shall be allowed to use sick leave in excess of his accrual as of the beginning of the pay period in which it is to be used.
Employees shall accrue sick leave at the rate of 8.00 hours per month of continuous service. Non-
12
probationary employees shall have 1.33 hours of this 8.00 hour monthly accrual deducted from their accrued sick leave balance and contributed directly into the employee’s Retirement Health Savings (RHS) Account.
The Employer is authorized to deduct and pay to the Trustee of the Retirement Health Savings (RHS) account established as described in Appendix A of this Agreement, for the benefit of the employee, sixteen (16) of these hours of compensation.
SECTION 13.3 - RETURN TO DUTY: Any employee who has taken sick leave for three (3) or more consecutive duty days may be required, as a condition of being allowed to return to duty, to submit certification signed by a reputable physician, stating that the employee or the specific member of the employee's immediate family was sick on the days which sick leave was used. In the case where the employee was sick or injured, the physician shall also certify that the employee is able to return to work and fully perform the duties of his position. The City shall have the right at its discretion and expense to have the employee examined by a physician chosen by the City and such employee shall not be allowed to return to duty until certified by the City's physician that he is able to perform the duties of his position. If the physician chosen by the City certifies that the employee is able to return to work and perform the duties of his position, and the employee was required to be examined by such physician prior to the return to work date certified by his physician, the employee will have any and all sick leave used for that purpose credited back to his accrued sick leave balance for such examination time.
SECTION 13.4 - ABUSE OR EXCESSIVE USE OF SICK LEAVE: Where the City reasonably suspects that an employee is abusing sick leave, the City shall have the right to require compliance with Section 13.3 above, regardless of the length of the sick leave.

Notwithstanding any prior practice, effective January 1, 2004, employees resigning or retiring from the Peoria Police Department shall not be allowed to utilize sick leave as “general paid time off’ prior to separation. Sick leave shall only be approved for use for those individuals who have a legitimate illness or injury as defined in Section 13.1.

201 -400 hours - 40%	601 and up - 80%

Maximum payout accumulations shall be as follows:
(a)	Employees may accumulate up to 960 hours.
(b)	All hours over 960 hours shall be paid annually by the Employer to the employee’s RHS account as follows:
13
(1)	To calculate the employee’s annual payment, the City will take the number of hours that exceeds 960 hours as of the end of the employee’s shift, if any, on December 31st of that particular year, and multiply the hours by the employee’s rate of pay as of December 31st in the same year.
(2)	The City will then multiply the amount in (b)(1) by 60%, resulting in the annual payment amount the City will pay into the employee’s RHS account.
(3)	The City will make the annual payment for a particular year, as calculated above, no later than the first pay period in March of the following calendar year.
The Parties acknowledge that 2017 will be the first year that the City will make annual payments for hours over 960, with such payment occurring no later than the first pay period in March of 2018.

SECTION 13.6-SICK LEAVE DONATION: An employee may donate sick, vacation, and/or personal leave to another employee who has exhausted all sick leave and is in documented need of sick leave due to illness. Employees requesting donation of sick, vacation, and/or personal leave shall notify the Captain of Administration in writing as far as in advance as practicable. The paid leave time will be valued at the donating employee’s current rate of pay, and will then be converted to the appropriate amount of time based on the donee's current hourly rate of pay (i.e. one hour for one hour).
Donated Sick Leave Time shall be permitted up to 12 months after the employee has exhausted all of his sick leave.
Vacation, Sick, and/or Personal Leave shall not be donated to another employee who is off work due to a work related injury or illness.
SECTION 13.7 - SICK LEAVE HOURS TRANSFER: An employee who transfers to another position with the City that is outside the bargaining unit shall be allowed to transfer his/her accrued sick leave hours to the other position. The use and pay for those accrued sick leave hours will be subject to City policy or the collective bargaining agreement covering the new position. Accrued sick leave hours transferred will be used prior to use of sick leave hours accrued in the new position. In the event that an accrued sick leave hours balance earned under PBPA agreements remains at the time of separation of employment, such payment for that part of the unused sick leave balance will be made in accordance with the payment requirements of the PBPA agreement that were applicable when the employee accepted the transfer.

EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE
SE	CTION 16.1 - STANDARDS OF DISCIPLINE: All disciplinary action against employees covered by this Agreement shall be carried out in accordance with department rules, regulations, orders, policies, procedures, city ordinances and state laws governing the discipline of law enforcement officers.
The City agrees with the tenets of progressive and corrective discipline where appropriate. However, when the severity of an infraction is great, dismissal outside the progression shall be considered an appropriate remedy. It should also be recognized that when using the principal of progressive discipline, all aspects of performance are taken into consideration. Individual infractions standing alone may not warrant action beyond the first, but when viewed cumulatively with warnings and other discipline actions, more extreme action may be appropriate. No non-probationary employee shall be disciplined without just cause.
SE	CTION 16.2 - DEPARTMENTAL DISCIPLINE: Disciplinary action rendered by the Department may take any one or more of the following forms:
a.	Oral reprimand;
b.	Written reprimand;
c.	Suspension without pay;
d.	Dismissal.
Rank of Sergeants and above are authorized to issue Oral reprimands. Rank of Lieutenants and above are authorized to issue written reprimands.
Suspensions without pay and dismissals shall be levied by the Chief of Police. Disciplinary suspensions without pay shall not exceed two-hundred forty (240) hours except as provided for in Section 17.2 (D). At the discretion of the Chief of Police, an officer may be allowed to trade paid leave time off (excluding sick leave) for a suspension without pay, limited to a disciplinary suspension of twenty-four (24) hours or less. By election to trade paid leave time off the officer agrees to waive his/her right to process a grievance on the disciplinary suspension. Officers shall have twenty (20) days from the date the officer is notified of such suspension to make the election to trade paid leave time for such suspension.
SECTION 16.3 - RIGHT TO REPRESENTATION: Employees shall have their right to Association representation at meetings within the Department when the employee(s) reasonably feels that disciplinary action may result. No suspension or dismissal will result without a prior offer to the employee to provide Association representation. Notices of disciplinary actions taken will be provided to the Association.
Any employee who is involved in any incident in which his actions result in death or serious injury to another may be compelled by order, as provided in Appendix C, to provide preliminary factual information to the supervisor in charge of the scene. The involved employee shall have the right to consult with an attorney chosen by the employee prior to and during any further interview, interrogation or questioning, prior to and after being required to prepare and submit any report including special reports regarding the incident. When such request for counsel is made, no interview or interrogation or questioning shall proceed, nor shall any written statement or report be required to be submitted, until reasonable time and opportunity are provided the employee to obtain
19
counsel.
No employee under formal investigation shall be questioned without first being informed of their rights under Garrity vs. New Jersey.
SECTION 16.4 - REVIEW OF DISCIPLINE: Review of any disciplinary action by the Chief of Police or his designee shall be grievable, providing the grievance is filed within twenty (20) days after the employee is notified of the discipline.
Disciplinary grievances shall be initially filed at Step 2 or at Step 3, as determined by the Chief of Police.
If the employee is not satisfied with the resolution of the grievance by the City Manager or his designee at step 3, the Association may, at the request of the employee, proceed to arbitration by notifying the Director of Personnel and Labor Relations within ten (10) days of the receipt of the step 3 response as set out in the grievance procedure in Article 5.
SECTION 16.5 - UNIFORM PEACE OFFICERS' DISCIPLINARY ACT: The Uniform Peace Officers' Disciplinary Act (50 ILCS 725/1 (1992) et. seq.) shall apply.
SECTION 16.6 - CONDUCT OF INVESTIGATION: Investigations shall be conducted expeditiously and consistent with employee's rights under law. Promptly upon the conclusion of the investigation, the employee shall be notified in writing of the results of an investigation in which the charge has been determined to be not sustained and if not, advised whether the department intends to take disciplinary action. Any employee, while serving such a suspension without pay, shall not have his off-duty employment, which does not involve the exercise of police powers, refused without just cause.
SECTION 16.7 - EXPUNGEMENT OF RECORDS: In keeping with the parties' agreement that discipline is to be corrective, it is agreed that all files maintained concerning an employee shall be expunged of any reference to his disciplinary history in accordance with the following:
(a)	Oral Reprimand - one (1) year.
(b)	Written Reprimand - two (2) years
(c)	Disciplinary Suspension: Will remain permanently in the individual's personnel file.
SECTION 16.8 - STATUS DURING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS: When an employee is arrested for or charged with a criminal offense or when a domestic violence order of protection that includes a firearms prohibition is issued against an employee, the employee will be immediately placed on administrative leave with pay unless the employee has been formally charged in court with a felony, in which case the administrative leave shall be without pay.
When a domestic violence order of protection that includes a firearm prohibition is issued against an employee as a result of an emergency or interim hearing and the employee has not been formally charged in court with felony, the employee will be immediately placed on administrative leave with pay, or at the Chiefs discretion, on restricted duty with police powers suspended for a period of up to ninety (90) calendar days pending a plenary hearing or the dismissal of the order of protection, whichever occurs first.
When an officer is formally charged with a felony and subsequently acquitted, the Department shall make the officer whole for any regular wages, accrued benefits and seniority forfeited between the time the officer was placed on Administrative leave without pay and the time the officer was acquitted. It is understood that any
20
disciplinary suspension or termination related to the criminal offense or felony charge is subject to the grievance procedure, and that the determination of any forfeited compensation, if any, will be based on the settlement of the grievance or the decision of the labor arbitrator.
The Department shall promptly investigate the incident consistent with the Department’s policy of not interfering with a criminal investigation. In the event that criminal charges are filed by indictment or information, or in the event a domestic violence order of protection that includes a firearms prohibition is entered or continued after a plenary hearing at which the employee had the opportunity to appear, the employee will be carried on administrative leave without pay, (1) pending resolution of the criminal charge; (2) a determination by the Chief of Police that, because of the nature of the charges, the employee may be returned to full or restricted duty during the pendency of the charges; or (3) termination of an order of protection that includes a firearms prohibition.
Time on such administrative leave without pay shall not be considered discipline, but the Chief of Police shall credit such time on administrative leave without pay against any suspension that might subsequently be entered against the employee for that incident.

2.	Assessment Center Examination - 35%
3.	Employee Confidence Rating - 15%
The written and assessment center examinations will be administered by or under the direction of an outside consultant employed by the City. The assessment center examination will be conducted by command level police officers from City police departments outside the immediate Peoria area who have at least five (5) years of command level police experience in a city with a population, including its surrounding metropolitan area, of at least 50,000 and who are not personally acquainted with any of the candidates. All interviewers shall receive appropriate training from the consultant in the assessment center process. None of the suggested responses to the questions asked during the interview will be in violation of applicable Peoria Police Department policies and procedures, applicable State and Federal laws and City of Peoria ordinances. All assessment center examinations shall be audio and video recorded. Candidates may view/listen to their own video/audio recording to review their performance.
All eligible candidates shall be permitted to participate in the assessment center examination and the written examination. The written examination is weighted at 50% with a maximum of 50 points possible. The assessment center examination is weighted at 35% with a maximum of 35 points possible. The maximum combined score of the assessment center and written examination is 85 points after they are given their appropriate weight. A minimum composite score of the assessment center and written examination must be 70% or 59.5 (85 x .70 - 59.5) in order for the candidate to be placed on the list for the employee confidence rating and to move on in the promotional process. A list of the names of the candidates with a composite score of 70% or higher will be posted in alphabetical order for employees to complete the employee confidence rating. All sworn personnel of the Peoria Police Department holding the rank of non-probationary officer through Chief of Police may complete an employee confidence rating for the sergeant promotional candidates who are on the list. Employees wishing to complete an employee confidence rating are to rate twenty (20) sergeant promotional candidates in rank order on how the rating employee believes the candidate would be able to perform the duties of a sergeant. A ranking of "1" indicates the candidate is most qualified, a ranking of "2" indicates the candidate is the next most qualified, etc. Employees will rate only twenty (20) sergeant promotional candidates from the list. Candidates receiving ratings will be assigned point values as follows:
1.	40	6.	30	11.	20	16.	10
2.	38	7.	28	12.	18	17.	8
3.	36	8.	26	13.	16	18.	6
4.	34	9.	24	14.	14	19.	4
5.	32	10.	22	15.	12	20.	2
26
The sergeant promotional candidates rating points will then be, totaled and converted to a percent score based on the total possible points. This score will carry a weight value of 15% toward the total weighted score. The twenty (20) candidates with the highest total weighted score will become the sergeant's promotional list.
SECTION 21.4 - LIEUTENANT PROMOTIONS: Promotion to the rank of lieutenant shall be open to all sergeants who, at such time as the then current promotional list expires, have served in the rank of sergeant or above for not less than two years.

The maximum combined score of the assessment center and written examination is 85 points after they are given their appropriate weight. A minimum composite score of the assessment center and written examination must be 70% or 59.5 (85 x .70 - 59.5) in order for the candidate to be placed on the list for the employee confidence rating and to move on in the promotional process. A list of the names of the candidates with a composite score of 70% or higher will be posted in alphabetical order for employees to complete the employee confidence rating. All sworn personnel of the Peoria Police Department holding the rank of non-probationary officer through Chief of Police may complete an employee confidence rating for the lieutenant promotional candidates who are on the list. Employees wishing to complete an employee confidence rating are to rate twenty (20) lieutenant promotional candidates in rank order on how the rating employee believes the candidate would be able to perform the duties of a lieutenant. A ranking of "1" indicates the candidate is most qualified, a ranking of "2" indicates the candidate is the next most qualified, etc. Employees will rate only twenty (20) lieutenant promotional candidates from the list. Candidates receiving ratings will be assigned point values as follows:
1.	40	6.	30	11.	20	16.	10

5.	32	10.	22	15.	12	20.	2
27
The lieutenant promotional candidates rating points will then be, totaled and converted to a percent score based on the total possible points. This score will carry a weight value of 15% toward the total weighted score. The twenty (20) candidates with the highest total weighted score will become the lieutenant's promotional list.
SECTION 21.5 - FILLING OF VACANCIES: When the City elects to fill a vacancy in the ranks of Sergeant or Lieutenant, the Chief of Police shall choose from among the three candidates having the highest overall score. If fewer than three candidates remain on the promotional eligible register, then the Chief of Police shall choose from among those remaining.

The Chief of Police shall not arbitrarily or capriciously deny such approval. If permanent vacancies occurring during the year are filled, they shall be filled on the basis of seniority within the unit.

Employees who voluntarily transfer to another organizational unit after annual shift bid shall not be allowed to use their seniority for days off and shift assignment until the next vacancy occurs in the organizational unit to which they transfer, or until the next annual selection of shifts and days off, whichever occurs first. In the case of a vacancy transfer within an organizational unit, the vacancy shall be filled and days off selected on the basis of seniority. Probationary officers, upon completion of Field Training may be assigned to a shift and off days in Patrol at the Chief’s discretion. Such officers shall remain in that assignment until the first Patrol shift bid (Annual or mid-year), and shall bid into a vacant position at the first bid opportunity.

The employee shall be given reasonable advanced notice of the temporary transfer. Employees shall be required to work temporary positions for not more than one hundred eighty (180) days per year, per employee, unless the position opening is due to illness, injury or military service. For purposes of this section, a
32
year will commence on the day the officer is transferred.

This clause shall not constitute any form of a waiver of the legal rights afforded each party under applicable Federal and State Statutes.
ARTICLE 36

Occasionally the City may decline to pay for training trips. The employee may feel that the trip would be of benefit to the employee's professional development, and therefore, would be willing to pay the expenses if the employee were permitted authorized time off from work at full salary. The authorization shall come from the Chief of Police.
Any employee assigned to a Four-Day Shift that attends an authorized training session that is less than ten (10) hours, will be required to work the remaining hours to meet the 10-hour shift requirement.

Once an employee's shift has ended, if they are still involved in negotiations, time spent negotiating will not be compensable. Requests for time off to participate in negotiations must be made with adequate advance notice to their supervisors. This section does not supersede Section 36.2 of the present contract.

APPENDIX E
Mediation/Arbitration Procedure “Med/Arb”
“Med/Arb” is a process under which the mediator begins the process by attempting to mediate a settlement. The process is limited solely to disagreements relative to proposed changes covered in Section 9.3(b) of the Agreement. If unable to settle the disagreement, the Mediator assumes the role of Arbitrator and the meeting changes to a hearing.
The following guidelines apply to the resolution of a disagreement under the Med-Arb procedure:
a)	If agreement has not been reached by October 8 the parties, will during the next seven (7) calendar days, contact the Mediator-Arbitrator from the Med-Arb panel who is next in the selection rotation. Should that Mediator-Arbitrator be unable to schedule a Med-Arb hearing on or before November 15, the parties will contact the next Mediator-Arbitrator in the selection rotation until one is selected who can provide a hearing date on or before November 15.
b)	After the Mediator-Arbitrator has been selected, the parties shall prepare and exchange a Statement of Facts and Position within fifteen (15) calendar days of the hearing date, and submit same to the Mediator-Arbitrator.
c)	The proceeding shall be limited to one (1) day. If after four (4) hours of mediation an agreement has not been reached, the meeting will change from mediation to an arbitration hearing. The Mediator-Arbitrator may conclude the mediation portion of the hearing prior to four (4) hours if he/she concludes that a mutual agreement cannot be reached.
d)	No transcript or stenographic record of the hearing shall be permitted.
e)	No pre-hearing or post-hearing briefs shall be permitted.
f)	Representation by counsel shall be permitted for either party.
g)	Each party shall be limited to three (3) representatives. In the arbitration phase, each party shall be limited to three (3) witnesses, in addition to opening and/or closing statements by counsel.
h)	No hearing date continuances shall be permitted except by mutual agreement or due to the incapacity of the Mediator-Arbitrator selected in accordance with the Med/Arb panel selection procedure.
i)	The Mediator-Arbitrator’s authority shall be limited solely to either the approval of the proposed change(s) of the Chief of Police covered under Section 9.3(b) or maintenance of the status quo as advocated by the Union. The Mediator-Arbitrator has no authority to substitute any other remedy.
j)	The Mediator-Arbitrator shall issue a written “bench” decision at the conclusion of the hearing that will be limited to a one (1) page statement of whether and what proposed change(s) were approved or rejected.
k)	The decision of the Mediator-Arbitrator is final and binding upon both parties.
1)	Any decision rendered pursuant to this provision shall be precedent setting.
m)	All parties to this process agree that it is the exclusive process during the term of this Agreement for the resolution of disagreements covering subjects of Section 9.3(b) of the Agreement and waive any rights to use any and all administrative and contractual processes for resolution of such disagreements.
n) The fees and expenses of the Mediator-Arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties.
Arbitration Panel Selection
The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will be jointly requested to send a list of five (5) Mediator-Arbitrators from the Midwest region with mediation-arbitration experience. Each party will strike two (2) names from the list received from FMCS. In addition to the Mediator-Arbitrator selected from the FMCS list each party shall appoint two Mediator-Arbitrators to the panel.
49
The names of the five (5) Mediator-Arbitrators selected will be placed in a hat and drawn out to establish the selection rotation of the initial Med-Arb panel. Any vacancies that may occur on the panel later will be filled through the FMCS request and strike-off procedure outlined above.
The submission of the initial list of Mediator-Arbitrators and the joint request for the FMCS list for the Med-Arb panel shall be accomplished within thirty (30) calendar days of the approval of the Agreement by the City Council and the final panel selection shall be made within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the FMCS list.. A party that does not submit a Mediator-Arbitrator list within the time period described shall waive its right to strike Mediator-Arbitrators or submit a later list for the duration of the Agreement, and the Mediator-Arbitrator list of the other party shall be utilized as the final panel.
In the event that the Mediator-Arbitrator selected to handle the Med-Arb hearing is unable to schedule the hearing on or before November 15, the next Mediator-Arbitrator on the panel rotation will be selected, and so forth, until a Mediator-Arbitrator is chosen who can meet the hearing time deadline. If no Mediator-Arbitrator on the panel can comply with the November 15 hearing date, the Mediator-Arbitrator with the earliest hearing date available shall be selected, provided such hearing date is not later than November 30.
A Mediator-Arbitrator, as a condition for selection to the panel, shall be informed in advance of the requirement, that if selected for a hearing, he/she must establish a hearing date between October 16-November 15. The parties agree to schedule such hearing on any calendar day, excluding holidays covered under Section 12.1 of the Agreement, during the October 16-November 15 time period.
All hearings shall be held in the City of Peoria, Illinois unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
50
APPENDIX F
ARTICLE 17
FITNESS FOR DUTY
SECTION 17.1 - EMPLOYEE TESTING AND FITNESS FOR DUTY: No employee shall be requested or required to undergo psychological, psychiatric or physiological testing unless the Chief of Police has just cause to believe the employee is then unfit for duty. Basis for the just cause shall be set forth in writing to the employee at the time the employee is ordered to undergo such testing. Employees shall have the right to Association representation when being informed of the need for testing, and shall have the right to secure similar testing at their own expense from psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians of their own choosing. The employer and the employees shall only utilize the services of qualified, certified medical doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists. The employee shall be given a copy of any and all information, reports and opinions that are provided the City as a result of such testing.
A female officer during her pregnancy shall have the option to not participate in firearms qualification. The officer will be required to qualify upon her return to full duty after the pregnancy.
SECTION 17.2 - DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORKPLACE:
I.	POLICY:	It is the policy and commitment of the City and the Association to provide an environment
within the workplace which is free from prohibited drugs and alcohol in order to protect the employees as well as the health and safety of the public. The City recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse is considered by many to be an illness and encourages its employees to voluntarily utilize the City's employee assistance program before such abuse affects the employee's job performance.
A.	Illegal drugs; consumption, possession or distribution of alcohol.
1.	Any employee who consumes, possesses or distributes alcohol or controlled substance while in the workplace or while on duty shall be terminated from the employ of the City; provided, that this shall not apply to consumption, possession or distribution specifically directed or authorized by the employee's supervisor in the performance of the employee's duty; nor to possession or consumption according to directions of the prescribing physician of legal prescription drugs.
2.	Any employee who fails to notify the City within five (5) days after they are convicted of a criminal drug offense for a violation taking place in the workplace or while conducting City business, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
3.	Any employee convicted of a criminal drug offense regardless of when or where that act takes place, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
4.	The City shall provide employees and supervisors with a positive program of drug education and make everyone aware of help that is available for such a problem.
B.	Call Out. The parties recognize that employees may be placed in a conflict arising from the fact that employees who are not on standby are not prohibited from consuming alcohol or legal drugs while off duty, but are subject to emergency call out during off-duty hours. Accordingly, when employees are notified of any emergency call out from off-duty, the following procedure shall apply.
51
1.	The employee called out shall advise the department representative notifying him if he has consumed alcohol or legal drugs during the day of the call out and the extent of such activity.
2.	The officer in charge of the call out shall assess the employee's condition and fitness for duty in accordance with the .04 standard for impairment set forth in this section, and either assign him to duty or, if the employee is determined to be impaired, will not allow him to sign in for duty. This provision shall not authorize the officer in charge of the call out to order an officer who is contacted for a call out to submit to a test for blood alcohol content.
3.	Any employee who reports for the call out without informing the department of his consumption of alcohol or legal drugs as required in paragraph 1 above, shall not be allowed to work if he appears to be impaired and shall not be paid for reporting.
C.	Voluntary Referral: It is specifically agreed that no employee shall be disciplined or the subject of adverse employment action for the first instance where the employee notifies the Employer that he has a problem with legal prescription drug or alcohol use, and voluntarily seeks assistance prior to initiation of an investigation of suspected drug or alcohol abuse by the employee. In the event that an employee who has notified the department as stated in this section is disciplined for the drug or alcohol abuse after an investigation is initiated by the employer, the employer shall, upon the employee's request, provide the employee with written documentation of the date an investigation was initiated. Such employees shall be referred by the managerial employee who is notified to the City's employee assistance program for confidential counseling and treatment. Such voluntary participation shall not confer immunity from discipline for any misconduct other than the substance abuse. The managerial employee shall not divulge any information received from the employee who voluntarily seeks the help of the employee assistance program except within the City administration on a strict need to know basis. Information concerning the employee's voluntary referral shall not be disseminated outside of the City administration, except with the employee's written authorization or if required, pursuant to legal discovery. Such voluntary referral to the employee assistance program, however, does not relieve the employee from the responsibility to adequately perform their job. In addition, voluntary submittal does not eliminate the employee from the requirements to take required drug or alcohol tests as described in this Article.
D.	Disciplinary Action for Confirmed Positive - Alcohol or Legal Drugs Other Than Valid Prescriptions.
1.	First Positive. The first confirmed positive test result will be cause for disciplinary action up to and including a two-hundred forty (240) hour disciplinary suspension. The employee must agree to the following conditions: (1) the employee will be mandatorily referred to the City's Employee Assistance Program for evaluation, diagnosis and development of a treatment plan consistent with generally accepted standards; and (2) the employee will be required to cooperate in the treatment plan, undergo unannounced periodic drug and/or alcohol screening for a period of up to 12 months, successfully complete the prescribed treatment, remain free of drug and alcohol use, and sign an agreement consenting to said conditions. The unannounced periodic drug and/or alcohol screening provided for in this paragraph shall be done while the employee is on duty, provided, however, that if the employee was scheduled to work and has called in sick, he may be ordered to undergo such drug and/or alcohol screening. Failure to comply with these conditions of continued
52
employment shall be cause for further discipline, up to and including discharge.
2.	Second Positive - During Treatment. If an employee has a first confirmed positive test under the previous Paragraph 1 and enters a treatment program, and thereafter that employee has a subsequent confirmed positive test result while the employee is in treatment, as a result of unannounced periodic drug and/or alcohol screening, the employee shall receive a seven-hundred twenty (720) hour disciplinary suspension and shall be required to continue in treatment and comply with the other conditions of treatment set forth in the preceding paragraph. The appropriateness of the seven-hundred twenty (720) hour disciplinary suspension shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Any confirmed positive test thereafter, either random, periodic unannounced or reasonable suspicion, shall result in the employee's discharge, which penalty shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	Second Positive - Reasonable Suspicion or Random. An employee who has a first confirmed positive test under Paragraph 1 of this Section D and who subsequently has a confirmed positive test under the random or the reasonable suspicion standard shall be discharged, which penalty shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee and the penalty shall not be subject to the grievance procedure in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
4.	Employment Status. There is no requirement on the part of the City to keep an employee on active employment status who is receiving treatment under this Section if it is appropriately determined by a physician and/or appropriately certified medical and/or psychological professional either that the employee's current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing his duties or that his continuance on active status would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of himself or others. Such employee shall be afforded the opportunity to use accumulated paid leave or take an unpaid leave pending treatment.
E.	Other Related Discipline. This section shall in no way limit discipline for offenses other than substance abuse, nor shall it limit the discipline to be imposed for selling, purchasing, possessing, using or delivering any illegal drug. In cases of misconduct arising out of, related to, or aggravated by alcohol or drug abuse, the discipline imposed shall be based upon the extent, severity, and/or consequences of the misconduct.
Except as provided in paragraph B above, no employee shall consume any alcohol within 4 hours prior to reporting for duty.
F.	Costs of Testing and Rehabilitation. The City agrees to bear the costs of all testing ordered by the City, and of rehabilitation programs ordered by the City to the extent they are not covered by the employee's health care provisions or insurance. The employee may be required to assist the City in coordinating benefits of insurance coverage.
II.	PROCEDURE.
A.	The Chief of Police or his designee may order any employee to submit to an immediate test of his blood, breath and/or urine at any time he has reasonable suspicion to believe the employee to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs while on duty, to have consumed alcohol
53
while on duty without authorization, to have illegal drugs in his system, or the employee was driving a City vehicle involved in an accident that resulted in death and/or great bodily harm requiring immediate medical attention at an emergency or outpatient facility. The basis for the reasonable suspicion shall be documented and given to the employee in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of giving such test. If the results of the drug tests are negative the Association shall have the right to challenge whether reasonable suspicion existed for the ordering of the test.
In addition, the Chief of Police shall have the right to order random tests for the presence of alcohol or illegal drugs of all employees. In addition to "employees" as defined in this Agreement, the random test pool shall include all other commissioned officers in the Peoria Police Department.
A test for the presence of illegal drugs shall also be a part of any medical examination ordered by the City in connection with promotions, recall or the return to duty after leaves. All tests ordered by the City shall be at the expense of the City.
The refusal by any employee to submit to and complete any testing provided for under this Article, shall subject the employee to immediate discharge.
Any employee who tests positive for the presence of illegal drugs shall be subject to discharge. Individuals consuming alcohol or having BAC of .04% or more while on duty shall be subject to disciplinary action as provided in this Section 17.2.
Employees ordered to submit to drug and alcohol testing shall promptly comply with the order. Employees who submit to such tests shall not be deemed to have waived or otherwise impaired their rights to grieve or otherwise contest any aspect of the testing as may be provided by law or this Agreement. Employees shall have the right to Association representation during the testing procedure, except during actual collection of the sample. The testing procedure shall not be unreasonably delayed due to unavailability of an Association representative.
B.	The City agrees that its testing procedure for the presence of drugs or alcohol shall conform to the following:
1.	Use only a SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) certified or licensed laboratory to test body fluids or materials for drugs whose collection, handling, testing and preservation of sample and reporting are in accordance with SAMHSA standards. The City shall have the right to utilize any certified laboratory of its choosing. Breath tests ordered under this Section solely for disciplinary purposes shall be performed by a United States Department of Transportation (DOT) certified operator who is employed by an independent third party contractor which either operates or is affiliated with the SAMHSA certified laboratory selected for the blood and urine testing. All breath tests shall be done on a DOT certified breath analysis machine;
2.	Establish a chain of custody procedure for both sample collection and testing that will insure the integrity of and identity of each sample and test result;
3.	Collect a sufficient sample of the same body fluid or material to permit for an initial screening, a confirmatory test, and a sufficient amount to be set aside and reserved for later testing if requested by the employee. In the case of urine testing, it shall be a split sample;
4.	Collect all samples in such a manner as to preserve the individual employee's right to
54
privacy, insure a high degree of security for the sample and its freedom from adulteration. Employees shall not be witnessed while submitting a sample. Proper testing may be conducted to prevent the submission of a false or adulterated sample;
5.	Confirm any sample that tests positive in the initial screening for drugs by use of gas chromatography, with mass spectrometry or an equivalent scientifically accurate and accepted method that provides quantitative data about the drug metabolites. Confirm any positive breath alcohol screening test with a test of the employee's blood by use of gas chromatography or an equivalent scientifically accurate and accepted method;
6.	Provide the employee tested with an opportunity to have an additional portion of the same sample tested by a licensed testing facility of his own choosing;
7.	Require that the clinical laboratory report to the City through its Medical Review Officer positive results only in the case where both the initial and confirmatory test results are positive as to the same sample;
8.	Provide each officer with a report of the confirmed positive results of each drug test that includes the types of tests conducted, the results of each test, the detection level used by the laboratory and any other information provided to the City by the laboratory;
9.	Insure that all positive samples are maintained for a period of not less than 120 days to permit additional testing at the election of and the expense of the employee;
10.	Insure that no officer is reassigned or subject to any discipline during any testing procedure pending the results thereof;
11.	If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration of 0.04% of alcohol in the employee's
blood stream (alcohol concentration shall mean grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grains of alcohol per 210 liters of breath), the employee will automatically be deemed "under the influence" of alcohol within the meaning of this Policy, and therefore, may be subject to discipline under this Policy;
12.	The testing or processing phase for body fluids shall consist of a two-step procedure: a.	Initial screening test.
b.	Confirmation test.
13.	The body fluid sample is first tested using the initial drug screening procedure. An initial positive test result will not be considered conclusive; rather, it will be classified as "confirmation pending." Notification of test results to the City shall be held until the confirmation test results are obtained;
14.	A body fluid specimen testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. The confirmation procedure shall be technologically different and more sensitive than the initial screening test;
15.	Personnel utilized for testing will be certified as qualified to collect samples or adequately trained in collection procedures;
16.	Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA shall be considered
55
a positive test result when using the initial immunoassay drug screening test. At the present time, those levels are:
INITIAL TEST
Level - Nanogram/Milliliter (hereafter referred to as (ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite ..................... 50
Cocaine metabolite	..................... 300
Opiate metabolite .......................................... 2000
Phencyclidine...................... 25
Amphetamines ............................. 1000
Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for confirmatory tests shall be considered a positive test result when performing a confirmatory Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectophotomotry test on a urine specimen that tested positive using a technologically different initial screening method:
CONFIRMATORY TEST
Marijuana metabolite .................
Cocaine metabolite	.................
Opiates:
Morphine	...................
Codeine	...................
6-AcetyImorphine .........................
Phencyclidine.........................
Amphetamines:
Amphetamines .........................
Methamphetamine ......................
Level (ng/ml) 15* 150**
2000
2000 jq***
25
500 500****
*	Delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid
*	* Benzoylecgonine
*	** Test for 6-AM when morphine concentration exceeds 2000 nanograms/milliliter
*	*** Specimen must also contain amphetamine at a concentration >=200 nanograms/millilter
17.	Where a positive result is confirmed, specimens shall be maintained in secured, refrigerated storage for at least a period of one hundred twenty (120) days;
18.	For random drug tests, the following additional conditions shall apply:
(a)	The City will contract with an independent third party to provide random selection services through use of a computerized random number generator program based on unique 3-digit identification numbers developed by the City for the random testing process. The City shall specify the percentage of commissioned positions (which shall be at least 25%) that are to be tested annually, and the number of dates on which the body substance specimens are to be collected. The random number generator will then select the dates, the individuals to be tested on each date, and the shift (first, second, third or fourth) on which the collections shall begin. When the collection process begins on second, third or fourth shifts, the preceding shifts shall be processed on the following day.
56
(b)	To maintain the security of the selection system, the contractor shall deal exclusively with the Assistant Chief of Police or in his absence, the Administrative Captain, for purposes of notifying the City of testing dates and individuals selected, verifying and updating the pool and supplemental selection of individuals, if necessary.
(c)	When the department contact person is notified of a testing date by the selection contractor, he/she shall promptly contact the President of the Association, or such other individual as has been previously designated in writing by the President to notify the Association of the test date. In the absence of the President or designated alternate, the department shall attempt to notify the officers of the Union in descending order of their office. It shall be the obligation of the Association representative to promptly come to the office of the Assistant Chief of Police to participate in the verification of the random drug test pool roster, and verification of the selection of officers to be tested.
(d)	Upon the arrival of the Association representative, the department contact person shall notify the selection contractor to fax the existing random drug test pool roster and the contractor shall sign the roster submitted. Upon receipt of the roster from the selection contractor, the department contact person in the presence of the Association representative shall update and verify the roster to include the random test identification numbers for all officers. The department contact person and the Association representative shall both sign off on the roster and return it to the selection contractor by fax. The contractor will promptly do the random selection and return the list to the department contact person having signed off on it. The department contact person and the Association representative will then check the selection list against the updated roster to insure that all of the numbers selected are on the roster. Within one week after the testing date, the department shall deliver to the Association "signed off' copies of the initial roster submitted by the contractor, the updated roster returned by the department, and the selection list sent by the contractor. All copies of rosters, lists and other related records shall be maintained in secure storage by both parties, allowing access on a strict need-to-know basis.
(e)	The department contact person will then create a list of names from the identification numbers and will sort the list by unit and shift for notification of the officers to be tested. After the start of the shift on which the testing is to begin, the department contact person shall deliver the respective lists of names in sealed envelopes to the shift/bureau commanders of the officers to be tested. It shall be the responsibility of the shift/bureau commander to insure that all of the officers in his command to be tested report to the collection site as promptly as practical, but in any event before they secure from the shift.
(f)	Any officer selected who is on authorized time off which was applied for and approved prior to notice to the department of the date of the test shall be required to report to the collection site on his/her first day back from preapproved leave. Any officer who requests leave of any type after the department has been notified of the testing date shall be required to report to the collection site on the shift he would otherwise have been required to report unless he is excused by the Chief of Police for good cause shown. Any officer so excused shall be required to report to
57
the collection site on his first day back to work.
(g)	When an officer is selected in the random process, he/she shall promptly report to the appropriate collection site upon the direction of his/her commanding officer or supervisor. He/she shall provide specimens of urine sufficient to allow for "split sample" collection and processing of the specimens. He/she shall also supply a breath sample sufficient for a breath alcohol test. In the event that the breath sample registers a breath alcohol reading of .04 or greater, the officer shall also submit a blood sample sufficient for a confirmatory blood alcohol test.
(h)	The City will direct the laboratory to provide to the Association, at the Association's mailing address, copies of the quarterly statistical summary which shows the number and types of tests performed and the number of tests showing positive or negative, as well as copies of the bi-monthly proficiency reports of the laboratory at the same time they are sent to the City.
C.	The City agrees to maintain all records concerning drug problems of its employees, including all records pertaining to City required drug tests, in the utmost confidence, subject to legal discovery. If the City receives a discovery request for any records regarding drug problems of an employee and it decides to comply with that request, it shall notify the employee prior to releasing any of the records. Except when required pursuant to legal discovery, no records concerning the drug problems of any employee shall be released to other employers or agencies without written permission of the person whose records are sought.
The provisions of this drug testing policy may only be modified by mutual agreement in labor management committee meetings pursuant to Section 7.2 of this Agreement.
