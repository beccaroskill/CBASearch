If the grievance cannot be solved at the informal level, the unit member or the Union, on behalf of and at the request of the unit member, then submits the grievance to the appropriate administrator in writing within fifteen (15) duty days after the grievance arises.

Arbitration may be initiated by the Union by serving notice upon the Board requesting arbitration within fifteen (15) duty days after receiving the Step Three response and setting forth the precise question it proposes to arbitrate, the section of the Agreement violated, and a description of the action taken that initiated the grievance.

Should a paraeducator cover a class or classes without a regular teacher or a substitute teacher present, and such coverage is for the required total amount of time, whether for a consecutive period(s) of time or not, the paraeducator shall receive a class coverage premium of $5.00 per hour for all time spent providing such coverage for that day. Should the coverage for a qualifying assignment be continuous into the following school day, the class coverage premium shall continue beginning with the first hour of continuous coverage the following school day. Routine recess, lunch hour, and bus duty responsibilities will not constitute a break in class coverage assignments. All class coverage hours worked by a paraeducator must fall within his/her assigned duty hours and are not to extend beyond the number of hours of his/her daily assignment. It is further understood that it is the responsibility of the paraeducator’s supervisor to ensure that work is assigned to the employee within the employee’s assigned duty hours. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to allow a paraeducator to perform class coverage duties without compensation as provided for above. The parties agree to jointly monitor the utilization of paraeducators for class coverage.

Leave approved and verified with a doctor’s certification on an FMLA leave request form in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act, may be taken for up to twelve (12) weeks. Applications for leave must be submitted in writing to the appropriate official and forwarded with his/her recommendation.
1.	Eligibility - All unit members are eligible to apply.
2.	Benefits - Unit members may contribute to the retirement system while on leave
according to the provisions of the MCPS Retirement System. For unit members on FMLA leave, MCPS will maintain the employee’s benefits under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued working.
3.	Permanent Status
a)	A unit member who is on permanent status at the time he/she is granted leave because of personal illness or illness in his/her immediate family shall remain on permanent status.
b)	A unit member who has completed six months of successful experience with the Montgomery County Public Schools on a probationary status and has been recommended for permanent status at the time leave is granted shall go on permanent status at the time he/she returns from leave and is reassigned.
4.	Return from Leave - If the leave granted is for personal illness, the unit member will be reinstated at the conclusion of the leave providing a health certificate from the attending physician is submitted attesting to the unit member’s physical fitness to perform his/her duties. Reassignment will be made when there is a vacancy for which the unit member is qualified. Reassignment upon return from an approved FMLA leave will be to the unit member’s original position held prior to leave, or to an equivalent position if the original position has been eliminated.

E.	Workers’ Compensation Leave
SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE Contract -
School Years 2003-2005
-30-
A unit member who is physically unable to report for duty as a result of an injury in the line of duty may be placed on workers’ compensation leave at full salary by the superintendent provided the unit member seeks medical treatment with respect to the injury from a physician who is among a comprehensive list of preferred providers approved by the Board of Education. SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE, shall have representation on the selection committee that recommends the list of preferred providers to the Board. If the unit member elects to be treated by a physician who is not among the list of preferred providers, the unit member will be entitled to receive the benefit mandated by the Workers’ Compensation Law of Maryland, but will not be entitled to the benefits in this section. A unit member receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits but not receiving workers’ compensation leave may use his/her accrued sick leave and must submit to the Board all monies received through the Workers’ Compensation Law of Maryland, or resulting from a legal liability of a person other than the unit member.
For purposes of this section, full salary is defined as net biweekly pay after withholding of federal, state, and FICA taxes. The parties agree that it is not desirable for such individuals to receive greater salary after taxes while on workers’ compensation leave than when they are on active duty. Therefore, the Board shall provide a supplement to the standard Workers’ Compensation benefit so that the net pay of the employee is equal to his/her regular net pay.
The unit member, or his/her representative, must file an injury report with the Employee and Retiree Service Center within forty-eight (48) hours of the injury. The unit member shall also file a leave request for leave for disability accompanied by a participating doctor’s report stating he/she is unable to carry out the duties of his/her assignment due to this injury.
Workers’ compensation leave is approved by the associate superintendent for human resources and is contingent upon the claim for disability being approved by the MCPS workers’ compensation claims administrator. If the leave is not approved by the MCPS workers’ compensation claims administrator, the employee will be required to repay MCPS all monies received. This payment can be in the form of annual leave, sick leave, or lump sum payment. All monies payable to the unit member through the Workers’ Compensation Law of the State of Maryland, or resulting from a legal liability of a person other than the unit member must, under the right of subrogation, be transmitted to the Board by the unit member. It is the responsibility of the disabled unit member to check with his/her physician and to inform his/her principal or other appropriate official monthly of the approximate date he/she can return to his/her regular assignment. A unit member may be carried on full workers’ compensation leave for up to one (1) year after the disability accident. At that time, the superintendent will determine whether the unit member is able to return to his/her regular assignment, be given an alternate work assignment, be placed on sick leave, or be placed on disability retirement. An alternate work assignment terminates workers’ compensation leave.

b)	A unit member must provide a minimum of one week advance notice when requesting three or more consecutive days annual leave. Leave may be granted with less notice at the discretion of the administrator.

WORKING HOURS AND WORK LOAD
A.	The regularly scheduled work week shall not exceed five (5) days. The regularly scheduled workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours in addition to a daily duty-free lunch period. Starting and dismissal times will be assigned by the principal or the appropriate director. However, no change in starting and dismissal times in excess of two (2) hours will be made without the concurrence of the Union and the affected unit member. Such change in assigned schedule may occur no more frequently than one (1) time each school year. This limitation will not apply where the entire shift of the position assignment is changed. By mutual agreement between the Board and the Union, the work hours or work week for an employee or group of employees may be modified to exceed five (5) days per week or eight (8) hours per day.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing employees in the bargaining unit who work less than forty (40) hours per week the opportunity to work an optimal number of hours per week consistent with the operating needs and efficiency of the school system.
B.	Except for bus operators and bus attendants, the workday for forty-hour (40) per week unit members shall consist of eight (8) hours of work within eight and one-half (8 1/2) consecutive hours unless the workday has been modified as indicated in Section A above. The workday for unit members working less than forty (40) hours shall also consist of regularly scheduled consecutive working hours exclusive of duty-free lunch periods when applicable. Starting and dismissal times for bus operators and bus attendants will be assigned by the director of transportation. Nothing shall prevent a unit member from voluntarily requesting an exception to this section.

The transportation department will undertake a review of schedules and assignments for the purpose of reducing the length of the downtime periods.
C.	Notwithstanding the above, the Board may implement modified work weeks for central office safety and security personnel, not to exceed forty (40) regularly scheduled hours in a six (6) day week (Saturday, 12:01 a.m. to Friday, 12:00 p.m.). Time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a modified work week shall be overtime and paid at one and one half (1 1/2) the unit member’s regular rate of pay. Such a modified work week may be implemented by mutual agreement between the principal and the employee for school-based safety and security personnel. No such employee shall suffer retaliation for not agreeing to a modified work week.
D.	1. A unit member who is requested by an appropriate official to report back to work after the unit member’s normal workday or to report to work on a nonscheduled workday shall be credited with a minimum of three (3) hours of work. However, time worked immediately before or immediately after the unit member’s regularly scheduled hours is not considered call-back work and only the actual work time is reported.
2.	When an unit member is directed in writing by a supervisor to remain at home and be
ready to report for work when called, that unit member shall receive three (3) additional hours straight time pay for each day on such standby basis.
E.	1.	In regard to systemwide delayed opening, ten-month school-based unit members will
begin work twenty (20) minutes before the scheduled student starting time on said day without loss of pay.
2.	In regard to systemwide early dismissal, the same school-based unit members may leave as soon as all students and teachers with whom they work directly are off the school premises.
3.	The principal of any school may require any unit member in Section E.l to be on duty for the normal duty day if he/she is needed. Only the principal will determine such need.
F.	If the entire school system, including the central office is closed at the order of the superintendent, those employees who are required to work on an emergency basis will be paid at their applicable straight time rate for the hours they work while the system is closed. This payment will be over and above the payment they would have received had they not been required to work. Where schools are closed after food service employees report to work, they will be paid at the applicable straight time rate for the hours worked, in addition to emergency leave as provided in Article 12, Section P.

G.	School-based unit members and maintenance employees who are required to report to work
at the beginning of their shift or remain at work until the end of their shift on days of delayed opening and early closing of schools shall receive one (1) hour pay in addition to their regular pay. It is understood this additional payment to maintenance employees will apply only when the required work to be performed is related to the reasons for the delayed opening or early closing.
H.	Ten-month food service employees, educational assistants, media assistants, and office employees will be notified by the closing of the school year of their next year’s starting date and assignment, subject to the right of MCPS to make changes in such assignments whenever circumstances require, especially in the case of educational assistants.
I.	The duties or work required of a unit member will not be increased unreasonably above those normally required because of staff shortages or schedule reductions.
J.	MCPS will provide reasonable and customary work breaks for full-time unit members unless
such breaks are not feasible. Every one of such unit members is entitled to receive such breaks routinely, but it is recognized that circumstances may occasionally make them not feasible. The supervisor will notify the unit member of break arrangements and discuss the personnel and operating priorities that relate to breaks with the unit member.
K.	Secretaries shall be compensated for time spent outside their normal work hours calling teacher substitutes.
L.	Unit members may not work additional hours beyond their regularly scheduled work time without proper supervisory authorization. In emergency circumstances, where it is not possible to obtain prior authorization, unit members may perform the emergency work and shall pursue proper supervisory authorization as soon as practical. However, no unit member shall be required, pressured, or permitted by the supervisor to work additional time without appropriate compensation. This provision shall not apply to Fair Labor Standards Act exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a regularly scheduled work week.
M.	The appropriate supervisor shall assign priorities to the work of a bargaining unit member whenever the employee so requests.
N.	As part of the performance review process or at the request of an
employee, the appropriate supervisor shall review and discuss work assignments and expectations with the unit member.
O.	Annually, MCPS will inform all unit members and supervisors regarding the responsibilities and proper procedures for requesting authorization to work and compensation for work beyond a unit member’s regularly scheduled hours.

ARTICLE 15
REDUCTION IN FORCE
A.	Authority - The Board of Education of Montgomery County retains the right to reduce its
force, and its decisions on such reduction are not subject to the grievance procedure.
B.	Notice - No reduction in force shall be implemented without fifteen (15) duty days notice to
the employee and twenty-five (25) duty days notice to the Union, during which MCPS shall consult with SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE, on the reduction in force.
C.	Definition - Reduction in force shall mean an action resulting in a unit member being terminated from Montgomery County Public Schools for reasons other than disciplinary.
D.	Procedure for Reduction - When a reduction in staff within a given classification occurs, the determination of those who are to be released will be in the following order:
1.	Probationary employees to be laid off first.
2.	If further reductions are needed, those unit members with less than four (4) years’
service whose two (2) most recent performance evaluations have been unacceptable and/or below average will be laid off next.
3.	If still further reductions are required, seniority (as defined below) will govern, with
the least senior unit member to be laid off first.
The foregoing procedure will be applied on a systemwide basis and seniority is defined as length of continuous service with the Montgomery County Public Schools.
E.	Recall
1.	Unit members whose services have been terminated because of a reduction in staff shall for a period of two (2) years receive priority consideration for reemployment if they so desire and when Montgomery County Public Schools decides to fill
SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE Contract -
School Years 2003-2005
-48-
vacancies. The recall will be in the inverse order of force reduction. If a unit member is notified of recall to a reasonably approximate position for which the unit member qualifies and refuses the assignment, the unit member will lose the right to further recall.
2.	In the event that a unit member does not desire at the time of termination to be placed
on the list for priority consideration, he/she shall receive full payment for all earned unused annual and sick leave and will lose the right to recall. For those terminated unit members having two (2) full years of service but less than six (6) years of service, they will receive, in addition, one-half month’s salary for each year of creditable Montgomery County Public Schools’ service. For those terminated unit members having six (6) or more years of service, they will receive, in addition, one month’s salary for each year of creditable Montgomery County Public School’s service up to a limit of twelve (12) months’ salary.
F.	Any unit member who is terminated due to a reduction in force may be placed on leave without pay for the six (6) months immediately following the last duty day and may choose to continue membership in the MCPS health benefit plan in which the unit member is enrolled by paying the full cost of membership in such plan during those six months. If the member is not recalled, or refuses an assignment before the end of the initial six-month period, the leave without pay and the membership in the MCPS health benefit plan is automatically terminated.
G.	A nonbargaining unit employee may not exercise seniority rights to bump into or be placed in a SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE, bargaining unit classification during a time of a RIF affecting that classification or while there are unit members on active recall status who are eligible for work in such classification.
H.	It is the goal of the parties to avoid layoff of unit members to the extent possible. The superintendent will attempt to provide a period of retraining for nonprobationary unit members so that they can be placed in positions for which they would not otherwise qualify without such training.
I.	Any action taken under the foregoing provisions, except for the decision referred to in Section A, shall be grievable under Article 6.
ARTICLE 16
POSITION DESCRIPTIONS
A.	Upon request, each unit member will be provided with an accurate description of his/her duties or responsibilities in the form of a class specification.

B.	A copy of a unit member’s class specification will be included in each employment package to be distributed during orientation.

A unit member assigned to a lower grade classification as a result of a reclassification will be placed on the lower pay grade without reduction in pay. When the same rate of pay does not exist in the lower pay grade, the unit member’s hourly rate of pay will be red-circled which will remain in effect for no more than three (3) years from the effective date of the reclassification action. The unit member’s anniversary date for step increases will not be affected.

of the classification staff will meet with a representative of SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE, to discuss classification matters.

DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
A.	A suspension, demotion, discharge, or other disciplinary action may only be taken against unit members for proper cause. Suspension, demotion, and discharge will be handled in accordance with the procedures of Sections C and D. Any meeting where an employee is notified of such action shall be delayed a reasonable length of time, not to exceed two (2) duty days, in order to allow for the Union representative to attend if the employee so requests.
B.	Any suspension of a unit member for the purpose of investigation shall be with full pay. Normally, such investigations will be completed within five (5) duty days.
C.	Written notice of charges with specifications will be given to the affected unit member at the time the disciplinary action is taken. Prior to acting upon a recommendation for discharge or suspension in excess of five (5) duty days, the deciding official shall offer the affected employee the opportunity to make a statement in his/her behalf personally or in writing.

CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
A.	SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE, and the Board of Education recognize the vital importance of training and education in this era of change. A well-trained, effectively functioning work force is necessary if the Montgomery County Public Schools is to achieve its goal of providing quality education for every student.

All unit members and probationary employees who would upon successful completion of the probationary period become unit members are eligible for and encouraged to participate in in-service training programs designed to improve their effectiveness. The form and substance of these programs may differ widely and all unit members and probationary employees who would upon successful completion of the probationary period become unit members and their supervisors are jointly responsible for analyzing areas of job needs and then actively seeking training which will improve performance. To achieve the goal of developing and implementing a comprehensive program of in-service training, the Board agrees to budget the sum of $ 100,000 per year for instructional support for system-designed training programs, to hire consultants, and to develop relevant programs. This sum will be administered by the Office of the Deputy Superintendent of Schools.

C.	Some education and training which can either increase unit members' effectiveness in their current positions or can assist them to prepare for other positions within MCPS may be available through other educational institutions or agencies.

D.	SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE, and the Board realize that many unit members may desire to obtain further education and training to improve present job skills or qualify for other positions within MCPS. To enable unit members to achieve this aim, the Board supports a program of released time for unit members on permanent status who work twenty (20) or
SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE Contract -

more hours per week.

E.	To assist unit members to utilize the opportunities in Sections B, C, and D, the Board agrees
to budget not less than $15,000 per year for the purchase of books, equipment, and other educational resource materials. The Career Development and Educational Improvement Committee may make recommendations concerning the expenditure of these funds.

If this "deadhead" travel time overlaps with "deadhead" travel time for an adjacent run/trip for a given operator or attendant, the operator or attendant will not be paid double for a single "deadhead" time period.
12.	Buses will be assigned in accordance with Section H below. When a bus run, special education or regular, becomes available, the operator receiving the bid and assigned the run and hours may take his/her bus to the new run unless the bus does not fit the established requirements of the run (for example, going from a regular run to a special education run). In this situation, the operator must accept a different assignment bus.
13.	All non-driving bus operator assignments within the Department of Transportation shall be bid in accordance with Section G above except for the following:
a)	All requests for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) job accommodations shall be considered and verified by the Office of Human Resources individual responsible for ADA compliance, in accordance with established MCPS procedures. However, the Department of Transportation shall make available placement opportunities to nondriving assignments to those bus operators whose requests are so verified, consistent with operational requirements.
b)	All other administrative placements of bus operators to nondriving assignments shall be done in consultation with the union. Such assignments shall not extend beyond sixty (60) calendar days except by mutual agreement between the Union and the chief operating officer.
14.	The provisions of this Article may be suspended by agreement of the Department of
Transportation and the Union where considered desirable by the parties to rectify or correct a specific issue or matter.
H.	Assignment of School Buses - Buses will be assigned to maximize
efficiency in meeting the transportation needs of MCPS. The following factors will be used in assigning buses:
SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE Contract -
School Years 2003-2005
-74-
1.	Buses equipped with wheelchair lifts or those assigned to serve pupils in special education programs are exempt from the following; however, every effort will be made to distribute them with preference given to senior drivers, based on factor Nos. 2 through 7 below:
2.	New buses will be distributed by systemwide seniority.
3.	When new buses are available, they will be assigned to eligible operators after
completion of five (5) years of service based on their hire date (i.e., when the operator is beginning his/her sixth year of employment, by August 15).
4.	Bus operators assigned a new bus will maintain that bus assignment for five (5) years unless the group of eligible operators, those with more than five (5) years of service, has been exhausted (see No. 3 above).
5.	If a new bus is offered to an eligible bus operator and the operator turns down that
assignment, the operator’s ranking will be maintained. However, the operator will not be considered for a new bus assignment until his/her cycle comes up again (would probably have to wait a minimum of five years).
1. All other assignment of buses not included in Nos. 1 through 5 above will be assigned on a seniority rolldown basis.
7. Bus operators may request to keep their current bus assignment by submitting a used bus assignment form (see Appendix).
I.	Procedures for the Fair Distribution of Field Trips - Field trips will be assigned on a fair and
equitable basis for those operators who express an interest.
1.	No field trips will be awarded to operators who are regularly scheduled forty (40) hours per week unless the field trip assignment cannot be covered by the pool of operators defined in item No. 4 below or as described in No. 5 below.
2.	No field trips will be awarded to operators with a position designation of perm-sub (guaranteed 40 hours per week), unless the field trip assignment cannot be covered by the pool of operators defined in item No. 4 below.
3.	Operators with a position code of 9210 Temp (20-hour employees) may be assigned field trips.
4.	Any operator (withstanding the previously mentioned) with an application on file in the field trip office who is scheduled less than 32.5 hours per week is eligible to be assigned field trips unless such an assignment will place the operator in an overtime status.
SEIU Local 500, MCCSSE Contract -
School Years 2003-2005
-75-
5.	Operators having field trip hours preassigned as part of the August bid are exempt from No. 1 and No. 4 above.
6.	It is understood that, on rare occasions, it will be necessary to make emergency or critical service decisions to assign field trips outside these guidelines. This is by no means a common practice, but may occur from time to time.
7.	The Department of Transportation will make every effort to assure that operators are
notified of field trips well enough in advance to arrange their schedules to accept them. Trips that are kicked back because the operator was improperly notified will not cause that operator to become ineligible for future trips.
8.	Kick Back Trips - As time permits, priority in giving out kicked back trips is as follows:
a)	Permanent employees interested in short notice	assignments,
b)	Radio operators,
c)	Substitutes (nonpermanent).
J.	Compensation for field trips and activities will be paid within thirty (30) days of the submission of field trip tickets by the employee. Employees must submit field trip tickets within five (5) days of completion of the trip. Upon request to the Department of Transportation, an employee will be provided a summary of field trips for which he/she has been paid along with the trip ticket numbers.
K.	1. In each year of this Agreement, an assessment of scheduled hours will show at least 66 percent of those bus operators having indicated an interest to work full time have a 40-hour schedule.
2.	Only those Department of Transportation employees working in excess of 40 hours in a week or 11 hours in a given day will be eligible for time and one-half overtime compensation. No employee shall be required to have a scheduled workday in excess of 13 elapsed hours.
2.	If Section K. 1 is not met, then Section K.2 above, at the request of either party, shall
be null and void and overtime will be paid for all hours over eight (8) in a day; and routes will be reassigned to require no more than eight (8) hours per day. Reduction in hours shall be on the basis of seniority, with less senior employees being reduced first. Where necessary, routes will be rebid in accordance with the other provisions of this Article. The Union and affected employees will be given fifteen (15) days notice before this procedure is implemented. The parties may agree to alternative remedies during this time.
