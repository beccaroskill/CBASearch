The Trustees' authority to waive any costs shall be governed by the terms of the Trust Agreement.

8
bargaining unit shall also include those persons in the employ of an Employer who are supervisors, as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act, as amended; and who at one time were Employee members of the bargaining unit herein on whose behalf contributions were required to be made to the trust funds described in the aforesaid Paragraph 3 and 4 of Article IX hereof.
