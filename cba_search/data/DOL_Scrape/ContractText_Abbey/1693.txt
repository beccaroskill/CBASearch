COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into, effective the 1st day of May, 2004 by and between the ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF ST. LOUIS for and in behalf of their members who have designated the Association as their collective bargaining agent, hereinafter referred to as the Employer and LOCAL UNION NO. 513, affiliated with the INTERNATIONAL UNION OF OPERATING ENGINEERS, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as the Union.
For and in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree and contract as follows:
ARTICLE 1 INTENTS AND PURPOSE - AREA LIMITS RECOGNITION
Section 1.01 It is the desire, intent and purpose of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall promote and improve their industrial and economic relationship and make it one that is harmonious and profitable.
Section 1.02 It is the intention of the parties that this Agreement shall make provision for the orderly and expeditious consideration and settlement of rates, pay, wages, hours, working conditions and adjustment of grievances.
Any reference in this Agreement to the male gender shall also be understood to mean the female gender.
Section 1.03 With respect to Employers who have designated the Association as their collective bargaining agent for an agreement applicable only to construction projects located in the City and County of St. Louis, this Agreement shall apply to all employment of employees covered hereunder on building, heavy and highway, site preparation, tank farms, mechanical and processing lines, treatment plants and elevated water towers, asphalt plants, dredging construction work, fiber optic projects, and hazardous waste removal in the City of St. Louis and St. Louis County, Missouri, and not elsewhere.
With respect to Employers who have also designated the Association as their collective bargaining agent in the five adjoining Missouri counties of Jefferson, Franklin, St. Charles, Lincoln, and Warren, this Agreement shall apply to employment of employees covered hereunder on all the above-described construction work in St. Louis City and County and, in addition, to such employment on building construction projects located in said five counties.
5
Section 1.04 On any commercial or industrial construction project covered by this Agreement, an Employer who is bound as a party hereto with respect to employment on such project may, at its option, perform site preparation or improvement work at such project either under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, or under the terms and conditions of any other collective bargaining agreement then in existence between the Union and any employer or employer group which is applicable by its terms to such work at such project. However, on any such project, the Employer shall perform building construction as defined below (*) under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
* FOR PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION, BUILDING CONSTRUCTION IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE BUILDING STRUCTURES, INCLUDING MODIFICATIONS THEREOF OR ADDITIONS OR REPAIRS THERETO, INTENDED FOR USE FOR SHELTER, PROTECTION, COMFORT OR CONVENIENCE. BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SHALL INCLUDE THE DEMOLITION OF, AND FOUNDATIONS FOR, BUILDING CONSTRUCTION. EXCAVATION FOR THE FOUNDATIONS AND THE BASEMENT PROPER SHALL BE CONSIDERED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION.
When site work is performed under the terms and conditions of another agreement, as permitted in this section, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applied to the construction of the building itself, beginning with the digging of the excavation, pile driving, drilling or dewatering pertaining to the start of the building.
Section 1.05 Residential Construction: Employers party hereto may, at their option, perform residential construction work on projects covered by this Agreement, including sewer work in subdivisions, under the terms and conditions of any other collective bargaining agreement then in existence between the Union and an employer or employer group which is applicable by its terms to such work at such project.
Section 1.06 The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agency with respect to wages, hours, and other conditions of employment in the unit consisting of Operating Engineer Equipment Operators, Operating Engineer Apprentices, Operating Engineer Foremen, Operating Engineer Firemen, Operating Engineer Mechanics, Operating Engineer Mechanic Trainees, Operating Engineer Greasers, and Operating Engineer Oilers who are employed in the city and county of St. Louis, Missouri, and on work as specified in counties as provided in this article.
6
Section 1.07 Representation in Home Office Yard or Permanent Shop and/or Yard: With regard to representation of employees of the job site unit when working in the Employer's home office yard or permanent shop and/or yard, and permanent employees working in the Employer's home office yard or permanent shop and/or yard who historically and traditionally have been members of the operating engineer craft, it is understood that the Employer will abide by this Agreement with regard to wages, fringes and other contract benefits. This clause will not change any existing historical and traditional work patterns of Local 513 in the Employer's home office yard or permanent shop and/or yard, and allows the Union the right to represent such employees when working in the Employer's home office yard or permanent shop and/or yard.
Section 1.08 The Employer agrees that it is in the best interest of job progress and efficiency to, insofar as possible, develop and encourage a uniform labor policy on any particular job.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit or restrict, in any way, the Employer's right to determine which portions of the work, if any, the Employer may perform with the Employer's own employees or may subcontract to others.
The Employer shall not undermine the wage and fringe benefit standards established by this agreement by subcontracting work that would be otherwise done at bargaining unit employees at a construction job site for performance except by subcontractors who agree in writing to pay wages and fringe benefits of monetary value in the aggregate equal to or greater than those provided in this agreement.
In the event the subcontractor does not pay wages and fringe benefits in the aggregate as provided in this Agreement, the Employer shall terminate the subcontract and remove the subcontractor from the job site.
It is understood and agreed that this subcontractor clause requires said subcontractor to abide by and be bound by the terms and provisions of this collective bargaining agreement only for the period and on the project where the subcontractor relationship exists.
It is not the intent of this clause to interfere with the normal, traditional and customary work of the subcontractors on the job who employ other trades. Work historically, normally and traditionally done by the other crafts will continue as usual. Conflicts over usage of any pieces of equipment not covered by this clause will be submitted to a special Labor-Management Committee to consist of the Director of Labor Relations of the AGC of St. Louis and two representatives each from management and labor.
7
ARTICLE 2 UNION SECURITY
Section 2.01 It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that as a condition of continued employment, all persons who are hereafter employed by the Employer in the unit which is the subject of this Agreement shall become members of the Union not later than the eighth (8th) day following the beginning of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; that the continued employment by the Employer in said unit of persons who are members of the Union shall be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the periodic dues of the Union; and that the continued employment of persons who were in the employ of the Employer prior to the date of this Agreement and who are not now members of the Union, shall be conditioned upon those persons becoming members of the Union not later than the eighth (8th) day following the execution date of this Agreement.
Section 2.02 The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such required times shall obligate the Employer, upon written notice from the Union to such effect and to the further effect that Union Membership was available to such person on the same terms and conditions generally available to other members, to forthwith discharge such person. Further, the failure of any person to continue payment of the periodic dues of the Union as required herein shall, upon written notice to the Employer by the Union to such effect, obligate the Employer to discharge such person.
Section 2.03 The acquisition of Union membership required herein shall obligate employees to do no more than pay an initiation fee and dues for the first month. The obligation to maintain Union Membership shall be limited to payment of the periodic dues of the Union.
Section 2.04 The Employer shall not be required to discharge any employee for non-compliance with this Article until such time as such employee is replaced by a qualified employee, and if the Union requests the discharge of any employee for non-compliance of the foregoing, the Union agrees to indemnify the Employer and hold the Employer harmless of any liability or claims therewith in connection with the termination of the employment of such employee in compliance with the request of the Union.
Section 2.05 Should the National Labor Relations Act be amended at any time during the term of this Agreement in such manner that the Union or the Employer would be privileged to seek different provisions relating to Union Security, then, in such event, this Agreement may be reopened at the option of the
8
Union or the Employer for renegotiation of the question of Union Security, but shall not be reopened on any other question, except as may be hereinafter provided. If the Union or the Employer desires to exercise such option under such circumstances, it shall give a sixty (60) day prior notice of its intention to do so, and should the Union exercise said option, it shall be free to strike in support of same, anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding.
ARTICLE 3 MANNER OF EMPLOYMENT
Section 3.01 It is understood and agreed that no employees falling within the classes of persons covered by this collective bargaining agreement shall be hired except in accordance with the terms of this article. Whenever an Employer desires new or additional help the Employer shall notify the referral office of the Union, either in writing, in person, or by telephone, stating the job location, starting time, approximate duration of the job, the type of work to be performed, and the number of workmen desired. Subject to the procedures outlined in this article, the Union referral office shall refer qualified job applicants to meet the needs of the Employer. Also, there shall be a pre-job conference whenever a Foreman is to be required when requested by either the Union or Employer.
Section 3.02 Registration: It shall be the sole responsibility of the Union, not the responsibility of any Employer, to establish and maintain an appropriate registration facility for qualified applicants for employment in job classifications covered by this collective bargaining agreement. Registration shall be on a monthly basis and shall be without discrimination in any manner. The following registration list shall be maintained as follows:
All applicants shall be registered on the respective appropriate list, which shall show the date of their registration.
Each applicant for employment shall be expected and required to furnish such data, records, names of Employers, dates and length of employment, evidence of requisite qualifications, and other related information as may be determined necessary by the Union's registration facility to enable proper referral hereunder, and each applicant shall complete such forms relating to registration as shall be submitted to him.
Section 3.03 In the interest of maintaining an efficient system in the industry providing for an orderly procedure of referral of applicants for employment, preserving the legitimate interests of employees in their employment status within the area, and of eliminating discrimination in employment because of membership, or nonmembership in the Union, the parties agree to the following system of
9
referral of applicants for employment:
(a)	No employee or applicant for employment shall be required by the employer to complete any application for employment except required payroll and emergency information.
(b)	The Union shall be the sole and exclusive source of referrals of applicants for employment.
(c)	If, within twenty-four (24) hours following the request of an Employer for the referral of job applicants, the Union is unable to refer needed help, then, in that event, the Employer may hire from any source; provided that if no registrant is available at the time the request for referral is made by an Employer, the Union list administrator shall so state and the Employer may hire forthwith. In this event, however, the Employer shall promptly notify the Union of persons so employed, giving their names, job classifications, and probable length of employment.
(d)	The Union shall select and refer applicants for employment without discrimination against such applicants by reason of membership or non-membership in the Union, and such selection and referral shall not be affected in any way by rules, regulations, bylaws, constitutional provisions or any other aspect or obligation of Union membership, policies or requirements, or by race, color, creed, age, or sex, national origin, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran, nor against qualified disabled veterans or qualified individuals with handicaps or disabilities. All such selections and referrals shall be in accordance with the following procedures.
(e)	In the event the Employer violates any provision of this Article and the Employer is notified in writing by the Union's Business Manager and fails to correct said violation, or violations, within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of notice from the Union, a copy to be sent to the Manager of the Association, the Union shall have the right to immediately subject said Employer to all legal or economic recourse, notwithstanding any provision in this Contract to the contrary. The Union assumes full responsibility to each applicant for employment for any loss or damage resulting from referral discrimination or other violation of law by the Union, its representatives, agents or employees operating a referral office in which it is established such violation occurred.
(f)	The Employer will, when requesting referrals from the Local Union (1) specify the number of employees required; (2) the location of the project; (3) the nature and type of construction involved; (4) the work to be performed and (5) such other information as is deemed essential by the Employer in order to enable the Union to make proper referral of applicants.
10
REFERRAL OF MEN: Upon the request of an Employer for the referral of applicants for work, the Union shall refer qualified registrants in sufficient number to meet the needs of the Employer as requested. The following order of referral shall prevail, except as modified below and subject also to the Employer additional preferences hereinafter provided under Section 3.04.
FIRST:	Registrants requested by the Employer by name who have worked for
that Employer within a period of twelve (12) months preceding the date of request for a total of at least thirty (30) days during that period, irrespective of such registrants position on the registration list, but, if the number of registrants so requested be insufficient to fill the Employer's needs, then
SECOND: Registrants who have worked for any Employer signatory to this Agreement within a period of two (2) years preceding the date of their registration, then
THIRD: All other registrants.
The order of referral shall be from the current monthly appropriate registration list on a first in, first out basis, except as to registrants requested by name.
FOURTH: Nothing herein contained shall deny the Union the right to select any applicant for referral on the basis of experience in the industry, qualifications, skill, or the Employer’s preference regardless of the employee's place on the out-of-work list. The referral office shall require all applicants who have not previously registered, to submit a resume of experience and qualifications.
Section 3.04 Additional Employer Preferences: Employers may request also the referral of specific individuals by name desired by them as employees, irrespective of their position on the registration list, and these persons shall be referred to such Employer, regardless of the fact that other job applicants would otherwise be entitled to prior referral; provided, however, that requests for the referral of specific individuals falling into categories Second through Fourth of Section 3.03, above, shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the employees within the bargaining unit who will be required on a job basis, it being expressly understood that this fifty percent (50%) limitation does not apply to men employed under Section 3.03 "FIRST" hereof. Fifty percent (50%) will be on a one to one basis for employees of the bargaining unit.
11
Each Employer shall be privileged to hire or refuse to hire, at their option, any job applicant referred from the Union referral office. Provided, however, no Employer shall refuse to hire an applicant referred for the purpose of circumventing the order of referral of registrants as herein provided for.
Section 3.05 Non-Discriminatory Referral: Neither the Union nor the Employer shall discriminate in the referring or hiring of employees because of age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or status as a Vietnam-era veteran, nor against qualified disabled veterans or qualified individuals with handicaps or disabilities.
The union shall post at the referral office and the Employer at the job site the provisions hereof relating to the function of the hiring procedures as specified herein. Registration list shall be made available to Employers when requested.
Section 3.06 Non-Liability of Employers: It is understood and agreed that it shall be the sole duty and responsibility of the Union to establish and maintain an appropriate and legal manner hiring hall facilities; and no Employer shall have any duty or obligation to participate therein or to police or investigate the operation thereof; and that the Union shall hold the Employer harmless from any financial responsibility, liability and loss resulting from the failure of the Union, if any, to establish, maintain and administer the referral facility in a proper and legal manner. Should the Union fail to fulfill this obligation to indemnify and hold an Employer harmless, as above provided, this entire article providing for manner of employment shall henceforth become null and void.
Section 3.07 Hiring Hall Procedures and Regulations: These hiring hall procedures and regulations represent basic guidelines for registration for and referral to available work under the Labor Contracts of Local Union No. 513 of the International Union of Operating Engineers. Our right to register and refer men for available work is provided for in our Labor Contracts.
1.	Registration for employment in the various groups mentioned in the contract will be open to all persons one day each month, the day being the first Monday of the month. All persons may register on that day between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
2.	Registration shall be on a monthly basis and will not be carried forward from month to month. Provided, however, that persons who have registered but were not referred to work may request, either orally or in writing, that their previous registration be renewed for another month.
3.	You must be available for contact by telephone and if you cannot be reached after a telephone call is made to the number you leave with us,
12
you will lose your right to be referred to the work then available.
4.	Persons need not be members of Local 513 in order to register and be referred out to work. But, take notice that the Labor Contracts of Local 513 require workers to become members of the Union to the extent of payment of the Union's initiation fee and dues no later than the 8th day after going to work.
5.	If a person is referred to work and then quits his job without first notifying the hiring hall, he will not be entitled to register or be referred until the next monthly registration period.
6.	Any person referred to work and goes to work, but works less than five (5) working days will be entitled to be put back in his original place on the hiring list.
Section 3.08 Grievances: All disputes, differences and disagreements which may hereafter arise between the parties with respect to this article, or between the parties and any person seeking registration and referral, shall be determined, resolved and finally disposed of under the grievance and arbitration provisions of this contract. No person shall be denied access to said procedures because of membership or non-membership in this or any other Union or because he is not employed by an Employer obligated thereto.
Section 3.09 Modification: This entire article may be modified or rescinded by the mutual consent of the Association and the Union at any time during the term of this Agreement of which it is a part.
The Employer shall have the right to accept or reject for good cause, to employ or not to employ for good cause, any man furnished by the Union, or to discharge for good cause any man once accepted who afterwards proves unsatisfactory to the Employer. The Union shall have the right in all instances to question whether or not the actions of the Employer were for good cause. An unqualified employee may be discharged on the day hired, with pay only for actual hours worked. It is understood however, that the Union shall not be the sole judge of what is or what is not good cause.
If employee does not agree that he was discharged for good cause, he has the right either directly or through the Union to submit the question to arbitration.
The Employer shall be the sole judge of and have the right to determine the number of employees required on the job or any certain portion of the work being done by the Employer. There shall be no restrictions of the use of machinery, tools or appliances.
Section 3.10 Apprenticeship: The parties agree that it is in their mutual interest and in the interest of the entire construction industry that new employees be adequately trained in the operation of the equipment covered by this agreement.
Therefore, Article 3, Manner of Employment and Article 7 are modified by
13
this Article as they apply to apprenticeship.
The apprenticeship coordinator shall request apprentices by name from the Union referral office to fill requests to him from Employers for apprentices to fill specified jobs. The apprentice may be moved from job to job by the coordinator to provide the needed training for his apprenticeship. The apprentice coordinator will notify the Union and the Employer before he moves an apprentice from one job to another. Seniority will not apply to the apprentice during his apprenticeship. Apprentices may not be bumped by a member of the bargaining unit.
Operating engineer apprentices may be assigned to any equipment in the bargaining agreement, according to the ability of the apprentice with the following exceptions. Under no circumstances will an apprentice by allowed to operate the following equipment: pumps, compressors, welders, generators, elevators, or any other standby equipment, on workday when an apprentice has to finish out the day, he can be put on one of the machines listed in this paragraph, not to exceed the last two hours in the day.
When an apprentice is employed as an oiler on a job and when time permits after he has performed his duties as an oiler, he shall be permitted to run other machines on the job under the supervision of the operator assigned to the machines. The apprentice will perform these training duties with the specific permission of the operator he is oiling for and the job supervisor.
Other oilers or operators of standby equipment will be allowed to cover for the apprentice when he is training on another machine on the job site. The foregoing does not mean that the apprentice will not perform his regular job. If his oiler duties are keeping him busy he will forego training on other machines.
When a registered apprentice is performing operator duties, there shall not be more than one apprentice per six journeymen per job without the consent of the business agent in that area. Any Employer may employ an apprentice, however, under no circumstances shall an apprentice perform journeyman work on any project where no other journeyman in the employ of the said contractor is employed, except on jobs where governmental authority has specific requirements for apprentices, trainees, or minorities or women.
Apprentices shall receive the following applicable percentage of the journeyman rate in Group II per hour plus payments into Welfare, Pension, Apprenticeship and Vacation Funds as provided in this Agreement:
1st term.... 55%
2nd term....65% 3rd term.... 80%

Section 5.01 Hours of Work: The regular workday shall consist of eight (8) consecutive hours, exclusive of a thirty (30) minute lunch period, with pay at the regular straight time hourly rate. The regular workday shall begin on the job site between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. with the starting time to be
17
determined by the Employer. All employees shall have the same starting time. The employer shall notify the employees of any job site starting time changes by Friday of the week before. This starting time can be adjusted on a daily basis to comply with special hauling requirements between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. (permit loads only).
Employees shall be at their work station at the designated starting time and shall remain at their place during working hours until the designated quitting time except for tower crane operators, pedestal crane operators, etcetera whose “climbing time” will be on Employer’s time. Where the employees’ place of work requires Employer-furnished transportation, the employees shall be transported one way on the employees’ time and the other way on the Employer’s time. On projects where there is a significant amount of such transportation time, the Union agrees to negotiate this matter on a pre-bid basis.
All men are expected to report for work each morning and each afternoon following their lunch period unless notified before quitting time not to do so. Provided, however, if inclement weather or changed job conditions should occur during the lunch period and if employees are notified there is no work before the lunch period is over, their pay will stop for that day at the beginning of the lunch period. (See Section 5.07 for building construction). Further, if inclement weather or changed job conditions should occur during the interim between each day's work, then the Employer or a representative designated by him shall have the privilege, up to one (1) hour before official job starting time, of notifying the men by telephone not to report for work and if such notification is given, the Employer shall not be obligated to pay a man for reporting for work the "show up" time hereinafter provided for.
Section 5.02 Except for the provisions of Section 5.03 below, employees reporting for work and finding no work available in their particular classification shall be paid for two (2) hours show up time at the straight time rate applicable to their classification. However, to receive show up pay, employee must remain on the job one (1) hour unless permitted to leave by Employer. Except on building construction as provided in Section 5.07, if employees begin working in the morning and work for less than four (4) hours, they shall be paid for four (4) hours work. If they begin work in the afternoon and work for less than four (4) hours, they shall also be paid for four (4) hours work. These provisions for four (4) hour guarantees shall likewise apply to Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, but on these days the compensation shall be at the applicable overtime rate.
In case of layoff or discharge of an employee at noon or afternoon, employee will be notified by 11:30 a.m. or one-half (!6) hour before quitting time in afternoon; if not notified as set out above he shall receive in addition to the time
18
earned, two (2) hours pay at the straight time rate.
When an employee is discharged for other than lack of work, he shall be paid in full at time of layoff. When an employee quits, he shall wait until the next regular pay period for his check. When an employee is laid off because of lack of work, the Employer may mail the employee's check without penalty, provided it is postmarked no later than the next regular work day following the layoff, the Employer shall pay the employee two (2) hours time at the straight time rate per day of delay. Employee must notify the Union and the Employer within five (5) days after his layoff that he has not been paid or the penalty for late payment will stop.
When employee works before the regular starting time on an overtime basis and is stopped by inclement weather before the regular starting time, employee shall be paid from the time he begins work until the regular starting time at the overtime rate plus one (1) hours show up pay at the straight time rate.
Section 5.03 The terms and provisions of Sections 5.01 and 5.02 are intended, in part, to give employees compensation for "show up" time whenever their Employer fails to give them reasonable advance notice of the fact that work is not available. But said terms and provisions are not intended to impose unreasonable burdens or expenses on any Employer. Therefore, the "show up" time shall not be due and payable to any employee if the employee does not have a telephone and fails to notify his Employer of a telephone number to be used for notification purposes. Furthermore, if the Employer arranges for telephone notification by Western Union and a telephone call is made by Western Union at least one (1) hour prior to official starting time, "show up" time shall not be due and payable, even though an employee is not actually reached either because he is not at home or because no one answers the telephone. Provided, however, a notification of more than one (1) hour shall be required whenever it would require an employee more than one (1) hour to travel from his home to the job site.
Section 5.04 The regular workweek shall consist of five (5) days, Monday through Friday.
Section 5.05 The Employer may have the option to schedule his work week from Monday through Thursday at ten (10) hours per day at the straight time rate of pay with all hours in excess of ten (10) hours in any one-day to be at the applicable overtime rate.
If the Employer elects to work from Monday through Thursday and is stopped due to inclement weather, holiday or conditions beyond the control of the Employer, he shall have the option to work Friday at the straight time rate of pay to complete his/her forty (40) hours.
