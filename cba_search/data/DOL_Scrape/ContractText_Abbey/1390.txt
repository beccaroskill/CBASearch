APPENDIX
UNITED ASSOCIATION/MECHANICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA
STATEMENT ON WORKPLACE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING AND TREATMENT*
The following model substance abuse testing and treatment policy is published for consideration in local collective bargaining.
The United Association and the Mechanical Contractors Association of America believe that substance abuse testing, treatment and protection are as necessary in the skilled construction trades as they are in other high technology and safety-sensitive workplaces. Substance abuse testing and treatment measures are appropriate for all employer non-bargaining unit employees as well, including company executives and officers subject to applicable state and federal law. MCAA and the United Association also recognize that broad mandates of such policies are being issued increasingly from both public and private purchasers of construction.
MCAA and the UA regard worker safety, health and well being as integral to top quality work performance and successful project delivery. Therefore, in the mutual interests of MCAA member firms, UA-represented workers and their families, and the purchasers of construction services, MCAA and the UA jointly subscribe to and recommend the following elements of substance abuse policies for local collective bargaining.
Substance abuse policies should be developed, subject to MCAA/UA local collective bargaining, and should include the following:
>	a pass-through of more stringent public and/or private owner substance abuse and testing mandates;
>	prohibitions against the possession and use of illegal substances at work;
>	a prohibition against impairment at work;
>	testing on the bases of pre-employment, unscheduled, for-cause, post-incident and retum-to-work from treatment;
>	stringent controls (such as computerized selection of individuals for unscheduled testing) against abuse in selecting individuals for testing;
>	testing methods using non-invasive procedures;
>	thresholds for positive results shall be at least as stringent as those required by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and
>	treatment coverage in full accord with the latest government standards for publicly mandated policies as well as federal and state individual privacy and disability laws.
Disciplinary action under substance abuse policies should be subject to negotiated dispute resolution mechanisms or adopted owner policy requirements.
The implementation of substance abuse policies should be fully documented so that necessary and appropriate changes can be made based on experience with the program.
Approved 02/22/99
