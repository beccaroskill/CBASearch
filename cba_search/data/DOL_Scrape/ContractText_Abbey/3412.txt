ARTICLE 3	RECOGNITION
3.1	The EMPLOYER recognizes the UNION as the exclusive representative under Minnesota Statutes, Section 179A.03, Subdivision 8 in an appropriate bargaining unit as identified by the Bureau of Mediation Services, Certification of Exclusive Representative dated April 1, 1985, Case No. 85-PR-569-A, (clarified per BMS case No. 87-pr-612, order dated May 19, 1987).
AFSCME and the EMPLOYER have agreed to file a joint petition to the Bureau of Mediation to revise the Certificate of Exclusive Representative to add “professional” to those EMPLOYEES excluded from representation, as follows:
All EMPLOYEES of the City of Ramsey, Ramsey, Minnesota, who are public EMPLOYEES within the meaning of Minnesota Statutes 179A.03, Subdivision 14, excluding supervisory, confidential, professional and essential EMPLOYEES.
3.2	The EMPLOYER, in accordance with the provisions of M. S. 179A.03, Subd. 8, agrees not to enter into any AGREEMENTS covering terms and conditions of employment with members of the bargaining unit covered by this AGREEMENT, 2012 AFSCME Labor Agreement	4
either individually or collectively, which in any way conflict with the terms and conditions set forth in this AGREEMENT, except through the certified representative.
ARTICLE 4

The fair share fee shall be equal to the regular membership dues of the exclusive representative, less the cost of benefits financed through the dues and available only to members of the exclusive representative. In no event shall the fair share fee exceed 85 percent of the regular membership dues. The exclusive representative shall provide advance written notice of the amount of the fair share fee to the Commissioner of the Bureau of Mediation Services, the EMPLOYER, and to unit EMPLOYEES who will be assessed the fee. The EMPLOYER shall provide the exclusive representative with a list of all unit EMPLOYEES.

ARTICLE 7	EMPLOYEE RIGHTS - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
The EMPLOYER will recognize a representative designated by the UNION as the GRIEVANCE representative of the bargaining unit having the duties and responsibilities established by this ARTICLE. The UNION shall notify the EMPLOYER in writing of the name of such UNION representative and of the representative's successor when so designated.
7.1	PROCESSING OF A GRIEVANCE
It is recognized and accepted by the UNION and the EMPLOYER that the processing of GRIEVANCES as hereinafter provided is limited by the job duties and responsibilities of the EMPLOYEES and shall therefore be accomplished during normal working hours only when consistent with such EMPLOYEE duties and responsibilities. The aggrieved EMPLOYEE and the UNION representative shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay when a GRIEVANCE is investigated and presented to the EMPLOYER during normal working hours provided the EMPLOYEE and the UNION representative have notified and received the prior approval of the designated supervisor who has determined that such absence is reasonable and would not be detrimental to the work programs of the EMPLOYER.
7.2	PROCEDURE
GRIEVANCES, as defined in ARTICLE 2, Section 2.6, shall be resolved in conformance with the following procedure:
2012 AFSCME Labor Agreement
7
Step 1. An EMPLOYEE claiming a violation concerning the interpretation or application of this AGREEMENT shall, within twenty-one (21) calendar days after such alleged violation has occurred, present such GRIEVANCE to the EMPLOYEE'S supervisor as designated by the EMPLOYER. The EMPLOYER-designated representative will discuss and give an answer to such Step 1 GRIEVANCE within ten (10) calendar days after receipt. A GRIEVANCE not resolved by the operation of Step 1 of the grievance procedure may be appealed by the Union by filing a notice to that effect with the EMPLOYER designated representative. Such notice shall set forth the nature of the GRIEVANCE, the facts on which it is based, the provision or provisions of the AGREEMENT allegedly violated, and the remedy requested. Such notice shall be filed within ten (10) calendar days after the EMPLOYER-designated representative's final answer in Step 1. Any GRIEVANCE not appealed in writing to Step 2 by the UNION within ten (10) calendar days shall be considered waived.
Step 2. If appealed, the EMPLOYER designated representative shall conduct a conference with the union and the EMPLOYEE in an attempt to resolve the grievance. At such conference, the union shall present the grievance in writing signed by the affected EMPLOYEE and the union. The EMPLOYER-designated representative shall give the UNION the EMPLOYER'S Step 2 answer in writing within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of such Step 2 GRIEVANCE. A GRIEVANCE not resolved in Step 2 may be appealed to Step 3 within ten (10) calendar days following the EMPLOYER-designated representative's final Step 2 answer. Any GRIEVANCE not appealed in writing to Step 3 by the UNION within ten (10) calendar days shall be considered waived.
Step 3. A GRIEVANCE unresolved in Step 2 and appealed in Step 3 shall be submitted to the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services. A GRIEVANCE not resolved in Step 3 may be appealed to Step 4 within ten (10) calendar days following the EMPLOYER'S final answer in Step 3.
Step 4. A GRIEVANCE unresolved in Step 3 and appealed to Step 4 shall be submitted to arbitration before a single arbitrator to be selected from a list to be supplied by the Bureau of Mediation Services pursuant to its rules. Any GRIEVANCE not appealed in writing to Step 4 by the UNION within ten (10) calendar days shall be considered waived.
7.3	ARBITRATOR'S AUTHORITY
A.	The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the terms and conditions of AGREEMENT. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the specific issue(s) submitted in writing by the EMPLOYER and the UNION, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue not so submitted.
B.	The arbitrator shall be without power to make decisions contrary to, or inconsistent with, or modify or vary in any way the application of laws, rules, or regulations having the force and effect of law. The arbitrator's decision shall be submitted in writing within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or 2012 AFSCME Labor Agreement	8
the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever be later, unless the parties agree to an extension. The decision shall be binding on both the EMPLOYER and the UNION and shall be based solely on the arbitrator's interpretation or application of the express terms of this AGREEMENT and to the facts of the GRIEVANCE presented.
C.	The fees and expenses for the arbitrator's services and proceedings shall be borne equally by the EMPLOYER and the UNION provided that each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. If either party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it may cause such a record to be made, providing it pays for the record. If both parties desire a verbatim record of the proceedings, the cost shall be shared equally.
7.4	WAIVER OF GRIEVANCE
If a GRIEVANCE is not presented within the time limits set forth above, it shall be considered "waived". If a GRIEVANCE is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limit or any agreed extension thereof, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the EMPLOYER'S last answer. If the EMPLOYER does not answer a GRIEVANCE or an appeal thereof within the specified time limits, the UNION may elect to treat the GRIEVANCE as denied at that step and immediately appeal the GRIEVANCE to the next step. The time limit in each step may be extended by mutual AGREEMENT of the EMPLOYER and the UNION.
ARTICLE 8	WORK SCHEDULES - PREMIUM PAY
This ARTICLE is intended only to define the normal hours of work. Nothing herein shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week.
8.1	The sole authority in work schedules is the EMPLOYER. The normal work day for an EMPLOYEE shall be eight (8) hours. The normal work week shall be forty (40) hours, Monday through Friday. The normal work week for premium pay purposes shall begin at 12:01 A.M. Saturday. EMPLOYEES shall be given a two week posted or written notice of exceptions or changes in the normal work week start time. In the event that work is required because of unusual circumstances such as, but not limited to, fire, flood, snow, sleet, or breakdown of municipal equipment or facilities, no advance notice need be given.
8.2	In order to provide service to the public, the EMPLOYER may require the establishment of shifts for some EMPLOYEES on a daily, weekly, seasonal, or annual basis other than the normal work day or work week.
8.3	Each EMPLOYEE has an obligation to work overtime or callbacks if requested. Overtime will first be offered by the EMPLOYER on a voluntary basis. Employees who are on vacation leave that has been requested and approved
2012 AFSCME Labor Agreement
9
according to normal department procedures are not obligated to respond to callbacks.
8.4	Every regular EMPLOYEE shall be granted a thirty (30) minute lunch break without pay. Also, every regular EMPLOYEE, when working under conditions where a break period is practicable, shall be granted a fifteen (15) minute break period with pay in each half of the EMPLOYEE'S shift. Each department head shall schedule rest periods so as not to interfere with work requirements.
8.5	EMPLOYEES who are not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), working in excess of forty (40) hours within the work week, shall be compensated for such over-time at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the EMPLOYEE'S regular rate of pay in accordance to FLSA. The formula used for payment herein shall be the same regardless of operation of equipment at HEO, LEO or other rates of pay. As an alternative to compensation at premium rates for time worked in excess of forty (40) hours within the work week, the Employee may request compensatory time off in lieu of over-time pay compensatory time off to an EMPLOYEE, to be taken at a later date, which shall be computed at one and one-half (1-1/2) the time worked in excess of forty (40) hours within a work week.
8.6	Neither compensation for over-time nor accumulation of compensatory time off will be granted unless the work is performed at the direction of, or with the prior written approval of, the EMPLOYEE'S supervisor.
8.7	Neither compensation at over-time rates nor accumulation of compensatory time off will be paid for time not worked except as provided in this section. Time worked for the purpose of calculating over-time shall be actual time worked plus holidays recognized in Article 10 plus vacation time scheduled at least one week in advance of its use, and sick leave. Unpaid leave shall not be counted as time worked for the purpose of calculating over-time.
8.8	When an EMPLOYEE accrues eighty (80) hours of unused compensatory time off, further accumulation of compensatory time off is prohibited, and the EMPLOYEE shall be paid for overtime in accordance with this Article.
8.9	An EMPLOYEE shall be permitted to use accrued compensatory time within a reasonable period after it is requested if to do so would not unduly disrupt the operations of the EMPLOYER. Prior approval of the EMPLOYEE'S supervisor is required for the use of compensatory time-off.
8.10	A regular EMPLOYEE who is called out to perform work services on other than the EMPLOYEE'S scheduled shift shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours pay. The two hour minimum shall count toward worked hours for the purpose of calculation of overtime. An extension of a shift or an early start to a shift shall not be considered a call back for purposes of this section.
8.11	On Call Policy: Public Works Maintenance staff only
2012 AFSCME Labor Agreement
10
This policy is effective January 1, 2008 and does not apply to snowplow duties. This on call policy applies to unexpected emergencies and weekend well and lift station checks. Employees who wish to be added to the on call list for the calendar year may make this request to his/her supervisor on a voluntary basis at the beginning of each quarter. Those who are approved as on call employees will rotate on a weekly (seven days) basis. During an employee’s week of assigned on call duty, that employee will be allowed to drive a city vehicle to and from work for on call duties only. Employees may not take care of personal business while driving a city vehicle.

Employees must also be able to respond to the appropriate public works facility within 30 minutes and must be skilled in the areas of streets, parks and utilities maintenance work, as determined by the Public Works Director, in order to be a member of the on call pool
On call employees will be assigned to a seven-day schedule. On call employees will receive one hour of straight pay for each day of assigned on call duty Monday through Friday. Upon responding to a situation, an on call employee will forfeit on call pay and s/he will be paid as per Section 8.10 (Call-back Policy). On call hours shall begin at 3:30pm and shall end at 7:00am on the next regularly scheduled work day.
On Saturdays, Sundays and approved holidays, on call employees are required to perform lift station and well checks once daily. On call employees who conduct these checks will be paid as per Section 8.10 (Call back- Policy).
On call employees who are called back to work on an approved holiday will be compensated as per Section 10.2 (Holidays).
ARTICLE 9	SICK LEAVE
9.1	Every probationary and regular EMPLOYEE is entitled to accrue sick leave with pay at a rate of eight (8) hours for each calendar month of full-time service or major fraction thereof.

Additional funeral leave may be taken (with prior approval from a supervisor) and is deductible from sick leave (up to three (3) consecutive days), vacation or compensatory time as the EMPLOYEE may choose and have available.
9.5	Employees are able to use accrued leave or compensatory time (with prior approval from a supervisor) for family members not considered immediate family members under ARTICLE 9.3. To be eligible for sick leave with pay, an EMPLOYEE shall:

APPENDIX Al - COMPENSATION PLANS
The compensation plans are based on “steps” that are four percent apart based on maximum market salaries represented in the Step 6 (100%) column. Steps 1 through 5 equal 80%, 84%, 88%, 92%, and 96% of the maximum respectively.
If approved by the City Council, maximum salaries may be adjusted by a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). Therefore, if approved the entire plan adjusts in value each year while the percentage between steps stays constant at 4%.
Initial placement in the plan may be at any step because it depends on the employee’s knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as City Council approval.
When an employee reaches the maximum salary for his/her position (Step 6), he/she stays on that step. However, a salary increase may be received, if approved by the City Council, The maximum salaries would then increase by the approved Cost Of Living Adjustment made to the plan as a whole.
Progression through the compensation plan for all City of Ramsey employees will be based on satisfactory performance. Employee performance will be evaluated annually. Cost of Living increases will occur on January 1, and step increases will occur on an employee’s anniversary date, dependent on the employee’s performance evaluation.
An employee’s anniversary date of employment refers to his/her start date of regular full-time or regular part-time employment. This does not include temporary or seasonal employment.
Employees who receive an overall performance rating of “Meets Standards” or “Exceeds Standards” will move to the next highest salary step for their respective position classification.
Employees who receive an overall performance rating of “Below Standards” or “Unsatisfactory” will remain at their existing salary step and receive only the Cost of Living Adjustment of three percent.
Employees who receive an overall performance rating of “Below Standards” or “Unsatisfactory” will be re-evaluated in six months. If, at that time, overall performance is rated “Meets Standards” or “Exceeds Standards” the employee will move to the next highest salary step for their respective position classification.
This process is grievable, but not arbitrable, under Article VII of the Union grievance procedure.

Sick leave used for wellness activities will be reimbursed according to the City’s sick leave severance schedule based on the employee’s years of service and wage at the time the request for reimbursement is made. For example, an employee with ten years of service who earns $25 per hour is eligible to receive 7.92 hours of sick leave at a rate of $25 per hour for approved activities. The City’s severance schedule at the time of this writing is as follows: 33% after five years of service; 35% after 15 years of service; 37% after 20 years of service; and 40% after 25 years of service.
Reimbursements will be taxable income to the employee unless otherwise indicated.
Required Documentation
Claims will be accepted June 1-15 and December 1-15 and will be processed in July and January, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. An activity for which reimbursement is requested must have occurred in the same calendar year in which the request for reimbursement is made. All claims shall be submitted to Human Resources via a Request for Reimbursement Form accompanied by proper documentation for each activity. The sick leave used to fund a reimbursement for wellness activities will be based on the employee’s years of service and wage at the time the request for reimbursement is made.
Approved Medical and Dental Expenses
Sick leave may be used to reimburse employees for the employee’s medical and dental expenses not covered by the City’s insurance plans. Accumulated sick leave used for this purpose will be reimbursed according to the City’s sick leave severance schedule based on the employee’s years of service and wage at the time the request for reimbursement is made. To receive the reimbursement, the employee will fill out a Request for Reimbursement Form and submit proof of the expense to the Human Resources Manager.

a.	Individual employee memberships in approved health clubs and/or a sum equal to an individual membership for those employees holding family memberships which include the employee. An approved health club would be one that provides facilities for aerobic and strength training activities.

Approved Deferred Compensation Contributions
Eligible employees will be allowed to convert accumulated sick leave to deferred compensation deposits. Deposits in combination with all other payments to the deferred compensation accounts are subject to maximum deferral regulations. Accumulated sick leave used for deferred compensation contributions will be reimbursed according to the City’s sick leave severance schedule based on the employee’s years of service and wage at the time that the contribution to deferred compensation is requested. Requests for contributions under this section must be submitted to Human Resources by December 31. Contributions will be made to deferred compensation plans via payroll deduction in January of the following year and will not be taxable.
