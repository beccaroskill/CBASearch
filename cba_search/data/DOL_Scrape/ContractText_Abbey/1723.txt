ment as a Field Construction Boilermaker (e.g. acts of violence, sabotage, job site theft, serious and chronic violations of referral rules) will be referred to the National Joint Rules and Standards Committee for consideration and recommendation.

8.6.2	Dispute Hiring Hall Action. If the suspension is otherwise imposed as the result of ministerial action of the referral agent, such is properly the subject of the referral disputes procedures (e.g. two [2] consecutive refusals of offered employment) as are all complaints concerning fair, equitable, and non-discriminatory operation of the referral procedures.
8.6.3	Cumulative Suspensions. If an individual grieves an Employer action, the consequences of which could include a suspension of cumulative duration (thirty [30] and ninety [90] day suspensions for repeated discharge for just cause), such circumstances will be reviewed by the Local Joint Referral Disputes Committee upon exhaustion of the basic grievance procedure and prior to imposition of any cumulative suspension.
