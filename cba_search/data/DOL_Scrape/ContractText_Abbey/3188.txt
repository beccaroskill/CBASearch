v
THIS AGREEMENT, entered into at Columbus, Ohio, March 1,2001, between the BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE CITY OF COLUMBUS SCHOOL DISTRICT (hereinafter referred to as the “Board”), and the COLUMBUS SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION, the OHIO ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL EMPLOYEES, OAPSE/AFSCME LOCAL 4, AFL-CIO (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION
1.1	Recognition. The Board recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining
representative for all employees in the following described unit:
The bargaining unit includes all full-time and regular part-time Civil Service Employees of the school district and all instructional assistants employed by the school district, except that supervisory, confidential, and management level employees, as those terms are defined in Ohio Revised Code Section 4117.01(F), (J), and (K), are excluded from the bargaining unit. Such supervisory and management level employees are not included in the list of classifications paid in accordance with the pay ranges adopted in connection with this agreement. There shall be a total of six (6) clerical positions designated as confidential as defined in ORC section 4117.01(c)(6). Said employees will not participate in OAPSE DAY.
1.2	Definition of “employee”. The term “employee” as used in this Agreement shall refer to those persons included in the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE 2 DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT
2.I	Discrimination. There shall be no discrimination, retaliation or intimidation by the Board or the Union against any employee solely as a result of, or because of such employee’s race, color, creed, sex, age, national origin, or membership or non-membership in the Union.
2.2	Harassment. Harassment as defined in board of education policy and regulation 4114.122, is not permitted in the Columbus Public Schools. (Appendix A)
ARTICLES MANAGEMENT CLAUSE
3.1	Management Rights. The Board retains the sole right and authority to manage the schools of the Columbus City School District. Except as limited by the specific terms of this Agreement this shall include, but not be limited to, the right to direct the Civil Service work force; to decide the duties to be performed; to decide the means, methods and equipment to be used; to assign, transfer and promote the employees; to schedule the days and hours of work, and starting and quitting times of employees; to hire, discharge and discipline employees; and to make such rules and regulations as are necessary to maintain the orderly and efficient operations of the schools.
3.2	Appointing Authority. The parties recognize that, for the purposes of this Agreement, the “Appointing Authority” for the employees covered by this Agreement for the purpose of hiring, employee discipline and discharge shall be the Director of Classified Personnel or other Central Office Administrator designated by the Board and Superintendent. Any disciplinary actions greater than a three day suspension, (including demotions and discharges) shall be acted on by the Board of Education subsequent to the conclusion of any appeal to the Civil Service Commission or Arbitration, or when the appeal period has closed. All other personnel matters, including determining layoffs and job abolishments, shall require action by the Board itself in advance.
ARTICLE 4
UNION REPRESENTATION
4.1	Union Duties. The Union shall represent all employees of the school system within the bargaining unit equally and without discrimination regardless of their membership or non-membership in the Union.
4.2	Union Dues/Agency Fees.
A.	The Board agrees to continue to honor dues deduction authorizations executed by the employee in favor of the Union in accordance with provisions of the Revised Code of Ohio. The dues deduction authorizations shall be honored by the Board unless an employee withdraws from membership in the Union and revokes that authorization in writing in a letter sent to the OAPSE State Treasurer at the State Office and the Board Treasurer within the ten (10) day period from August 22 through August 31. An employee who withdraws from Union membership and revokes dues deduction authorization will be required to pay the fair share fee.
2
B.	All employees who are not members of the Union shall pay a monthly agency fee equivalent to the monthly dues uniformly required of such members, not including initiation fees, fines or assessments, as certified by the Union to the Board’s Treasurer before each school year and as further necessary to be accurate. Such payment shall be subject to a rebate procedure provided by the Union meeting all requirements of applicable state and federal law. Such agency fee shall be automatically deducted from such employees’ paychecks.
C.	Union dues and agency fees, as certified annually on or before August 1 (provided, if the Board has not furnished to the Union in a timely fashion the information needed to calculate the dues and agency fees, this date shall be extended to give the Union a reasonable amount of time to transmit the information to the Board), shall be deducted in twenty (20) equal and consecutive biweekly installments for all employees regardless of length of work year. The first installment shall be made from the first full pay period for school year employees. The charge made by the Board for such deduction privileges shall not be more than fifteen cents ($.15) for such deductions up to twenty (20) in a year. Such charge may be deducted from the first installment of the employee dues or fees. The Union agrees that dues and fee deductions for all locals under the jurisdiction of the Columbus School Employees Association (CSEA) shall be paid directly to the OAPSE State Office on a monthly basis. The Board shall not be responsible for any dues or fee deductions after the employee’s employment terminates.
D.	The foregoing provisions regarding agency fees shall be subject to all requirements of Ohio Revised Code, Section 4117.09(C), when effective, and all other applicable law of like subject matter.
E.	The Union shall indemnify the Board, its members, and its administrative and supervisory employees, including but not limited to the Board’s Treasurer (all hereinafter, “the indemnities”), for, and hold them harmless from, any and all liability, damages and expenses, including but not limited to legal fees at customary rates in the community and costs, directly or indirectly incurred by the indemnities, or any of them because of any legal action or administrative claim brought against them as a result of the provisions of this Article.
4.3	Union Stewards.
A.	The Union may designate Union Stewards at each school building or physically separated establishment or work area of the Board, one of whom shall be designated
3
the Chief Steward. The Union Steward may also be the Local President or his/her Designee. The Chief Steward and any other Union Steward shall be identified by location by the Union for the Board. Union business, including the investigation or processing of grievances shall not be conducted by such stewards on school board time and shall not, in fact, interfere with the work assignment of any other employee.
B.	A limit of one Union Steward involved in the attendance at a grievance hearing for any step of the grievance/discipline procedure, after the grievance has been reduced to writing, shall be provided released time in connection with attendance at such grievance proceeding.
4.4	Privileges of the CSEA President. The President of the CSEA or, in his/her absence, the vice president of CSEA, shall have the privileges accorded to Union Stewards.
4.5	Access to Premises. Official OAPSE field representatives and/or Union Stewards may consult with employees of the bargaining unit before the start of and at the completion of the day’s work and shall be permitted access to work areas at such times only for the purposes of adjusting grievances, assisting in the settlement of disputes, and for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions and aims of this Agreement. This privilege is extended to include access to work areas at other times subject to the approval of the head supervisory person in the building and subject to the understanding that work assignments are not, in fact, to be interfered with, except with approval of the head supervisory person in the building. Visits in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall be by prior arrangement with the head supervisory person except in an emergency. Such a field representative, Union Steward, or CSEA officer shall, after entering a building during normal school hours, first inform the head supervisory person in the building of his/her presence. The Board will be supplied with a list of authorized field representatives, Union Stewards, and CSEA officers, which list shall be kept current by the Union. The Board shall furnish to the Union the names of the head supervisors of all work locations.
4.6	Information Provided to Union by the Board.
A.	The Board agrees to make available to the Union a list of the names and addresses of employees eligible for the bargaining unit setting forth the job classifications and work locations to which each new employee is assigned. Such list will be made available every month.
4
B.	The Board shall supply the Union with the name, address, social security number, hire date, hourly rate, standard weekly hours, pay company, class title, class title code, and file number generally within one (1) week after Board action to employ.
C.	The Board will include employees on both active status and leave status when reporting W-2 earnings to OAPSE for dues calculation purposes. If this does not correct the concern regarding dues deductions from employees returning from leave, the parties will continue to seek a mutually acceptable remedy.
4.7	OAPSE Day. There is hereby established OAPSE Day, which day shall be the same day as COTA Day on the school calendar. Bargaining unit employees shall be released without loss of salary to attend the annual district OAPSE meeting as a professional day on such day. An employee wishing to attend the OAPSE meeting shall make a prior written request to his/her immediate superior as defined in Section 6.3 of this Agreement. Where the operation of the school district requires that certain personnel be on duty, priority in the following order shall be given to those making a written request to attend OAPSE Day:
A.	Officers of the OAPSE Central District;
B.	Officers of the CSEA;
C.	Local officers;
D.	Others.
4.8	Union Leave. The Board shall authorize a pool of up to a total of 180 days with pay per fiscal year for use of members of the bargaining unit who are elected to represent the Union or who are chosen to represent the Union in any official capacity for Union business. Such leaves will be granted upon written application from the President of CSEA made not less than five (5) work days in advance to the Director, Classified Personnel. In no event shall more than two (2) employees be granted such a paid leave on the same day from any classification with thirty (30) or less employees. The parties recognize that jeopardy to the orderly and efficient operation of the school system due to employee absence for other reasons such as illness, personal leave and/or vacation, may result in leave under the provision being denied. Leave requested from this pool of days to attend the OAPSE annual convention shall generally be granted.
Additionally, if requested by the President of CSEA, employees that are officers on the state or district level may be granted leave without pay for Union business provided the Union reimburses the Board for the employees’ wages and such absence does not interfere with the efficient operation of any department or working unit. Such request must be submitted in
5
writing no less than five (5) work days in advance to the Director, Classified Personnel. It is anticipated by the parties that these requests would generally be reserved for special circumstances.
4.9	Mail Service to Union Office. The Union office, as designated annually by the President of CSEA, shall be included on a regular school building mail route provided such office is in a location that can be reasonably scheduled on an existing mail route.
4.10	Use of School Equipment. The CSEA officers and/or Union Stewards may request to use individual school office equipment (including audio visual equipment) when such equipment is not otherwise in use. Such request must be made to the appropriate administrator or supervisor at that specific work site. Permission to use such equipment will not be unreasonably withheld.
4.11	AFSCME-PEOPLE. The Board agrees to deduct from the wages of any employee an AFSCME-PEOPLE deduction as provided for in a written authorization. Such authorization must be executed by the employee and may be revoked by the employee at any time. The Board agrees to remit any deductions made pursuant to this provision promptly to the Union together with an itemized statement showing the name of each employee from whose pay such deductions have been made and the amount deducted during the period covered by the remittance. Payroll deductions for AFSCME-PEOPLE shall be made available to employees as follows:
A.	AFSCME-PEOPLE payroll deductions shall be made ten (10) times a fiscal year for all pay plans from the same paychecks that charity payroll deductions are made as published annually in payroll schedules prepared by the Office of the Treasurer.
B.	A payroll deduction must be for a minimum of $1.00 and in full dollar increments.
C.	The Office of the Treasurer will transmit payroll deductions by check to AFSCME-PEOPLE on a monthly basis if the total deduction is at least $100. Total monthly deductions less than $100 shall be carried over until at least $100 is accumulated.
D.	The Board will charge the Union two cents ($.02) per deduction for such deduction privileges.
E.	Payroll deduction forms may be submitted to the Office of the Treasurer at any time. The payroll deductions will begin as soon as practical.
6
F.	A bargaining unit member may stop AFSCME-PEOPLE payroll deductions by requesting such in a letter to the Treasurer. Payroll deductions will be canceled as soon as practical after receipt of the letter.
4.12	WCBE Announcements. The Union will be provided access to have announcements related to the Union made on WCBE. The extent of this access and any requirements and/or restrictions will be communicated to the President of CSEA.
4.13	Labor-Management Meetings and Committees.
A.	Labor-Management Meetings. Labor-management meetings may be called by mutual agreement. Meetings may be held for a specific Local, or for CSEA as a whole. The parties shall agree upon an agenda prior to the meeting. A labor-management meeting shall be held at least quarterly unless the parties agree otherwise.
B.	Insurance Study Committee. A joint Board/Union Insurance Study Committee shall be established to review the insurance provided in this Agreement and to make reports to the Superintendent and to the Union President concerning any alternatives and recommendations as they relate to providing an improved insurance program. All related insurance records and statistics reasonably available to the Board will be made available to the joint committee. This committee shall also be authorized to:
(1)	Review and, as necessary revise any materials concerning the insurance program which are to be distributed to employees.
(2)	Determine the limit that should be placed on in-patient psychiatric and substance abuse coverage and include a statement regarding such limit in said materials.
(3)	Study a Preferred Provider Organization Plan.
C.	Health and Safety Committee. The Board and the Union shall establish a labor-management health and safety committee. The committee shall be composed of at least four (4) representatives appointed by the Board and four (4) representatives appointed by the Union; however, those members whose locals or departments are directly involved with specific agenda items shall attend. The duties of the Committee will be to analyze injury data, identify safety-related problems, recommend safe work practices, procedures and equipment improvements, promote
7
awareness and encourage compliance with safety rules, the use of safety equipment Risk Reduction Program models.
Similar committees may be established by each local, consisting of at least one classified representative from each department within the local and the department head or designee.
Meeting of the Health and Safety Committee shall be held outside of regular working hours, with a limit of one hour unless extended by mutual agreement. Employees shall be paid their regular rate for attendance at Health and Safety Committee meetings of Employees shall not be compensated for attending meetings of committees established by a local.
D.	Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The President of CSEA shall have the right to appoint at least as many members to the committee established to oversee an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for all Columbus Public Schools employees as any other employee organization represented.
4.14	School Continuous Improvement Teams. Any School Continuous Improvement Teams (or similar group called by another name) shall include a representative(s) of the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE 5
CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE PLEDGE
5.1	No Strike Clause. The members of the Union agree that they will neither cause nor sponsor any strike, slow-down, or other work stoppage during the term of this Agreement. Any dispute as to whether this provision has been violated shall be determined by the State Employment Relations Board (SERB).
5.2	No Lockout Provision. In recognition of this continuous performance pledge, the Board agrees there will be no “lockout” of members of the Union except if such “lockout” is a result of the Board’s inability to pay which results in the closing of all regular schools. In the event the Board determines it is necessary to close all schools in connection with actions of Board employees who are not members of the bargaining unit, school-year employees who are members of the bargaining unit may have their work year adjusted by the Board to accommodate the pupil attendance days in the adjusted school calendar provided no such school-year employee, except as a result of being on an unpaid status, shall have their days of work or their total salary for the school year reduced by such adjusted school calendar.
8
Such adjusted work year shall not be considered a “lockout.” Any dispute as to whether this provision has been violated shall be subject to final and binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
5.3	Initiation/Participation in a Strike. Any classified employee who initiates or participates in a strike or other act prohibited by this Article will be subject to disciplinary action by the Board; provided, however, that the question of such participation shall be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 6.
5.4	Union Responsibility. The Union will make every reasonable effort to prevent or terminate violations of this Pledge.
ARTICLE 6 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE/ARBITRATION
6.1	Definition of “grievance”. A grievance is defined to be any question or controversy between any employee or the Union with the Board involving:
A.	The interpretation or application of the provisions of this Agreement;
B.	The effect, reasonableness, or application of any work rule established or enforced by the Board;
C.	The discipline or discharge of any employee except to the extent that the employee has a right to appeal the discipline of more than 3 days or discharge to the civil service commission.
When such problems arise, an attempt must be made by the employee, the Union Steward, and the employee’s immediate superior to settle them informally. A problem which cannot be resolved informally will be processed as a grievance.
6.2	Union Class Action Grievance. In the event there is a grievance which affects a number of employees or which involves a condition of general concern to the employees, it may be submitted as a grievance at Step 2 by the Union, provided:
A.	The grievance involves employees at more than one work location, or
B.	The grievance involves employees in more than one department, as listed in Article 7.1 (B), assigned to the same work location.
9
6.3	Grievance Procedural Steps. An employee should first make every effort to settle differences and disputes informally without filing a grievance. In the event that an agreement cannot be reached, grievance shall be processed in the following manner:
Step 1. Within ten (10) calendar days after either an employee or the Union has knowledge of the incident which is the subject of the grievance, the employee involved (or the Union, as provided in 6.2 above) will reduce his/her grievance to writing, on forms to be agreed upon, and will submit it to his/her immediate superior, who is a supervisor or administrator. (In order to preserve his/her Civil Service appeal rights, a grievant must also complete and submit an appeal form and a copy of the grievance to the Board’s Civil Service Office within ten (10) calendar days of such occurrence. The appeal will be held until the appropriate step within the grievance process. Upon notification to the Board’s Civil Service Office by the employee or the Union that Step 3 has been reached, the appeal will be activated.) Within five (5) work days after the grievance is submitted, a hearing officer chosen by the Board will discuss the grievance with the employee involved and attempt to resolve it. Within five (5) work days after this discussion, the hearing officer will state his/her decision in writing, attach it to the grievance form, and provide a complete copy to the grievant.
Step 2. If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision concerning his/her grievance made by the hearing officer, he/she may, within five (5) work days of his/her receipt of such decision, request such hearing officer to forward his/her grievance to the Superintendent of Schools for hearing. The Superintendent of Schools, or his/her designated representative, will schedule a hearing on the grievance within ten (10) work days of its receipt by him/her and will notify the employee and the Union of the time and place of such hearing. Within five (5) work days following such hearing, the Superintendent of Schools or his/her designee shall state his/her decision in writing, attach it to the grievance form, and forward a complete copy to the grievant.
Step 3. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the employee and/or the Union, within five (5) work days following receipt of the Step 2 response, shall have the right to continue the grievance as an appeal to the Municipal Civil Service Commission of the City of Columbus in accordance with the procedures established by said Commission and as hereinafter provided in Section 6.6(A), provided the appeal was filed with the Board’s Civil Service Office within the prescribed ten (10) day time period. In the event the grievance concerns a matter over which the Columbus Municipal Civil Service Commission refuses to exercise or grant jurisdiction, the Union shall have the recourse to the arbitration procedure provided for in Article 6.
10
6.4	Failure to Appeal. The failure of the grievant to appeal any decision to the next step within the time set forth for such appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right of further appeal in all cases (except one in which the Municipal Civil Service Commission exercises jurisdiction), and a final disposition of the grievance shall be made on the basis of the last decision given so far as the Board of Education grievance steps are applied.
6.5	Grievance Hearings, Representation, and Grievant’s Rights. Unless mutually agreed otherwise, all grievance hearings shall be held outside of the normal working hours of the grievant or grievants involved so as not to interfere with their working responsibilities, except that Step 1 hearings shall be held during the grievant’s normal work day (span of day for bus drivers) unless, at the discretion of the Board, the Step 1 hearing is held at the assigned work location of the grievant. A Field representative and/or of the Union Steward may accompany and represent the grievant at all steps of the grievance procedure, however, only one such person shall serve as spoke person. The grievant shall have the right to present witnesses and question such witnesses on the matter of the grievance and shall have the right to present any other relevant evidence in his/her own behalf. An employee shall not be represented or accompanied by any other representative but an official Union representative at any grievance or arbitration hearing. An employee may represent himself in Step I or in Step 2 of this procedure.

A.	In the event the Columbus Municipal Civil Service Commission refuses to exercise jurisdiction over a grievance which has been submitted to it or in the event it is finally determined that the Columbus Municipal Civil Service Commission has no jurisdiction overthe grievance, the Union may request arbitration. Arbitration must be requested in writing within thirty-five (35) calendar days after receipt of the written answer given by the Superintendent of Schools or his/her designee under Step 2 of the grievance procedures, or within thirty-five (35) calendar days after receipt of the refusal by the Municipal Civil Service Commission to exercise or grant jurisdiction, or of a final determination that the Municipal Civil Service Commission has no jurisdiction over the grievance, whichever is later.
B.	Within five (5) working days after the notice requesting arbitration has been served on the Board, the parties shall meet to select an impartial arbitrator. If no agreement is reached at this meeting, the parties immediately and jointly shall request the services of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitrator selection shall be governed by the voluntary rules of the American Arbitration Association.
11
C.	The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.
D.	The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, subtract from, or modify this Agreement. Only grievances and disputes between the parties as to the interpretation, or application, of this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration as herein provided.
E.	The costs for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, and actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses, as well as the related cost of the American Arbitration Association services, shall be borne totally by the loser.

Such charges shall not be divided by the arbitrator between the parties in any manner or under any circumstances without prior approval of both parties. The expenses of witnesses and other representatives shall be borne by the party they represent. A stenographic record of the arbitration proceedings may be made. Either party may request a stenographic record and bear the total expense for it. If the other party desires a copy then each party shall pay for its own copy of such record, and the parties shall share equally the cost of the arbitrator’s copy.
F.	The Union and/or the Board may request the other to provide in advance of the arbitration hearing, documents relevant to the grievance under consideration, as well as the names of witnesses intended to be called at the hearing. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.

H.	Upon request of either party, the parties may meet to attempt to settle the matter prior to arbitration through mediation.

During such time a new employee shall have no seniority rights, and his/her qualifications to do the work required, or his/her discharge or layoff for any reason, shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedures set forth in this Agreement. Employees retained beyond this probationary period shall have their system seniority computed as of their date of hire; their department seniority computed as of their latest date of entry into the department; their job classification seniority computed as of their latest date of entry into the job classification; and their building seniority computed as of their latest date of entry into the building.

When an employee is reassigned to a classified non-bargaining unit position, the employee shall retain the seniority accumulated prior to the reassignment.

(1)	Available 65-passenger bus routes shall be posted during the annual route bidding process. 65-passenger bus drivers, except drivers of special education routes, shall have the option of retaining their routes from the preceding year. Retained routes will not be available for bidding, and drivers retaining routes will not take part in the annual route bidding process. A route will be considered for retention provided at least one-half of the trips are continued from the preceding school year. A trip is considered to be continued if it serves the same elementary attendance area as a residential route or if it serves the same discontinuous attendance area, in each case with the same school level of pupils.

25
(b)	The routes will be posted and the indexed list made available prior to August 15 for not less than two (2) days for review and adjustment by an OAPSE Representative and the Local officers or their designees. The Local President or the OAPSE Representative shall have the authority to add to or delete from the list, based on reasonable determinations.
(c)	The adjusted lists shall be posted along with the basic routes for review by the drivers for at least two (2) days prior to and the day of the bidding. Drivers will be given a reasonable opportunity to view the routes prior to the bidding. The Local President or OAPSE Representative shall have the authority to resolve conflicts which may arise concerning route retention rights.

(1)	Eight-hour drivers without a mid-day route segment or other assigned mid-day responsibility.
(2)	Five-hour drivers who elect to be on the mid-day work list, on a continuous rotation.
In the event more drivers are needed than the number electing, drivers will be assigned on a rotating basis beginning with the least senior driver.

(3)	Drivers absent any part of the day of the trip, or of the last work day preceding a trip on a non-work day, shall lose their turn for that rotation unless:
(a)	The driver has a medical appointment, and has provided Transportation Supervisor with notice of the appointment three (3) work days prior to the appointment.

Administrative personnel will be advised to call the Department of Transportation for field trip buses rather than outside contractors. Any individual teacher or administrator who arranges for a field trip bus from an outside contractor will be directed to follow the proper procedures in the future.
The Board will continue to determine the feasibility of utilizing Columbus Public School bus drivers to drive field trips outside the field trip window. This determination will be made on a case-by-case basis and may require more flexibility in assigning drivers to such trips than normally occurs when assigning drivers to mid-day field trips that occur inside the field trip window.

43
from outside of the bargaining unit shall be considered for a position as long as there is a member of the bargaining unit who applies for the position and is not subject to rejection as provided for in this section.
8.16	Temporary Assignment to a Vacancy. Nothing in the foregoing procedure for filling job vacancies shall detract from the right of the Board to temporarily fill job vacancies, without regard to seniority, until such time as a permanent replacement is secured through application of the appropriate procedures set forth in Sections 8.6 through 8.14.
8.17	Placement in Promotional Position. Within twenty (20) work days of notification of a promotion, an employee will be placed in the promotional position, except when an effective date for the position has been established in the certification letter, in which case the employee will be placed in the promotional position within ten (10) work days of the established date.
8.18	Prior Consideration for Bargaining Unit Members. It shall be the policy of the Board of Education that consideration be given to members of the bargaining unit prior to consideration of other applicants when filling positions at the Board of Education that do not require a teaching certificate, in the event such position does not fall within the bargaining unit. The Board shall notify the President of CSEA of any such vacancy in existing positions and of any such new positions established.
8.19	Assignments Between Classifications. Employees who desire to work in more than one job classification on a part-time basis may make application to the office of Classified Personnel. Assignment to more than one classification shall not interfere with the job responsibilities of either classification and shall not cause any employee to be assigned for more than 40 hours each week. The office of Classified of Personnel shall develop and disseminate procedures for application and consideration of dual-classification work.
ARTICLE 9
HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
9.1	Normal Schedule of Hours/Full-Time Employees. The normal schedule of hours for all regular full-time employees shall consist of eight (8) hours of work five (5) days per week, except where there is a seven (7) day operation made necessary by the nature of the work. If the work week for any position is normally five (5) days, work performed on Saturday or Sunday, as a part of said work week, shall be paid at one and one-half (W) times.
44
9.2	Normal Schedule of Hours/Part-Time Employees. The normal schedule of hours for regular part-time employees shall consist of two, three, four, five, six, or seven consecutive hours of work, five (5) days per week. The parties recognize that there are some employees in the school system who are assigned a split shift. All Food Service employees shall be guaranteed a minimum of three (3) hours per day.
9.3	Overtime Rate/Compensation Time. Clerical, Truck Drivers, Warehouse, Data Processing and Custodial employees required to work overtime previously approved by the supervisor may, at the employee’s option, elect to receive compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime for up to one-half (1/z) of all overtime worked by that employee. The employee must notify the supervisor in writing by the end of the business day after overtime has been worked if the employee desires to use compensatory time at a future date rather than receive payment for the overtime in the next pay period. Compensatory time shall not be used immediately before or after a holiday or any student non-attendance days.
Compensatory time shall be credited on the basis of one and one-half (11/z) hour for each hour of overtime worked by the employee. Compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime may be accumulated up to a maximum of forty (40) hours.
Whenever the employee desires to take time off earned on the basis of compensatory time, the employee shall submit a written request to the employee’s supervisor. Indicating the amount of compensatory time the employee desires to use and the requested date(s) for such use. The supervisor may not unreasonably deny the employee’s request to use accrued compensatory time. Except in emergency situations, an employee shall submit a request to use compensatory time a minimum of three (3) work days in advance of the time desired off unless the supervisor agrees to lesser notice.
After an employee has used any or all of the employee’s accumulated compensatory time, the employee may accumulate additional compensatory time up to the forty (40) hour maximum. If the employee’s request to use compensatory time is denied, the employee shall have the option to request to receive cash payment for the overtime worked. Upon termination of employment for any reason, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at the rate in effect at the time of payment.
9.4	Tardiness. Tardiness of less than fifteen (15) minutes for a scheduled shift shall not be the basis for denying an employee the right to work the remainder of the shift. Nothing in this provision shall limit the right of the Board to discipline an employee for tardiness of less than fifteen (15) minutes, and denial of the right to work for tardiness in excess of fifteen (15)
45
minutes shall not limit the right of the Board to take other disciplinary action in connection with such tardiness. The decision to deny an employee who is fifteen (15) or more minutes late the right to work the remainder of the shift shall be at the discretion of the Board. In general, denial of the right to work the remainder of the shift will be based on other arrangements having already been initiated, on the previous attendance record of the employee, or the degree of tardiness.
9.5	Non-Traditional Work Schedule. Notwithstanding the provisions of 9.1 and 9.3, the overtime rate shall not be applied to hours worked in excess of eight (8) in a given day or to hours worked on Saturday or Sunday, provided such hours worked are a part of an established regular work schedule voluntarily accepted by the employee. The overtime rate shall apply to hours worked in excess of forty (40) in any week.
9.6	Pyramiding/Duplicating Overtime. There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of overtime pay. Where two overtime or premium rates are applicable, only one shall be paid.
9.7	Custodial Overtime.
A.	When a head custodian is required to make an elementary school building check on a day when he/she is not regularly scheduled to work, said employee shall be paid a minimum of one (1) hour at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular pay. When a head custodian is required to make a middle or high school building check on a day when he/she is not regularly scheduled to work, said employee shall be paid a minimum of one and one-half (11/z) hours at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular pay. In the event the head custodian is unable to make a required building check it is the head custodian’s responsibility to designate another custodian at that building to make the building check. The Board will follow the same procedure at Kingswood as at elementary schools in the district regarding building checks by custodians.
B.	Custodian overtime at a work location shall be offered to all custodial and head custodial, including head operating, personnel on a rotation basis beginning with the most senior based on job classification seniority. Exceptions to this policy may be made for the following reasons:
(1)	When overtime duties to be performed require the presence of the head custodian (head operating employee).
46
(2)	When the need for assigned overtime is identified with less than twenty-four [24] hours’ advance notice.
(3)	When the overtime requires performance of a duty which is not practical for a Custodian I, the Custodian I may be passed but will again be placed on the rotation list for the next available overtime that is consistent with Custodian I duties.
(4)	Building check is not included for purposes of overtime rotations.
Because of the wide variance in advance notice, some overtime may be offered or assigned well in advance, while other overtime may be offered or assigned on relatively short notice. Each head custodian, in consultation with and at the direction of the building administrator, may develop the procedures most suitable to a given work location. Such procedures may include offering known overtime at a predetermined time each week or each month or some combination of the two approaches or some other suitable approach. Personnel who are absent on the date the overtime is offered or absent on the day the overtime is worked shall lose that turn. A custodian, head custodian, or head operating employee may be removed from the overtime rotation as a result of formal discipline action related to overtime duties. When a custodian refuses three (3) consecutive overtime opportunities in one school year, he/she shall be dropped from the overtime rotation list for the remainder of the year.
C.	Custodial emergency and project overtime shall be offered to all custodians and head custodians, when the custodians assigned to a particular location either waive their right to such overtime as defined in section (B) above or if the amount of overtime available exceeds the ability of the custodians at that location to satisfactorily complete in a reasonable time frame.
Custodians and Head Custodians wishing to be considered for such overtime must submit in writing their desire to be included on either or both of the lists maintained in the custodial services office for emergency overtime and for project overtime. Assignments for overtime will be offered rotationally on the basis of those lists, which shall be ordered in terms of overall departmental seniority. Exceptions to this policy shall be the same as those listed in section (B) above.
47
9.8	Food Service Extended Time/Summer Work.
A.	Food service workers who are regularly assigned extended service shall have their regularly scheduled work day increased in a similar manner. Specifically, when such an employee is assigned extended service in excess of 30 minutes for the majority of the work days in a full pay period for two consecutive pay periods, effective the first paid day of the next pay period the employee’s regularly scheduled work day shall be increased by the average number of extended hours during the two previous pay periods. This provision does not apply to food service workers during the first two full pay periods of the school year and does not apply to temporary extended service assigned as a result of the absence of another employee in the same work location.
All benefits resulting from such increase, except the added hours of pay, shall remain in effect for two pay periods following any reduction in the scheduled work day for such an employee. Any changes in insurance coverage resulting from an increase or decrease in an employee’s scheduled work day shall be effective the first day of the month following the effective date of such change.
B.	At the Food Service Production Center, the cold food line is currently operated at a maximum of 96 meals per minute and the hot food line is operated between 120 and 140 meals per minute, depending on product. These maximums will not be intentionally increased unless improved equipment or changed product make an increase feasible and unless any anticipated increase is first discussed with representatives of the affected employees.
C.	Summer food service positions determined by the Board to be available to food service personnel shall be awarded to food service employees based on the appropriate job classification seniority. In the event the Board participates in summer feeding programs that require the full or partial operation of the Food Service Production Center and use of specialized equipment at the Food Service Production Center, preference will be given to those employees who regularly operate that equipment during the school year. Putting food on the conveyor belt is not considered use of specialized equipment.
9.9	School Clerical Overtime/Comp Time/Summer Work.
A.	The provisions of 9.3 shall apply to school secretaries. Compensatory time off for work beyond the scheduled work day by school secretaries shall be based on the provisions of 9.3 with regard to straight time and time and one-half and shall be on a
48
voluntary basis. Work required beyond the scheduled work day by school secretaries shall be based on the provisions of 9.3 and shall be on a paid basis as authorized by the Director of Classified Personnel unless, by prior mutual agreement of the secretary and principal, compensatory time is to be taken.
In cases when a secretary is unable to reach the building principal, and has called the office of Classified Personnel, and there is no other staff person available or willing to remain with a child at the school, that secretary shall be compensated for the time he/she remained at the work site beyond the regular work day at the secretary’s regular hourly rate unless such time would make the secretary eligible for overtime compensation in which event the secretary will receive overtime compensation. The secretary required to work beyond the regular work day shall receive a minimum of one-half hour for each such occurrence. (It should be noted that the responsibility for remaining with the child rests with the classroom teacher in the majority of cases).
B.	(1) In the event a school clerical position exists for a secondary summer school program, the position will first be offered to the school secretary assigned to the location during the school year. The position will next be offered to the school secretary who held the position in the available location the previous summer. The position will next be offered to other school secretaries and awarded on the basis of department seniority. School secretaries in secondary summer school programs shall be paid their existing hourly rate of pay.
(2)	In the event a summer school helper position exists for an elementary summer school program, the position will first be offered to the school secretary assigned to the location during the school year. The position will next be offered to the school secretary who held the position in the available location the previous summer. The position will next be offered to other school secretaries on the basis of department seniority. The position will next be offered to instructional assistants, first on the basis of assignment in the position at the location the previous summer and next on the basis of department seniority. School secretaries in elementary summer school helper positions shall be paid at their regular hourly rate. Instructional assistants in summer school helper positions shall be paid their existing hourly rate of pay as an instructional assistant.
(3)	By April I5 of each year, the Director of Classified Personnel shall distribute a form to all work locations. This form shall be for secretaries and instructional assistants to indicate their desire for summer positions. The Director of Classified Personnel shall then proceed to award the available positions on the
49
basis of the desires indicated on such form and in compliance with the provisions of A and B above.
9.10	Pupil Transportation Span and Segments. During the term of this Agreement, the overtime rate shall be paid to bus drivers, child care attendants who ride a bus, and intervention aides who ride a bus, for time in excess of eight (8) hours of work or in excess of a ten (IO) hour span, whichever computation produces the greater overtime. There shall be no more than two (2) segments used to compute a bus employee’s work day.
9.11	Truck Driver Overtime/Summer Work/lnspection.
A.	Overtime.
(1)	School-year overtime shall be offered to all truck drivers on a rotation basis. The initial rotation shall begin with the most senior driver on the basis of job classification seniority. Sign-up lists for weekday and weekend overtime shall be posted for at least two (2) work days at truck driver work locations (currently 737 East Hudson, and Food Production Center), through the Wednesday prior to the overtime period or through the third work day prior to an extended weekend. The Board will administer the overtime roster in such a way as to be fair and equitable in the assignment of overtime.
(2)	All new drivers are excluded from overtime the first time around.
(3)	Any driver who is absent on the day the overtime is offered or absent on the day the overtime is worked shall lose that turn.
(4)	It is recognized by the parties that some overtime will occur in connection with various routes and such overtime will not be bid. It is further recognized by the parties that overtime bidding may not be practicable when the need for overtime is not known at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance.
(5)	A truck driver may be removed from the overtime rotation as a result of formal discipline action related to overtime duties.
(6)	Truck drivers will be offered available overtime work in the truck driver department before other employees are offered such work.
(7)	In the event that an insufficient number of food service truck drivers accept overtime, drivers shall be assigned by reverse seniority.
50
B.	Summer Work.
All summer truck driving work, beyond that assigned to calendar-year truck drivers, shall be offered to school-year truck drivers before being offered to other employees.
9.12	Warehouse Personnel Overtime (Known at least 24 hours in advance).
(1)	Warehouse personnel shall be offered overtime and extra time in the appropriate classification on a rotating basis beginning initially with the most senior warehouse personnel on a job classification basis at the site where the employee is regularly assigned.
(2)	Any warehouse personnel absent on the day the overtime is offered or absent on the day the overtime is worked shall lose that turn.
(3)	Any warehouse personnel may be removed from the overtime rotation as a result of formal discipline action related to overtime duties.
(4)	It is recognized by the parties that some overtime will occur in connection with various routes and such overtime will not be bid. It is further recognized by the parties that overtime bidding may not be practicable when the need for overtime is not known at least twenty-four hours in advance.
9.13	Maintenance/Vehicle Maintenance Overtime Compensation.
A Maintenance Department (may include Engineering Services personnel) or Vehicle Maintenance Department employee required to work overtime may, at the employee’s option, elect to receive compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime for up to one-half f/2) of all overtime worked by that employee. Compensatory time shall be credited on the basis of one and one-half (11/2) hour for each hour of overtime worked by the employee. Compensatory time in lieu of paid overtime may be accumulated up to a maximum of forty (40) hours. Whenever the employee desires to take time off earned on the basis of compensatory time, the employee shall submit a request to the employee’s supervisor. The supervisor may not unreasonably deny the employee’s request to use accrued compensatory time. Except in emergency situations, an employee shall submit a request to use compensatory time a minimum of three (3) work days in advance of the time desired off unless the supervisor agrees to lesser notice. After an employee has used any or all of the employee’s accumulated compensatory time, the employee may accumulate additional compensatory time up
51
to the forty (40) hour maximum. If the employee’s request to use compensatory time is denied, the employee shall have the option to request to receive cash payment for the overtime worked. Upon termination of employment for any reason, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at the rate in effect at the time of payment.
9.14	Data Processing Overtime. Data Processing Computer Employees periodically assigned on-call responsibility and system check responsibility during periods of non-production (generally weekends and holidays) will be paid a minimum of two hours pay for each such assigned day. The rate of such pay, and pay for hours actually worked in excess of two, shall be in accordance with the Board/OAPSE Agreement. Such periodic assignments shall normally be rotated among Computer Operator I’s and Computer Operator Il’s and such employees shall normally be furnished with a pager during such on-call assignment.
9.15	Breaks/Smoking on School Grounds.
A.	Employees working a scheduled day of seven (7) or more hours shall be provided two (2) fifteen-minute breaks, one of which shall occur during the first half and one of which shall occur during the last half of the work day. Employees working a scheduled day of four (4) or more hours shall be provided one (1) fifteen-minute break. The break(s) may be scheduled by the responsible supervisor and may not be used to adjust the employee’s scheduled work day. For food service personnel, the breaks provided in this provision shall be fifteen-minute breaks.
B.	Any policy regarding smoking adopted by the Board of Education shall be applied uniformly to all CPS employees.
9.16	Food Service Lunch/Breaks. Cafeteria employees scheduled to work four (4) hours or less shall not be required to take a one-half hour lunch break during said four (4) hours or less scheduled hours; provided, however, employees working four (4) hour schedules will be permitted to take a fifteen-minute break during such four (4) hour period.
9.17	Working in Higher Job Classifications. Any employee assigned to work in a higher job classification shall be paid, from the first day of such assignment, at the rate for the higher job classification, provided such assignment is for more than five (5) consecutive work days or the employee does work five (5) consecutive work days or longer in the higher job classification. The rate of pay shall be determined by application of the provisions of Article 20 of this Agreement. If a holiday(s) for which the employee would normally be paid falls
52
during the assignment, the employee shall be paid at the rate for the higher job classification for such holiday(s). Assignments of custodians during the summer months as a result of vacation schedules for head custodians shall not be subject to the above provisions of this Section.
9.18	Emergency School Closings.
A.	Employees shall be paid for all time lost when the Board determines that schools are officially closed on a system wide basis owing to disease epidemic, hazardous weather condition, or other public calamity. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring payment in excess of the employee’s regular wage rate or salary for any time worked while the school in which he/she is employed is officially closed for the reasons set forth herein. Members of the bargaining unit who are, by reason of their assignment, required to work when schools are closed for such reasons shall be given equal compensatory time off. The compensatory time shall be taken at a time that is mutually agreeable to the employee and the employee’s supervisor and shall be taken, where practical,, within a two-week period following the day when the compensatory time was earned.
B.	Employees shall be paid for all time lost when the Board determines that one or more individual schools are closed owing to damage to a school building, other temporary circumstances due to utility failure, or other public calamity, and no work is available in the closed school within the employee’s classification, except that the Board may offer such employees work within their classification at other schools or the Food Production Center. Employees declining such work shall not be paid for time lost, except that employees with a scheduled work day of four (4) hours or less shall not be required to report on the first day to another location in order to be paid. In the event the school is closed after employees report to work, the necessary travel time to the temporary location shall be considered a part of the work day. The employee shall be paid the mileage rate if the distance is more than four (4) miles.
9.19	Summer Cleaning Positions.

Such positions shall be for a minimum of five (5) hours per day.
9.20	Vehicle Maintenance Overtime. Vehicle Maintenance overtime at a work location shall be offered to employees whose name appears on an overtime rotation list beginning with the employee with the most job classification seniority on a rotating basis except that an
53
employee who has started a project which requires overtime shall be entitled to finish that work. The distribution of overtime shall be offered in a fair and equitable manner.
9.21	Overtime in Treasurer’s Office. When the Treasurer or his/her designee determines that overtime is needed, the overtime will be handled as follows:
1.	Overtime will be offered first to the individual(s) whose job(s) require overtime.
2.	The overtime will next be offered to others in the same classification within the section in which the overtime is needed based on job classification seniority.
3.	If additional employees are needed, the overtime will then be offered to employees in the job classification who appears on an overtime rotation list on a rotational basis beginning with the employee with the most job classification seniority. Employees desiring overtime shall sign an overtime rotation list jointly maintained by a designee of OAPSE Local 721 and a representative of the Treasurer.
9.22	Buildings and Grounds and Vehicle Maintenance Stand-by Pay. Buildingsand grounds and vehicle maintenance stand-by duty will be offered on a rotating basis among those employees who have signed up on a stand-by list at a specific work location. An employee on a stand-by rotation list may decline a stand-by opportunity in advance in sufficient time to allow assignment to someone else and in such case shall lose that turn on the stand-by rotation. If all employees decline to accept stand-by duty, the duty will be assigned to the employee with the least job classification seniority. It is recognized that buildings and grounds stand-by may be offered to persons in specific classifications, or who have special skills or assignments rather than all employees.
Employees are on stand-by when all of the following conditions apply:
1.	The Supervisor informs the person he/she is on stand-by in writing and the employee accepts that assignment.
2.	The employee remains in the physical proximity of the employee’s home phone (or he/she may wear a beeper or be accessible by cellular phone, with the Supervisor’s approval).
3.	The employee returns to work within 30 minutes of receiving the call (or no longer than regular drive time if the employee lives more than 30 minutes from the work site).
54
4.	The employee remains in work ready condition (no alcohol, adequate sleep, etc.).
5.	The employee realizes that failure to report to work when on stand-by duty is grounds for permanent removal from the stand-by list or appropriate employee discipline.
Employees on stand-by duty shall be compensated at the rate of one-fourth (1/4) of their regular rate of pay, for all time spent in stand-by status when not actually working. The employee will be paid the employee’s regular rate of pay from the time the employee reports to work until completion unless the time actually worked would qualify the employee for overtime compensation in which event the employee will be compensated at the employee’s overtime rate. The duration of the stand-by duty shall be set by the Supervisor.
Time spent on stand-by duty shall not constitute “hours worked” for the purposes of overtime calculations.
Stand-by is differentiated from being “on call” wherein management may make a good faith effort to contact an employee, but no penalty follows if the employee does not come to work. Being “on call” does not require additional payment by management unless the employee is actually called to work.
ARTICLE 10

10.2	Change in Working Conditions.
A.	The Board shall make it a practice to discuss with the Union, in advance, changes in working conditions which affect multiple classifications of employees or affect employees within a classification throughout the district. This provision is not intended to apply to changes in duties which are permissible under Civil Service Rules and Regulations but is intended to refer to significant system wide matters such as Section 12.6. This Section 10.2A shall not be subject to Article 6.
55
B.	A classified civil service employee shall not be assigned work in violation of the employee’s class specification, Columbus City Civil Service Commission Rules and Regulations and the specific terms of this Agreement and any assignment of work which does not violate the same shall not be considered a change in working conditions for a classified civil service employee. An instructional assistant shall not be assigned work in violation of the employee’s class specification, Section 3319.088 of the Ohio Revised Code and the specific terms of this Agreement and any assignment of work which does not violate the same shall not be considered a change in working conditions for an instructional assistant. In the event that the Board assigns work to an employee which the Union contends is a violation of this Section, the Board, upon notification from the Union, shall meet with the Union to discuss whether there has been a change in working conditions for an employee. If the Board and the Union are unable to satisfactorily resolve a dispute concerning a question of whether there has been a change in working conditions for an employee, the Union may, within ten (10) calendar days after the Board and Union meet, submit the matter for a decision to (1) the Civil Service Commission in the case of a question concerning a classified civil service employee and (2) an arbitrator in the case of a question concerning an instructional assistant.

B.	Whenever the Board proposes to create a new bargaining unit classification, the Board will negotiate the pay range for such classification with the Union.
10.4	Performance Evaluations. All classified employees shall be evaluated on performance twice during the employee’s probationary period and once during each year of employment. All performance evaluations shall be done during normal work hours.
56
10.5	Job Audits. Whenever the Board of Education is informed that a job audit is being conducted involving the members of the bargaining unit, it shall promptly notify the President of the Union of such audit including the positions being audited and by whom the audit is being conducted. The Board of Education shall also inform the person conducting the audit of the provisions of this Section. Upon receipt of such notice, the Union may request to meet with the Administration or its appropriate representatives to discuss their respective positions concerning the jobs under audit. The Union may, if it desires, request the Civil Service Commission or the person conducting the audit to allow the Association to state its position on the job under audit.

During such sixty (60) calendar day period the employee shall be maintained in the employee’s classification and pay range but may be assigned any bargaining unit work at the discretion of the Board. Upon passage of the tests to obtain a CDL, the employee shall be returned to the employee’s regular duties and position.

B.	There shall be established during this contract period a training/mentorship program. The members of the bargaining unit acknowledge that they can do much to assist new employees. This assistance may involve “ride along” assignments, observation, a “buddy system” or other creative arrangements that are agreed to
57
between the supervisor, the new employee and bargaining unit member. Bargaining unit members who serve in such roles shall not be required to evaluate the new employee.
ARTICLE 11 JOB SECURITY
11.1	Subcontracting.
A.	The Columbus Board of Education must notify the CSEA of any intention to subcontract any bargaining unit work and to give the Union an opportunity to be heard at a public meeting of the Board on such matters before a decision is made. It being understood that this notice applies to proposals for a change in policy requiring Board action as contrasted with the emergency, temporary or short-term project employment situations in which the administration has authority to act without specific prior Board action. After any decision to subcontract under the above provision, the impact upon bargaining unit employees will be discussed in the conference committee established under Section I6.3 of this Agreement. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the right of the Union to pursue other available legal remedies.
B.	During the term of this Agreement the Board shall not layoff any members of the bargaining unit as a result of the subcontracting of work being performed by members of the bargaining unit, whether such a resulting layoff actually precedes or follows the initiation of the subcontracted work.
11.2	Use of Aides, Student Helpers, Temporary Employees, and Volunteers.
A.	The CSEA and the Board recognize the importance of the participation of parents and community members in the schools and acknowledge that parent and community volunteers many perform activities on behalf of the schools, so long as those activities do not lead to a reduction in the workforce, failure to fill vacancies, or the layoff of any bargaining unit member. Likewise, aides, student helpers, temporary employees and volunteers shall not be used to fill a position within any of the job classifications covered by this Agreement except as expressly permitted by this Agreement or in the event regular full-time people are not available to fill the position.
B.	In the event under Section 11.2(A), above, it becomes necessary to use aides, student helpers or temporary employees to fill positions in job classifications covered
58
by this Agreement, such temporary employee, aide or student helper shall be paid at the rate of pay specified in this Agreement for such job at Step I.
11.3	Work Study Program. The parties understand and agree that from time to time the Board enters into work study programs and other programs designed to further the technical education of students and give them employment experience and undertakes other educational programs which call for the employment of student helpers or other people involved in study programs. The above provisions of this Agreement are not intended to exclude such educational programs; however, the employment of persons under those programs shall not in any way be used to reduce the number of employees of the Board or be used to reduce the hours of employees of the Board.

D.	Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only when medically necessary because of the employee’s own serious health condition or the serious health condition of the employee’s spouse, child or parent.

E.	Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee shall be returned to the position held prior to the leave or an equivalent position.
F.	The Board shall maintain health insurance benefits for the duration of FMLA leave at the level and under the same conditions (including employee premium contributions) and coverage that would have been provided if the employee had continued in active work status for the duration of the leave.

I.	The following notice and scheduling requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests, unless the FMLA leave is being charged to sick or vacation leave, in which case the notice requirements for sick leave in Article 15 or for vacation leave in Article 14 of this Contract shall apply.
(1)	Employees must give thirty (30) days notice to the Board before taking FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must notify the Board as soon as is practicable (normally no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the need for the leave becomes known).
(2)	If an employee has actual notice of the notice requirement stated in 16.8(l)(1) above (this requirement of actual notice is fulfilled by posting a notice at the worksite), and fails to provide the Board with thirty (30) days notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the Board may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the employee provides notice.
(3)	Employees shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the Board aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The Board may inquire further of the employee when additional information is needed to determine whether FMLA leave is to be taken.
(4)	If an employee takes leave based on the serious health condition of the employee or to care for a family member, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as to not unduly disrupt the Board’s operation. If an employee does not initiate discussions with the Board to attempt to arrange a mutually agreeable treatment schedule, the Board may initiate such discussions and require the employee to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
J.	The following medical certification requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Employees who request leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member shall be required to
82
provide a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee’s family member on a form acceptable to the Board of Education or designee in accordance with Department of Labor regulations. For the employee’s own medical leave, the certification must include, among other things, the date the condition commenced, probable duration of incapacity, a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee’s position, and a statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for the condition by the health care provider (including estimated number of visits, nature, frequency, and duration of treatment). For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include, among other things, the date the condition commenced, probable duration of incapacity, a statement that the patient requires assistance for basic medical, hygiene, nutritional needs, safety or transportation, or that the employee’s presence or assistance would be beneficial or desirable for the care of the family member, and an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to provide care.
(2)	The Board shall give employees requesting FMLA leave written notice of the requirement for medical certification.
(3)	In its discretion, the Board may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the Board at its own expense, may obtain the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the employee and the Board.
(4)	Employees must provide the requested certification to the Board within the time frame requested by the Board, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee’s diligent, good faith efforts. The Board must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the Board’s request for certification.
(5)	In most cases, the Board shall request that an employee furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the employee requests leave or soon after the leave is requested or in the case of unforeseen leave, soon after the leave commences. The Board may request certification or re-certification at some later date if the Board has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration, if circumstances have changed significantly or if any extension of the leave is requested. If the Board believes the certification is incomplete, it shall notify the employee and allow an opportunity to correct the deficiency. In the case of a complete certification which is unclear, the Board’s health care provider
83
may, with the employee’s permission, contact the employee’s health care provider to clarify and authenticate the certification.
(6)	Certification shall be submitted using a form approved by the Board of Education for use by employees consistent with the FMLA.
(7)	All employees who take FMLA leave because of their own serious health condition shall be required to provide medical certification of their fitness to report back to work. The Board may seek fitness for duty certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee’s need for FMLA leave.
K.	The Board may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee’s status and intent to return to work. An FMLA leave will not be granted to permit an employee to accept gainful employment elsewhere, including self-employment. If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return, the Board's obligations under FMLA to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee cease.
L.	Leaves that are granted under any other provision of this Contract or under State law, whether paid or unpaid, shall be inclusive of any sick leave or other approved leave utilized respectively, for purposes which are covered under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall be charged as FMLA Leave and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
M.	The Board, in its discretion, may implement the FMLA consistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section 16.8 and in accordance with any Department of Labor regulations which may be in effect from time to time.

(1)	The committee will establish the rules and policies for the tuition reimbursement program. This shall include setting the maximum allowable per hour cost. The committee shall determine the maximum amount of money that can be reimbursed, along with the maximum allowable amount per employee. Employees in their probationary period are not eligible for tuition reimbursement.
During the term of this Agreement the parties may agree to earmark part of the tuition reimbursement fund to identify and support Columbus Public School bargaining unit employees in targeted groups, to complete their education in order to occupy positions within the District.
If such a decision is made, the committee will agree upon the rules that will govern participation in such a recruitment program.
(2)	Where credit is available, courses approved for reimbursement must be taken for credit.
93
(3)	Committee developed guidelines will encourage teacher training courses.
(4)	The termination of employment for any reason, except death, within one year of reimbursement will result in the reimbursement being deducted from the final paycheck.
C.	In-Service Procedures
(1)	Classified employees shall attend a minimum of two in-service meetings per calendar year, when such meetings, designed to help improve the efficiency or ease of the work, are offered in either the field of present work of the individual employee or in a field of work to which said individual employee might reasonably aspire.

It is the intention that such employee payroll deductions will be excluded from an employee’s gross income under Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. This Cafeteria Premium Payment Plan is provided solely for the purpose of reducing current income tax for members of the bargaining unit who contribute employee payroll deductions for insurance premiums. The Board will have no liability to the members of the bargaining unit for the tax treatment of such employee payroll deductions, and is assuming no additional portion of the cost of such benefits. This Cafeteria Premium Payment Plan will continue to be sponsored by the Board only to the extent that Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations promulgated thereunder remain substantially unchanged.
The Board shall explore the expansion of the Cafeteria Premium Payment Plan to other areas permissible under Internal Revenue Code Section 125 and may make such expansions available to employees.
94

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Representatives of the Board and CSEA/OAPSE have mutually agreed to these changes regarding the Payroll and Deduction Schedules for the 1996-97 school year.
1.	AFSCME-PEOPLE payroll deductions shall be made sixteen (16) times a fiscal year for school year employees and twenty (20) times a fiscal year for 12-month employees from the same paychecks that charity payroll deductions are made as published annually in payroll schedules prepared by the Office of the Treasurer.
2.	The amount deducted from each member's check for UNCF and/or IKIC shall be the amount previously designated per pay by the employee multiplied by 10 and divided by sixteen (16) for school-year employees and twenty (20) for twelve-month employees.
3.	In the next United Way campaign, contributors will be notified that deductions shall be continuous from year-to-year until canceled in writing to the Treasurer's Office. Changes will be made by completing new option cards during the annual campaign period.
4.	Salary reductions for annuities and Section 125 accounts shall be determined by dividing the yearly amount by twenty-one (21) for school-year employees and twenty-six (26) for twelve-month employees.
5.	Amounts for credit union deductions for those members with direct deposit shall be electronically transmitted by the next Columbus Public Schools business day following the employee's paydate.

Dear Bob:
As you are aware, during the bargaining of our recent collective bargaining agreement we discussed an idea presented regarding the frequency and the timing of servicing mail trucks.
The suggestion was that such service be provided twice a year. The t imes suggested were summer and during the Christmas break.
The management of vehicle maintenance views these as very positive suggestions and will attempt to implement them.
we always appreciate the willingness of your members to offer creative suggest ions .
