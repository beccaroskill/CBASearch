A regular full-time employee is an employee recognized by the Union and Employer and included in the records of each as a full-time employee. It is understood that the agreement will refer to those in this category as “employees” or “full-time employees ”
As used in this agreement, “bargaining unit employees” includes full-time and/or part-time employees whose classifications are listed in Article VI (Wages) in addition to any newly created or other positions which are appropriately included in this unit.

The Employer agrees that it will not discriminate against a bargaining unit employee or prospective employee by reason of race, creed, color, national origin, political or religious views, Union position, sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, physical appearance apart from dress beyond bona fide occupational requirements, parenthood or child-bcaring capacity.
B.	Affirmative Action
The Employer agrees to continue recruitment and employment of minority persons and women for positions covered by this agreement where they are significantly under-represented, for which they meet the minimum qualifications and for which they apply.

Sexual harassment grievances will be processed as expeditiously as possible.

The Union shall have the right to review the qualifications for individualjobs on an ongoing basis. The Union may recommend, and the
5
Employer agrees to seriously consider, alternative qualifications that the Union feels are either equivalent to the qualifications established (e.g. two year’s work experience can satisfy a degree requirement) or are more appropriate for the position.
5.	Employment Tests
All ability tests used by the Employer for filling unit job openings must be reviewed by the Union before they are given to bargaining unit applicants. A notice that such tests will be administered must be included in the posting notice under the "Qualifications” section of the Job Posting form. Results of such tests shall be given to the applicant upon request. Unless agreed to by the parties in disciplinary proceedings, medical tests or exams required of bargaining unit employees shall be restricted to those tests or exams relating to: a) the employee \ continued ability to perform the essential functions of his or her job following illness or injury; and b) infectious disease epidemics (excepting HIV/A1DS).

If the Union objects to such posting, it may seek a meeting with the Employer to address its inquiries. Such meeting must be held within five (5) working days of said inquiry. The posting procedure will not be delayed; however, the posting will be revised to include a notice that the Union is objecting to the posting. Any changes in the posting that result from such inquiry will serve to restart the fourteen (14) day posting period. If the issue is unresolved, the matter may be taken to arbitration.
Notices shall be filled out by the Employer per the following sample posting form:
POSTING FORM
Date of Posting:	Date to be taken down:
Dept:	Number of jobs to be filled:
Department Head:	Job Title:
Shift:	Job Classification & Salary:
Qualifications:	Basic Functions and Responsibilities:

C.	Hiring/Promotion/Transfer
The Employer agrees to inform the Union of any major changes in employment procedures.
The Globe policy is to hire and promote from within whenever practicable. When seeking to fill vacancies in existing or ncwly-created bargaining unit positions, the.Employer shall, before hiring a new employee, give first consideration to employees in this bargaining unit. However, applicants who are from outside the bargaining unit may also be selected based on the needs of the newspaperjob requirements and applicant qualifications as determined by the Employer.
7
The Employer will notify the Union when it decides to reduce a vacant full-time staff position to a part-time position(s).
D, Applications
All bargaining unit employees will have the opportunity to submit an application to the Personnel Department expressing interest in a posted position. Such application will include the name of the employee, current department, position applied for and date of application. The Personnel Department will forward to the supervisor responsible for filling the position all such applications, along with resumes, received within 55 days of a job posting, unless the job is filled before that. Only those employees who have filed an application for a specific job posting will be considered for that posting. A list of such employees will be sent to the Union. The Employer also agrees to send to the Union a list of all other applicants. At the end of the fourteen (14) day posting period, at least three (3) BGEA applicants will be interviewed. If fewer than three such applications are received, all BGEA applicants will be interviewed.
If the posted vacancy is not filled within fifty-five (55) days after the posting has been removed from the bulletin boards, the vacancy may not be filled unless it is reposted. In the case of a reposting, only new BGEA applicants need be interviewed.
All BGEA applicants will be notified in writing whether they will be interviewed.
Copies of all BGEA applications will be made available to the Union upon request.
E.	Union Notification
The Union will be informed in writing by the Personnel Department of the names of all applicants, those interviewed and the name of the successful applicant.
F.	Career Guidance
The Employer agrees that, in the event an employee fails to be promoted or transferred to a position he/she has been interviewed for, such employee shall be notified in writing as to the specific reasons for that denial. An applicant, upon request, shall also be
8

G.	Change of Classification Pay
An employee moved or promoted to a higher wage classification shall be paid in his/her new classification at the experience level next higher than his/her current rate of pay and shall advance from there in the time provided by the Wage Provision (Article VI). No employee shall incur any economic loss as a result of accepting a higher paying position as herein provided.
H.	Trial Period
Employees advanced to a higher paying classification shall have a trial period not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days. An evaluation shall be held within thirty (30) days between the department head and the employee during this trial period. A written report of the evaluation shall be provided to employee and Union. If after thirty (30) days, there is reasonable doubt whether the employee will successfully complete the trial period, a second evaluation will be held.
At the end of the trial period the department head shall determine if the employee meets the requirements of the higher paying classification. If the department head decides that the employee docs not meet the requirements of the higher paying classification, or if the employee wishes to do so, he/she will be returned to his/her former position at his/her former rate of pay.

1.	Layoff
There shall be no layoff for the term of this agreement through December 31, 1994. Thereafter, employees who were hired as full-time employees prior to January I, 1992 will be protected from reductions in force as provided for in the attached Supplemental Agreement. Effective January 1, 1995 and thereafter, if the Employer determines that a layoff shall be necessary, the layoff will be carried out in accordance with the following provisions:
A.	There shall be no layoff except for good and sufficient cause. The size of the staff deemed necessary by the Employer shall constitute a good and sufficient cause. The Employer shall give the Union and affected employees at least thirty (30) days written notice of a layoff. The notices shall set forth the reasons for the layoff and the notice io the Union shall also contain the names of the employees scheduled to be reduced. The determination of what areas or departments and to what extent layoffs are to be carried out are the sole prerogatives of the Employer.
B.	Employees dismissed through a layoff shall be those within each job classification by department with the least amount of seniority. which shall be determined by an employee’s total length of bargaining unit seniority, pursuant to Article 111, Section 5. Those employees with substantially demonstrable special skills or employees of outstanding ability may be excepted from the application of this section, but the burden of establishing the need for such exceptions shall be on the Employer and shall be subject to grievance and arbitration.
For the purpose of this provision, "length of service" shall include pro-rated service credit for part-time employment in the bargaining unit.
C.	An employee laid off will be entitled to severance benefits of four weeks notice or pay in lieu of plus one additional week of pay for each six months of continuous service as a regular Globe employee up to a maximum of 50 weeks pay. All severance payments shall be made in the payroll week following layoff. If an employee dies after notification of layoff and election to be laid off (in lieu of bumping) but before he/she has received notice and severance pay, such payment shall be made to his/her estate.
10
D.	An employee dismissed through a layoff shall be placed on a rehiring list and shall remain on that list for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of dismissal. In filling vacancies within any job classifications from which employees were dismissed through a layoff, the Employer shall offer re-employment to employees on the rehiring list who were dismissed from the classification in which there is a vacancy before hiring or promoting employees. The Company shall notify such employees, based on bargaining unit seniority, by registered mail and the employee will be given ten (10) work days from the time hc/she receives such notification in which to make his/her decision to accept or reject the offer of re-employment. Should he/she accept the job, hc/she will be given an additional one (1) week in which to report for work. Failure to comply with this provision shall cause the employee’s name to be removed from the rehiring list. When an employee is reinstated into a job through the rehiring list hc/she shall be paid al the current salary for the same step he/she left.
E.	Restrictions on the Use of Subcontracting, Exempt Employees, Part-Time Employees and Free Lancers During A Lay-Off Recall Period
1.	Except as provided in Paragraph 3 below, if there is a layoff after January 1, 1995 but prior to the expiration of the successor contract to this contract and if said layoff impacts any full-time employees hired on or after January I. 1992, then the Globe agrees that during the recall period of a full-time employee on lay-off the Globe will not:
a)	use the-full-ti'me equivalents of exempt or part-time employees whose major responsibility is to perform the actual work (as opposed to the type of work) performed by the employee on lay-off;
b)	commission the full-time equivalents of work by free lancers or correspondents where such work is the actual work (as opposed to the type of work) performed by the employee on lay-off;
c)	contract out the full-time equivalence of the actual work (as opposed to the type of work) performed by the employee on lay-off.
II
2.	If the Globe intends to have some of the actual work formerly done by a full-time employee on layoff done on a part-time, free-lance or correspondent basis, it will first offer the laid off full-time employee the opportunity to do the work on such a part-time, free-lance or correspondent basis.
3.	Except as otherwise specifically provided in this proposal and in the collective bargaining agreement, the Globe may continue its past practices concerning the use of part-time employees, free-lancers, correspondents, new procedures, new equipment and technology and outside vendors.
E The Globe will meet with the Union during the thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Union of a planned layoff, if so requested by the Union, to voluntarily consider possible alternatives proposed by the Union to reduce labor costs other than through a layoff. The Globe may continue implementation of its planned layoff during these voluntary discussions. Lack of agreement on a voluntary alternative shall not be grievable.
G.	An employee designated for layoff may elect to displace an employee with less total bargaining unit seniority occupying any job classification he/she previously held on a full-time basis.
This election must be made within ten (10) work days of layoff notification to the employee.
The employee displaced will be the employee with the least bargaining unit seniority in that classification.
Any employee who is displaced as a result of another employee’s election to return to a previously held job shall have the same election rights as the employee who displaced him/her.
An employee who elects to return to a previously held job in a lower paid job classification shall be paid at the rate he/she would have earned had his/her employment in that classification been continuous. No merit increase shall be lost or reduced by any reduction in salary.
H.	These provisions shall be immediately effective on January 1,1995 (whether or not the parties have concluded successor contract negotiations) and will not be subject to any alterations or changes in negotiations (except by mutual agreement) until the expiration of
12
the successor agreement to this agreement (January 1,1991 through December 31,1994) or for three years from December 31,1994 whichever is longer.

2,	Discharge and Disciplinary Action
The Union and Employer agree that discipline, including discharge, must be administered fairly and consistently for just cause. Discipline will typically be progressive. The offense, facts and circumstances will determine the level of discipline to be applied regardless of prior discipline, if any. There shall be the following forms of discipline:
A.	Verbal Warnings, which constitute the least severe form of discipline, consist of verbal reprimands to the employee by the department head or manager. A written record of a verbal warning may be made.
B.	Written Warnings may be issued regarding an aspect of an employee's performance which could lead to suspension or dismissal, if uncorrected.
The Employee Relations Department will be notified of all written warnings prior to a decision to issue. If a decision is made to issue the warning, the Union shall be notified of the time and place the warning is to be given, and who shall be given the warning, at least 24 hours in advance of the warning being issued. The Union may have a representative present. Except in the case of gross neglect of duty or serious misconduct, at least one verbal warning will be issued before an employee will be given a written warning.
A minimum of two written warnings will be issued before an employee may be dismissed except in the case of gross neglect of duty or serious misconduct.
An employee will be allowed a reasonable amount of time to correct the behavior or conduct which led to the first written warning. If the same behavior or conduct continues after that period of time, a second written warning may be issued.
Any written warning older than tw-o (2) years shall cease to exist for purposes of progressive discipline. However, those warnings may be considered by the Employer in determining the degree of discipline to issue in future cases involving probation, suspension or discharge action.
The Union may request that a written warning be reviewed by the Employer for possible removal after one year if the employee has made
14
substantial progress toward correcting the behavior or conduct which resulted in a written warning.
When an employee has received a written warning for alcohol and/or drug (a controlled substance) abuse, he/she will be referred to a qualified program. The Union, medical department or Employee Assistance Program can make such referrals.
C.	Suspension and/or disciplinary probation decisions will be made by the Vice President of Employee Relations or his/her designee. The Union shall be notified when a final decision to suspend or place on probation is made, and the same rights of representation and appeal will apply as are applied to written warnings or dismissals.
If, in conference, a suspension without pay is found by mutual agreement not to have been based on just cause, the Employer will restore the employee to his/her position with full pay and all benefits for the period from the date of suspension to date of reinstatement, with service record unimpaired. A lesser form of discipline may be invoked.
D.	Dismissal decisions will be made by the Vice President of Employee Relations or his/her designee. Dismissal represents the most severe form of discipline.
Two weeks’ notice in advance of discharge or two weeks pay in lieu of notice shall be given to employees after completion of their probationary period except in cases of gross neglect of duty or serious misconduct. In either case, the Union President or his or her designated representative shall be present at the time of discharge. Any employee upon receipt of notice of discharge or upon discharge where no notice is given, may appeal to the Union so that the Union may confer with the Employer. Upon notice of discharge, an employee (who makes written request within ten (10) calendar days) shall receive from the Employer a written statement of the cause of discharge, with a copy of such statement to be furnished the Union representative.
Within seventy-two (72) hours of discharge the employee must request in writing that the Union act on his/her behalf under Article XI (Grievance and Arbitration).
If, in conference, a discharge is found by mutual agreement not to have been based on just cause, the Employer shall restore the discharged employee to his/her position with full pay and all benefits for the period
15.
from the date of discharge to date of reinstatement and with service record unimpaired; or a lesser form of discipline may be invoked, including suspension without pay.
E.	Conferences regarding any discharge or suspension shall proceed with due diligence and shall be concluded within five (5) working days from the date of the employees request for review.
If, upon conference, the Employerand the Union are unable to agree as to the proper disposition of the case within thirty (30) calendar days after notice of discharge or suspension the matter may be referred by the Union to arbitration within forty-five (45) calendar days after the date of discharge or suspension.
3.	Probationary Period
a.	Discharge of new employees in Editorial, Information Services (other than data entry clerks), outside circulation sales, and outside advertising sales classifications with less than one hundred thirty-five (135) calendar days employment shall not be subject to review by the Union.
b.	Discharge of new employees in all other classifications with less than ninety (90) calendar days’ employment shall not be subject to review by the Union.
During the probationary period written evaluations will be prepared and discussed with each new employee within the first 30 days, within the next 30 days, and at least 15 days before the end of the period. Copies of such written evaluations will be provided to the employee and the Union president and included in the new employee’s personnel file.
If a probationary employee is discharged he/she will be entitled to two weeks’ pay except in cases of gross neglect of duty or serious misconduct.
4.	Probationary Credit
Employment at the Globe as a part-time, temporary or substitute employee in the same classifications during the twelve-month period prior to becoming a regular employee shall be counted towards the appropriate probationary period up to a maximum of thirty (30) days credit.
16
5.	Seniority Defined
There shall be the following types of seniority:
a)	“Bargaining Unit Seniority” begins from the date of hire as an employee in the bargaining unit. Whenever an employee transfers into an exempt non-bargaining unit position and later returns to the bargaining unit, or he/she is laid off and later recalled under Article III, Section 1D, the employee will recapture the prior years spent in the bargaining unit to determine his/her bargaining unit seniority. However, years spent in a non-bargaining unit position will not be counted toward bargaining unit seniority. When a person who has worked as a part-time employee is hired as a regular employee, credit will be given for the hours worked as a part-time employee toward bargaining unit seniority.
b)	“Classification Seniority” dates from the time a full-time employee is hired or moves into a classification as listed in Article VI (Wages). This seniority will vary as an employee moves to various classifications.
Bargaining unit seniority applies in shift preference, holiday scheduling and vacation scheduling. Classification seniority shall apply in step raises.
For new hires and promoted employees, a successfully completed probationary or trial period shall be included in calculating seniority. If an applicant is not confirmed in a new classification, he/she will be returned to his/her classification with no loss in seniority.
ARTICLE IV
HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
1.	Work Week
The regular 37.5 hour work week of employees covered by the terms of this agreement, except those listed in Section 3 of this article, shall consist of not more than five (5) days of not more than seven and one-half (7.5) hours each, said seven and one-half (7.5) hours to fall within daily periods of not more than eight and one-half (8.5) hours each; or of not more than four (4) days (in cases where the needs of the Employer allow) of not more than nine and one-half (9.5) hours each, said nine and one-half (9.5) hours to fall within daily periods of not more than
17
ten and one-half (10.5) hours each. The Employer will consider requests from two-thirds of a department/sub-department’s employees for a four-day work week. The decision on such requests shall be in the sole discretion of the Employer. In instances where the needs of the newspaper allow, other variations within the 37.5 hour work week may be considered by the Employer in individual cases.
The above provisions shall not have application to employees on out-of-town assignments. Out-of-town refers to any assignment requiring overnight lodging.
Employees shall not be required to travel to out-of-town assignments on days off.
2.	Overtime
Overtime work in excess of 37,5 hours in one week and shall be paid at a rate of time and one-half.

If an employee terminates his/her employment for any reason, all overtime due him/her shall be paid by payroll check.
3.	Exclusions from Overtime
The following positions arc excluded from the application of the provisions of this agreement relative to hours of work and overtime payment; Outside Advertising Salespersons, Cartoonists, Editorial Writers.
4.	Assignment of Overtime
Except in an emergency, overtime must be approved in advance by an exempt supervisor/manager. In an emergency, overtime may also be approved by a bargaining unit supervisor. Bargaining unit employees required to work in advance of or after their regularly scheduled times shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half for such work in addition to their regular day’s pay. The Employer will make every effort within the needs of the newspaper to assign overtime in a fair and equitable manner taking into consideration seniority in classification. No em- ( ployee will be required to work more than ten (10) consecutive days.
Overtime payments will be made in the weekly pay period immedi- . ately following submission for the overtime worked.	'
(

18
5.	Scheduling and Shifts
The Employer will make every effort, within the needs of the newspaper, to assign regularly scheduled days off and regularly scheduled overtime in a fair and equitable manner taking into consideration seniority in classification.
The Employer will confer with an employee before changing his/her regular starting time and/or days off and before making transfers between departments within classification. An employee may make a request for such change. Bargaining unit seniority will be the major factor in making such changes, subject, however, to the needs of the newspaper as determined by the Employer. The Employer will exercise its discretion in a reasonable manner. All employees classified as "clerks" (including those formerly classified as “senior clerks”) shall be deemed to be within the same “classification” for the purpose of making transfers between departments within classification. This shall also apply to all “secretaries”and “executive secretaries" within their respective classifications.
Normal working days shall be regularly scheduled and days off shall be consecutive throughout unless otherwise agreed to by the employee and the Employer.
Regular employees shall have the same starting times at least three days each week. Work schedules shall be posted in each department one week prior to the beginning of each financial week to include all bargaining unit members.
It is understood that there shall be three basic shifts covered by this agreement. These shall be called a Day Shift, a Night Shift and a Lobster Shift. A day shift employee’s hours shall begin between the hours of 5 a.m. and 1 p.m.; a night shift employee’s hours shall begin between the hours of 1 p.m. and 9 p,m,; and a lobster shift employee’s hours shall begin between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. Within the framework of these shifts there may be variations of starting and finishing times on a shift. It shall be understood that an employee, except in the event of an emergency, shall not work a split shift.
The assignment of shifts will be in accordance with the needs of the newspaper as determined by the Employer, provided that an employee having fifteen (15) or more years of full-time service shall not be assigned to a different shift without his/her consent. This clause shall not apply to departments or sub-departments in which, at the time of the
19
assignment, 80 percent or more of the full-time employees in any bargaining unit classification have fifteen (15) or more years of service, but would apply when that department or sub-department falls below 80 percent of employees in any classification with fifteen (15) or more years of service.
When an opening occurs on a shift, claim for that shift can be made according to bargaining unit seniority.
6.	Notice of Schedule Change
Any employee with regularly scheduled working days and hours must be given one week’s notice of change of schedule, except in case of an emergency. However, if an employee is'on vacation then the one week’s notice will become effective on the date he/she returns from vacation.
7.	Recall
Employees requested to return to work within seven and one-half (7.5) hours after the end of their regularly scheduled work day shall be guaranteed a minimum of three and three-quarters (3 .75) hours pay at time and one half
8.	Unscheduled Work
An employee requested to work on his/her regularly scheduled day off shall be paid a minimum of seven and one-half (7.5) hours’ pay at time and one-half for that day’s work, which shall be in addition to his/her regular weekly salary. In this case, he/she would not be entitled to another day off.
9.	Recall from Vacation
An employee called in to work while on vacation shall be paid a minimum of seven and one-half (7.5) hours pay at the rate of double time for each day of such work, in addition to his/her regular salary.
10.	Shift Spacing
All regular schedules shall allow ten (10) hours between shifts, and an employee who is asked to start a day's work less then ten (10) hours after the completion of the previous regular work day shall receive time and one-half pay for the time worked before the elapse of that ten-hour period.
20
11.	Higher Overtime Payment
If overtime is payable under this article and also under another article in this agreement, payment shall be made under the one which provides the greater compensation to the employee, but not,under both.
12.	Overtime Records
All overtime-related records shall be kept and, on request, the Employer shall make records available to the Union.
13.	Inter-Classification Fill In
If because of unusual circumstances, a bargaining unit employee is required to fill in for more than one-half of his/her scheduled shift for another bargaining unit employee in a different classification, additional compensation equal to the difference in the base rates will be paid if the position being filled is one with a higher base rate. The next higher step in the base rate for the position being filled, as compared to the bargaining unit employee’s current step rate, will be used for purposes of this calculation. In no case will a bargaining unit employee’s salary be reduced during the time of the fill in. In cases where the editorial pay is higher (Article VI), that formula will be applied under the same stipulations as noted above.
A bargaining unit employee may be asked to fill in for an exempt employee. Such fill-in will be voluntary. In such cases, the employer shall pay the employee Ten Dollars ($10.00) per scheduled shift.
Examples (based on rates effective 1/1/97):
A third-year clerk ($520.19) fills in for a third-year secretary ($577.98). The clerk would receive the difference between ($520.19) and the next higher step on secretary’s pay rate ($577.98) or $57.79 per week or $11.56 per day.
A fifth-year reporter, ($1179.18), fills in for a second-year assistant metro editor ($1316.28). The reporter would receive the next higher step on assistant metro editors’ scale ($ 1206.35), but in this case, would instead receive $10.00 per day, under Article VI, as that rate would apply.
An accounts receivable clerk, fourth year, ($577.98), fills in for an accounts receivable supervisor, fourth year, ($910.17). The clerk will be
21
paid the next higher step on supervisor scale, first-year rate ($597.19) or $ 19.2 1 per week or $3.84 per day.
ARTICLE V
VACATIONS, HOLIDAYSAND LEAVES OF ABSENCE
1.	Vacations

5 weeks
*(after completing six months)
An employee who becomes eligible for a third, fourth or fifth week of vacation due to his/her length of service during the first five (5) months of any calendar year will be treated as having earned that service as of the previous December 31. Such additional week vacation may be taken after completing six (6) months service in the calendar year.
Part-time employees other than co-op students shall receive vacation benefits on a pro-rata basis in proportion to hours worked. One vacation day credit will be earned for each one hundred ninety-five (195) hours worked.

When a part-time employee has worked as a part-time employee a minimum of 600 hours per year for a total of ten (10) calendar years, two vacation days’ credit will be earned for each one hundred ninety-five (195) hours worked. For employees with more than ten (10) years part-time service, the most recent ten (10) years will be used in making this computation. These years do not have to be consecutive.
22
During the calendar year, such part-time employees may draw against their vacation day credit balance accumulated through the preceding December 31, For purposes of this paragraph, vacation and holiday time shall be included in hours worked.

24
Part-time or temporary employees other than co-op students shall receive holiday benefits on a pro-rata basis in proportion to hours worked.
One holiday credit will be earned by a part-time or temporary employee for each one hundred ninety-five (195) hours worked.

It is ultimately the decision of the Globe as to whether and when an individual job-sharing arrangement may be established and how many suclKpairings may be in place at one time. For a proposal to be approved, it must not have an adverse impact on the operation of the paper and must not result in an increase in cost to the paper.
The program will be open only to full-time staff members with two or more years of service and each pairing arrangement will last one year. It is presumed that each pair of employees who seek to establish a jobsharing arrangement would be in the same job classification and same
34
department, but other proposals may be considered.
Except in an extreme emergency situation, participants will be expected to fulfill their commitment to complete a full year in the job-sharing arrangement. At the end of the year, all participants are guaranteed the right of their full-time jobs.
Participants will retain their full fringe benefits and remain on the fulltime payroll but will receive pro-rated salary based on the hours worked.
Overtime will be paid on the basis of time beyond the regular workday as described elsewhere in this agreement.

At the end of the fourteen (14) days, if the parties cannot reach agreement, the parties will retain their respective statutory and contractual rights.
ARTICLE VI WAGES
The Globe proposes the following wage increases to change current rates contained in Article VI, with effective dates as noted, for a new three year labor agreement to replace the expired contract. Retroactivity for these increases from the contractual effective date up to the date of actual implementation is included in this proposal:
35
Effective January I, 1998	.6133/houror$23.00/week
Effective January 1, 1999	,6133/hour or $23.00/week
Effective January 1,2000	.64/hour or $24.00/week
The above hourly increases will be applied to the weighted averages of approximately 746 full time employees as of January I, 1998 to determine the appropriate percentage increase for each year. The weighted average for the first year’s increase (1998) is 51022.63 which equates to a percentage increase of 2.249%. The weighted average for 1999 is $1045.63, calculated after addition of the 1998 increase of $23.00 per week, which yields a percentage increase of 2.200% based on the above proposal; the weighted average for 2000 would be $1068.63 (after addition of the $23.OO/week increase from 1999), which yields a percentage increase of 2.245% based on the above proposal.
Under this proposal, top step reporters, for example would receive wage increases of $26.52 per week, $26.53 and $27.66 per week for 1998, 1999 and 2000 respectively.
These percentage increases would be applied to all contract book rates for all bargaining unit employees pursuant to the parties' 1987 letter of agreement. It will not be applied to merit pay or other supplemental payments. It will be applied to “differential weekly merit” and “differential hourly merit” for all full time and part time employees whose names appear respectively on Exhibits B and C to the collective bargaining agreement.
Effective January I, 2000 the Globe will recalculate the weighted average for the then full time employees to determine the appropriate percentage increase for 2000 based on the above negotiated wage increase of $:64/hour or $24.00/wcek. If that calculation (based on actual employment at that time) results in a percentage increase which is more than the current calculation of 2.245%, the higher percentage will be applied to all contract book rales. Otherwise the rate will remain at 2.245%. The Globe will share its calculations with the Union.
These percentage increases would be applied to all contract book rates for bargaining unit employees (part-time and full-time) pursuant to the parties’ 1987 letter of agreement. It will not apply to merit shift differential or other supplemental payments. It will be applied to “differential weekly merit” for all employees whose names appear on Exhibit B and C.
Future merit adjustments will be administered solely by the Globe according to Article VI, Section 3.
36
These percentage increases would be applied to all contract book rates and grandfathered merit differential for bargaining unit employees (full and part-time) pursuant to the parties’ 1987 letter of agreement. They will not apply to merit, shift differential or other supplemental payments.

i	mula: the Globe will contribute up to two percent (2%) of the
employees salary based upon the employee contributing up to a )	total of six percent (6%) of his/her salary into the 401 (k) plan. By

The Globe agrees that if in the future the parties in collective bargaining agree to a level of pension benefits which is less than that currently provided under the BGEA Retirement Plan or if there are changes in applicable pension laws that significantly limit pension benefits to less than those currently provided in the BGEA Retirement Plan that the difference between the cost to the Globe of the 1% 401(a) contribution (plus 401(a) administrative costs) and the $38.10 weekly contribution previously required under the 1991-1994 contract will be available to the BGEA for other benefit purposes in a proportionate amount to the actuarially determined reduced need for contributions based on the changes at that future time in the BGEA Retirement Plan.

The Globe agrees to contribute a single lump sum payment of $98,000 pursuant to d) 4) above for plan year May 1, 1993 through April 30, 1994 to be paid immediately upon the establishment of the Taft Hartley trust rather than pay it pro-rated monthly for this plan year only. Thereafter, the contribution in d) 3) above will be based on the Globe’s actual annual FICA savings, prorated monthly.
In addition, in order to make the transition intoa Tafi-Hartley fund, the Globe agrees that effective upon establishment of the Taft-Hartley trust that instead of monthly quid pro quo payments, it will pay the following three (3) months annualized quid pro quo payments specified in Section 11I( A) of the Supplemental Agreement immediately into the fund in a lump sum payment of S262.500 ($87,500 x 3 months) rather than pay these monthly. This is in addition to all other specified up front first year lump sum payments. If after the first three (3) months of the fund’s existence, the fund has a balance of less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars, the Globe will again pay an additional lump sum of three (3) months annualized quid pro quo payments ($262,500) into the fund rather than pay these monthly. Thereafter, all Globe contributions will be on a monthly basis.
[For example, if the fund is established effective January I, 1994, the Globe will on that date pay $262,500 into the fund (its contributions for January, February and March). On March 31, if the fund’s balance is less than $ 100,000, the Globe will again pay $262,500 into the fund (its contributions for April, May and June). Beginning July I, 1994, the Globe will pay $96,667 (which includes $1 7,333 from the pension fund diversion) monthly into the fund.]
It is understood and agreed that all monies paid directly by the Globe under this Section into the parties' Taft Hartley Trust Fund (excluding the $ 17,333 per month pension fund diversion) will be credited as employer contributions for the purpose of any such employer contributions required under national health insurance legislation except as modified by the December 15, 1993 side letter re: national health insurance legislation attached to this agreement.
e)	The Globe/BGEA Taft-Hartley Fund will receive bargaining unit employee contributions through payroll
62
deductions as established from time to time by the fund trustees. It is agreed that these bargaining unit employee contributions will always be established at levels sufficient, together with the contractually negotiated employer contributions, to maintain adequate actual funds to pay for the level of benefits and any appropriate reserves as determined by the trustees.
f)	The Globe/BGEA Taft-Hartley Fund trustees will be responsible formatters including, but not limited to, establishing the appropriate level and kind of benefits to be offered and the determination of the necessary premiums to be contributed by participating bargaining unit employees.

C.	Effective April 4, 1999, the payment practice described in paragraph B above will be eliminated and instead the following onetime salary adjustments will be made: seventy-five percent (75%) of the average of the payments made under paragraph B to each full time and regular part time photographer and full time and regular part time technician for the two highest years among 1995, 1996, and 1997 ora minimum of $500 for each full time and regu

lar part time technician and $2000 for each full time and regular part time photographer will be added to their salary( for 1999 the amount will be prorated from April 4,1999). This calculation will be made separately for each full time and regular part time pho-tographer/technician.

ARTICLE IX RETIREMENT
Agreement	• *
Under an agreement between the Globe Newspaper Company and The Boston Globe Employees Association, a retirement plan became effective January I, 1954 and has been amended, most currently effective July I, 1987. A “plain English" booklet on the BGEA Retirement Plan is available in the Personnel office.
The Employer recognizes that the authority under the BGEA Retirement Plan for the Globe Newspaper Company president to terminate the Plan is substantially restricted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA"). In particular, the Employer recognizes that under ERISA a single employer defined benefit plan such as the Plan may only be terminated (1) at the initiative of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), (2) if the Plan has sufficient assets to pay all benefit commitments or (3) if the PBGC determines that the contributing employer must be allowed to terminate the Plan on account of or in order to avoid severe financial distress (such as bankruptcy).
The Employer agrees that during the term of this agreement, it will not amend, modify or terminate the retirement plan dr merge or consolidate the retirement plan or merge or consolidate the retirement plan with any other retirement plan, without prior negotiation with the Union, and in any event will not implement any amendment, modification, termination, merger or consolidation (1) without such authorization from PBGC as may be required, and (2) that would result in a violation of the Employer’s obligations under ERISA.-
Any employee who has vested benefits in the Plan will have those benefits secured regardless of any event that may occur during the term of this contract.
The Employer recognizes its obligation under ERISA to ensure that the Plan has sufficient assets to pay all vested benefits. The Employer recognizes that this statutory obligation survives the expiration of this contract and that relief from this obligation is provided by ERISA only in certain narrow circumstances and only after review by PBGC or a court of competent jurisdiction.
74
At the request of (he Union Administrative Trustees, the Employer will review withall the Administrative Trustees the performance of the Plan’s various investment managers. Quarterly, the Employer will provide all the Administrative Trustees with performance evaluation data concerning the Plan’s various investment managers. Although the provisions of the Agreement of Master Trust and Boston Globe Employees’Association Retirement Plan provide that decisions on selection (and changes) of investment managers shall be made solely by the Employer (or the Employer’s designees), the Employer when notified of any changes in or additions of investment managers of the Plan, will timely so notify the Union and the Um-;? Administrative Trustees. The parties acknowledge that for investment management purposes only, the Plan's assets may be co-minglcd with the pension plan assets of the New York Times Company. This does not constitute a merger or consolidation of the Plan with any other plan as referenced above.
2.	Joint Administrative Trustees
In the event that matters to be decided by the Administrative Trustees under the terms of the Plan result in a tie vote, then the matter will referred to an impartial arbitrator mutually agreeable to the parties. The company and that Administrative Trustees agree to abide by the arbitrator’s decision.
The Pension Trustees agree to rotate chairmanship of Administrative Trustees biennially between Union and Management.
3.	Benefit Changes
a.	The.maxinium pension benefit is based on 55 percent of straight-* time salary averaged over 104 consecutive weeks of highest compensation with a cap of $55,000 on that average. The maximum salary for purposes of determining the death benefit under the pension plan is S55,OOO, averaged over 104 consecutive weeks of highest compensation.
b.	Effective with (he ratification and signing of this agreement the maximum pension benefit is based on'55 percent of straight-time salary averaged over 104 consecutive weeks of highest compensation with a cap of $65,000 on that average. The maximum salary for purposes of determining the death benefit under the pension plan is $65,000, averaged over 104 consecutive weeks of highest compensation.
75
c.	Effective with the ratification and signing of this agreement, commissions will be included for purpose of pension calculations for the following categories of employees only to a maximum combined salary and commission of 554,000: Outbound Telephone Advertising Salespersons, Inside Telephone Advertising Salespersons, Special Projects Group and Special Incentive Salespersons.
4.	401 (K) Plan
The Employer offers and administers a 401 (K) Plan for all members of the Union.
5.	Contributions
The Globe (the “company") will contribute to the BGEA Retirement Plan (the “Plan") for each plan year an amount determined under the following formula. For purposes of the formula, the formula terms shall be defined as follows:
A= the maximum tax deductible contribution for a given plan year under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. as amended;
B= the contribution determined by the funding policy then in effect for the plan;
C= the minimum contribution required to avoid a funding deficiency as provided in applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and
D» the 1991 -1994 collective bargaining agreement (Globe/BGEA) reference in Article IX, Section 5 to total shift contributions for S7.62 for each contributable full-time shift worked (up to five shifts per week for a total of $38.10 per week) in a plan year minus the total dollar value of the 1% 401(a) contribution for the entire bargaining unit for the same year (and minus the 401a administrative cost as referenced in the attached side letter).
The company shall, from time to time, designate an actuarial consultant (“actuary”). and the actuary’s calculations of the above terms A, B, and C shall be conclusive. The funding policy of the plan shall continue to be established by the Company or by persons expressly designated by the Company to do this, acting with the advice of the actuary. This funding policy may be changed from time to time by the company. The parties agree that the Plan
76
is and shall remain a defined benefit plan and is subject to minimum funding requirements for such plans in any plan year.
The contribution formula shall be as follows:
I.	If one or more of A, B, and C is less than D. then the plan shall be
funded at no less than B; and
II.	If either B or C is greater than D, then for purposes of the collective bargaining agreement only no less than D shall be contributed to the Plan.
III.	If both part I and II of this formula apply, then for purposes of the collective bargaming agreement only the provisions of part II of the formula control application.
Example #1
A= $8.9 million
B= $2.5 million
C= $0
D= $1.0 million (approximately)
Since one of A, B, or C is less than D, part I of the formula applies. Therefore, the contractually required funding is B or $2.5 million. In this example, however, both part 1 and II apply, therefore part II of the formula controls. Therefore, the required contribution is Dor $1.0 million. This is an example which reflects the 1995 actuarial evaluation of the Plan.
Example #2
A= $8.9 million
B= $2.5 million
O $1.5 million
D= $ 1.0 million (approximately)
Since neither B nor C is less than D, part 11 of the formula applies. In this case, the minimum contractually required funding is D. which is S 1.0 million. This is an example showing what would happen if the minimum funding requirement changed.
Example #3
A=$2 million
B=$.5 million
C=$0
D=$l .0 million (approximately)
Since both B and C are less than D, Part I of the formula applies and therefore the plan shall be funded at no less than B or $.5 million. This is an example of the operation of the formula after the plan has become almost fully funded.
77

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT Between
GLOBE NEWSPAPER COMPANY, INC. and BGEA/TNG-CWA Local 31245
This Memorandumj^Agreemcnl is marie and entered into by and between Globe Newspaper Company, Inc. (the "Globe") and BGEA/TNG-CWA Local 31245 (the "BGEA"). This Agreement covers the period January I. 1998 through December 31/2001).

I.	WAGE INCREASES
Effective January 1. 1998
Effective January 1. 1999
Effective January 1.2000
.6l33.hour or $23.00 week .6133;hour or $23.00 week .64/hour or $24.00 week
The above hourly increases will be applied to the weighted aver
ages of approximately 746 full time employees as of January I. 1098 to determine the appropriate percentage increase for each year. The weighted average for the first year's increase (1998) is $1022.63 which equates to a percentage increase of 2.249%. The weighted average for 1999 is S1045.63. calculated after addition of the 199S increase of $23.00 per week, w hich yields a percentage increase of 2.200% based on the above proposal: the weighted average for 2000 would be S1068.63 (after addition of the $23.00' week increase from 1999), which yields a percentage increase of 2.245% based on the above proposal.
Under this proposal, top step reporters, for example would receive wage increases of S26.52 per week. $26.53 and $27.66 per week for 1998. 1999 and 2000 respectively.
These percentage increases would be applied to all contract book rates for all bargaining unit employees pursuant to the parties’ 1987 letter of agreement. It will not be applied to merit pay or other supplemental payments. It will be applied to "differential weekly merit" and “differential hourly merit"
103
for all full time and part time employees whose names appear respectively on Exhibits B and C to the collective bargaining agreement.
Effective January 1,2000 the Globe will recalculate the weighted average for the then full time employees to determine the appropriate percentage increase for 2000 based on the above negotiated wage increase of $.64/ hour or S24.00/wcek. If that calculation (based on actual employment at that time) results in a percentage increase which is more than the current calculation of 2.245%, the higher percentage will be applied to all contract book rates. Otherwise the rate will remain at 2.245%. The Globe will share its calculations with the Union.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
Between
Globe Newspaper Company, Inc.
and
BGEA/TNG-CWA Local 31245 (BTU Work Assignments)
Globe Ncwspa|ier Company. Inc. (the “Globe”) and BGEA/TNG-CWA Local 3124? (the "BGEA") enter into the following Agreement to set forth the terms governing the Globe’s assignment of employees who are members of the Boston Typographical Union No. 13 (the "BTU”) to perform certain functions described in sections 4 through 7 below which are related both to operations currently performed by BTU members and are also related to operations performed by BGEA employees in the Globe's Editorial, Advertising and Computer Operations Departments so that the Globe can provide meaningful work opportunities for BTU represented employees who haw lifetime job guarantees.
This Agreement contemplates assigning work to two groups of BTU employees: (I) those individuals with lifetime job guarantees as of the date of this Agreement (“Job Guaranteed Employees"), and (2) employees hired or transferred by the Globe to meet its contractual obligation to the BTU to maintain a “Minimum Force" ("Minimum Force Employees").
It is understood and agreed that:
I.	The terms of this Agreement will become part of the collective bargaining agreement currently under negotiation between the parties (January 1J99X through December 31. 2000).
2.	The terms of this Agreement do not abrogate or otherwise diminish the
H( i 1 i A’s jurisdiction pursuant to Article VIII, Section 3 of the Globc-BGEA collecliw bargaining agreement. All work which has traditionally been within the exclusive jurisdiction of the BGEA shall remain as such, subject to the assignment of BTU employees to perform any of the functions as is otherwise provided in this Agreement.
3.	All work which was previously within the exclusive jurisdiction of the BTU and is to be assigned to BTU and BGEA employees under paragraphs 4. 5 and 6 to this Agreement shall become as of the execution of this Agreement the exclusive jurisdiction of the BGEA , subject only to the assignment of BTU employees as provided in this Agreement. Such work includes certain advertising production functions which have his-
106
topically been within the BTU’s exclusive jurisdiction such as classified pagination and the scanning of camera ready ads. It is expected as a result of this Agreement that BGEA employees shall also perform these above-mentioned functions. Such work shall not be assigned to members of any other Globe bargaining unit.
4.	The Globe may assign Job Guaranteed Employees to perform advertising production functions which arc similar/idenheal to those at any lime performed b\ the BGEA job categories of “Production Coordinator". "Advertising Clerk” and “Advertising Designer". These functions in- . elude ad processing, ad makeup, page proofing and finishing, and processing of tear sheets. BTU employees will hot be assigned to perform any advertising sales functions.
5.	The Globe may also assign Job Guaranteed Employees to perform noncreative production support functions in the Editorial Design department and to perform the electronic make-up of wedding, obituary and paid death notice pages.
6.	a) The Globe may also increase the existing comp lent ent of BTU employees in the Information Services Computer Operations department to perform the function of "Computer Operator" initially from four (4) to a maximum of eight (X) total full lime equivalent employees with Job Guaranteed Employees. After their training period, they may be scheduled for either day, night or lobster shift, at their individual option, provided such coverage is required by the Globe. If any Job Guaranteed Employees opt for a night or lobster shift schedule, the three BGEA employees who are currently on a night or lobster shift may voluntarily transfer to a day shift schedule on a 1:1 replacement basis, based on BGEA bargaining unit seniority.
b) Thereafter, the Globe may increase the number of BTU employees in the department to a maximum of fourleenl 14) only if new functions are added to the department and/or the number of hours to be covered by the department increases which requires additional shifts to be scheduled. The Globe will maintain the ratio relationship relatively in balance between the BTU and BGEA employees in that department, based onaratioofl 1/2 (BTU) to 1 (BGEA).
7.	The Globe may also assign functions not previously performed by Globe employees (including functions previously performed by third parties for the Globe) to Job Guaranteed Employees. The Globe will notify the BGEA at least thirty (30) days in advance of these assignments and will meet with the Union upon request to discuss the nature of the work
107
' involved Such new work that the Globe and the BGEA agree is reasonably related to work performed within the BGEA bargaining unit shall become the exclusive jurisdiction of the BGEA, subject only to(i) the interim assignment to BTU employees as provided in this agreement, and (ii) reassignment to third parties as provided elsewhere in this section. Any disagreements under this paragraph shall be subject to the parties’ Grievance/Arbitration procedures. Any such arbitration will be limited to the issue of whether the new work activity shall become the exclusive jurisdiction of the BGEA, subject Only to (i) the interim assignment to BTU employees as provided in this agreement, and (ii) reassign me nrto third parties as provided elsewhere in this section.
The Globe can decide to have work previously performed by third parlies for the Globe performed by third parties again in the future. Subject to the preceding sentence regarding third party work, any such new work shall not be assigned to any other employees, persons or entity. The Globe may, at any time, determine not to have work performed for the Globe by any employee, person or entity.
8.	-BTU represented employees may perform all the functions described in paragraphs 4 through ? above in physical areas in which BGEA employees are working. These areas currently are the ad operations area (including advertising design), the Inside Sales department, the display desk, the Editorial Design area (including any specific area within Editorial to which a BTU employee may be assigned to provide non-crc-ativc design production support such as sports) and the Computer Operations department within Information Services. These areas may change in the future: a) as workflow and processes change and/or b) as a result of new work assignments pursuant to paragraph 7 above.
9.	When the number of Job Guaranteed BTU Employees decreases to less than fifty (50) pursuant to the “Minimum Force’’provision of the Globe-BTU 1997-2006 collective bargaining agreement, if the Globe should hire new full time or part time employees under the Globc-BTU agreement to maintain the “Minimum Force" in positions performing work described in paragraphs 4 through 7 above, such new employees will be transferred to the BGEA bargaining unit pursuant to the terms of the "Minimum Force" provision (i.e., such jobs will be posted pursuant io the contractual provisions then existing between the Globe and the. BGEA. Employees selected for these positions will be hired into the BTU bargaining unit, placed on a leave of absence from that unit and then immediately transferred into the BGEA bargaining unit). BGEA employees will be eligible for such positions, pursuant to the same terms of the “Minimum Force” provision.
108
10.	The Globe agrees that as a direct result of the implementation of this Agreement no named BGEA bargaining unit employee listed in Exhibit A to this Agreement shall be laid off from the job categories of “Advertising Production Coordinator", “Advertising Designer", "Computer Operator", or "Advertising Clerk" (for ad production support jobs only). The Globe agrees that no full time employee listed in Exhibit A to this Agreement without a lifetime job guarantee shall be laid off during the life of this Agreement as long as Job Guaranteed Employees are assigned to those functions which are similar/identical to those at any time performed by the foregoing BGEA job categories. If at any time Job Guaranteed Employees arc no longer so assigned and employees listed on Exhibit A were laid off. the Globe would be precluded from again assigning Job Guaranteed Employees to such function(s) until those Exhibit A employees were offered recall (pursuant to Article 111, Section 1(D) of the contract.)
Regular part time hours for part time BGEA employees listed on Exhibit A may be reduced only proportionally to a part time hours reduction implemented for their respective departments as a result of other business reasons (such as budget cutbacks or a decrease in advertising volume) as long as Job Guaranteed Employees are assigned to those functions which arc similar/identical to those al any lime pci lbrnicd by the BGEA job categories listed above . 'flic Globe shall notify the Union prior to implementing any reduction in part time hours for Exhibit A employees and shall meet with the Union, upon request. to discuss reasonable alternatives to any such hours reduction.
. There will be a transition period following the signing of this Agreement which will be for six (6) months or until at least forty (40) Job Guaranteed Employees arc regularly performing the functions described in paragraphs 4 through 6 above (excluding those solely performing classified pagination and/or the scanning of camera ready ads), whichever is later. In no event shall the transition period be longer than twelve (12) months. At that time the Globe will furnish the BGEA with a list of such Job Guaranteed Employees. Thereafter, if any of those employees were to leave the Globe or were no longer performing those functions and the Globe chose to replace them with other Job Guaranteed Employees, the Globe will hire additional BGEA bargaining unit employees for the positions of Production Coordinator and/or Advertising CIcrk based on a ratio of three (3) additional Job Guaranteed Employees so assigned to one additional BGEA bargaining unit employee hired.]. The Globe may hire either full time employees or part time employees based on a ratio of 2 part time employees being equivalent to 1 full time hire. The Globe will continue to hire both full time
109
and part lime employees based on its business needs After the transition period referred to in this paragraph, any new hires into the BGEA bargaining unit positions of either Production Coordinator or Advertising Clerk may be banked by the Globe for credit toward this hiring ratio.
12,	There are 61 employees listed on Exhibit A. The Globe agrees that if that list were to reduce in number to 46, then thereafter the Globe will hire BGEA replacement employees for those positions based on a ratio of one( I) hire for each three (3) BGEA employees who have attrited. The Globe may hire either full time or part time employees. The Globe will continue to hire both full time and part time employees based on its business needs. Two part time employees will count toward each full time employee who has attrited. Any hires to replace named employees on Exhibit A who attrit from an Exhibit A position may be banked for credit toward this hiring ratio.
13.	In addition to the quid pro quos agreed to elsewhere, it is understood and agreed that in exchange for this Agreement, the Globe will add to the Job Security List (Exhibit A) to the Globe-BGEA collective bargaining agreement) 55 additional BGEA full time employees on a one for one replacement basis for each job guaranteed employee who is removed from that List for any reason (resignation, death, etc.). Such additions will be made solely on the basis of bargaining unit seniority.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
. Between
GLOBE NEWSPAPER COMPANY,INC.
and
BGEA/TNG-CWA LOCAL 31245 (Imaging Center)
Globe Newspaper Company, Inc. (the "Globe”) and BGEA/TNG-CWA Local j 1245 (the "BGEA”) enter into th is Memorandum of Agreement to set forth the tcmis governing the Globe’s establishment of an Imaging Center as follows:
I.	Asa result of technological changes in the workplace and to help ensure consistent quality of production, the Globe may establish an "Imaging Center” in which both black and white and color photographs will be processed for the newspaper ("imaging work”). This imaging work includes that work which was previously performed in the Sci-tex Department as well as that performed in the Editorial Photo Department. Specifically, this imaging.work currently includes the receiving of photos and reflective material (e.g., line art and hard copy photos) from a variety of sources, the scanning of such material and the conversion to either gray scale for black and white images or to a "cmyk” scale using color separation techniques for color images. It is understood that this imaging work may change in the future given the constant changing technology.
2.	Both BGEA bargaining unit employees (primarily Imaging Technicians) and employees represented by other Globe unions will share and be able to interchangeably perform all imaging work performed in the Imaging Center, except that only BGEA employees will perform work that requires editorial judgments or decisions. This editorial work includes. but is not limited to, caption writing, in house photography and film editing. BGEA technicians will be trained in color correction, and will continue training and participating in advances in digital imaging and the resultant work flow (i.c. the increased use of digital cameras). All employees working in the Imaging Center, regardless of bargaining unit, will be appropriately trained as the changing technology requires, except only BGEA employees will be trained for the above described work requiring editorial judgments or decisions.
3.	’ It is understood that all imaging work which has been historically within the exclusive jurisdiction of the BGEA shall remain as such subject only to the work sharing described in this agreement.
114
4.	The Globe agrees that no named current part time BGEA Imaging Technician shall be laid off as a direct result of the merging of work nor shall an Engraving Department substitute employee be employed in the Imaging Center to reduce the hours otherwise worked by the named current part time Imaging Technicians. If during the life of this agreement either or both of the named current part time Imaging Technicians become full time Imaging Technicians, he/they shall be protected from lay off for the duration of this Agreement and as long as he/they remain full time Imaging Technicians. In addition, the one current full time Imaging technician who does not have a job guarantee will be added to the Job Security List.
5.	All BGEA Imaging Technicians will maintain their BGEA bargaining unit contractual rights, including but not limited to seniority separately from that of employees in other bargaining units working in the Imaging Center. Such separate bargaining unit seniority will be used for shift scheduling, holiday scheduling and vacation scheduling as is otherwise provided in Article III, Section 5 of the collective bargaining agreement.
6.	The Globe and the Union shall form a committee, composed of three persons for each party, which shall meet upon request of either party to review the implementation of the shared Imaging Center and discuss any questions or concerns arising from its ongoing operation. The committee shall refer any agreed upon recommendations to the Globe and the Union.
7.	This Agreement shall survive this collective bargaining agreement and shall continue in effect as long as the shared work arrangement in the Imaging Center continues. The Globe shall give the Union at least thirty (30) days notice if ever it plans to discontinue the shared work arrangement in the Imaging Center. The parties shall then meet to discuss the effects of the termination of this Agreement. Furthermore, if either party so desires, it may propose changes to this Agreement at the conclusion of the successor collective bargaining agreement to the one currently under negotiation (covering 1998-2000) and such proposed changes shall be included in the overall negotiations for such successor contract.

RE: Increase in Pension Cap
Dear Bob:
This will confirm that during negotiations for the 1998-2000 collective bargaining agreement that the Globe and the Union have agreed that the increase in the salary cap for the pension from the current $55,000 to $65,000 shall be effective upon ratification and signing of the contract. The parties have further agreed that any bargaining unit employees who retired January 1, 1999 and thereafter who would benefit from the increase in salary cap would have their pensions adjusted to reflect the increase effective for the month following signing of the contract. It is understood and agreed that this pension adjustment will be paid separately from the monthly check from the pension fund and shall be paid from the company’s operating funds.

RE: 1999 Health Fund Contribution
Dear Bob:
This will confirm that the Globe has agreed that commencing May 1, 1999, over a one year period, it will pay $220,000 (in twelve equal monthly installments of$ 18,333.33) into the Globe/BGEA Health Fund as part of the negotiated quid pro quo. The Globe will pay this money retroactively for May Is1, provided the parties’ tentative agreement, which was reached prior to May Is', is ratified by the Union membership on or about May 25, 1999. If the agreement is not ratified at that time, the 1999 $220,000 payment would then be prorated from the time of actual ratification.

RE: Special Incentive Salespersons
Dear Bob:
This is to confirm that the parties have negotiated and agreed upon the following termsand conditions for new hires in the job category of “Special Incentive Salespersons”:
1.	There may be both full and part-time employees employed in the position. For 1998, there will be a cap of eight (8) and for 1999 there will be a cap of an additional ten (10) new hires in this position. The Globe may “bank” up to six (6) unused hires from 1998 for use in 1999 (for a total of 16 potential new hires), and may bank all unused hires from 1999 for the year 2000, with the understanding that there will be a cap of no more than twenty (20) total hires in this job category by the end of 2000, with no cap on the number employed thereafter.
2.	The rate of pay for the term of the contract shall be as follows:
First Year Second Year Third Year Fourth Year
S500.00/wk
$53O.OO/wk
S565.00/wk
S600.00/wk
This rate will not be subject to the general wage increase negotiated effective January 1, 1999, but will receive the general wage increase effective January 1,2000. Thereafter, the issue of wage rates for this new job category will be included in the overall bargaining process. In addition to the base wage rate, the Employer shall maintain a commission program structured such that there is an incentive for a reasonably successful Special Incentive Salesperson to earn a total of between S800 to SI,200 per week and more in both salary and commission together. The type of commission program and changes therein, and decisions with respect to the administration of any such programs, shall be determined solely by the Employer. The Globe will provide the Union and the affected employees with a copy of the commission program and any subsequent modifications to it seven (7) working days prior to the modifications taking effect.
121
3.	A record of all sales and commissions, including accounts for which commissions were earned, shall be compiled monthly and copies shall be given to the respective employee. This information shall be provided to the Union upon request. Commissions will be paid monthly, in the month following the sale. The Globe will make every practical effort to pay the commission no later than six (6) weeks after the sale.
4.	For the duration of this contract the Special Incentive Salespersons will be limited to selling to “Local Retail advertisers” only. That group is currently defined as those retail and general advertisers whose prior calendar year spending in the Globe was less than $200,000. The definition of “Local Retail advertiser” may be changed once a year by no more than ten per cent (10%) up or down. The Union shall be notified thirty (30) days in advance of such change, if any. Thereafter, the issues of any change in the definition of “Local Retail advertiser” and the ability of Special Incentive Salespersons to sell to non Local Retail advertisers will be included in the overall bargaining process.
5.	When an account sold and serviced by a Special Incentive Salesperson becomes a larger Globe advertiser (as defined by calendar year spending greater than the level then currently established for a “Local Retail” advertiser in paragraph 4 above) it will be transferred to an Outside Salesperson for continued sales and service.
6.	New hires in this category shall have a probationary period of six months. Discharges during this period shall not be subject to review by the Union nor subject to the Grievance and Arbitration procedure under Article XI. The Globe may terminate any Special Incentive Salesperson for failure to maintain reasonable, written minimum sales goals as established by the Globe. Such failure will constitute just cause for dismissal.
The Globe may change its written Commission sales goals from time to time. Upon request the Globe will provide those minimum goals to the Union. A Special Incentive Salesperson after his/her probationary period, will have at least 30 working days to meet such minimum goals prior to being subject to discharge.
7.	For the duration of this contract and the successor contract, first consideration to fill at least one (1) or twenty per cent (20%) (whichever is more) of the Special Incentive Salesperson positions filled per year will be given to a qualified current Advertising Department bargaining unit employee (including Inside Sales, Special Projects Group and Outside Sales). If applicants from two of the three groups are chosen for a Special Incentive Salesperson position, an applicant from the third group
122
only will be given first consideration for a position in the following year. The Globe will interview at least one (1) applicant from each of these three Advertising areas (provided there are applicants from each group) for each posted position.
Any current Advertising Department employee who is selected to fill a Special Incentive Salesperson position may return or be returned to his/her former position if either the employee or the Globe so chooses during their first six (6) months of employment as a Special Incentive Salesperson. The rate of pay shall be as though the employee never left. There shall be no break in continuity of service for such employees.
8.	Except as provided in Section 6, all Commissioned Outside Salespersons shall come under the same contractual provisions (including benefit entitlements and grievance and arbitration rights) as other bargaining unit employees.
9.	All current (by name) Outside Advertising Salespersons (the “grandfathered Outside Advertising Salespersons") will be guaranteed their current rate of pay (as of January 1, 1999) plus future negotiated salary increases, if any, equivalent to those negotiated for the entire bargaining unit for the next ten (10) years, (beginning January I, 2000 through December 3 1, 2009) provided they remain in the Outside Advertising Salesperson position. After the ten (10) year period, the issue of wage rates for these named Outside Advertising Salespersons will be included in the overall bargaining process.
10.	For purposes of Article III, Section 1(B) only, "Layoffs". the "Special Incentive Salespersons" shall be considered to be in the same job classification as “Outside Advertising Salespersons” (for example, if any layoff became necessary, the less senior Special Incentive Salespersons would be laid off prior to non-job guaranteed Outside Advertising Salespersons).

The Production Coordinator job description relative to Inside Sales is attached as part of Appendix A to the Inside Sales Memorandum of Agreement, As both the Sales Coordinator and Production Coordinator jobs are higher rated than the clerk position, they would also be able to routinely do clerical functions as well.
Sales Coordinator - Various sales support and marketing tasks including, but not limited to, new sales prospecting, marketing and sales analysis reporting, assistance in preparing marketing collateral materials and presentations, assistance in contract renewal and fulfillment process, handling of inbound sales inquiries, customer scrviceand occasional field work.

132
All clerks who are currently receiving differential merit pay pursuant to Section II (“marketplace wage adjusted classifications”) of the 1990 Supplemental Agreement who are promoted into either of these two new positions will not be paid at the above rates but instead will continue to carry their current “differential merit pay" and will be paid an additional $85 per week. However, if such a clerk is promoted or transferred into any other non-marketplace adjusted wage job classification they will not continue to carry their “differential merit pay” or the $85.00 premium.

SI5,000 to be used for retraining payments during 1998 to any employee whose job duties are altered by the end of 1998 to require them to work regularly on the pagination system. At the end of 1998 if there is money left from the $ 15,000 withheld for retraining payments it will be paid into the BGEA/Boston Globe Taft Hartley Health insurance Trust (the "Trust").
Upon request of the Union, the parties will meet to discuss the future eligibility of any employee employed as of the date of this Agreement for the SI 500 retraining bonus. Any disagreement will be subject to the parties’ grievance and arbitration procedures.
The Union agrees that as a result of this agreement it will deem resolved Grievance No. 90-18/New Technology-Pagination and the pagination issues raised in that grievance and will so notify the AAA.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT between
GLOBE NEWSPAPER COMPANY
and
BOSTON GLOBE EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION LOCAL 245, TNG (INSIDE SALES)
This Memorandum of Agreement is made and entered into between the Globe Newspaper Company (the “Globe”) and the Boston Globe Employees Association, Local 245, TNG (the “BGEA”). This Agreement is to become a part of the successor collective bargaining agreement currently being negotiated and will supplement the terms of the Globe July 16, 1095 Final Offer and Posted Conditions covering the Inside Sales Department as follows:
The parties agree that this Memorandum of Agreement supersedes the current two sidelctters entitled, “Inside Sales Department” and "New Advertising Department Job Classifications” to the extent they are inconsistent with the following provisions.
1.	All current (by-name) full and part-time Inside Salespersons ("the grandfathered Inside Salespersons”) will be guaranteed their current (as of January 1, 1997) wage rate plus future negotiated salary increases, if any, equivalent to those negotiated for the entire bargaining unit for the next ten (10) years (beginning January 1, 1998 through December 31,2007), provided they are in the Inside Salesperson position. Subject to the foregoing, after the passage of the ten year period, the issue of wage rates for these named Inside Salespersons will be included in the overall collective bargaining process. This is not a guarantee of hours or work unless otherwise specified in the parties’ agreement.
2.	The Globe may hire new full-time and part-time Inside Salespersons for “outbound calling” at the same rate of pay as the Special Projects Group (currently $462.49/1 st year to $52O.3O/4th year). The Globe may also hire new full-time and part-time Classified Inbound Salespersons (currently includes major account group, core account, and customer service groups) at the rate of$550/wk 1st year, S575/2nd year, $600/3rd year and $625/wk 4th year. The Globe shall have the right to and will establish commission/incentive programs consistent with contractual provisions for these new job categories which will be higher than that paid to the “grandfathered” salespersons. The Commission Program for Classified Outbound will be structured such that
141
there is an incentive for a reasonably successful outbound salesperson to earn a total of $20.00 to $25.00 an hour (salary plus commission combined). This specific provision is not subject to renegotiation through December 31, 2007, except that negotiated wage increases will be applied to the respective rates (beginning January 1, 1998).
For five years, new full-time employees may only be hired on a one-for-onc replacement basis for grandfathered full-time employees who are attrited from the Inside Sales position. Attrition will be defined to include those persons who voluntarily resign from their Inside Salesperson position because of retirement, buyout, or who voluntarily leave the Globe’s employ or who voluntarily take a position other than Inside Salesperson within the Globe. It shall also include termination for just cause and death and employees who arc on either Worker’s Compensation or LTD for twelve months or longer. Employees out on Workers Comp or LTD may return to their Inside Salesperson’s position as would otherwise be the case. Such employees will return to their grandfathered status. Voluntary transfers of full-time grandfathered Inside Sales people to Classified Outbound will also count toward this attrition. After five years, there shall be no cap on new full-time hires.
3.	Volunteers from the grandfathered part-time Inside Sales will be offered first opportunity to work in the Classified Outbound group. The Globe will have the right to select those it deems potentially qualified to perform the work. The selection will not be arbitrable. The Globe will guarantee a minimum of 20 hrs./wk. at their current pay rate ($25.63/hr.- top scale) which will be frozen until the new outbound two-tier rate catches up to the frozen rate. Any full-time grandfathered Inside Salesperson who transferred to Classified Outbound would be paid at the current pay rate ($961,26/wk. - top scale) which would be frozen until the outbound two-tier rate caught up. The Globe will establish a commission structure based on that in effect for the Special Projects Group (with the higher frozen pay differential as an offset against commissions). Any grandfathered Inside Telephone Salesperson who is selected to fill a Classified Outbound position may return or be returned to Inside Sales if cither the employee or the Globe so chooses during the first six months of employment in Classified Outbound Sales. Such employee shall return to his/her previous job and the rate of pay shall be as though the employee had not left. There shall be no break in continuity of service for such employees.
New hires in Classified Outbound shall have a probationary period of six months. Discharges during this period shall not be subject to re
142
view by the Union. The Globe may terminate any Classified Outbound Salesperson who did not transfer from Inside Sales for failure to maintain reasonable, written minimum sales goals as established by the Globe. Such failure will constitute just cause for dismissal. No full-time Classified Outbound Salesperson who was promoted from part-time status shall be terminated for failure to maintain reasonable sales goals without first being given one (1) written warning. Any transferred Inside Salesperson who fails to meet such goals will be returned to his/her former part-time or full-time Inside Sales position.
The Globe may change its written Classified Outbound Sales goals from time to time. Upon request, the Globe will provide those minimum goals to the Union. A Classified Outbound Salesperson, after his/her probationary period, will have at least 30 working days to meet such minimum goals prior to being subject to discharge.
4.	Pursuant to Article XIV, Sections (f) and (G) grandfathered part-time Inside Salespersons will be notified three (3) weeks in advance of a total lay-off (as defined by having no shifts available for four (4) or more weeks). They will have one (I) week to notify the Globe if they wish to bump any part-time Advertising clerk (Inside and Outside Sales), including but not limited to those paid marketplace adjusted wage rates, with less Globe seniority (defined as years of actual Globe bargaining unit service). They will receive all necessary training during the next two (2) weeks, during which they would have to demonstrate they are capable of performing the work for which they have been trained. This training will be done on scheduled work time. They would be paid at the then current rate of pay for grandfathered Inside Salespersons which would be frozen until the highest two-tier clerical rate caught up to their frozen rate, which would then move forward. They would have the right to revert to part-time Inside Salesperson position as they became available at the grandfathered rate for then guaranteed Inside Salespersons. The Globe will make a reasonable effort to make available computer training as would be needed for these positions and to perform substitution under paragraph (5) below, provided such training is done on the Inside Salesperson’s own time.
5.	The one non-guarantecd full-time Inside Salesperson, Mary Bcntson, will be added to the list of job guaranteed employees (Exhibit A to the expired contract) when and ifa job guaranteed full-time Inside Salesperson is removed from the list for any reason (resignation, death, etc.), provided she is employed as a full-time Inside Salesperson. If before she is added to the list, there is a lay-off situation she would be able to bump another non-guaranteed Advertising full-time clerk, pro
143
vided she had more bargaining unit seniority, and subject to the same notice and training period provisions as in paragraph 4 above. She would be paid at her current Inside Salesperson rate which would be frozen until the top rate for her two-tier clerical position caught up, which would then move forward. She would have the right to revert to Inside Salesperson full-time position if one becomes available at the then Inside Salesperson guaranteed rate.
6.	The Globe will offer the grandfathered part-time Inside Salespersons the opportunity to substitute for fifty percent (50%) of all replaced absences of Advertising clerks (Inside and Outside) as averaged over a calendar year’s period subject to the following guidelines: a) the Globe maintains its right to determine if all (or part) of an absence is to be covered; b) the Globe has right to select which part-time Salespersons will be offered substitution opportunity based upon their skills and ability to perform the substitute work (the Globe will distribute the opportunities in a reasonably equitable manner with due regard to seniority except in those cases in which skill and ability are relatively equivalent, seniority shall prevail); c) the Salesperson will be paid at the top two-tier clerk rate plus Ten Dollars (SI0.00) per each shift worked; and d) the Salesperson may perform Inside Salesperson work for one or more shifts per week at her guaranteed Inside Salesperson rate of pay as necessary and as scheduled by the department. All offered substitution opportunities, even if rejected, will count toward the fifty percent (50%) obligation. The Globe will supply the Union with data which tracks such substitute opportunitiesand review it with (he Union every six months.
7.	The Globe will first offer the grandfathered part-time Inside Salespersons the opportunity to substitute for all replaced absences of fulltime Inside Salespersons, subject to the Globe’s right to determine if all (or part) of an absence is to be covered. If no grandfathered part-timers arc available to substitute, newly hired part-timers will then be offered the opportunity.
8.	Effective upon signing and ratification, for a twenty-four (24) month period, for any week in which a name part-time Inside Salesperson’s work opportunities fall below twelve (12) hours per week, the Globe will pay them the difference in their actual hoursand the pay for twelve (12) hours up to One Hundred Dollars each week up to a maximum of $2,500/year per employee for a maximum of $5,000 total per employee.
144
It is understood that the term “work opportunities” includes not only work offered within Inside Sales but all work offered under Paragraph (6) of the Agreement.
These payments shall not be made for weeks which are part of the annual seasonal downturn (defined as the week after Thanksgiving through the last week of December) nor shall it apply to a significant downturn in Classified advertising linage as a result of business conditions (defined as at least a twenty percent decrease in total Sunday Classified Ad pages compared to the prior year over at least an eight week consecutive period).
9.	No newly hired part-time Inside Salesperson will be offered one (1) or more work opportunities per week unless all grandfathered part-time Inside Salespersons have first been offered at least two (2) work opportunities per week, of at least six (6) hours each, and up to seven and a half hours, exclusive of overtime. All offered opportunities, even if not accepted, will count toward the foregoing requirement. These work opportunities will be offered based on seniority among the grandfathered part-time Inside Salespersons as is the current practice. In no event shall a newly hired part-time Inside Salesperson be offered more hours in a week than the least senior grandfathered part-timers. Seniority shall prevail for work opportunities offered beyond two (2) per week to any part-time Inside Salesperson and for all work opportunities offered to newly hired Inside Salespersons. This section is intended only to provide an assurance of priority of allocation of available work opportunities.
10.	The Globe will continue to make available the following full shifts for the grandfathered part-time Inside Salespersons for the time periods as follows: a) no less than 8 shifts Thursday night, 3 shifts Saturday and 3 shifts Sunday for the remainder of 1997; b) no less than 4 shifts Thursday night, 3 shifts Saturday and 3 shifts Sunday for 1998: and c) no less than 2 shifts Thursday night, 3 shifts Saturday and 3 shifts Sunday for the remainder of the successor contract to the one currently being negotiated.
Grandfathered part-time employees who currently work on cither Thursday night, Saturday or Sunday as their first scheduled work opportunity who do not get offered one of those shifts as their first scheduled work opportunity will be offered one Inside Salesperson full shift work opportunity on a different shift as their first scheduled work opportunity.
145
11.	The parties recognize that the primary responsibility ot inside Classified Salespersons is to generate advertising revenue through the telephone sales and service of advertising accounts. The parties further recognize that the functions of the Advertising Clerks and/or Production Coordinators as outlined in the attached Appendix A are to provide support to the Inside Classified Salespersons. In the future, if the Union believes that any specific Globe assignmcnt(s) of work violates the terms of Appendix A, it may grieve and arbitrate those assignments pursuant to the parties’ grievance and arbitration procedure.
12.	The Globe may establish basic minimum performance standards for all Inside Classified Salespersons provided such standards are reasonable. Immediately following ratification, the parties will form a joint “performance standards” committee with three representatives from the Inside Sales department staff and three members of Advertising management. That committee will have ninety days to formulate performance standards. If the joint committee reaches agreement on standards during this period, the parties shall recommend approval of their agreement to the Globe and BGEA Negotiating Committees. If by the end of the 90 day period the parties are unable to agree on the proposed standards, the Globe shall have the right to implement the standards it deems to be reasonable. The Union may refer the issue of the reasonableness of the standards adopted by the Globe to the parties* grievance-arbitration procedure based on this memorandum and Ar-ticle-VIII, Section 8. The Globe may not use the proposed standards for purposes of progressive discipline for a period 9 months from the dale they are implemented or until January 1, 1998 whichever is later, unless an arbitrator rules on their reasonableness prior to either of those dates. During this time the Globe may use its proposed standards for all other purposes, including commission/inccntive programs pursuant to Article VII, Section 16 and for working with employees during this period to help them reach the standards. The Globe agrees that the minimum performance standards under which employees will be eligible for a commission will be higher than those under which they maintain a minimum level of accept able performance.. The committee will also continue to meet during the above period to review the standards and the employees progress in meeting the standards. The application of such standards for commission/inccntive programs shall not be subject to arbitration under this Section.
Following implementation of the performance standards, the performance standards committee shall, on a monthly basis, review employee performance results, whether the standards were reasonable for the month given current business conditions, and whether any exceptions

RE: Inside Sales Agreement Implementation
Dear Bob:
I
This will confirm that as a result of the parties’ agreement relative to the Inside Sales Department that certain changes such as duties and responsibilities of specific positions and the introduction of performance standards will occur in the department.
The Globe expects that a number of these changes will occur gradually over time and will keep the Union informed prior to implementation of these changes and will maintain a dialogue with the Union regarding such implementation.

RE: Inside Salespersons’ Shift Reallocation
Dear Bob:
This will confirm our understanding that as a result of certain changes in the Inside Sales Department that there will be a reallocation of certain part-time Inside Salesperson shifts which are currently scheduled for Thursday nights. It is the Globe’s intention not to eliminate these shifts but rather to reallocate them at this time to other days and times when Salespersons arc needed. Obviously any current allocation of shifts could be changed in the future as a result of a change in business conditions.
However, for the remainder of 1997 the Globe will continue to maintain at least one of the eight Inside Salesperson positions on Thursday nights for the 6:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. period.

RE: “Emergency Hires”
Dear Bob:
This will confirm that as a result of the parties’ agreement relative to the Inside Sales Department that the Globe may continue to employ the ten “emergency hires” it employed pursuant to the parties’ July 25, 1996 Interim Agreement as regular part-time employees at their current rate of pay (pursuant to para. 3 of that Interim Agreement) and that these part-time employees will be treated as “newly hired part-time employees” for all purposes of the Inside Sales Agreement.
Accordingly, all provisions of that Interim Agreement will be superseded by the parties’ new collective bargaining agreement, including the Inside Sales Agreement, upon ratification and signing of the new contract.
Very Truly Yours,

C.	OUTBOUND SALES - responsible for outbound calling to specific market segments to sell new accounts into classified sections, special sections and directories. May also include selling of special sections, bannered sections and directories to existing account customers in collaboration with Inside Sales Major and Core Account Groups salespersons, (i.e. The same information about these initiatives would be provided to the Major and Core Account Salespersons so they could also sell into these sections.) “Bannered sections" and “special sections" do not include nor are they intended to replace the traditional classified slugged sections of the newspaper. To the extent that commissions for individual performance are paid to Major Account Salespersons, commission will be paid for ads sold by Outbound Salespersons to existing accounts of Major Account Salespersons.

Training, in more complex ad formatting (Mechanical Regulation Proposal Sections HI (3) through (6)) will be provided to any current salesperson who so requests. There may be times, based on the Globe’s needs, that Inside Salespersons who have received such training will be called on to pcr-
152
form this work. Ads that are formatted by Production Coordinators, based on salespersons’ or customer directions, will be reviewed, approved and released by Salespersons, except as prevented by production deadlines.
4.	RESOLVE CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES - to make adjustments for errors in customer ads as is the current practice.
5.	AD RESEARCH AND GENERATION - (Outbound Sales Group) -generate new business calls through review of other media and publications related to target marketed segments, (ex. Going through yellow pages to generate leads for Globe Special Section).
CLERICAL SUPPORT TASKS
1.	COPY PROCESSING - processing of electronically transmitted (such as ACI AdDircct and AP AdScnd) and camera ready display ads, including but not limited to those that arc generated by ad agencies. Includes taking information from customer insertion order, typing that information into Atex system to generate Globe order form which is then attached to hard copy ad. Processing ad through to the comp room through a central "traffic desk” which will be staffed by Production Coordinators who will review and approve ads before releasing to Comp Room. Electronic ads may be ordered through same process (after printing out hard copy) or electronically through system (in the future). May require phone call to agency (or customer) if information is missing from insertion order. Neither a clerk nor a Production Coordinator will perform any upselling as part of this function. This is similar to function performed by clerks in Ad Control Unit for Outside Sales. Prior to making such a phone call, clerks may also discuss questions and problems which may arise with an Inside Salesperson, a supervisor, or a manager.

*	(such as Legal Notices and Death Notices)which then would be sent
straight to the Running Ad Bank by a clerk. Neither a elerk nor a Pro
153
I
duction Coordinator will perform any upselling as part of this function. Clerks may also discuss questions and problems which may arise with an Inside Salesperson, a supervisor or a manager.

This work has been done by clerks for some time.
4.	LEAD RESEARCH AND GENERATION - based on directions and guidelines developed by Inside Sales managers, extracting data from Globe ads and other sources to develop sales prospect lists for Salespersons.

5.	RESEARCI 1 AND PROCESS CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES - assist in processing of all ad adjustments which involves research (ex. Getting tear sheets, pulling copy from comp room), assist in filling out adjustment forms at the direction of an Inside Salesperson, supervisor, or manager, getting necessary approval, circulating copies of forms.
6.	M1SC. CLERICAL DUTIES - filing, typing, etc.
PRODUCTION COORDINATOR’S TASKS AS THEY RELATE TO INSIDE SALES
1.	ROUTING - The production coordinators will be responsible for trafficking ad copy. This will be done both internal and external to the building. On “hand-off’ from sales staff, customer, clerical or management they will insure the advertisements are sent to their ultimate des-‘.ination. As an example when an inside salesperson has taken the text of an ad, they will pass it on to a production coordinator. This can be done directly, through a clerk or electronically. The coordinator will then determine the advertisement’s route (art department, comp room). This may require contact with the customer to see if a messenger pickup or electronic transfer is necessary.
2.	SCANNING - Art elements, advertiser’s logos, photos, etc. will need to be scanned into the file servers to be eventually made up into ads. Inside Salesperson will be responsible for getting these elements to the
154
coordinators for the actual scan with appropriate instructions from the Salesperson, supervisor or manager.
3.	ELECTRONIC FORMATTING - Will perform more complex single and multi-column ad formatting pursuant to the attached “Mechanical Regulation Proposal" guidelines. Section Ill (3) through (6). As determined by the various ad complexities the sales staff or clerical staff will pass the ad either physically or electronically to the coordinators for composition commands. These “commands" can be made by pencil mark-up or by keystroke. Ads will be reviewed, approved and released by salespersons except as prevented by production deadlines.
4.	PROOFING - The coordinators will “pre-proof’ ads be fore-releasing them to the sales staff or the customer. This is a move to insure quality. If errors occur or instructions are not followed in the ad make-up process, the ad will be caught and sent back through the cycle. Ad proofs may be faxed to the customer by the Production Coordinator or a clerk under the direction of the Inside Salesperson.
5.	. AD TRACKING - Although not an exclusive task, the coordinator will have the ability to Track ads through their cycle. They will be available to answer informational requests as to the ad’s disposition. They will also be able to reprioritizc or set ahead an ad for ’Tush" at the request of the sales staff.
6.	ELECTRONIC AD RECEPTION - Generally for display ads, the sales or clerical staff will alert the coordinators that the ad is coming electronically. The coordinators will then accept the copy, crop, rename and send along to the flic server.
7.	TRAFFIC DESK AND COPY RELEASING - Production coordinators will staff the traffic desk; that desk will have the responsibility to see that the ads arc timely released to the newspaper.

Dear Bob:
This will confirm that the parties have agreed to implement, effective January 1, 1997 the following agreed-upon changes and side agreement to the collective bargaining agreement being negotiated.
1)	Negotiated pattern wage increase of S.6400/hour or S24.00/week which we have estimated will result in an approximate wage increase of 2.31 percent to be applied to all contract book rates and grandfathered merit differential. The actual wage increase will be paid beginning the week of February 2nd, with retroactive pay from January I to February I to be paid after the successor agreement is ratified and signed.
2)	The attached executed side agreement relative to Boston Globe Electronic Publishing. It is understood and agreed that if parties do not conclude their current collective bargaining negotiations with an agreement to provide salary protection for Inside Telephone Salespersons through December 31,2007, as is currently provided in a separate draft agreement relative to Inside Telephone Sales, that the six (6) year term of the B.G.E.P. side agreement will be reduced to a term of five (5) years;
3)	The I percent 401(a) employer contribution to the "Employee Savings Plan" pursuant to Article VIA, Section 6 as attached and Article LX as attached. The 1 percent 401(a) contribution will be implemented as soon as technically feasible (based on systems requirements of both the Globe and Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company) which is expected to be within the next month, with ietroactivc40l(a) employer contribution to be made from January I to the actual date of implementation at the time that retroactive pay is paid following the ratification and signing of the successor agreement.
This agreement is without prejudice or precedent in these and any future negotiations.
Very truly yours,
Gregory L. Thornton

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT
I.	Job Guarantee
The Globe agrees that those full-time employees on the payroll prior to January 1, 1992, whose names appear in Exhibit A to this Agreement, will not be subject to a layoff. This job guarantee will not extend to employees hired subsequent to January 1, 1992. The named employees listed below may, however, be discharged for just cause and will also be removed from the job guarantee list upon resignation, retirement, abandonment of job or death. This job guarantee does not preclude the Globe from eliminating or consolidating jobs or positions as provided for in the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. A transfer to other available work, with no loss of pay, shall not be considered a layoff.
In the event the Globe permanently ceases publication, the above guarantee will thereupon cease and, provided further, in the event of an “Act of God” or strike by or a lockout of another union(s) with whom the Globe has a collective bargaining agreement that results in a period of temporary suspension of the Globe's operation, this job guarantee will be suspended for such period of temporary suspension only; and provided, further, in the case of strike by the Boston Globe Employees Association against the Globe, this job guarantee will cease during the strike but will be reinstated for those persons on the job guarantee list who return to work to available positions after the strike has ended, pursuant to both parties’ rights under the National Labor Relations Act.
In the event of a dramatic and apparently irreversible downturn in the Globe's business, placing in jeopardy the continued existence or survival of the Globe, the parties will meet to discuss what reductions, if any, are necessary to this no-layoff list. During the discussion period, the Employer will provide to the Union a “top-line” summary of its current financial condition and its market and economic projections upon which it bases its need to request the reduction. These discussions, which will not exceed thirty (30) days, may include consideration of possible alternatives proposed by the Union to reduce labor costs other than through reductions to the no-layoff list. If the parties cannot reach agreement, it will be subject to binding arbitration for resolution, and the arbitrator will not be strictly bound by the.no-layoff provisions of this Supplemental Agreement and will be empowered to make equitable adjustments as appropriate. The arbitrator shall also be empowered to require the Globe to submit its financial records to an independent accounting firm (limited to one of the “Big Six” that has not been retained in an auditing function for the Globe in the last ten
157
years) solely to verify the bona Tides of the Globe’s financial representations as provided to the Union. The independent accountant shall share its conclusions and findings (but not the Company’s financial backup data) with the arbitrator, the Union and the Company. However, the arbitrator, upon request, shall have confidential access through the independent accountant to any specific financial back-up data provided by the Globe. However, no layoff of the named employees on the list attached to this supplemental agreement may be made (unless mutually agreed upon) prior to the arbitration ruling on such equitable adjustments.
The arbitrator may also consider any of the alternatives presented by the Union as a resolution or rule that no reductions to the list are appropriate.
II.	Marketplace Wage Adjusted Classifications
1)	All employees currently employed in the attached marketplace wage adjusted classifications (whose names appear in the attached Exhibit B) shall retain the difference between the 1987 - 1990 contract book rate for their position and the new marketplace wage adjusted rates for that position and have it converted to “differential merit pay." No differential merit pay shall be lost or reduced while the employee remains in the marketplace wage adjusted classification as listed in Exhibit B or transfers into any other marketplace wage adjusted classification. Differential merit pay will not be carried when an employee moves into a job classification not included among the marketplace wage adjusted classifications.
2)	All named employees who are not at the top step for their respective job classifications shall, on their anniversary date, receive additional differentia! merit pay which shall be the difference between the 1987 - 1990 contract book rate for their next step and the next step rate under the adjusted contract rate for that classification.
3)	Those monies retained as differential merit pay shall be increased by the same percentage equivalent as the yearly general increases that are negotiated in the future and that are applied to the top scale for each job classification in the future, starting with the general increase that will be effective January 1, 1993.
4)	An employee who transfers out of a marketplace wage adjusted classification (as per the attached list) into a non-marketplace wage
158
adjusted classification shall be paid in his/her new classification at the pay level next higher than his/her current rate of pay, including differential merit pay, and shall advance from there.
5)	All part-time employees currently employed in the attached marketplace wage adjusted classifications (whose names appear in the attached Exhibit C) will be grandfathered at their current hourly rate of pay. Such part-time employees shall have that rate increased by the amount ofall negotiated future contractual pay increases so long as they remain in that specific marketplace wage adjusted classification. Any such part-time employee who becomes full time will be paid al the marketplace wage adjusted rate for that classification but will receive all contractual benefits to which full-time employees are otherwise entitled.
6)	Merit differential pay shall be included in calculating all contributions to and benefits payable under pension, life insurance and disability insurance programs.
111.	Quid Pro Quo
A.	Annualized Payments
In exchange for the Union’s agreement to certain changes in the Collective Bargaining Agreement as listed below, pro-rated from the date of signing the Globe agrees to pay an annualized quid pro quo of$782,000 based on the estimated cost savings to be achieved from these changes.
In addition, because the Union's Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan, not a defined contribution plan, and because the Globe is contractually and legally obligated to fund the plan to cover the negotiated benefits, the Globe proposes to modify the requirement of Article IX, Section 6, that it weekly contribute $43.10 per full-time employee to the plan and will instead contribute $38.10 weekly per full-time employee. As a quid pro quo for this change, the Globe will contribute $ 1.00 per regular straight-time shift per fulltime employee weekly to the BGEA Health Fund ($5.00 per employee per week). The Globe estimates that this would provide another $208,000 to the Health Fund annually.
In addition, effective January 1, 1994 and thereafter, a further quid pro quo payment of $60,000 annually, to be paid in equal monthly
159
amounts of $5,000 will be added in exchange for the Union’s eliminating no cost retiree newspaper subscriptions.
The above annualized quid pro quo payment reflects 38.8% of the estimated first year annualized cost savings as a flat-dollar amount and will be made initially as an annualized flat-dollar payment ($782,000) to be paid monthly in equal amounts in addition to the $208,000. These payments will be reflected as a $82,500.00 per month payment to the Health Fund from the date that the Globe implemented its Revised Final Offer that contains (he following provisions, Paragraphs 1 through 8. Effective January 1, 1994, the Globe will increase that annual amount as provided in the paragraph above by another $60,000 to $842,000, which will also be paid in monthly amounts, in addition to the $208,000. Those payments will amount at that time to $87,500 per month to the Health Fund (which includes $17,333 a month from the pension diversion). Effective May 1, 1994, the Globe will again increase that annualized quid pro quo payment by another $110,000, to $952,000, which will also be paid monthly in equal amounts, in addition to the $208,000. Those payments will be reflected at that time as a $96,667.00 per month payment to the Health Fund (which includes $17,333 a month from the pension diversion). None of these payments will be made retroactively.
I.	agreement on the Globe’s current proposals on Promotions (Article 11, Sections 3(B) and 7c;
2.	agreement on the Globe’s modified proposal on Sick Leave (Article V, Section 10);
3.	elimination of the No Layoff Clause (Article 111, Section 1) to be replaced by the layoff provisions as proposed by the Globe;
4.	inclusion of the right to subcontract as modified and proposed by the Globe (Article VIII, Section 3);
5.	agreement on the Globe’s June 17, 1992 proposal on Marketplace Adjusted Rates (Article VI, Sections 2 and 2A);
6.	agreement on the Globe’s proposal to establish a new part-time telemarketing position within the BGEA bargaining unit;
160
7.	agreement on the Globe’s current (November 26, 1992) proposal on Successors and Assigns.
8.	agreement on various other contract changes sought by the Globe including mileage rates and per diems, limitation on probationary credit, use of single vacation days, tuition reimbursement, caps on PC/VDT eye care, etc as well as resolution of the Globe’s Unit Clarification petition and certain contractual grievances.
The $952,000 per year quid pro quo (plus the Section 125 F.l.C.A. savings of approximately $98,000 per year) represent the annual quid pro quo for approximately $2,700,000 in annual savings achieved by the Globe in items I -8 above as well as other changes in the new agreement sought by the Globe. These savings and quid pro quos are allocated among paragraphs 1-8 above, except that paragraph five represents $1,867,000 in annual savings for the agreement on the Marketplace Adjusted rates.
Such payment will result in the Health Fund being able to reduce the ' levej of the current individual and family member payroll deductions for bargaining unit employees, as well as substantially offset future increases during the term of the Agreement.
The Union may divert up to $15,000 annually (pro-rated monthly) from its ongoing quid pro quo monies for payment of its 401 (k) administrative expenses or other non-wagc or non-pension benefit purposes. If such a diversion is implemented, the above monthly quid pro quo payments will be adjusted accordingly.
B.	One-time Quid Pro Quo Payments
1.	In exchange for the Union’s allowing the Globe to offer its Voluntary Selective Buyout Program to members of its bargaining unit, the Globe will make a one-time only contribution of $50,000 to the BGEA Health Fund, effective the date of signing of the collective bargaining agreement currently being negotiated.
2.	In exchange for the Union's agreement to divert $5.00 per week per full-time employee from the BGEA Pension Fund to the BGEA Health Fund, the Globe will make a one-time
. only contribution of $100,000 to the BGEA Health Fund, effective May I, 1993.
161
3.	In exchange for settlement of the Globe’s Unit Clarification petition, currently pending before the NLRB, (case #1-UC-552) the Globe will make a one time only contribution of $50,000 to the BGEA Health Fund. This is in addition to the one-time payment of $37,440 to the BGEA Health Fund, (based upon exclusion of certain current BGEA members from the bargaining unit) effective upon signing and ratification of this agreement,
4.	In exchange for settlement of certain contractual grievances, the Globe will make a one-time only payment to the BGEA Health Fund of $50,000 effective upon signing ratification of this agreement.
C.	Increase in LTD
The Globe will increase the monthly "LTD” plan to provide 60% of monthly pay up to a maximum of $5,000 per month.
D.	Part-Time Benefits
In exchange for the changes listed in Section’A (1-8) and other changes in this agreement which were sought by the employer, (including a change in retiree newspaper subscription practice), ■ effective upon date of signing and thereafter, part-time employees will receive the following new benefits: ' ' '
1.	The employer will provide $5000 in life insurance for regular part-time employees who have been employed by the Globe for at least one (1) year. Once eligible for such insurance, coverage shall continue so long as part-time employment is'continued,
2.	Article V, Section 1, “Vacations” will be modified to provide that part-time employees shall earn 1.25 vacation day credits for each one hundred ninety-five (195) hours worked, and part-time employees who have worked a minimum of 600 hours per year for a total of five (5) calendar years shall cam 1.5 vacation day for each one hundred ninety-five (195) hours worked.
IV.	This Supplemental Agreement providing protection against layoff as defined above for the named employees in Exhibit A and for those entitled to “differential merit pay” pursuant to Exhibits B and C, and pro
162
viding for annualized quid pro quo payments as described in Section III above, shall survive and supersede this and all successor collective bargaining agreements and shall not be subject to renegotiation. Should the Employer sell, transfer or assign its right, title or interests or transfer by receivership or bankruptcy its interest or ownership in any form or manner to a successor employer, this Supplemental Agreement will be fully binding on that successor employer who will be fully bound by the terms of this Supplemental Agreement as if such successor employer had been an original party to this Agreement.
GLOBE NEWSPAPER COMPANY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS POLICY
It is the policy of the Globe Newspaper Company to reimburse any employee, via insurance coverage or company funds, for personal loss resulting from that employee performing duties for the Globe under dangerous conditions, including, but not limited to, civil disorders and riots.
Reimbursement will be made in all cases where it is apparent that the employee exercised caution and the loss was unavoidable.
This policy will not be extended to personal losses suffered in the normal conduct of day-to-day business, such as parking tickets, damage to a personal motor vehicle, loss of a wallet or a pocketbook, etc.

Re: Clarification of Job Guarantee
Dear Bob:
This will confirm that the parties have agreed to clarify their use of the term “resignation" as used in the first paragraph of the “Job Guarantee" section of the December 20, 1993 Supplemental Agreement as follows:
1	.) Any full-time employee listed on the Job Guarantee list (Exhibit A to the Supplemental Agreement) who changes his/her status to exempt (i.e. management) without a break in continuous service, will have their job guarantee held in abeyance for up to two (2) years while they arc exempt. If during this two (2) year period they choose to return, with management's agreement, to a full-time BGEA position, (or if Globe management chooses to so return them during this two year period) their job guarantee will be reinstated, provided there is no break in continuous service. This provision will be applied retroactively to January I, 1994 except as to those employees who became exempt as a result of the parties’ Unit Clarification Settlement Agreement.
It is understood that this clarification will not protect employees from discharge for cause during the time they are exempt, nor would it protect them from a lay-off during the time their job guarantee was in abeyance. The bargaining unit seniority of these employees if they return to full-time job guaranteed status will be determined by Article III, Section 5, “Seniority Defined” for all purposes except for layoff (from which they would be protected pursuant to terms of the Job Guarantee). Bargaining unit seniority for purposes of layoff only applies to non-guarantecd employees (i.c. those hired January 1, 1992 or thereafter).
2	.) Any full-time employee on the Job Guarantee list (Exhibit A to the Supplemental Agreement) who changes his/her status to part-time, without a break in continuous service, will maintain their job guarantee while part-time so that the number of hours that they are scheduled to work will not be reduced from that which they are originally assigned (unless they so choose to reduce their hours, with management’s agreement). It is understood that this provision does not obligate the Globe to accommodate an employee’s initial request to reduce from full-time to part-time status nor does it obligate the
164
Globe to maintain a specific schedule of shifts, days or hours other than the number of hours offered. Any such employee may return to full-time status only if there is a position available for which they apply and are selected pursuant to the applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time. Upon return to full-time status, the terms of the Job Guarantee will be those as provided for in the parties’ 1993 Supplemental Agreement.
Pursuant to the above terms of this letter, Exhibit A to the 1993 Supplemental Agreement (the Job Guarantee List) will be fully updated.
Very truly yours,
Gregory L. Thornton

RE:
Reduced Work Week .
Dear Bob:
This is to confirm that the parties have negotiated and agreed upon the attached Reduced Work Week Policy which will be in effect for full-time BGEA employees during the life of this Agreement. The Company has agreed, as part of this policy, that if it wishes to change the policy during the life of this Agreement as it affects BGEA full-time employees that it will so notify the Union and that any such changes shall not become effective unless and until agreed upon by the BGEA.
Very Truly Yours,
Gregory L. Thornton
REDUCED WORK WEEK
It is the policy of the Globe that it will grant reduced work week status, for good and sufficient reasons (including family reasons), based upon all relevant considerations, including but not limited to operational efficiency, under the following provisions:
1.	Full-time employees with more than two years full-time employment as a Globe employee may be granted a reduced work week for up to one year.
2.	Requests for a reduced work week will be made in writing to the employee’s department head with a copy sent to the BGEA. Requests will not be unreasonably denied.
3.	Employees working on a reduced work week will be paid on a pro-rated basis commensurate with the number of days worked each week. During the first six months, the Employer agrees to
166
maintain health insurance coverage during the reduced work week period subject to any regular participation required of the employee by the Employer. During the first six (6) months of reduced work week status, full credit will be given for vacation and pension benefits, provided the employee returns to full-time status at the end of the year. During the second six (6) months, vacation, health insurance contributions, and pension benefits will be computed on a pro-rated basis. During the second six (6) months, the employee will pay an increased payroll deduction, inversely related to the number of days worked, for their health insurance contribution. (For example, ari employee working three days per week under the Reduced Work Week Policy would not be working two days per week, or 40% of the time, and would therefore pay 140% of the employee contribution to health insurance.) The Employer will maintain life insurance coverage for the entire reduced work week period.
4.	Holidays (nine holidays plus birthday) and sick time are pro-rated from the start of the individual reduced work week agreement (i.e., working 60% of a normal work week results in being entitled to 60% of holidays and 60% of sick time) for the duration of the leave.
5.	At the end of one year, the employee will return to his/her former position on a full-time basis, at the salary he/she would have received had employment been continuous. In extraordinary circumstances, a reduced work week may be extended beyond the one-year period for up to one additional year. The Globe will timely notify the Union in writing of any such approved extensions.
6.	If requests are to be approved for reduced work weeks which do not fall within the above conditions or raise issues not presently envisioned, the Globe will notify the Union of those requests. Such requests will be granted if both parties approve the request.

RE:	Family Conflict Policy
Dear Bob:
This is to confirm that the parties have bargained over the attached Family Conflict Policy which will be in effect for BGEA members. The Company has agreed, as part of this policy, that if it wishes to change the policy during the life of this Agreement as it affects BGEA bargaining unit employees that it will notify the Union and give the Union opportunity to bargain about such changes.
Sincerely,

Attachment
FAMILY CONFLICT POLICY
It is the policy of the Globe Newspaper Company that it will consider for employment any qualified applicant regardless of that applicant’s relationship to a present Globe employee. This policy, however, is subject to the following exceptions:
1.	The Company will not hire any applicant for employment into any position in a department in which a relative of that applicant or employee is already employed,
2.	In those cases in which an employee marries another employee where, as a result, the employees would be in a subordinate/super-visor relationship, one of the two employees must transfer or change positions. In such cases, the affected employees will have thirty (30) days for one of the two employees to transfer to another available position for which he or she is otherwise qualified. It shall be the sole decision of the employer which of the two employees shall either transfer or change position.
168
3.	In those cases where, after thirty (30) days, such accommodations can not be made, one of the two employees must terminate his or her employment. In all such cases, the employer will give consideration to the choice of the employees involved. If no accommodation can be made, and absent a joint decision by the two employees, the Employer shall decide which employee must leave. In such cases, the Employer will allow the affected employee ninety (90) days (or pay in lieu of) in which to terminate his/her employment. The Union shall be contemporaneously notified of all such action.
For purposes of this policy, “relatives” are defined to include spouses, siblings, parents or children.
This policy shall be applied prospectively only. Any exceptions to this policy will require the advance review and approval of both the President of the Globe and the Vice Prcsident/Human Resources. The Union shall be notified of all exceptions granted.

Dear Bob:
This is to confirm that the parties have negotiated and agreed that all current photographers and circulation salespeople (whose names appear on the attached list) who have previously received payment of $150 annually pursuant to Article VIA, Section 14 of the 1987 - 1990 Collective Bargaining Agreement will continue to be compensated $150 annually so long as those employees remain in the photographer or circulation salesperson classification.

Re:	Editorial-Independent Contractors
Dear Bob:
This is to clarify the parties understanding under Article XV. relative to the Globe’s usage of non-employees for editorial work.
The Globe maintains its position that the current number and utilization of free-lance editorial independent contractors (both “Special to the Globe” and “Correspondents”) poses no threat of erosion to the BGEA bargaining unit. However, it also agrees not to significantly expand its usage of those non-BGEA persons, beyond the relative mix of BGEA staff to non-BGEA persons as has historically been the practice. Such practice, usage and mix would apply to any new editorial initiatives which might be introduced in the future.

Dear Bob:
The parties have agreed to establish a jointly administered trust fund pursuant to Section 302 © (5) of the Taft-Hartley Act, as is more specifically provided for in Article VIA, Section 8E(2)of the collective bargaining agreement.
The Globe agrees that in order to further assist the Union in transitioning to a Taft-Hartley Fund that employee payroll contributions will not be increased during the period up to and including April 30, 1994’. However, it is understood and agreed that after that date, employee contributions will be established at levels sufficient, together with the contractually negotiated employer contributions, to maintain adequate actual funds to pay for the level of benefits, any appropriate reserves as determined by the trustees, and eliminate any existing deficit on that date.

Dear Bob,
The Globe agrees that in the event that national health insurance legislation is enacted and the quid pro quo monies contained in the Agreement and all other monies paid directly by the Globe to the Union’s Health Fund (excluding the $208,000 annually generated by the Pension Fund diversion) exceed that which is required by the employer under such legislation (either by way of percentage or flat dollar amount) that the Union may opt to either: a) to the extent permitted by such legislation, have such excess monies be credited to BGEA employee contributions required under that legislation, or be used to purchase supplemental health insurance (i.e. a benefit package more favorable than the minimum established under such health insurance; or b) divert such excess quid pro quo monies for some other BGEA nonwage benefit purpose (except rediversion into the BGEA Pension Fund).

RE:	Committees Relative to Marketplace Adjusted Wage Classi-
fications and Subcontracting.
Dear Bob:
The parties agree that following the signing and ratification of this agreement, they will establish two committees, composed of six members each (three members from each party on each committee).
The first committee will be established immediately after the signing and ratification of this agreement to gather and review payroll and hiring information provided by the employer for full and part-time employees covered by the new Marketplace Adjusted Wages(“two-tier wages”). Such relevant information will be provided by the employer quarterly. In addition, this committee may review suggestions and alternatives to the current structure so long as those alternatives would result in the same level of annual savings for the employer as are attained from the Marketplace Adjusted Wages as noted in Section 111 (Quid Pro Quo) paragraph A of the parties Supplemental Agreement. This committee will be advisory only and will make any mutually agreed upon recommendations to the employer.
The second committee will be established, effective January 1, 1995, to monitor the employer’s use of subcontracting under Article VIII, 3D. This committee may review matters such as alternative jobs for employees impacted by subcontracting; cost-effective approaches or alternatives rather than subcontracting that will provide the same level of contractual savings for the employer, and retraining of impacted employees. This committee will be advisory only and will make any mutually agreed upon recommendations to the employer.
Both committees will meet quarterly on company time. Either party to this agreement may call for a meeting at any time to review any relevant issues. Such meetings will be held within a reasonably prompt period of time.

A list of those grievances are attached to a separate Memorandum resolving those grievances. Such resolution shall be without precedent and prejudice to cither party.

Retiree Newspaper Subscription
Dear Bob:
This will confirm that in exchange for an additional quid pro quo to the BGEA/Globe Health Fund of $60,000 per year to be paid in monthly installments of $5,000 (effective January 1994 anti thereafter) the union agrees that as a result of a change in national accounting rules the Globe may discontinue its prior practice of providing retired employees who made a request free newspaper subscriptions to the Boston Globe. Instead, all employees who retire effective January 1, 1994 and thereafter, may purchase the Globe annually at the lowest discount subscription rate available. This change is prospective only and will not effect the practice as it relates to currently retired employees.

UNIT CL/X RI Fl CATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
The Boston Globe and the Boston Globe Employees Association agree to resolve the Globe’s pending Unit Clarification petition, I -UC-552 on the following terms and conditions:
1. The parties agree that the following positions, be excluded from the bargaining unit and become part of the Globe Newspaper Company’s Appendix A list pursuant to its Revised Final offer:
Maintenance Shift Foremen (5) Post Office Supervisor Protective Services Foremen (3) Confidential Secretary(ies) (9) Associate Software Analyst (6)* Senior Editorial Design Supervisor Senior Assistant Business Editor Senior Assistant Sports Editor Calendar Editor
*New position (in lieu of Senior System Analysts and Systems Analysts)
Attached to this proposal is a list of the nine (9) employees currently designated by the Globe as “Confidential Secretaries" to be excluded from the unit. The Globe shall furnish the Union with a list of those employees annually (including titles of exempt managers and/or departments for whom they currently perform secretarial duties). Within the cap of nine (9) such secretaries, the Globe shall notify the Union of any future changes in the names of such secretaries or changes in the titles, positions or departments of such Confidential Secretaries. Subsequent replacements for any of the exempt Confidential Secretarial positions, if made from within the bargaining unit, shall be done on a voluntary basis.
The Globe will offer on a one time only basis the same management buyout that was offered in 1991 under this proposal.
I fa non-voluntary force reduction in management ranks is to be implemented, for the period of the collective bargaining agreement currently being negotiated, the Globe will permit anyone so excluded through this Unit Clarification Agreement to transfer back into an existing bargaining unit position, subject to negotiation by the parties. If the parties cannot agree, this issue only may be subject to arbitration. Any such named employee in this Unit Clarification Agreement impacted by such a force reduction would retain all seniority in such a transfer and, while not retaining his/her ex-
179
eluded job title or benefits, would have his/her current management salary frozen until the BGEA-negotiated contract rates for his/her job category exceeded the management salary.
Some of the excluded positions in this Settlement Agreement are held by more than one employee. Where more than one exclusion under a single title is agreed to it has been so noted with the appropriate number of exemptions next to it. If, during the period of the agreement currently being negotiated between the parties and its successor agreement, the Employer seeks more numerical incumbents in the future for these specific positions than noted herein, the Employer shall provide sufficient evidence that such an increase is necessary to meet the needs of the newspaper. If the Union disagrees, that shall be subject to grievance and arbitration under Paragraph IV herein. It is understood that the cap of nine (9) Confidential Secretaries shall not be increased for any reason during the period of the agreement currently being negotiated and its successor agreement.
The parties agree that individuals in the above-excluded positions will continue to do the approximate amount and type of work, duties and functions that these jobs have historically comprised while in the bargaining unit as of December 1, 1993.
IE The following positions, sought to be excluded through the UC petition, will remain in the bargaining unit:
Maintenance Foremen
Maintenance Assistant Foremen
Protective Services Assistant Foremen All non-supervisory guards Editorial Design Supervisor Ask the Globe Editor
Assistant Chief Photographer
Book Editor
Assistant Business Editor
Assistant Metro Editor
Assistant Sports Editor Editorial Writer . Assistant Night Editor
Nurse(s)
Operations Supervisors) Outside Circulation Sales Return Room HeacF Systems Analyst Senior Systems Analysts Single Copy Sales Supervisors
180
III.	Furthermore, for a period of the agreement eurrently being negotiated between the parties and its successor agreement, the parties agree that neither will seek to clarify (i.c., change the included or excluded status) through the NLRB’s clarification procedure, before an arbitrator, in collective bargaining negotiations, or by any other means: 1) any position covered by the unit clarification petition which remains in the unit by agreement; 2) any position covered by the unit clarification petition which is agreed to as exempt; 3) any position currently listed as exempt in Appendix A to the parties’ CBA; and 4) any position created as exempt since Appendix A to the parties’ CBA was negotiated and as to which the Union has been notified as of the current date.
The Globe further agrees that it will not seek or in any way initiate the removal of the guards from the bargaining unit, on the grounds that they arc NLRA statutory guards, before the NLRB, an arbitrator, or the courts al any time in the future. Moreover, the Globe will not, on the basis of the inclusion of guards in the bargaining unit, withdraw recognition from or refuse to bargain with the BGEA, or in any other way question the appropriateness or legality of the bargaining unit.
IV.	Positions currently listed as exempt (pursuant to the Globe's exempt "Appendix A” proposal under its Revised Final Offer) may continue to do the approximate amount and type of work, duties and functions that those jobs have historically comprised (including work, duties and functions also performed by employees in the bargaining unit).
V.	Additional Appendix A exempt positions in the future will be established pursuant to Article X, Section 6, "Exempt Employees" of the Revised Final Offer.
VL	Inside Sales Positions *
The parties agree that the Inside Sales issue shall be resolved through the current NLRB unfair labor practice proceedings.
VIL The Globe recognizes that the Unionwill lose certain shift payments for the BGEA/Globc Health Fund and will make a one-time payment to the Fund of the equivalent dollar amount of two (2). years multiplied by the number of employees exempted multiplied by the shifts that would have been worked multiplied by S3 per shift as a quid pro quo for resolution of the UC exclusions as referenced herein. The Globe calculates this payment to be $37,440 based on excluding certain BGEA bargaining unit employees. This payment will be made at the time this UC agreement is signed and implemented.	/ .•
181
VIII. The Globe agrees to make a one time payment of $50,000 to the BGEA/ Globe Health Fund in exchange for the simultaneous settlement of this unit clarification.	.....

RE:	UC Exclusion of Associate Software Analyst
Dear Bob,
This letter will confirm the parties understanding regarding the exempt exclusion of six (6) Associate Software Analysts in Information Services from (he bargaining unit pursuant to the Unit Clarification Settlement Agreement.
It is agreed and understood that the Globe will designate up to six (6) such exemptions from the existing group of Senior Systems Analysts. Such names will be furnished to the Union prior to the employees being so notified. Any employee so selected will be offered exempt status on a voluntary basis.
This move is being made because some of the work performed by-. Senior Systems Analysts is confidential in nature and, thus, it is more appropriate to liave exempt employees perform such work. In addition, persons filling Associate Software Analyst positions will continue to perform the same type of design, analysis and programming functions as have historically been performed by Senior Systems Analysts as well as those duties typical of exempt Software Analysts.
