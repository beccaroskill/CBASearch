article III

the work, shall be scheduled overtime in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 4(c) above.
(j)	In the event an insufficient number of employees accept overtime in accordance with subparagraph (i) above, employees assigned in other classifications who are capable of performing the work will be scheduled.

10.	Classification descriptions are of a composite-nature and describe typical and normal job-duties. : These duties are characteristic of the classification and are not intended as listing or describing all of the. work operations or tasks done within the classification.. Therefore,;a^classification description is not to be construed, so as to restrict the Employer to assign work to.employees; nor to grant or concede an employee any right to ref use. to perform assigned work for the reason that such work is not described specifically in the classification description for his classification, but is not to include machines or work.operations described in other
1	classification descriptions and not in that for his
I	classification.	.	.

ARTICLE IV
11.	When work operations or job duties are not adequately or specifically described, such work operations or job duties shall be appraised and classified as belonging- under the most appropriate classification description, by considering the relative degree of complexity or level of difficulty of said work operations or job duties in comparison with comparable work operations or job duties described in the ''Typical Tasks" section of the classification descriptions. It is understood that a classification description for a job is'to be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a specification of job standards, which are definitive of the job requirements of that particular classification.
12.	The normal duties of any employee may include recordkeeping associated with the classification and assistance to others.	1
13.	The classification description being of a composite nature, it therefore is not required that an employee perform all of the work described in a classification description in order to be classified there under. Similarly, an employee shall not be classified under a classification description by reason of his performing infrequently or on rare occasions an isolated or ..singular duty-described -in a classification description. An employee is required to perform the duties set forth in a classification description under that degree or amount of-supervision, guidance or "instruction which is considered usual and normal for that particular job.
14.	When a work'operation or function is described in the same manner for more than'one classification, such work operation or function shall not be used to determine the proper classification of an employee. Such operation or function is not a distinguishing element,- but stated for descriptive purposes or because it is such an integral and necessary part of the job that its amission would be undesirable from the standpoint of completeness.	>	■
SECTION G.	Red Circled Rates	-	.
Effective with the signing of this agreement any employee who is currently paid an hourly rate that is above the rate range maximum for the classification assigned will be considered as having a "Red Circled Rate."

SECTION B.	Retirement Plan Improvements
Effective January 1, 1988, the following changes were made in the Retirement Plan contingent upon and subject to obtaining and retaining such approval of the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue and all other Federal and State governmental agencies as the Employer may find necessary to qualify for tax exemption under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or other laws:
1.	Monthly "Normal Retirement Benefits" under the Plan for participants separating from the Service after October 23, 1987 and retiring effective on or after January 1, 1988 are computed as the greater of:	■
■	(a) Career Average formula - One twenty-fourth (1/24)
of the participant's contributions to the Plan plus credited monthly past service credits for contributions and service prior to January 1, 1988; and one percent (1%) of the first $3,600 of Plan Compensation plus-two percent (2%) of Plan Compensation in excess of $3,600 for each year of contributions and service from January 1, 1988.
(b)	Minimum. Benefit formula - $13.00 per'month plus one-half of one percent (1/2%) of the participant's five (5) years average monthly compensation for the five (5) highest of his or her last ten (10) qualifying twelve (12) Accounting Month periods as a contributing member of the Plan including those years for which past service was credited, or
(c)	Effective for participants retiring effective on or after January 1, 1991, the final Average Compensation formula will be one and three quarters percent (1-3/4%) of the participant's five (5) years average monthly compensation for the five (5) highest of his or her last ten (10) qualifying
■ twelve (12) Accounting Month periods offset by one . and one-half percent (1-1/2%) of the estimated ■ "Primary Insurance Amount" determined under the Federal Social Security Act for each year that the participant contributed to the Plan including those years for which past service was credited. The maximum offset is fifty percent (50%) of the
-<84
ARTICLE XVI
estimated monthly "Primary Insurance Amount" benefit.
2.	Effective January 1, 1988, employees were permitted to continue to contribute to the Retirement Plan after age 65. Employees who are already over age 65 and who had their contributions stopped because of the attainment of age 65 may again enroll and begin contributing. Employees who attain age 65 after January 1, 1988, will automatically continue participation in the Plan,
There will be no retroactivity and there will be no "make up" contributions permitted for employees over age 65 who again participate in the Plan.
3.	Effective January 1, 1991, a non-contributory benefit will be provided for all employees hired after January 1, 1991 and for existing employees who choose the non-contributory option prior to December 22, 1990, The non-contributory benefit, for those participating in it will.supersede the benefit described in Section B, paragraph 1 of this Article. The non-contributory benefit formula will be:
(a)	One and one-half percent (1-1/2%) of the participant's five (5) years average monthly compensation for the five (5) highest of his or her last ten (10) qualifying twelve (12) accounting month periods (final average monthly compensation) for the first thirty-five (35) years of service plus one-half percent (1/2%) of the final average monthly compensation for service over thirty-five (35) years offset by six-tenths (6/10) of one percent (1%) of each individual's covered compensation using a thirty-five (35) year average of the annual maximum Social Security wage base.
(b)	The non-contributory benefit will have different qualifications for normal and early retirement, no automatic cost-of-living payment, and no eligibility for company-paid medical. Effective January 1, 2000 the plan was amended to contain a minimum pension benefit formula of $29 per month per year of service, subject to the provisions of the plan regarding normal and early retirement. Effective for employees retiring on or after January 1, 2005, this minimum pension benefit will increase to.$30. Effective for employees retiring on or after January 1, 2006 this minimum pension benefit will increase to $31. Details of the
