§8 I	f the grievance is not resolved pursuant to the foregoing procedure, the Union may submit the grievance within thirty (30) days after completion of Step 3 of the grievance procedure to the American Arbitration Association for selection of an impartial arbitrator in accordance with the Association’s procedures. Grievances must be submitted separately and may not be combined for purposes of arbitration, except that grievances based on the same or substantially similar facts may be combined. The American Arbitration Association shall direct each grievance to be heard in rotation in order from the following list of arbitrators: Lawrence T. Holden, Jr.; Philip J. Dunn; Roberta L. Golick; Marcia L. Greenbaum; Tim Bornstein and Richard Grant Higgins. Should any of these arbitrators decline an appointment or be unable to offer a hearing date within six months from submission (three months for suspension and/or discharge cases), the grievance shall be referred in turn to the next arbitrator on the list. In suspension or discharge cases, briefs, if any, must be filed within two weeks after the close of the hearing and the arbitrator’s decision shall be issued within 30 days of receipt of the briefs. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding. All costs and fees of the arbitrator and the American Arbitration Association shall be paid equally by the Hospital
18
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
and the Union.
§ 9	The Union’s failure to submit a grievance for arbitration to the American Arbitration Association within thirty (30) days after completion of Step 3 of the grievance procedure shall be deemed as a final resolution of the grievance on the basis of acceptance of the Hospital’s Step 3 answer.
§ 10	The arbitrator shall have no power to alter or amend any of the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall have no authority to substitute his or her judgment for the Hospital’s regarding professional standards or patient care procedures. The arbitrator may not overturn Hospital decisions in discipline cases regarding standards of professional conduct unless it is clear that the Hospital’s actions were arbitrary and capricious.
§ 11	All time limits in this grievance and arbitration procedure are of the essence and may be waived only in writing signed by authorized representatives of the Hospital and the Union.
Article 14	Hours of Work, Schedules and Breaks

§ 7	Employees scheduled to work six to eight hours shall receive one twenty-minute paid break. Employees scheduled to work more than eight hours but less than ten hours will be provided an unpaid meal period of one-half hour and a paid break of fifteen minutes. Employees scheduled to work a ten hour shift will be provided an unpaid meal period of one-half hour, a paid break of fifteen minutes, and, by mutual agreement between the employee and the supervisor, an additional fifteen minute paid break. Employees scheduled to work a twelve hour shift will be provided an unpaid meal period of one-half hour and two fifteen minute paid breaks. Employees are to be completely relieved of duty in order for the meal period to be unpaid and employees may leave their work areas. If there is a significant interruption in the meal period that results in the employee performing work, the employee will be provided a substitute meal period or paid in lieu thereof.
§ 8	A work schedule shall be posted at least two weeks in advance of the first day on which
20
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
the schedule is to be effective. Specific work schedules for each department or unit/section shall be prepared covering a period of at least four weeks. For unplanned circumstances such as resignations or absences, when changes to the posted schedule are necessary, they would affect employees in inverse order of seniority among the available, qualified employees on a rotating basis. Such changes would be made only after every s	effort has been made to provide alternate means of coverage including, but not limited to
the solicitation of volunteers, assignment of per diems or assignment of permanent floats.
*	§ 9 During the life of this Agreement it may be necessary for the employer to permanently
change the regular shifts, assignment to departments, units or shifts and/or hours of shifts as they existed at the time this Agreement was executed. No such changes will be made without notice to and opportunity for discussions with the Union. Any employee affected by such changes will receive at least three weeks, notice thereof. In the event that a change affects less than all of the employees in a particular department or unit, seniority among qualified employees will apply in selecting those employees who will be affected
i
by the change. Any changes in an employee’s shift hours will be limited to hours falling within the definition of shifts in this Article. Nothing herein shall be construed to modify any requirements of this Agreement dealing with rotation or floating.
§ 10	Employees may be offered the opportunity to be called off in situations where there is a drop in the census and/or the acuity level on their unit. The option of being called off will be offered to qualified employees on a rotating basis in order of unit seniority. Employees who elect to be called off may have the option to float off the unit or take vacation/holiday time or unpaid time off.
§ 11	Employees who return from a leave of	absence of greater than six (6) weeks will be
placed on the voluntary call-off (voluntary time off) rotation list as if the last date of their
|	leave was the date of their last voluntary	call-off. Employees who return from a leave of
:	absence of less than six (6) weeks will	not have their place on the voluntary call-off
'	rotation list adjusted.
Article 15 Shift Rotation
§ 1 The Hospital shall seek permanent night and evening shift employees in an effort to
21
' — —..—..................-. LI I.III.T.. .
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
reduce shift rotation (the temporary reassignment for employees from their regular shifts to another shift). On units/departments presently requiring rotation, if a day/rotator position becomes vacant and the Hospital decides to fill that vacancy, a permanent night or evening position shall be posted first. If there are no successful bidders or qualified outside candidates for the permanent night or evening position within seven days, the Hospital may post the day/rotator position. The Hospital shall advertise all permanent night and evening shift vacancies not filled through the posting process. The Hospital shall not be required to advertise such vacancies more often than once every month.
§ 2	The Hospital agrees to keep rotation to a minimum and to provide employees with as much advance notice of required rotation as is feasible. Employees will not be required to rotate more than 50 percent of their hours measured by four-week time blocks. Employees will not be required to rotate to two different shifts during the same workweek.
§ 3	When it becomes necessary to assign unscheduled rotation, the employer agrees to seek volunteers first.
§ 4	By mutual agreement with their supervisors, employees in the same unit may agree to switch rotation assignments.
§ 5	Every effort will be made to avoid scheduling rotation which results in an employee rotating to the evening shift and having to return to work the next morning on the day shift.
§ 6	When employees are required to accept an unscheduled rotation to another shift, their regular weekly work schedule will not be reduced to offset the hours on the Totation shift unless the employee so requests.
§ 7	Permanent evening shift employees and permanent night shift employees shall not be scheduled to rotate to any shift.
§ 8	Mandatory rotations shall be assigned as follows, provided qualified employees are available:
22
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
A.	Any rotations necessary shall first be assigned to employees with five (5) years, 364 days or less seniority up to a maximum of 50% of their scheduled hours.
B.	Any further rotations that are necessary shall be evenly distributed among remaining staff with six (6) to ten (10) years, 364 days seniority up to a maximum (	of 50% of their scheduled hours.
C.	Any further rotations that are necessary shall be evenly distributed among >	remaining staff with eleven (11) to fifteen (15) years, 364 days seniority up to a
maximum of 50% of their scheduled hours.
D.	Any further rotations that are necessary shall be evenly distributed among remaining staff with sixteen (16) to twenty (20) years seniority up to a maximum of 50% of their scheduled hours.
E.	Any further rotations that are necessary shall be evenly distributed among remaining staff with greater than twenty (20) years seniority up to a maximum of I	50% of their scheduled hours.
§ 9	In the Operating Room, the above schedules shall apply except that in “A” employees with five (5) years or less seniority will only be required to rotate 50% of the rotations required. [
|	§ 10 To the extent paragraphs A through E above result in an odd number of rotation shifts,
the odd shift will be assigned to the junior employee.
Article 16	Float Districts
§ 1	The term floating refers to the temporary reassignment on a daily basis of an employee from his or her regular department or unit to another department or unit on the same shift. The Hospital may require employee(s) to float within the float districts when the
I	department or unit to which they are floated is understaffed or when the department or
unit from which they are floated is overstaffed.
§ 2	Floated employee(s) may not be assigned duties or tasks for which they have not been oriented and trained.
23
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
§ 3	Floating assignments will be distributed on a fair and equitable basis.
§ 4	Registered nurses and LPNs may be assigned within the following areas and may be assigned outside of these areas on a voluntary basis only.

§ 2	All materials placed in an employee’s personnel file shall be deemed to be confidential and no such material shall be released to persons outside the Hospital without prior written authorization of the employee to whom the material pertains except in response to duly authorized government requests or legal process in which case the employee will be notified unless it is a confidential government inquiry.
§ 3	Upon request of the employee, letters of recommendation shall be made available to the employee prior to their submission to a prospective employer. The employee at his/her option may elect not to have a letter of recommendation forwarded to a prospective employer.
§4 N	o material shall be placed in an employee’s personnel file unless the employee is aware of the material except for routine payroll, benefits or other such material.
§ 5	Disciplinary material shall be removed from an employee’s personnel file after twelve (12) months provided no additional disciplinary action has occurred.
§ 6	Employees who have successfully completed the probationary period shall be considered permanent employees and shall not be disciplined, suspended, reduced in rank, discharged or terminated except for just cause. In the event that an employee is discharged or terminated the employee and the Union shall be given a statement in writing setting forth the reason(s) for said termination.
§ 7	Each employee shall be evaluated at least annually by his/her supervisor. The evaluation shall be in writing.
§ 8	The employee shall receive a copy of the evaluation and shall have the right to meet with the evaluating supervisor to discuss the evaluation. In the event that the supervisor
25
j
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
believes the evaluation to be unsatisfactory, the supervisor shall offer constructive criticisms and make specific suggestions as to the manner in which perceived deficiencies may be corrected.
§ 9	An employee may request that a Union representative be present during any investigatory interview by a supervisor or other representative of the administration that the employee reasonably believes may result in disciplinary action. In any such interview, before an employee is questioned about his/her conduct, the employee will be told that a purpose of the interview is to review his/her conduct.
Article 18 Employment, Posting and Transfer Practices
§ 1	Employees who have served a total of six (6) months of continuous service in their current position and who are not subject to serious or repeated written discipline within the past twelve (12) months will be considered for posted vacancies. The six month requirement may be mutually waived between an employee and the Hospital and shall not apply to transfers which affect only the shift of the employee.
§ 2	Full-time, regular part-time and per diem bargaining unit permanent vacancies which are not filled by adjusting hours or shifts of current employees will be posted on Hospital bulletin boards as well as on the unit (Registered Nurse Bargaining Unit) or in the department (Technical Bargaining Unit) in which the vacancy exists. Vacancies will be posted Hospital-wide for seven days. Vacancies will be posted promptly, no later than two weeks after the Hospital makes a decision to fill a vacancy. The Hospital will continue to post vacancies throughout its facilities. The Hospital will give fair consideration to employee requests to add or drop hours.
Postings shall contain an “apply by” date. Applicants will be considered from those who apply during the initial seven-day posting period in accordance with Section 6. If no applicant is selected, the vacancy will be posted Lifespan systemwide for subsequent periods with applicants similarly required to respond to each posting period. During the Lifespan systemwide posting period, the applicable provisions in the Master Agreement referenced to in Article 43 shall control.
26
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
§ 3	Positions outside the bargaining unit that are non-physician positions below the Department Head level will be posted with the understanding that it is within the Hospital’s discretion as to whom to consider or select for such positions.
§ 4	The posting shall identify the job, the shift, the hours to be worked and the unit. Applicants, upon request, will be provided a copy of the job description which sets forth qualifications and requirements.
§ 5	Applicants must apply to the Employment Office within the seven-day posting period. Employees who are absent due to sickness, vacation or leave of absence may request, in writing, that they be mailed by the Hospital the current list of posted openings. Subsequent written requests may be made for the duration of such absence. In order to be selected, applicants must be able to report for work within the operational needs of the department. Employees may initially inquire about a posted opening without submitting a transfer evaluation. The Hospital may require the completion of a transfer evaluation before a position is awarded. The employee must complete the transfer evaluation within 5 days of the request.
§ 6(	a) Technical Bargaining Unit - Applicants for the vacancy will be given preference by seniority in order of department, then seniority group, then Hospital-wide except for the department of Diagnostic Imaging, which shall be by seniority group, department, then Hospital-wide. LPN vacancies in the Ambulatory Clinics will be awarded to the most senior, qualified bargaining unit LPN with the applicable adult or pediatric background. In order to be considered part of a department/section for purposes of bidding, an 1	employee must have been in the department/section for at least one year and have worked
i	in the department/section for at least 1,000 hours. Applicants for a posted position within
their current unit/section will be presumed qualified for that position. Outside applicants i.
r	will not be offered employment if any qualified Hospital employee applies for and
accepts a posted position. Between qualified applicants with equal experience, skills, abilities and disciplinary/performance counseling records, seniority will be determinative. Supervisors who bid for a posted vacancy will be credited with the experience accrued only through the first-line supervisory level.

§ 8	An employee who accepts a posted position may return to their previous position within thirty (30) days provided that position has remained vacant.
§ 9	Relatives of department heads, managers, supervisors or any persons acting as supervisors shall not be employed under the direct supervision of such managerial personnel or in positions for which a relative has responsibility for approving performance, promotion, salary or disciplinary actions.
§ 10	In cases of involuntary transfer, employees will be selected in reverse order of seniority.
§ 11	Within ten days after the seven-day posting period, applicants will be notified in writing as to whether or not they were qualified and the qualified applicant(s) will be awarded the position. The applicant will be notified whether the Hospital withdrew the vacancy, whether he/she was not qualified for the position or whether a more senior employee was selected.
§12	Vacancies of one hundred (100) days or less may be deemed temporary and not subject to posting requirements. In exceptional cases such as extended sick leaves, the one hundred (100) days may be extended. Unless so extended, if the position is to be continued
28
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
beyond one hundred (100) days, it shall be posted pursuant to this Article.
§ 13	If a bargaining unit employee fills a temporary position, he/she will continue to be covered by all of the terms of this Agreement. Regular employees who voluntarily fill i temporary vacancies shall retain their right to return to the position they left.
§ 14	In the event that the Hospital determines that a newly transferred employee is unable to satisfactorily perform the duties of her/his new position, such employee may be returned to her/his previous position, or if the previous position has been filled, to an equivalent vacant position within ninety (90) days of the date s/he is transferred into the new position, provided that:
•	the employee was notified in writing after no more than sixty (60) days in the new position as to any performance deficiencies and required corrective action,
•	the employee’s return to her/his former position shall not displace any other employee, and
•	the employee’s return to an equivalent vacant position shall not supercede the bidding :	rights of any other employee.

Article 19 Layoffs and Recalls
<	§ 1 Seniority, as defined in Article 11, shall apply to the selection of employees for layoffs
i
'	and recall therefrom.
I
|	§ 2 When it becomes necessary to lay off employees within the bargaining unit, both the
'	Union and the affected employees shall be notified at least seven (7) days in advance.
§	3 In the event of layoff, employees in the affected seniority groups shall be laid off in the following order:
First, all temporary employees
29
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
Second, all probationary employees by inverse order of hiring
Third, regular full- and part-time employees by inverse order of seniority
§	4 When the employer determines the positions affected, it will notify the employees holding positions subject to layoff and advise them of any vacant positions. If vacancies exist within the same seniority group, same shift and with the same scheduled hours, within 48 hours those employees must elect to take a vacant position. An employee who is subject to layoff shall have preference for posted vacancies on her/his shift and within her/his seniority group over an employee who has unit preference but who is less senior than the employee subject to layoff.
§5	If no vacant position is available, the affected employee may exercise bumping rights and must bump the most junior employee on his/her shift in his/her seniority group who has same regularly scheduled hours as the laid off employee, provided he/she is senior to the employee bumped.
§6	If there is no such junior person, the laid off employee may bump (a) the most junior employee on his/her shift in his/her seniority group regardless of hours, or (b) bump the most junior employee in his/her seniority group on either of the other two shifts who has the same scheduled hours as the laid off employee, provided he/she is senior to the employee bumped. The employee must choose (a) or (b) within 48 hours.
§7	If the laid off employee cannot exercise bumping rights under the above he/she must bump the most junior in his/her seniority group on the other two shifts regardless of scheduled hours, provided he/she is senior to the employee bumped.
§8	In the event of multiple layoffs, when more than one employee in the same seniority group and shift are laid off, choices of bumping will be exercised by seniority. The most senior of the laid off employees will choose first which of the junior employees among those subject to bumping he/she will bump. Then the next most senior laid off employee will choose.
§	9 Employees may bump under the provisions of this Article only if the layoff is for one
30
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
week or more. Layoffs of less than one week will be used only when necessary in exceptional cases and not in a repetitive manner to avoid bumping. Employees may not bump into a position which would require formal orientation or training of more than four weeks, in which case the affected employee may be eligible to bump a junior employee in the same seniority group (if any) not requiring such orientation or training, j	First-line supervisors bumping into a staff position shall do so under the same process as
other employees under this Article.
'	§ 10	Prior to the layoff of any bargaining unit employee, employees in the area to be impacted
by a layoff will be notified in an effort to seek volunteers for layoff or reduction in hours. In response to this notification, or at any point in the procedure under this article, the Hospital and employee may mutually agree that the employee be laid off or have their hours reduced.
§ 11 Severance benefits: Employees who have been laid off and elect not to be on recall status shall receive a minimum of four (4) weeks severance pay plus one (1) week of severance for every year of service, up to a maximum of sixteen (16) weeks of severance. Employees who are 40 years of age or older will receive an additional one week of severance pay for every year of service up to a maximum of an additional ten (10) weeks. The severance benefit of employees who accept positions that are budgeted for 20% or more fewer hours or are at a lower pay rate will be placed in a severance bank. Each week for a period of up to one year or until the severance bank is exhausted, whichever is sooner, the employee will draw down the severance bank to supplement her/his base hourly rate and/or paid hours to duplicate the weekly earnings of the employee’s previous ?	position (based on the employee’s base hourly rate and budgeted hours of the position
accepted). Severance benefits will not count as time worked for the determination of J	benefits eligibility. Severance benefits will be paid through the normal payroll process
with deductions taken as appropriate.
An employee subject to layoff shall not be entitled to severance benefits if s/he declines a comparable vacant position that is available to her/him. For this purpose only, a comparable position shall be defined as:
31
■
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
-	same classification
-	equal or greater base hourly rate
-	budgeted weekly hours greater than 80% of the employee’s budgeted weekly hours immediately prior to layoff, but in no case less than 20 hours per week
-	at least 75% of the scheduled hours of the vacant position are within the hours of the employee’s previously scheduled workshift, and
-	not requiring more than four weeks of formal orientation or training
An employee who declines an opportunity to bump under this Article shall not be rendered ineligible for severance.
An employee who is receiving severance pay under this Section, and who begins employment within another Lifespan facility before severance pay has ended, shall immediately be rendered ineligible for any further severance payments.
Rights of Employees Bumped
§ 12	Bumped employees will have the same bumping rights as the laid off employee.
§ 13	Employees who have been laid off shall be recalled (re-employed) within their seniority groups in the inverse order of their layoff.
§ 14	Employees will be notified of recall from layoff by certified mail and shall have ten (10) days from the date of the postmark to respond.
§ 15	Employees who have been laid off shall continue to receive the benefits of Article 38 for a period of ninety (90) days following the effective date of the layoff. Thereafter, employees who are laid off may continue to participate in the medical-hospital plan by paying to the employer the full cost of the plan for a period of one year following their layoffs.
§ 16	Employees who have been laid off shall remain on the recall list for a period equal to the
32

1
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
employee’s continuous length of service at the time of layoff or twelve (12) months, whichever is shorter.
§ 17	Employees on layoff shall not be denied further consideration for recall (re-employment) by declining to accept re-employment on a different shift or with different weekly hours than the position from which they were laid off.

§ 3	Per diem employees will be called off after employees having regularly scheduled hours have first been given that opportunity, provided there are sufficient, qualified employees remaining to perform the available work.
§ 4	Per diem employees who are offered the opportunity but who fail to meet their work obligations for a period of sixty days may be terminated and will lose all previously accrued seniority. Per diem employees who do not work for four consecutive months or more for any reason may be terminated and will lose all previously accrued seniority.

In each cost center that employs Per Diem A and Per Diem B employees, available hours will be equitably distributed by the manager among Per Diem A and Per Diem B employees to accommodate the work requirements of Per Diem A and Per Diem B set forth in this Agreement. Provided, however, that Per Diem A employees will not be assigned more than 24 hours per four week period, until Per Diem B employees have been assigned 32 per week per four week period, at which point Per Diem A employees shall have preference for any remaining hours, which shall be equitably distributed.

Additional SQCs shall be established with the mutual consent of both the Hospital and the Union. It is understood
72
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
and agreed that SQCs will be piloted in Hasbro Children’s 4, Jane Brown N-3, and General Radiology. Each SQC shall consist of an equal number of representatives appointed by the Union and the Hospital. It is expected that the Committee size will be based on unit size/patient volume, and shall generally not exceed six representatives, if appropriate. Bargaining unit SQC members shall be paid their regular hourly rate for attendance at SQC meetings, the frequency and duration of which shall be determined by the Committee.
§ 1(	a) The parties to this Agreement recognize the need for and continuation of a SQC Steering Committee. The Steering Committee shall consist of an equal number of representatives appointed by the Union and the Hospital, unless otherwise agreed to by mutual consent. The purpose of the Steering Committee will be to review the work of the SQCs on a scheduled basis, manage barriers that inhibit the SQCs effectiveness, serve as a mechanism and forum for organizational learning, prioritize and allocate resources for the SQCs, and facilitate communication and coordination between units. The Steering Committee will assist in the development of hospital Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will then guide the development of SQC KPIs. Members of the Steering Committee will serve as a facilitator and a resource to the established SQCs.
§ 2	The purpose of each SQC shall be to review, revise, and/or recommend “core” staffing levels, i.e. the number and type of staff that shall ordinarily be assigned on each shift, as well as to develop recommendations for variable staffing. Among the factors that shall be considered by the SQC shall be census, length of stay, patient needs, acuity, safety, licensure requirements, skill mix and experience job descriptions, workloads, overtime patterns, and available resources. The SQC shall be further guided by applicable laws, regulations, and/or professional organization standards. The SQCs will report back to the Steering Committee their recommendations and findings. The SQCs are expected to develop work plans with specific actions, outcomes and timelines as well as unit KPIs and review the work plans and KPIs with the Steering Committee before final adoption..
§ 3	Each SQC shall have access to relevant information, such as, by way of example, budgeted and actual daily census, length of stay, and acuity; hours worked; voluntary and
73
Rhode Island Hospital/UNAP
mandatory overtime, vacation, sick, and leave hours.
§ 4	Compliance with this Article shall be enforceable through contractual grievance and arbitration procedures; however, Hospital decisions regarding staffing and/or budgets shall not be grievable or arbitrable based upon this Article.
§ 5	At time of establishment, members of the Steering Committee and members of the SQC ■
shall receive eight (8) hours of training, which shall be provided by a trainer(s) mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Hospital. Employees shall be paid their regular hourly rate of pay for time spent in such training. The training will consist of mutually agreed upon content which supports the mission of the SQCs as outlined in this Article.
