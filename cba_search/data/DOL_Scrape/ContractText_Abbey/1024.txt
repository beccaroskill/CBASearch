IRON WORKERS’ DISTRICT COUNCIL OF THE STATE OF TEXAS
representative for and on behalf of
ALL OUTSIDE ERECTION LOCAL UNIONS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS
This Agreement is entered into between the Iron Workers’ District Council of the State of Texas for and on behalf of all affiliated outside erection Local Unions in the State of Texas of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers (affiliated with the AFL-CIO) (Local Union Numbers 66,84,135,263 and 482) hereinafter referred to as the “Union” and the Texas Iron Workers Employers’ Association, hereinafter referred to as the
“Employer.”
RECOGNITION
The Union is recognized as the bargaining representative in the areas covered by the now existing jurisdiction of all outside erection Local Unions in the State of Texas for all Iron Workers and other labor that it may lawfully represent, whom are employed by Employers signatory to the Standard Form Agreement.
The Union recognizes the Texas Iron Workers Employers’ Association, on behalf of the firms that have legally assigned their bargaining rights to the Association, as the bargaining representative in the areas covered by the now existing jurisdiction of all outside erection Local Unions in the State of Texas.
PREAMBLE
This Agreement is entered into by collective bargaining to prevent strikes and lock-outs and to facilitate peaceful adjustments of grievances and disputes between Employer and the Union in this trade and to prevent waste, unnecessary and avoidable delays, and expense, and so far as possible to provide for Labor’s continuous employment, such employment to be in accordance with the conditions herein set forth and to be at wages herein agreed upon; also, that stable conditions may prevail in the building industry and building costs may be as low as possible, consistent with fair wages and conditions, and further, the establishment of the necessary procedures by which these ends may be accomplished. In order to economically and efficiently serve the building public, it is important to have experienced, skilled workers. Employers recognize all outside erection Local Unions in the State of Texas as a source of such skilled manpower and they will therefore use it as a source when in need of Employees and all outside erection Local Unions in the State of Texas agree that when Employers request Employees, they will exert every effort to supply skilled Employees. The Employer shall be the sole judge of any applicant’s qualifications. The Employer may exercise his right to hire and to reject applicants for employment without regard to Union membership or non-membership, race, color, national origin, creed, sex or religion. Employer and Union agree to
1
abide by all laws applicable to this contract, including executive orders and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.
CRAFT JURISDICTION
The work of the Union and other labor that the Union may lawfully represent shall be all items of work that are claimed as spelled out in the Constitution of the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers, Article TV, entitled, “Jurisdiction.” That complete wording shall be considered as part of this Agreement as though set forth herein at length.
It is understood and agreed that Employers party to this Agreement shall not sign a stipulation to be bound by the terms of the Agreement establishing the Impartial Jurisdictional Disputes Board nor be bound by its future decisions. Any such stipulation that previously may have been entered into on or on behalf of the Employer is rescinded by execution of this Agreement. It is further understood that the parties to this Agreement shall not submit any dispute to the Impartial Jurisdictional Disputes Board.
In the event a jurisdictional dispute shall arise, such dispute shall be settled in accordance with the regulations of any agency established by law or mutual agreement to settle such disputes. In any such mutually agreed upon procedure shall include all of the Unions involved in the dispute and the Employer. The initial steps in such a mutually agreed upon procedure shall include:
A meeting at the jobsite between the Business Agents of the Unions involved and the Employer. If the dispute is not resolved, there shall be a meeting between the international representatives of the Union involved. The participants in such meetings shall consider (a) Decisions of Record, (b) Agreements of Record, (c) Area Practice, and (d) Efficiency (craft most suited to perform work involved).
There shall be no strikes, work stoppages, or other interference with the work by reason of jurisdictional dispute.
TERRITORY
The territory covered by this Agreement shall be the territorial jurisdiction of all outside erection Local Unions in the State of Texas as represented on the attached territorial listings.
HIRING AND TRANSFER OF IRON WORKERS
The Employer agrees to hire local Employees in any territory where work is being performed or is to be performed except that the Employer has the right to move fifty (50%) percent of his required Employees into any Local Union’s jurisdiction coming under the District Council. The second individual hired will act as Steward and one to one thereafter shall be obtained from the Local Union in that area the work is being performed. An Employer may, however, on work of a technical nature, move three (3) Employees into any Iron Workers’ Local Union jurisdiction coming under this District Council. It is mutually agreed that the Employer’s right to bring in three (3) Employees into a Local Union area is limited to work requiring unusual level of skills or work that is of a technical nature that rank and file Iron Workers from the Hall could not perform. This does
2
k
not apply to normal erection and installation of rebar, structural, ornamental, precast or miscellaneous/rigging. It is understood that the Employer will be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) call out. The Iron Workers being transferred into another jurisdiction do have their same obligation of clearing into that Local Union. If a Local Union is unable to fill the request of the Employer for local Employees within a forty-eight (48) hour period after such request for Employees (Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays excepted), the Employer may employ non-resident Iron Workers.
WORK HOURS PER DAY
Section 1. Eight (8) hours shall constitute a day’s work between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., inclusive with the starting time at the Employer’s option. Lunchtime will be determined by agreement with the Employees on the job and the Employer’s representative.
In the event the job is shut down for any reason beyond the Employer’s control for a minimum of four (4) hours, then Saturday may, at the option of the Employer, be worked as make-up day at the straight time rate of pay not to exceed eight (8) hours or forty (40) hours per week. If determined, between the Employer and the Local Union and in advance of the project commencing, that certain project conditions may prevail whereby a make-up day must be scheduled, then the Employees will be required to work the scheduled make-up day.
Section 2. At the option of the Employer, the standard workweek shall be an established four (4) consecutive ten (10) hour workdays exclusive of the daily thirty (30) minute lunch period. Forty (40) hours per week shall constitute a workweek, Monday through Thursday, inclusive.
In the event the job is shut down for any reason beyond the Employer’s control for a minimum of five (5) hours, then Friday may, at the option of the Employer, be worked as a make-up day at the straight time rate of pay not to exceed ten (10) hours or forty (40) hours per week. If determined, between the Employer and the Local Union and in advance of the project commencing, that certain project conditions may prevail whereby a make-up day must be scheduled, then, the Employees will be required to work the scheduled make-up day.
Section 3, It is agreed that if the Employer exercises its option for a make-up day regardless of which shift is worked, then the Employer will provide work for a full day, weather permitting.
Section 4.	It is agreed that if a make-up day is scheduled to make up a holiday that falls on a day during the normal work week, then all work performed on the make-up day will be paid at the rate of time and one-half. At the option of the Employer, the work schedule may change from a five (5) day per week and eight (8) hour per day schedule to a four (4) day per week and ten (10) hour per day schedule during a holiday week. In the event an Employee cannot work the ten (10) hour schedule during such holiday week, he/she shall not be penalized by the Employer.
3
Section 5.	The Employer may, if job conditions dictate, designate the thirty (30) minute lunch period any time between the third (3rd) and fifth (5th) hour of employment.
Section 6.	All premium pay hours (excluding Holidays) worked under the terms of this Agreement shall receive one and one-half times the regular hourly rate.
Section 7.	The Union and the Employer recognize that it is in the best interest not to work more than ten (10) hours in any given day for productivity and safety.
Section 8. Under no circumstances can an Employer work his regular Employees forty (40) hours, then terminate their week and hire new Employees to work the remainder of the week in order to avoid paying overtime.
Section 9. Unless specifically limited by this Agreement, it is expressly understood that overtime is only paid after an Employee has worked in excess of ten (10) hours in any one (1) day or forty (40) hours in any one (1) week; thus it is conceivable to have Employees working on the same jobsite during the same day with some Employees being compensated at premium pay and some Employees being compensated at straight time.
FLEXIBLE STARTING TIME PROVISION
Flexible starting time may be established at the option of the Employer when conditions exist that are beyond the Employer’s control and dictate a starting time that would normally come under the Premium Pay provisions of the Agreement. Premium pay days are Sundays and Holidays.

MOST FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE
It is clearly the intent of the District Council that there will be equity and fairness to all Employers signatured to this Agreement and it is the intent of this Agreement to establish uniform wages and conditions in each of the Local Union territories within the State of Texas.
The District Council acknowledges that it will not allow one or more Employers to have special terms and conditions more advantageous than any other signatory Employer. However, the Employers recognize that reduction in wages or conditions to fit a certain classification of work such as heavy and highway or maintenance would not affect the overall integrity of this collective bargaining Agreement.
It is also recognized by the Employer that modifications in one geographical area of either wages or conditions would not constitute the necessity for similar changes in other geographical areas of the District Council.

He/she shall see that the provisions of this Agreement are complied with and report to the Union the true conditions and fact. The Steward shall promptly take care of injured workers and accompany them to their homes or to a hospital as the case may require, without any loss of time and report the injury to the proper officers of the Union.

In the event that the two (2) so appointed arbitrators are unable within two (2) days to agree upon the third arbitrator, they shall jointly request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to furnish a panel of five (5) names from which the third member shall be selected. If the two arbitrators cannot agree upon a third member of the Board within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of these five (5) names by the Board, the Union representative on the Board shall strike two (2) names, the Employer representative shall strike two (2) names, and the person whose name then remains shall be immediately asked to serve as the third member of the Board. The decision of the Board of Arbitration shall be handed down within two (2) days after the selection of the third member and the decision of the Board of Arbitration shall be final and binding upon both parties.
The Board of Arbitration shall have jurisdiction over all questions involving the interpretation and application of any section of this Agreement. It shall not, however, be empowered to handle negotiations for a new Agreement, changes in the wage scale or jurisdictional disputes.

16
affiliated Union which has been authorized by the International of that Union, the Central Labor Council or the Building and Construction Trades Council.
The Union and the Employer recognize the fact that work stoppages can be a detriment to the Contractor and/or owner in the bidding and/or negotiation of projects. The Union and Employer further recognize that other persons create work stoppages over which the Union and employer have no control. For these reasons, the Union and Employer reserve the right after mutual agreement, between the President of the District Council and the involved Employees), to continue working on the project until its completion.
