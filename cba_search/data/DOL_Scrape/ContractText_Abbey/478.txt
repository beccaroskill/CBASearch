THIS AMENDED AGREEMENT, dated January 1, 2003, is entered into by and between the SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON COMPANY, hereinafter called ‘'Company" and LOCAL UNION NO. 47, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, A.F.L.-C.I.O., hereinafter called “Union.”
PREAMBLE
The Company is a public service agency charged under the laws of the United States of America, of the State of Nevada and of the State of California with the duty of maintaining electric service under public regulations of its activities and of its rates. The Company is engaged in a public service requiring continuous operation, and the recognition of such obligation of continuous service during the term of this Agreement is imposed upon both the Company and the Union. The obligation and the duty of the Company and its working forces to maintain continuous electric service, insofar as possible within human limitations, is a basic condition of the Company’s franchises and rights under law.
Inherent in the relationship established between the Company and its employees is the obligation on the part of the Company to deal justly and fairly with its employees; and on the part of the employees, to cooperate with their fellow employees and with the Company, in the performance of said public service obligation, and in the preservation of the good name and the good will and the property of the Company requisite thereto.
As used in the Agreement, the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender, and the singular or plural number, shall each include the others.

When an employee has accepted a job in accordance with the seniority provisions and finds himself unable to retain the job, he shall accept whatever job is available in the "Working Unit” and for which he is qualified.
Additional reference Appendix i
C.	1. The Company will post notices of all job vacancies that occur in the Working Units, as set forth in Section B of this Article VII, for a period of seven (7) consecutive calendar days, except for Exhibit D jobs filled by progression.
Such notices of job vacancies shall be placed on the Company bulletin boards, and it shall then be the individual employee’s responsibility to learn of said postings and to cause to be indicated thereon his desire to be considered for said job. Employees are only eligible to sign notices of job vacancies for jobs in their own working unit and said notices will not be posted outside of the working unit to which they
2
Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
apply. Apprentices will not be considered eligible to bid on other apprentice jobs within the same classification.
The names and unit seniority of the employee who is given the job will be posted at the time of the appointment. In the event of jobs other than entering level jobs being filled from the outside, notice will be posted on the bulletin board indicating that fact. It is not contemplated that notice of vacancies in entering level jobs will be posted.
After an employee has signed a posting sheet for a job and has been assigned the job and posting of that fact has been made, he must either accept the job or take whatever job is available in the working unit for which he has seniority, ability and qualifications. However, if he has not been actually transferred to the new job within: (a) thirty (30) days from the time the assignment has been posted he shall be free to bid and receive an award for another new job; or, (b) sixty (60) days from time assignment has been posted, he shall be free to withdraw his bid.
An Apprentice Lineman/Splicer who completes the sixth month of the sixth step of the apprentice training program will be promoted assuming he is qualified, to the Lineman/Splicer classification as an “in-training” Lineman/Splicer. The junior (working unit seniority) “in-training” Lineman/Splicer will be subject to assignment to a predesignated district to fill a vacancy in his classification in the event there are no qualified bidders for such a vacancy. Upon filling such a vacancy, either by bid or otherwise, the “in-training" designation will be removed. In no case will the “in-training” Lineman/Splicer be assigned to a new permanent work location which is more than thirty (30) road miles from the Lineman/Splicer’s original work base. Further, if after a six month period the
Rev. 2004

Article VII
“in-training" designation has not been removed, such designation will then be removed and the Lineman/Splicer will be considered to have filled a regular vacancy at his current work location.
2.	The provisions of this Section C shall apply to vacancies occurring in classifications listed in Exhibit “C” and in Exhibit "E” in accordance with seniority provisions of the Agreement.
In determining what constitutes sufficient ability and qualifications to meet the standards of the job under Exhibit “C” and Exhibit "E" bidding, due consideration will be given to: (1) the quality of the employee’s performance on his current job; (2) his
i Ljui i<u vi cjvj wvciliui i ai ikJ	ioi IL/C; m oilllliai
or related work; (3) the amount of special preparation for the new job, if any is necessary, which the employee has completed at the time the selection is made; and (4) leadership qualifications and ability to progress.
It is understood and agreed that the Company has the sole responsibility for selecting employees for these supervisory jobs and that the bidding procedure, as set forth in this Section C, is for the purpose of advising employees of vacancies and giving them an opportunity to indicate their desire for such vacancies.
3.	“In-training” Plant Equipment Operator
a.	Operating Assistants, when qualified, shall be promoted to “in-training" Plant Equipment Operator and will be eligible to receive future step progression increases.
b.	An "in-training” Plant Equipment Operator is hereby defined as a Plant Equipment Operator who has progressed from the classification of Operating
4
Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
Assistant, when qualified, but who has not filled a regular Plant Equipment Operator job and is carried as excess manning at a station. “In-training” Plant Equipment Operators are eligible to fill shifts the same as regular Plant Equipment Operators.
c.	In the event vacancies for Plant Equipment Operator occur and are not filled as the result of a bid and award, the junior (working unit seniority) “in-training" Plant Equipment Operator in the working unit will be subject to filling a job vacancy at Cool Water, Solar I, coal gasification (if appropriate), Highgrove, San Bernardino, and any other generating plants built on Edison properties at these sites. However, when an “in-training" Plant Equipment Operator is already assigned to a location where such a vacancy exists, the junior “in-training” Plant Equipment Operator at that location shall be assigned the vacancy rather than the junior “in-training” Plant Equipment Operator in the working unit.
d.	Should an “in-training” Plant Equipment Operator be assigned a Plant Equipment Operator vacancy at another station than his current assignment, the provisions of Article XIV.F.3. shall apply.
e.	“In-training” Plant Equipment Operators who are assigned as a result of the “in-training” provision of Article VII.C.3. shall not have such assignments count against the six (6) month restriction for horizontal and/or down moves described in Article VII, Section D.
f.	An “in-training” Plant Equipment Operator will receive merit increases subject to the same requirements of a Plant Equipment Operator.
D.	Transfers and horizontal moves will be made upon request received from the employee, in accordance with the terms of the seniority provisions of
Rev. 2004
Article VII

Article VII
the Agreement. This does not apply to moves within the same apprenticeship classifications. Employees will not be entitled to move horizontally and/or down more than once in a six (6) month period, nor may they make any combination of up and down moves during a six (6) month period which results in their occupying the same, or a lesser position as they held initially. New employees will not be eligible to move horizontally during the first six (6) months of their employment. Such six (6) months period shall be computed from the time an employee is hired or is awarded a job vacancy. If an employee bids for another job vacancy or requests a transfer to another job involving a horizontal and/or down move, at least six (6) months must have elapsed as of the date the job posting sheet is removed from the bulletin board.
1.	An employee may have valid requests for transfer on file for up to six different classifications, at any given time. On each request for transfer, an employee may request transfer to an unlimited number of designated locations. A request for transfer will be filled out by the employee and all copies will be presented to the employee’s District Manager or Division Superintendent who will date and acknowledge receipt of same and return a copy to the employee. This establishes the effective date of the request for transfer.
2.	A request for transfer shall be valid for:
a.	Twelve (12) months from the date submitted, or;
b.	Until the employee accepts a different job.
c.	If the employee rejects a job which he is offered, his request for transfer for that specific job will be cancelled.
3.	To be valid for a given job opening, a request for transfer must be submitted ten (10) working days

Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
prior to the date on which a department’s requisition for the job in question is received in the Staffing Division (Personnel Office).

a. An employee shall have at least two days from notice of a job offer to accept or reject the job.
5.	An employee who has submitted a valid transfer request as set forth in this article, and is performing satisfactorily on hispresent job, meets the Company’s hiring standards, and otherwise meets the qualifications of the vacant job, shall be awarded the job over a new hire based on working unit seniority and then Company seniority (within the bargaining unit).
6.	Each month, the Company shall post (on the bulletin boards where job bid sheets are posted) a notice of all jobs awarded via requests for transfer and shall provide the Union with a copy (name, bargaining unit seniority date, location, job classification, date of award of job).
E.	Reduction of Forces
In a reduction of forces employees will be displaced on the basis of Company seniority.
1.	Employees with twenty-four (24) months or less Company seniority:
a.	Such employees shall be subject to direct layoff by classification and working location.
b.	An employee who is declared surplus and who is subject to direct layoff shall be entitled to displace the least senior employee or fill a vacancy in a
Rev. 2004
Article VII

Article VII
similar or lower level classification at his established working base or another working base within his working unit as defined in Article VII.B. Such employees shall not be permitted to bump into other working units.
c.	In order to displace a less senior employee in his working unit, an employee must be qualified by previously holding the position or by passing a standard job knowledge or aptitude test and is otherwise qualified to perform the duties of the classification.
d.	The bumping process shall be expedited so that the necessary rounds of bumping, if any, can be completed within a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days. Employees shall be afforded the opportunity to take qualifying job knowledge and aptitude tests during this period.
e.	During a reduction in forces, affected employees who have exhausted their seniority rights for a full-time position, may fill a part-time Meter Reader vacancy or displace a part-time Meter Reader via the bump choice sheet. If converted to part-time Meter Reader, such employees will have recall rights, but no severance benefits, and if the employee subsequently terminates voluntarily, they will retain recall rights. The Company will determine which part-time Meter Reader is displaced at any requested location. Employees converted to part-time Meter Reader may not be displaced by another full-time employee. Employees working in part-time Meter Reader positions will be placed in the wage step closest to, but not greater than, their current rate of pay and will be subject to the same working conditions as part-time Meter Readers.
f.	In any event, employees who are declared surplus, who do not have sufficient seniority or qualifications to exercise their seniority rights as stated in this

Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
Section E.1., and/or have not transferred to a vacancy outside their working unit within thirty (30) calendar days after the implementation of the force reduction shall be laid off.
g.	Recall of such employees shall be in accordance with Article VII, Section F, except that employees laid off under this Section E.1. would be permitted to decline jobs outside their former working unit without forfeiting their rights under Article VII, Sections F&G.
h.	When the number of positions identified as surplus is the greater of either ten (10) positions or 3% of all of the bargaining unit employees in the working unit, then these provisions of Article VII.E.1. shall apply.
i.	For the purposes of this Article VII.E.1., Customer Service geographical divisions shall be considered separate working units.
j.	Apprentices who are subject to displacement, will be treated in the same manner as set forth in Article VII.E.2.c.
k.	No position will be filled by promotion or transfer during a reduction of forces so long as there are surplus employees at the same or higher level with qualifications and seniority sufficient to fill such position.
2.	Employees with more than twenty-four (24) months’ Company seniority
a.	In the event a reduction of forces is made in a classification at an established working base, employees with the least Company seniority in that classification at that base will be declared surplus. Employees declared surplus and those subsequently displaced, shall be entitled to displace the
Rev. 2004
Article VII

Article VII
least senior employee or fill a vacancy in a similar or lower level classification at his established working base or another working base in the working unit provided he has Company seniority over the least senior employee in the classification at the designated working base and is qualified by previously holding the classification or by passing a standard job knowledge or aptitude test and is otherwise qualified to perform the duties of the classification. All entry-level classifications shall be considered to be similar for the purpose of displacements under this provision.
b.	If a surplus or displaced employee does not have sufficient Company seniority and/or qualifications to displace an employee then occupying a similar or lower level classification within the employee’s working unit, he shall be entitled to displace the least senior employee or fill a vacancy in an entry-level classification at an established working base in any other working unit provided he has Company seniority over the least senior employee in the classification at the designated working base and is qualified by previously holding the classification or by passing a standard job knowledge or aptitude test and is otherwise qualified for the position.
c.	At the time of a reduction of forces at a working base, each journeyman classification as set forth in Exhibit D and the related 7th, 6th, and 5th step apprentices will be considered as one journeyman classification for the purpose of the reduction. Apprentices in the 4th step or lower will be considered as one classification for the purpose of the reduction.
d.	Moving Expenses
(1)	If there is a vacancy at another working base in the classification being reduced, the Company
10
Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
may request the employee being reduced or declared surplus to move to the vacant job. Such a request must be made in writing and confirm that it is being made under the provisions of this section of the Agreement. If the employee elects to move at the request of the Company, all moving expenses will be paid by the Company as stated in Article XIVF.3. In addition the employee will receive $1,000.
(2)	If a surplus or displaced employee elects to, and is successful in ultimately filling a vacancy in lieu of displacing another employee, all moving expenses will be paid by the Company as stated in Article XIV.F.3., and the employee will receive $1,000, when the following conditions are met:
a)	The employee’s new permanent work base must be twenty (20) miles or more from the employee’s old permanent work base;
b)	The employee’s new residence is closer to the new work location than his present residence;
c)	The employee’s commuting time to the new work location from his new residence is less than the commuting time to the new work location from his old residence; and
d)	The employee must move within one year from the effective date of the transfer to qualify for moving expenses under this provision.
e.	Preferential Bid Rights
Preferential bid rights do not apply to classifications in Exhibit C or to entry-level classifications.
(1)	A reduced employee working in a lower classification will have a preferential bid right based upon Company seniority to an opening in his original classification at his original work base. He will also have
Rev. 2004
Article VII
11
Article VII
a preferential bid right to an opening in his original classification at the new work base to which he bumped, if it is within his original division.
(2)	An employee who is bumped from his original work base and maintains his original classification will have a preferential bid right to an opening in his original classification at his original work base.
(3)	It is understood that in exercising preferential bid rights, an employee will return to the point of progression that he had reached at the time of his reduction.
(4)	An employee with preferential bid rights, who bumps out of his working unit may use his Company seniority to bid back into his original working unit.
(5)	Any employee who bumps out of his working unit may also use his Company seniority to compete with others on a request for transfer to an entering level job back in his original working unit.
(6)	The employee may make known his desire to be considered for job vacancies in his original working unit by submitting specific or blanket requests for transfer.
f.	Loss of Preferential Bid Rights
An employee will lose his preferential bid rights to:
(1)	A work location to which he holds a preferential right if he refuses to exercise his bid right when a vacancy occurs in his original classification at that location;
(2)	The new work base to which he bumped if he voluntarily leaves that location;
(3)	To both locations if he is successful in getting back to his original, or a higher, classification at his original work base.

Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
(4)	Failure of an employee to accept a requested transfer will cancel the employee’s preferential rights described in Paragraph 2.e. above.
g.	Freeze on Bid/Transfer Procedure
No position will be filled by promotion or transfer during a reduction of forces so long as there are surplus employees at the same or higher level with qualifications and seniority sufficient to fill such position.
h.	Layoff
In the event employees do not have sufficient seniority or qualifications to exercise their seniority rights as stated in this Section E, they will be laid off.
i.	Paper Procedure
A major portion of the reduction of forces will be completed through a paper process before any physical move is made. Employees will be given two (2) consecutive weekends from the time they receive notice of reduction or bump before they will be required to submit bump choices. Employees will be required to make three (3) choices per round. The Union Office will be provided with a list of the results of each round.
j.	Red Circle Provisions
(1) If under this Section E an employee is reduced to a lower paying job classification, the employee will be "red circled” at his/her “pre-force reduction” rate of pay until one of the following occurs: 1) the rate of pay for the employee’s current job classification is equal to or greater than the “red circle” rate of pay or, 2) the "red circled” employee declines to accept assignment as set forth in j.(2) below. Should either 1) or 2) occur, the employee will assume the rate of pay of his/her current job classification.
Rev. 2004
Article VII
13
Article VII
(2)(a) In the event a job vacancy occurs for which there are no qualified job bidders or transfers, any employee currently “red circled" in the vacant classification who was reduced from a work base within a 35-mile radius* of the vacant position may be offered assignment to the vacancy. Such employees will be offered the vacant position based on working unit seniority, beginning with the junior employee.
(b)	In the event a “red circled" employee is reduced to another working unit, the employee must file a valid transfer request back to his/her “pre-force reduction" working unit for ail vacancies in his/her original job classification within a 35-mile radius* of the employee’s “pre-force reduction” work location.
(c)	If a “red circled” employee fails to accept the first job vacancy properly offered under j.(2)(a) or (b) above, the employee will assume the rate of pay of the current job classification.
(3) If an employee is force reduced into a new working unit, and if the former working unit or former job classification in that working unit no longer exists, the employee will be credited with his/her former working unit seniority after accumulating two years in the new working unit. (Applies to force reductions occurring on or after February 1, 1988)
k.	In the event of an involuntary layoff, the Company will pay a severance of three (3) weeks pay to laid-off employees with zero (0) to three (3) years of service and one (1) additional week for each additional full year of service to a maximum of 26 weeks of pay.
*For Transmission/Substation and PAMM only, job vacancies in the “basin" will be offered in accordance with the 35-mile assignability rule Letter of Understanding.
14
Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
The Company will also provide health care coverage for a minimum term of one (1) month to laid-off employees with less than five (5) years of service and three (3) months of coverage for employees with five (5) years or more service. In addition, the employee will be eligible for up to 18 months of COBRA coverage.
If an employee elects the above severance and medical coverage, the employee will not have recall or rehire rights.
I.	During a reduction in forces, affected employees who have exhausted their seniority rights for a full-time position, may fill a part-time Meter Reader vacancy or displace a part-time Meter Reader via the bump choice sheet. If converted to part-time Meter Reader, such employees will have recall rights, but no severance benefits, and if the employee subsequently terminates voluntarily, they will retain recall rights. The Company will determine which part-time Meter Reader is displaced at any requested location. Employees converted to part-time Meter Reader may not be displaced by another full-time employee. Employees working in part-time Meter Reader positions will be placed in the wage step closest to, but not greater than, their current rate of pay and will be subject to the same working conditions as part-time Meter Readers.
3.	Relocation of Work Bases
In the event of a relocation of a work base, the Company reserves the right to transfer employees to the new working location without invoking the provisions of Article VII, Section E, providing the new work location is within sixteen (16) road miles of the original work base location. If a work base location is moved more than once in a five (5) year period, the
Rev. 2004
Article VII
15
Article VII
provisions of this Article VILE.2. would be applicable for the second move.
4.	Temporary Curtailment
In the event of a temporary curtailment in any working unit, the Company reserves the right to temporarily transfer employees to other units to do such work as may be available and suitable to their skill and experience, provided that no employee of longer Company seniority may be displaced by an employee so transferred who has less Company seniority.
5.	In the event that a reduction of forces is necessary but cannot be implemented under the provisions of Article VII.E. 1. or Vil.E.3., the reduction snail be implemented under the provisions of Article VILE.2.
Additional reference Appendix i
F.	Reemployment shall be in reverse order of layoff, i.e., the last employee laid off shall be the first reemployed. The Company shall notify former employees who were laid off in writing by registered mail addressed to the last address of record to report back to work when jobs are available. If such a former employee does not report within ten (10) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays excluded) after the sending of such notice, he shall lose his seniority, except that if the failure to so report is due to substantiated illness, injury, or some cause beyond his control, the former employee shall be put back to work when he is able to report, provided he notifies the Company within such ten (10) day period the approximate date when he will be able to return and there is on such date an available job for which he is eligible by reason of qualifications and seniority.
16
Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
It is the responsibility of the employee to see that the Company is advised of his current mailing address.
All former employees so reemployed must pass a physical examination and upon reemployment shall receive the prevailing rate of pay for the classification in which they are reemployed.
G.	Except as otherwise provided herein, seniority shall be lost if an employee: (1) quits; (2) is discharged for cause; (3) fails to return to work within ten (10) days after being notified to report for work, except when such failure is due to substantiated illness, injury, or similar cause beyond his control and he has so notified the Company within the ten (10) day period; or (4) is laid off for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months. However, if his seniority exceeds five (5) years, he shall not lose his seniority until he has been laid off for more than a continuous period of thirty-six (36) months. Seniority shall not accumulate during any such layoff.
H.	Company and working unit seniority shall accumulate for New Normal and Regular Employees during any absence due to illness or injury, so long as the employee continues to receive Comprehensive Disability Plan benefits, and the employee shall be returned, if qualified, to his former job or to a similar position at the then current rate.
I.	Employees who are transferred to supervisory or non-supervisory positions outside of the bargaining unit shall accumulate working unit seniority while occupying such supervisory or non-supervisory positions. If they are transferred to classifications within the bargaining unit, they may elect to be assigned, if qualified, to the classification in the working unit they formerly held:
Rev. 2004
Article VII
17
Article VII
1.	In the working location where they are employed; or
2.	In any other location within the working unit, provided there is a job vacancy.
Such transfers shall be with accumulated seniority and all the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall apply while they are assigned to any job classification in the bargaining unit. Such transfers into the bargaining unit will be effected without the necessity of posting job vacancies. A job award, however, will be posted at the time the assignment is made.
For purposes of a reduction in forces, employees who have been outside of the bargaining unit for two (2) years or more and who are returned to the bargaining unit under this provision may not use Company seniority accrued while outside of the bargaining unit for a period of two (2) years.
J. Employees who are transferred to temporary positions outside of the working unit shall accumulate working unit seniority in their regular working unit while occupying such temporary positions. In the event any of the aforementioned employees are returned to classifications within the working unit, they shall be assigned, if qualified, the classification in the working unit they formerly held, with their accumulated seniority; and all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to them while they are assigned to any job classification in the working unit.
K.1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 below a temporary position shall be construed to mean any position or assignment which is not expected to continue more than ninety (90) day; however, if it is necessary, such time may be extended with the approval of the parties hereto.
18
Article VII
Rev. 2004
Article VII
2. In the case of temporary employees, they may be employed for up to nine (9) months and in the case of temporary upgrades, employees may be assigned an upgrade for up to nine (9) months. However, if it is necessary, such time may be extended with the approval of the parties hereto.
The following will apply to temporary employees who have been terminated and are hired as new normal employees:
a.	If an employee is hired full time within one year from the conclusion of his last temporary employment period, his seniority will be adjusted to include all temporary employment periods retroactively for one year from the in-service date as a full-time employee.
b.	For an employee whose rehire date is more than one year from the date his last temporary employment is terminated, his seniority will not be adjusted.
Additional reference Appendix i
L. As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, but not later than ninety (90) days thereafter, and each year thereafter, the Company shall furnish the Union with lists showing the Company and working unit seniority of each employee in the units covered by this Agreement. The Company will also post said seniority lists on all Company bulletin boards. Any protest in seniority lists must be made within sixty (60) days from date such lists are furnished the Union or said lists will stand as corrected for the duration of the Agreement.

Article IX
WORKING HOURS, OVERTIME, HOLIDAYS AND SAFETY
A. 1. Forty (40) hours shall constitute a regular week’s work. A regular week’s work shall be performed on five (5) consecutive days which shall be normally Monday to Friday, inclusive, except that regularly scheduled shifts may be instituted to such extent and at such hours as may be required in the Company operations and it is understood that such regularly scheduled shifts may be instituted regardless of the special departmental provisions of this Agreement; except that:
a.	Where employees so request, the Company may permit such employees to work more than five (5) consecutive days without overtime pay for the purpose of accumulating their days off, if the same be back-to-back work weeks.
b.	The five (5) work days need not be consecutive if the sequence of work days be interrupted by regular shift rotation or by shift changes mutually agreed upon by employees for their convenience.
2.	When an employee is scheduled for a regular days-off period of four (4) days and when such employee has five (5) approved vacation days connected to the four (4) days-off period, such scheduled days-off period shall not be changed. For the purpose of this provision, any combination of holidays and vacation days totaling five (5) will be considered the equivalent of five (5) vacation days.
3.	No more than 20% of the work performed by Meter Readers, as measured on an annual basis, may be done by part-time Meter Readers. If the Company exceeds this 20% at year end, then the amount of work which may be done by part-time
Rev. 2004
Article IX

Article IX
Meter Readers in the following year will be reduced by 2% for each 1% above the 20% maximum level, returning to the 20% work level the next following year. A part-time Meter Reader may not work any longer than 1,456 hours in a calendar year.
Additional reference Appendix i and ii
B.	For the purpose of this Agreement, Testboardmen, Substation, Hydro Plant, Steam Plant, and Diesel Plant Operators, Station Attendants and Systems Communication Technicians working on a rotating shift basis shall be known as “shift employees.’1
The schedules for employees on rotating shifts shall be so arranged as to provide that each employee works approximately the same number each of the shifts worked.
Additional reference Appendix ii
C.	For shift employees eight (8) consecutive hours shall constitute a regular day’s work; their meals to be eaten on Company time. For employees other than shift employees, eight (8) hours constitute the regular day's work which hours shall be consecutive except for time out for meals. Shift changes or regular working schedules shall not be changed solely for the purpose of avoiding overtime payments.
1.	Shift employees who are assigned to school classroom training will assume a day shift schedule including a non-paid lunch period.
2.	In the Transportation Services Department, employees on fixed shifts (swing or graveyard) may be changed to day shift, with a minimum of 72 hours’ notice, for school classroom training, and up to ten (10) days per year for special project assignments.

Article IX
Rev. 2004
Article IX
Such assignments shall be for five (5) consecutive days or less.
Employees assigned pursuant to this section shall not receive overtime compensation for the eight (8) hours worked on the day shift, but shall receive the shift differential applicable to their normal shift.
D.	The regular working schedules shall be made up and posted on the Company bulletin boards two (2) weeks in advance of their effective date. While part-time Meter Readers will generally be placed on a regular work schedule, the Company reserves the right to work them on an on-call basis on normal time.
E.	The following shall be the basis for payment of the rate of time and one-half the straight time hourly rate of pay for the employees affected, except as provided in Sections F and G of this Article IX:
1.	Hours worked in excess of eight (8) in a single day;
2.	Hours worked before or after scheduled shift hours;
3.	The first work day on a new schedule after transfer from one schedule of working days to another without notification of such transfer at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the starting time of the new schedule;
4.	The first shift after transfer from one eight (8) hour working shift to another without notification of such transfer at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the starting time of the new shift; except when employee's shift is transferred to graveyard shift with less than eight (8) hours notice in advance of the starting time of the new shift, the first shift after such transfer shall be paid at the rate of two times
Rev. 2004

Article IX
the straight time hourly rate of pay for the employee affected;
5.	Required to work more than one (1) short change in a seven (7) day period. A short change which occurs more than seven (7) days beyond the first short change establishes the beginning of a new seven (7) day period and will not be paid at the premium rate except that if a short change is worked on the seventh day, a short change worked on the eighth day will be paid at the rate of time and one-half the straight time hourly rate. A short change is defined as a transfer from one schedule of working days to another with but eight (8) hours off between shifts;
6.	Hours worked on scheduled days off;
7.	The overtime rate of time and one-half for hours actually worked is the maximum which may be received under the foregoing provisions of this Section E, even though there may be two or more bases for applying the time and one-half rate to such hours;
8.	No overtime compensation shall be paid for any hours worked on a second shift in any twenty-four (24) hour period, which hours are worked as a result of the regular shift rotation or which hours are worked as a result of shift changes or changes in days off mutually agreed upon by employees for their convenience. Any changes in days off must be in the same work week.
F. 1. Employees, except part-time Meter Readers, who are called (other than for prearranged work) outside of their regularly scheduled working hours shall be paid at the double time rate for all hours worked and for travel time in connection therewith except as provided elsewhere in this Section F. The minimum time, including travel time, for which overtime com
4
Article IX
Rev. 2004
Article IX
pensation shall be paid under the provisions of this Section shall be two (2) hours at the overtime rate. For the purposes of this Section, additional calls received within the two (2) hour minimum period shall not establish consecutive minimum periods of double time.
For purposes of this Section employees who are called within two (2) hours immediately preceding their regular scheduled working hours shall be entitled to no more than a minimum of two (2) hours at the double time rate for any time worked within said two (2) hour period. Should the two (2) hour minimum overlap into an employee’s regularly scheduled work hours the straight time pay for the regularly scheduled hours shall commence after the close of the two (2) hour minimum period.
Call-out time under this Section shall be computed from the time the call is received when the employee is required to report immediately. Employees called out but not required to report immediately shall receive pay from the time the employee begins to travel in order to report at the required time. Shift employees called within forty-five (45) minutes of the time required to report for work shall be considered to be required to report immediately and shall be paid from the time the call is received.
When employees are working overtime as the result of being called out to perform emergency work, and when such emergency work immediately precedes and extends into the starting time of prearranged overtime, the following shall apply:
a.	As long as such emergency work continues they shall be paid the double time rate of pay;
b.	If and when the emergency work is completed and such employees start working on the pre
Rev. 2004
Article IX

Article IX
arranged overtime work, they shall be paid the rate of pay applicable to prearranged work.
2.	Employees who are required to work outside of their regular scheduled working hours on a prearranged basis shall be paid at the time and one-half rate for hours worked.
If the employee does not continue to work into his regular work day or if the time worked is not a continuation of his regular work day, the minimum time for which overtime compensation shall be paid under the provisions of this Section shall be two (2) hours at the applicable overtime rate.
When scheduled overtime, other than an extension of the regular work day (before or after), is cancelled less than eight (8) hours prior to the time the scheduled overtime was to start, the employee shall receive two (2) hours’ pay at the applicable overtime rate.
3.	When time worked under the provisions of this Section fulfills the requirements of Section G of this Article IX, the double time rate will be applied instead of the rate of time and one-half.
G. 1. Employees who, as the result of a call out, work on a job during a days-off period, or which extends into a days-off period, and who are notified while at work on such job to report back for work at a later time during the same days-off period, shall be paid at the double time rate for such time worked on this second assignment. Such assignment, however, is not considered a call out and travel time provisions pertaining to a call out are not applicable but the meal provisions for call outs will apply.
2.	Employees shall be paid at the double time rate of pay for all time worked in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours. Employees who, under the provi
6
Article IX
Rev. 2004
Article IX
sions of this clause, would be entitled to pay at the double time rate will not have such right nullified by an interruption of continuous work time of six (6) hours or less. (Any break in continuous work time of more than six (6) hours will be considered to be an interruption of continuous work time.)
Under the provisions of this Section G.2., the employees may be sent home for a specified break (it is understood that employees on any such break may be called back to work) and shall not lose any normal time pay for the regular time which they are required to lose by reason of such break. Meal periods will not be considered as an interruption of continuous work time and will not be considered as work time except when paid for by the Company. The meal period which occurs during employees’ regular work hours will be included in the computation of the break period.
3.	Employees who work on a job during the first day off of a days-off period and who are notified while at work on such a job to report back for work on the second day off, shall be paid at the double time rate for such time worked on this second day off. Such assignments, however, are not considered call outs and travel time provisions pertaining to a call out are not applicable, but the meal provisions for call outs will apply.
4.	Employees who work during a non-workdays period (starting at the end of their regular work hours prior to their first day off and continuing until the start of their regular work hours on their first day back) shall receive the double time rate of pay for time worked in excess of eight (8) hours. The double time rate shall remain in effect for all hours worked during the remainder of the days off period, except that, for prearranged overtime work on a subsequent day off,
Rev. 2004
Article IX
7
Article IX
the rate of time and one-half will apply if such work is preceded by a minimum of twelve (12) hours off.
5.	The double time rate is the maximum which may be received under these provisions, even though there may be two or more bases for applying the double time rate.
H.	Employees reporting for work on normal scheduled working days will not have pay deducted because of weather conditions when the Superintendent directs that no field work be undertaken. However, it is understood that such employees may be held at headquarters pending trouble calls, or may be employed in other miscellaneous work at headquarters.
The provisions of this Section shall apply only on the employee's regular scheduled work days, except that in those divisions and areas where the extended work week is temporarily in effect, the provisions of this Section shall also apply on the sixth (6th) day.
Seasonal or casual employees on an hourly or daily basis, ordered to report for work, will be credited with at least two (2) hours pay if weather conditions are so unfavorable that the Superintendent directs no work be attempted. Two (2) hours at overtime rates shall apply on non-work days.
I.	Overtime shall be divided as equally as practicable among those qualified and available for the work in each classification. Employees shall not be required to take equivalent time off during any regular scheduled work week to compensate for overtime previously worked or to be worked within that work week. Overtime records will be maintained in two separate categories, via., emergency (call out) or planned (prearranged) work, except in the case of
8
Article IX
Rev. 2004
Article IX
“shift employees” where only one list will be maintained and in those Departments, Divisions or districts where the parties agree that one list will be used. In districts where the use of one list is determined by a vote of the majority of employees, such employees shall have the option to re-vote annually if they so choose. Overtime totals will be carried on a cumulative or “evergreen” basis and records shall be readily available.
When an available and qualified employee is not assigned an overtime assignment to which he is entitled by the provisions of the Agreement, the employee will be reimbursed for the overtime compensation loss he suffered if the overtime was improperly assigned to an employee in another classification or to an employee from another Evergreen overtime list (excluding planned versus emergency lists) thereby making it impossible for the normal application of the Evergreen provisions to provide future opportunities for the employee to make up the overtime lost.
Additional reference Appendix i and ii

Article XIV
1.	When employees are called from their homes to perform emergency work outside of regular work hours, they shall, if possible to do so, be given meals at intervals of approximately four (4) hours, provided, however, that in no event shall an employee be required to work more than five (5) consecutive hours without a meal, if one can be provided, such meals, and the time necessary therefor shall be at Company expense. When such emergency overtime continues into normal time hours and there are three (3) hours or more between the end of the last meal period and the start of the normal time hours, the employees shall be eligible for an additional meal on Company time and at Company expense, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section.
If an employee is called out for emergency work one (1) hour or more before his scheduled work hours on a scheduled work day and continues to work into his regular scheduled work hours and does not have an opportunity to eat a meal or prepare a meal before reporting for work, the Company shall furnish him with such meals if they can be provided. The necessary time taken to eat a meal shall be provided by the Company; the usual practice relating to lunch time on work days shall prevail. The Company shall reimburse the employee for such meals only if the actual expense therefor has been incurred.
2.	When employees are required to perform prearranged work on non-work days during regular work hours, they shall observe the lunch arrangement which prevails on their regular work days. When employees are required to perform prearranged work (not as a continuation of the regular work day) on either work or non-work days outside of regular work hours, they shall provide the first meal on the job at their own expense, and the time necessary therefor but not to exceed one-half (1/2) hour shall

Article XIV

Article XIV
be taken at Company's expense. Any subsequent meals shall be taken at intervals of approximately four (4) hours but in no event shall an employee be required to work more than five (5) consecutive hours without time off for a meal. Such subsequent meals and the time necessary therefor shall be at Company expense. When such prearranged overtime continues into normal time hours and there are three (3) hours or more between the end of the last meal period and the start of the normal time hours, the employees shall be eligible for an additional meal on Company time and at Company expense, notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section.
When employees are required to perform prearranged work two (2) hours or more before regular work hours on a regular work day or a non-work day and continue to work into their regular scheduled work hours, they shall, if possible, be provided with a meal at Company expense and the necessary time to eat it. The Company shall reimburse the employees for such meals only when the actual expense therefor has been incurred.
3.	When an employee is required to work two (2) hours or more beyond regular work hours, he shall be given an opportunity to secure a meal and the time taken therefor shall be paid by the Company. The Company shall reimburse employees for such meals only when actual expense therefor has been incurred. If an employee does not accept a meal at Company expense, as provided herein, he shall nevertheless be allowed overtime for the time usually taken to eat a meal, not to exceed one-half (1/2) hour.
If any employee is called back to work less than one and one-half (1-1/2) hours after the end of his regular shift or an extension thereof which does not
Rev. 2004
Article XIV
9
Article XIV
exceed two (2) hours, he shad be entitled to a meal on Company time and at Company expense unless he is released from his base not more than two (2) hours after normal quitting time.
4.	When an employee is required to: a) perform prearranged work less than two (2) hours before regular work hours, and b) is required to work less than two (2) hours beyond regular work hours; and when a and b combined with the employee’s regular hours result in the employee working eleven consecutive hours or more (normal lunch period excluded) without a Company provided meal, he will be entitled to a meal and the time to eat it at Company expense. For an employee who earns a meal under this provision, any subsequent meals shall be taken at intervals of approximately four (4) hours but in no event shall an employee be required to work more than five (5) consecutive hours without time off for a meal.
5.	When employees become eligible for a meal at Company expense as referred to in Sections C and D of this Article XIV, they will be reimbursed for such meals, when purchased in a restaurant and eaten by them at a rate of $13.50 per meal.
Daily Meal Allowance
1-1-2003 ......................$13.50

The phrase “purchased in a restaurant” is construed to include mobile catering trucks, but does not include unprepared food purchased in a market, restaurant or elsewhere. A meal purchased in a restaurant and eaten on the job will qualify for the meal allowance. The Company, at its option, may designate a restaurant where employees may eat and in such case the Company will pay for the reasonable cost of the meal.

E.	Established permanent base, as used herein, means that base assigned by the Company to which the employee normally reports for work. Temporary base, as used herein, is any base to which the employee is assigned by the Company for the purpose of engaging in work which will continue for a temporary period and may be established by the Company at its option at any location where suitable board and lodging can be obtained or provided.
F.	When an employee is permanently transferred from one established headquarters to another the following procedure will be followed with regard to moving expenses:
1.	In the event the aforementioned transfer results in a promotion as a result of the application of the seniority provisions of this Agreement, the employee will pay moving expense up to and including fifty dollars ($50.00). Any such expense in excess of fifty dollars ($50.00) will be paid by the Company.
2.	The Company will furnish a truck and driver to move the employees within, but not between, each of the following locations when such move is necessary as a result of a promotion: (1) Kern Canyon; (2) Big Creek Project; (3) Kaweah River.
3.	In the event the aforementioned transfer is at the request of the Company and does not result from the application of the seniority provisions of the Agreement, moving expense will be paid by the Company.
* Normal insurance in this case is to be interpreted as that insurance coverage required by the I.C.C. on interstate moves.

Article XIV
4.	In the event the aforementioned transfer is at the request of the employee, the moving expense will be paid by the employee.
For the purpose of this Agreement, moving expense shall include reasonable charges for moving the employee and normal household goods as well as normal insurance coverage.* If in accordance with the provisions above any of the moving expense is to be paid by the Company, fully detailed receipted freight, express, or truck bill showing weight, rate, etc., of household goods moved shall be attached to the expense account. When the total moving expense exceeds fifty dollars ($50.00), approval of the Division or Department Head must be obtained prior to contracting the expense.
The Company will pay the cost of any necessary wiring for electric range and water heater installations, and when necessary shall allow an employee expense of board and lodging while finding accommodations for his family or his personal possessions at the new location not to exceed fourteen (14) calendar days following the date of such transfer, except when the employee is transferred at his request.
Moves made that require the Company to pay all or part of the expense must be made within ninety (90) days after the transfer of the employee to the new locations. An extension of this time may be given upon written request addressed to his supervisor showing good and sufficient reason therefor.
Any special insurance purchased by the employee will not be covered by the Company.

PROVISION FOR SYSTEM OPERATING PERSONNEL
(Reference to System Operator applies to Transmission System Operator or Subtransmission System Operator as appropriate.)
1.	Station Manning: Supervision will determine the number of persons to be included in a shift rotation at a station. A normal rotation will consist of five or more System Operators.
A number of shift options have been made available io the System Operators as a part of this Paragraph M Agreement.
Voting: If the System Operators at a station express an interest in changing from their existing shift rotation, the Union will conduct a vote of the affected Union members at the station.
Such voting will be conducted during the first two weeks of October of each year to determine if a new shift will be implemented for the following year.
A 60% or greater majority of the votes cast will be required to implement a new shift rotation.
2.	Fixed Graveyard Shifts
A.	Establishing a Fixed Graveyard Shift Rotation (FGS):
At stations where at least one crew member desires to fill a fixed graveyard shift, a vote may be conducted concerning the establishment of a FGS rotation. A crew that votes to establish a FGS must also vote to select an “alternate" regular shift rotation (from Item 3.B. or 0. below) to revert to in the event that a position on the FGS rotation becomes vacant and goes unfilled and the vacancy can only be filled by a bidder for a regular rotating shift schedule.
1
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
B.	Filling a Vacant Fixed Graveyard Shift on a FGS Schedule:
If a FGS is established and the fixed graveyard shift is subsequently vacated, the senior System Operator at the station who so desires may move to the vacant fixed graveyard shift without the necessity of posting a job bid. If the vacant fixed graveyard shift is not filled from within the crew, it will be posted for bid.
C.	Filling a Vacant Rotating Shift Position at a FGS Station:
If a vacancy occurs in the rotating shifts, the fixed graveyard System Operator may elect to move to a rotating shift without the necessity of a job bid being posted. If the vacancy is not filled by the fixed graveyard crew member, it will be posted for bid.
D.	Posting Job Bids at Locations with a FGS Schedule:
A System Operator vacancy on a FGS that is not filled by a volunteer on the crew will be posted as follows:
(1)	A Fixed Graveyard vacancy will be bid as “System Operator — FGS — Fixed Graveyard Shift.”
To expedite filling.the vacancy at the station (in the event there are no qualified bidders for the fixed graveyard shift), the Company may simultaneously post a bid for “System Operator — Regular Rotating Shift schedule” with a note that the bid “will only be awarded if there is no qualified bidder for the FGS — Fixed Graveyard vacancy; i.e., Bid No.__________
above.”
Rev. 2004
Appendix
2
Appendix
If there are no qualified bidders for the fixed graveyard shift, the vacancy at the station will be awarded to the senior qualified bidder for the “Regular Rotating Shift schedule" and the crew will revert to their “alternate” rotating shift schedule that was selected at the time the FGS schedule was implemented. (The FGS will be cancelled at that location until it is subsequently reestablished as indicated above.)
(2)	If the vacancy is on a rotating shift, it will be bid as “System Operator — FGS — Rotating Shift.”
To expedite filling the vacancy at the station in the event there are no qualified bidders for the rotating shift on the FGS schedule, the Company may simultaneously post a bid for “System Operator — Regular Rotating Shift schedule” with a note that the bid “will only be awarded if there is no qualified bidder for the FGS — Rotating Shifts vacancy; i.e., Bid No.above.”
If there are no qualified bidders for the “FGS -Rotating Shift vacancy,” the vacancy at the station will be awarded to the senior qualified bidder for the “Regular Rotating Shift schedule” and the crew will revert to their “alternate” rotating shift schedule that was selected at the time the FGS schedule was implemented. (The FGS will be cancelled at that location until it is subsequently reestablished as indicated above.)
3.	Optional Shift Rotations: The shift and days off sequences for the various options available are as follows:
A.	Fixed Graveyard: A System Operator on a five-or six-man rotation assigned to a fixed graveyard shift will work Monday through Friday. Days off sequence shall be Saturday-Sunday.

4.	Shift Changes for System Operators
A.	One System Operator on a shift rotation is designated as the relief System Operator. A relief System Operator will fill shift vacancies in his/her classification. Filling such vacancies may require changes in shift or days off or both.
B.	A relief System Operator may be assigned to fill day shift vacancies and perform the same duties as the Substation Operators assigned to their work base. They will not be required to perform such duties at stations where they have not been previously qualified except in emergencies.
C.	If the System Operator on the board in charge of the day shift determines that the relief System Operator, who has been assigned to perform Substation Operator duties, is needed to assist with
5
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
System Operator duties, the relief System Operator will return to or remain on the board and the Substation Operation Supervisor will be notified of the change in duties. The Substation Operation Supervisor will determine if additional personnel are needed to perform the Substation Operator duties.
D.	A System Operator assigned to a Fixed Graveyard Shift will not be subject to a shift change except:
(1)	As provided elsewhere in this agreement.
(2)	When assigned to training.
(3)	When necessary due to poor job performance or discipline.
5.	Training
A.	(1) A new System Operator will be provided five (5) days of classroom training on basic system operating techniques. Such training may or may not be in consecutive days.
(2) A new System Operator will be provided three (3) days of computer training. Approximately one-half day of training will be provided on each system. Such training may or may not be in consecutive days.
B.	Approximately once every three years, System Operators will be provided three (3) days of formal training on PMS, DAS, PC, New Relays and Protection Schemes. Such formal training may be provided by qualified local supervision.
C.	(1) A new set of eight or more Operating Reviews will be developed and provided for training. Such reviews will be suitable for adaptation to a station’s jurisdiction.'
(2)	Local supervision will assign one review for each System Operator to complete each quarter.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
6
Appendix
Assistance will be provided each System Operator to ensure completion of the assigned review.
D.	It will be incumbent upon the Company to provide training as set forth above. Likewise it will be incumbent upon each employee to participate in training as assigned.
6.	New Rate of Pay for Higher Job Classification
A.	In the event an employee is not moved to a new work location within eight (8) weeks of the posting of the job award, the employee will begin to receive the new rate of pay. This provision will not apply if the employee requests in writing that the move date be delayed for his/her convenience and the Company can accommodate the request.
B.	If an employee is awarded an operator job classification at a higher rate of pay than the employee is currently receiving, the employee will be assigned the new job classification and receive the higher rate at the time he/she begins to break in.
Additional reference Art. IX. B.
PROVISION FOR SUBSTATION OPERATING PERSONNEL
Substation Operator’s shift sequence and days off sequence will be established locally to suit local conditions. Substation Operator schedules shall avoid overlap conflict with System Operator schedules. One Substation Operator in a rotation on day shift will be designated each week as subject to fill vacancies in the rotation at his base. Filling such vacancies may require changes in shift or days off or both. Non-designated Substation Operators will be subject to shift or days off change or both to fill vacancies in the event the designated Substation Operator has no normal time available. Effort will be
7
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
made to maintain a reasonable balance in the crew for such non-priority relief duty.
Substation Operators will be given the opportunity to work 12 hour shifts to fill vacancies before such vacancies are filled on overtime out of classification. Shift change that would result in an Operator's previously scheduled shift being filled at overtime shall be avoided.
Substation Operators’ schedules may be changed from time to time to fit changing needs and conditions.
GENERAL
Holiday time off on a regular schedule day shift may be granted by use of normal time of relief System Operator, Substation Operator or Chief Operator. An employee is entitled to take a floating holiday as a birthday holiday, if he so elects, provided he schedules it at the time he schedules his vacation.
Changes in establishing work base will be made in accordance with the Agreement to satisfy changes in operating requirements.
Additional reference Art. IX. B.
IDENTIFICATION OF “POLICY" AND “ME TOO" GRIEVANCES
In conjunction with the 1987-88 negotiations between the parties with respect to the grievance procedure, the parties agree to establish a “me too" concept for the pending of grievances. In this respect, the parties agree to the following:
1.	Either party may propose in writing to the other that a grievance be designated as a “policy’’ grievance, provided no other active grievance on the same subject or issue has been designated and
Rev. 2004
Appendix
8
Appendix
mutually agreed to. The receiving party shall respond in writing its decision to concur or not. A grievance may be proposed as a policy grievance until the time it is appealed to Step 3 or Review Step.
2.	Either party may propose in writing to the other a grievance be designated as a “me too" grievance provided there is a mutually agreed to and active policy grievance on the same issue or subject to which to associate the “me too” grievance. The receiving party shall respond in writing its decision to concur within 30 calendar days.

BIDDING OF LINEMAN/SPLICER VACANCIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS UNIT
Problems associated with the bidding of the Lineman/Splicer and Apprentice Lineman/Splicer vacancies in the Customer Service Department have been an ongoing topic of discussions since 1982. To ensure the opportunity for Journeyman to bid to all locations throughout the system while attempting to prevent having an unreasonably high number of apprentices at any given location, the parties have agreed to the following “high/low" bid system:
A.	Definition of Terms
1.	Apprentice
The term apprentice includes all active Apprentice Linemen/Splicers, first step through sixth step, inclusive.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
10
Appendix
2.	Journeyman
The term Journeyman includes all active Journeyman Linemen/Splicers and red circled Senior Cable Splicers in the Customer Service Department.
3.	High Ratio District
A high ratio district is a district whose ratio of journeymen to apprentices is equal to or above 2.25 to 1.
4.	Low Ratio District
A iow ratio district is a district whose ratio of journeymen to apprentices is less than 2.25.
B.	Determination of a District's Ratio at a Given Point in Time
1.	Each district shall determine whether it is a high ratio or low ratio district for each Journeyman Lineman/Splicer bid posted. The calculation shall be based on the district’s status as of the date of the specific job posting. However, if at the time of the bid award the successful bidder’s district has become a low ratio district, due to a Journeyman Lineman/Splicer in the district being awarded a bid (includes Exhibit C and E jobs), the bid will instead be awarded to the next bidder from a high ratio district.
2.	For the purpose of determining a district’s status, an employee who has been awarded a transfer or bid but who has not yet reported to the new job assignment, will be considered as working at the new job assignment as of the date of the job award.
C.	Bidding of Customer Service Lineman/Splicer Vacancies
11
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
1.	The Customer Service Department will bid all Lineman/Splicer vacancies as journeymen with the following exception:
a. In high ratio districts every other Lineman/ Splicer vacancy may be bid as an apprentice.
2.	Lineman/Splicers in high ratio districts shall be awarded bids in either high ratio or low ratio districts.
3.	Lineman/Splicers in low ratio districts shall not be awarded journeyman Lineman/Splicer bids except:
The senior qualified journeyman bidder from a low ratio district will be awarded a job vacancy 1) over transfers or new hires; or 2) before the job is filled as an apprentice by a non-journeyman bidder from a low ratio district.

Service Crews
1.	The first call Service Crew will be called for emergency work on a unit basis.

3.	When additional Service Crews are required, the Service Crew Foreman and Lineman/Splicer will be called according to the Emergency Overtime List.
4.	If the Lineman/Splicer on the first call is not available when called, a Lineman/Splicer will be called in accordance with the Emergency Overtime List.
5.	A Lineman/Splicer temporarily upgraded to Service Crew Foreman will not be called (as a Foreman) until all available Service Crew Foremen
Rev. 2004
Appendix

have been called in accordance with the Emergency Overtime List (except first call Service Crew).
6.	Employees will be assigned to Service Crews as required for training and as necessary to assure equity in the division of overtime.
Call Out for Emergency Overtime
Electrical and Distribution Crews
1.	On a two-week basis, beginning the first Monday following pay day, a low emergency overtime Lineman/Splicer (two, in the case of Distribution Crews) and a low emergency overtime Groundman will be assigned to a crew, together with the low overtime Distribution or Electrical Crew Foreman.
2.	The low emergency overtime Distribution or Electrical Crew will be called first for all emergency overtime work during the two-week period.

ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PERMANENT SHIFTS — TSD/CMM
Concerning the establishment of new permanent shifts in the:
A.	Transportation Services Department
B.	Corporate Materials Management
During the negotiations for the 1989-90 agreement, it was agreed that the aforementioned departments would be allowed to reassign existing employees at a work base to fill a new permanent shift at their work location without use of the bid or the reduction of forces procedures of the agreement. This procedure would apply only to newly established permanent shifts and it is not to be used for the temporary assignment of employees to a shift.
Procedure:
1.	Vacancies on the new permanent shift will first be offered to volunteers in the classifications at the work base. Employees with the highest working unit seniority will be given preference.
2.	If volunteers are insufficient to fill the vacancies on the new shift, employees at the work base will be assigned to the new shift by classification based on low working unit seniority.
3.	Supervision on newly established shifts will be filled by job bid.
In the event a shift, which has been established under this procedure, is to be eliminated, the employees on the eliminated shift will be transferred to shifts at the work base, based on their working unit seniority.

cerning promotional testing, was discussed. The issues raised by the Union involved the Company sometimes failing to provide employees with their job knowledge (promotional) test results in a timely manner, failing to provide test scores, and failing to identify areas of the test where improvement may be needed.
The Company is committed to reviewing the procedure for the transmittal of test results to employees with its line management. Improvements will be made, as determined by the Company.
Further, the Company will provide employees with their test results in a timely manner (normally test results will be provided to the employee within 10 working days). The Company will provide employees with their actual test scores when they fail to pass job knowledge tests. Finally, the Company will ensure that all employees who fail job knowledge tests are provided with an outline identifying the subject areas where improvement is needed in order to be successful in future tests.
Nothing in this letter should be construed as limiting the Company’s rights under the collective bargaining agreement to determine job qualifications or utilize promotional testing, nor to prejudice the Union's position in this regard.

EXHIBIT “A” AGREEMENT
The Union and the Company hereby agree that the following principles shall be used to determine whether the relationship between the Company and a non-Edison entity shall be covered by Article Vll-K and the 1981 Letter of Understanding. Thus, where it
Rev. 2004
Appendix
42
Appendix
is established that the Company is engaging in any of the following types of conduct in dealing with such an entity’s employees, Article Vll-K and the Letter of Understanding shall apply.
These principles shall not be applicable to owner-operators or to lessors of heavy equipment who provide heavy equipment along with an operator to perform work as directed by Edison personnel. Nothing herein shall apply to communications between Edison and a contractor in which Edison requests the assignment to or removal from its jobs of contractor personnel who are supervisors within the meaning of the Labor-Management Relations Act.
1.	Hiring — Edison shall not select or be involved in the decision to select specific craft personnel to be employed by a contractor to perform work for Edison.
2.	Discipline — Edison shall not terminate or discipline contractor craft personnel or request that specific contractor craft employees be terminated or disciplined by the contractor based on Edison’s evaluation of the individual’s work performance for the contractor. Edison may comment about the quality of the contractor’s performance or report any breach of its site or facility rules in which it observes a particular contractor employee engaging. Edison may require a contractor to remove an employee from Edison jobs due to a breach of generally accepted rules of behavior (e.g., theft, drunkenness on the job, or other behavior which is disruptive to or destructive of Edison’s operations or which creates a safety hazard).
3.	Supervision — Edison shall not direct the manner or means by which a job is to be performed by a contractor's craft employees. Edison representatives
43
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
shall not utilize a contractor foreman so as to be a mere conduit to directly pass on specific job directions to contractor employees on the manner or means by which a job is to be performed. Nothing herein shall prevent Edison employees from directly ordering contractor employees to leave restricted areas where they are not authorized to be present, or to give contractor employees safety directions where necessary to prevent injury. Edison may require the contractor to comply with Edison blueprints, specifications and quality standards and to coordinate with other contractors or with Edison so that project schedules can be met. Edison may change job specifications or scheduling requirements as it sees fit.
4.	Training — Edison shall not train contractor craft employees how to perform the tasks associated with the performance of a particular craft job. This shall not preclude Edison from (1) providing contractor employees with orientation necessary to the site or Edison requirements, or (2) providing safety tailboards to contractor employees at energized work locations.
5.	Movement of Contractor Crew Personnel — Edison shall not require a contractor to transfer a particular craft employee or group of craft employees to a particular job. Nothing herein shall preclude Edison from establishing priorities and deadlines for a contractor which may have the effect of requiring the contractor to move one or more of its crews from one job to another.
6.	Personnel Decisions — Edison shall not: (1) schedule the contractor’s craft employees; (2) determine which contractor craft employees shall work overtime; (3) schedule vacations; or (4) grant or deny time off. Nothing herein shall prevent Edison
Rev. 2004
Appendix
44
Appendix
from establishing starting times, from requiring the contractor to obtain authorization prior to working overtime, or from requiring that the contractor perform its work in accordance with Edison deadlines and schedules.
7.	Tools — Edison shall not supply tools and equipment to the contractors’ employees. Nothing herein shall preclude Edison from supplying specialized Edison tools/equipment to contractors — providing such tools are made equally available to all contractors.
February 1,1990
EXHIBIT “B” AGREEMENT
It is hereby agreed that if a dispute arises alleging a violation of Article Vll-K of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties, the 1981 Letter of Understanding (concerning temporary employees) as amplified by Exhibit A of this Agreement, and/or the Tom Roberts’ Volt award, the Union may pursue the issue under the applicable grievance and arbitration procedures of the 1989-1990 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
However, it is agreed that any such dispute shall be expeditiously resolved. To that end, if such a dispute arises;
(a)	For all departments other than Customer Service and Power Supply (but including SSID), the Business Manager of the Local Union and the Edison Manager of Labor Relations, and/or their designated representatives, shall meet to discuss and attempt to resolve the issue within fifteen (15) days or;
(b)	For the Customer Service and Power Supply Departments (except SSID), the Union shall attempt
45
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
to resolve the dispute through the appropriate grievance procedure.
If the dispute is not satisfactorily resolved pursuant to (a) or (b) above, it may then be referred to arbitration (like a termination arbitration) in accordance with the provisions of Article V-C.2 of the non-Power Supply Procedure or Article V-0.2 of the Power Supply Procedure in the 1989-1990 Collective Bargaining Agreement. However, there shall be a minimum of 90 days between the date on which the Company is first notified that the dispute exists and the first day of hearing.
It is further agreed that Arbitrator Thomas Roberts shall be deemed to be the arbitrator, for a period of three (3) years, provided he is available to hear the case within six (6) months. It is further agreed that any arbitrator assigned to hear a dispute under this procedure must have committed to the parties that he will issue his decision in the matter no later than six (6) months from the close of the hearing.

47
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
determination of eligible locations and work groups will be based on operating necessity.
To ensure the widest opportunity for employees to elect the schedule, it may be applied at some locations and for some work groups for less than year around. For all identified work locations/work groups, the work schedule and intended annual duration will be posted prior to the employee vote on the schedule.
2.	Implementation/Suspension of 4/10 Work Schedule
A.	The Company shall designate each work group at a work location which is eligible to work a 4/10 schedule.
B.	Implementation of a 4/10 work schedule must be approved in advance by a majority of 66-2/3% of the votes cast by eligible Union-represented employees in an eligible work group at a work location that has been designated to work the 4/1 Os. The vote will be conducted by the Union.
C.	Implementation or suspension of a 4/10 work schedule will be as near as practical to, but no sooner than, 60 days after the date the Union notifies the Company of election results.
D.	An approved 4/10 work schedule shall remain in effect for a minimum of one year unless the Company specifies in advance that the term will be less than one year.
E.	Thereafter a 4/10 work schedule may be suspended by the Company or by a majority of more than 50% of the votes cast by eligible Union-represented employees in the designated work group.
F.	For the initial implementation of 4/10 work schedules, it is anticipated the earliest such a
Rev. 2004
Appendix
48
Appendix
schedule can be implemented is on or after July 1, 1991. Thus, it is agreed that if a group votes to implement a 4/10 schedule in 1991, the 4/10 schedule will extend from the date of initial implementation through the end of the calendar year 1992.
G.	In the future, schedules will be implemented or suspended annually on or about January 1.

NITE LINE CREWS
After studying customer needs, and trends in workloads, the Company has determined that customer demands for nighttime outages and the need for other nighttime work has increased significantly due to businesses’ increased reliance on computers and increased traffic congestion. The Company has concluded that it has a need to establish Nite Line Crews (Nite Crews) to help in controlling operating costs and in maintaining its ability to provide quality customer service. Thus, after several meetings with the Union, the following agreement was reached:
53
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
1.	In conjunction with reaching this Nite Crew agreement, the Company agrees that where a regular 4/10 work schedule is offered to Customer Service Line Crew personnel, it will be offered on a Monday through Friday coverage basis only. At locations where the employees vote to work a 4/10 schedule, the Customer Service Department may then post a bid for a Saturday Line Crew (Saturday Crew) to work a 4/10 Wednesday through Saturday daytime schedule in accordance with 4/10 Q & A No. 26 (the signing of such bids is strictly voluntary and no employee will be forced to change his/her regular work schedule to work a Saturday schedule).
2.	In addition to the above modification of the 4/10 agreement, employees working a 4/10 schedule will be given options to select the regular workday on which they will observe a regular holiday. (See the Letter of Understanding regarding Four Day/Ten Hour Work Schedules.)
3.	Nite Crews will be utilized to meet demands for pre-arranged outage work and other types of jobs which need to be accomplished during nighttime hours. (It is not the intent of the Company to establish Nite Crews to do routine line construction and maintenance work on a frequent basis which can reasonably be done by regular crews.)
4.	Nite Crew Work Schedules:
a)	Nite Crews will work a 4/10 schedule.
b)	The regular work hours for Nite Crews on a 4/10 schedule will be 8:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. (it is understood that a regular Monday workday will start at 8:30 p.m. on Monday evening and end at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday morning, etc.).
c)	The normal work schedule for Nite Crews will be either Monday through Thursday nights (8:30
Rev. 2004
Appendix
54
Appendix
p.m. Monday-6:30 a.m. Friday, inclusive) or Tuesday through Friday nights (8:30 p.m. Tuesday-6:30 a.m. Saturday, inclusive).
5.	Nite Crews will eat lunch on Company time.
6.	Filling Nite Crew Vacancies:
a)	If the Company elects to fill a permanent vacancy on a Nite Crew, such vacancy will be filled using the bid process, except Groundmen positions will be filled via the transfer process.
(It is agreed that the Customer Service Department may elect not to accept transfer requests to fill Nite Crew Journeyman vacancies except that transfers will be honored consistent with the Agreement prior to hiring a new employee to fill the position.)
1)	If a permanent vacancy on a crew is expected to remain unfilled for two weeks or more, the Company may seek volunteers from the regular line crew personnel in the classification at the work base to temporarily fill the vacancy.
2)	If there are insufficient qualified volunteers, the Company may (with a minimum of two weeks’ notice) change the low seniority employee’s shift from days to nights and assign him/her to the Nite Crew for up to three weeks.
If the vacancy continues beyond three weeks, the next lowest seniority employee in the classification may (with a minimum of two weeks notice) be assigned to the crew for up to three weeks, etc.
b)	If the Company elects to fill a temporary vacancy (due to sickness, vacation, jury duty or other such absences from which the employee is expected to return to the crew) on a Nite Crew, such vacancy will be filled on overtime using the regular
55
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
district “planned" evergreen overtime list where the crew is based. (The planned overtime list will also be used when filling Saturday vacancies on a Saturday Crew.)
7.	Employees assigned to a Nite Crew shall receive their regular contractual rates of pay plus the graveyard shift differential.

PART TIME METER READERS SENIORITY AGREEMENT
As we have discussed, the situation currently exists where Part Time Meter Readers do not acquire working unit seniority for their time of service spent as Part Time employees with the Company. To provide an equitable solution to this situation, the parties have agreed to the following:
The application of granting working unit seniority for time spent as a Part Time Meter Reader will be in accordance with Article VII K.2 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Current Regular Represented employees will be credited with additional working unit seniority for their time spent as Part Time Meter Reader. This time will be based on the length of time between the Part Time employee’s hire date and his/her date of conversion to a Regular Full Time employee, not to exceed 12 months. The parties agree to establish 1-1-95 as the effective date for this change. Current employees who were Part Time Meter Readers will be credited with working unit seniority as described above.
Any Part Time Meter Reader who accepts a Regular Meter Reader position subsequent to the date of this Agreement will be credited for their time worked as a Part Time Meter Reader for purposes of working unit seniority, as described above.
The parties further agree to implement these changes as soon as possible, but with the understanding that the review of employee work histories will take a substantial period of time to complete. It is anticipated that this review and any subsequent changes to affected employees work histories will be completed between now and September 30, 2001. If the review is completed prior to September 30, 2001, the Company will notify the
Rev. 2004
Appendix
66
Appendix
Union and a date will be agreed upon to implement the seniority changes. No working unit seniority will be awarded as part of this Agreement until the review process has been completed and the Union informed of such.

PART TIME METER READERS TRANSFER PROCESS
As we have discussed, the situation currently exists where Part Time Meter Readers do not acquire working unit seniority for their time of service spent as Part Time employees with the Company. Subsequently, Part Time Meter Readers do not have a mechanism in place to acquire Full Time Meter Reading positions in a district other than the one they are currently working in without terminating from the Company and reapplying for a Full Time position. To provide an equitable solution to this situation, the parties have agreed to the following:
Future Full Time Meter Reader openings will be filled under the following process:
1.	Full Time transfers into the work location.
2.	Part Time Meter Reader’s currently working and meeting standards with a transfer to the work location where the Full Time Meter Reading position is open.
3.	Temporary Meter Reader currently working and meeting standards at the work location where the Full Time Meter Reading position is open.
4.	Hire from the street.
Likewise, the movement of a Part Time Meter Reader to a Part Time Meter Reader opening will be covered under the process listed below.
1.	Full Time transfers into Part Time positions in the work location.
2.	Part Time Meter Reader’s currently working and meeting standards with a transfer to the work location where the Part Time Meter Reading position is open.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
68
Appendix
3.	Temporary Meter Reader currently working and meeting standards at the work location where the Part Time Meter Reading position is open.
4.	Hire from the street.
The selection of Part Time Meter Readers will be based upon their satisfactorily meeting standards and by their date of hire as a Part Time Meter Reader. The earliest date of hire as a Part Timer will be given preference in accepting Full Time Meter Reader positions.
This Agreement will supersede and take precedent over the June 15, 2001, agreement titled Part Time Meter Readers Seniority Agreement.

PILOT PROGRAM FOR BARGAINING UNIT TRAINING FOREMAN
As described in this letter of understanding, the Company and the Union have reached agreement in creating a pilot program to test the concept of utilizing bargaining unit foreman on the Apprentice Lineman training crews. The term of this pilot program will be for 12 months commencing with the signing of this Agreement. If it is determined that after the initial 12-month Pilot Program that the Company desires to continue forward with his concept, this Agreement will be ongoing with either party having the ability to cancel the Agreement by providing the other party 60-day written notice of their intent. The parties will also utilize the Joint Apprentice Lineman Committee to discuss the effectiveness of this program.
Currently the Training School at Chino has eight established training crews, which perform work to provide experience to Apprentice Lineman in all aspects of line work. This Pilot Program Agreement provides that the Company will create and establish the IBEW represented classification of Training Foreman to supervise the training crews. The Training Foreman classification will be an Exhibit E position, with a pay rate 5% above the Electrical Crew Foreman classification.
The Company will establish the Foreman’s reporting locations, which will be reviewed, on an ongoing basis and be subject to change.
In the absence of a Training Foreman, the senior qualified journeyman at the work location that the crew is working in will be offered the upgrade.
Crew size will be limited to no more than six apprentices on a single Training Crew.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
70
Appendix
The intent of this program is to provide developmental opportunities to the Training Foreman as well as provide guidance and direction to the apprentices. If the pilot program is determined to be successful at the end of one year, Training Foreman positions will be subject to re-posting annually based upon need. Existing Training Foreman will have the right to reapply for these openings. If current Electrical Crew Foremen are awarded the training opportunity, the vacancy created will be filled by shadow or upgrade as necessary, until they return from the Training Foreman position.
The initial openings created by this Pilot Program will first be offered to the existing Training Supervisors prior to posting the openings. If the need should arise to reduce or eliminate any of the Training Foremen or any the Training Foremen positions, the affected Training Foreman will be returned to the job classification last held without the use of the Reduction in Force procedure being enacted. If a Training Foreman’s work location is relocated, the option will be provided to the affected Training Foreman to either accept the new work location or be returned to the job classification last held without the use of the Reduction in Force procedure being enacted. Without precedence, bids for the training jobs will be posted in both the Transmission and Distribution Business Units.
As a pilot program this Agreement is meant to explore the value of a Bargaining Unit supervisor in a training role. The primary measure of success is to produce quality Apprentice Lineman. Another measure of the success of the program will be the safety performance of the crews. At the conclusion of the 12-month program, a review of all accidents on training crews will be done to assess the manner in which the pilot program has performed in safety.
71
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
Additionally, a study will be performed to assess the effectiveness of the training environment provided by the new training crews.
The Company and Union agree to meet as necessary to discuss issues of concern evolving from this Agreement. This Training Foreman Pilot Program Agreement is entered into with the understanding of both parties that it is without prejudice nor does it establish precedence to either party’s position on any issue discussed in this Agreement now or in the future.

Q&As TRAINING FOREMAN PILOT PROGRAM
Question: Will the Training Foreman classification be required to work overtime?
Answer: As part of the responsibilities of the Training Foreman classification, there is an expectation that the record keeping aspects of the position will necessitate the Training Foreman to be provided by management 30 minutes of overtime. This overtime would be available on workdays that the Training Foreman is working with the crew in the field and would be utilized to complete the required documentation pertaining to the Training crews.
Question: Will there be other Overtime opportunities for the Training Foreman to work? What evergreen list will they be on?
Answer: Training Foremen will not reside on any overtime list. The Training Foreman will be considered for overtime opportunities in the work location that they are reporting to after the work location's evergreen list has been exhausted. When overtime is available it will be offered to the Training Foreman in accordance with the overtime provisions in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Question: What is the maximum crew size if they are performing energized work?
Answer: If the Training crew is performing energized work, the size limitation of the crew will be determined by the voltage level that the crew is working on. The Power Delivery Policy/Procedure Book, the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the SCE Accident Prevention Manual will be used for appropriate manning levels for the Training crew size. Additionally, appropriate consideration will be given to the apprentice’s level of skill and knowledge
73
Appendix
Rev. 2004
Appendix
as well as the established work limitations of such apprentice's placement within the step progression.
Question: How long may an upgrade be utilized behind an E Crew Foreman who takes a Training Crew Foreman position?
Answer: The upgrade may remain in place for as long as the E Crew Foreman remains in the Training Foreman position, or until management posts the position.
Question: If I become a Training Foreman and the Company decides to move my existing reporting location, do I have a choice to move or return to my previously held position in the bargaining unit?
Answer: If the decision is made to relocate the reporting location of the Training Foreman, the existing Training Foreman will be eligible to continue in the position at the new location. Otherwise, the Training Foreman would return to their last held bargaining unit position.
Question: Can the Company add or eliminate Training crews without negotiating such changes with the Union?
Answer: Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company can increase or decrease the number of Training crews utilized to meet their training requirements without negotiating such changes with the Union.
Question: Where are the reporting locations that the Company will be establishing the Training Foreman at?
Answer: The Company anticipates establishing initial reporting locations in Ontario, Thousand Oaks, Dominguez Hills, Santa Ana, San Joaquin, South Bay, San Jacinto and Covina.
Rev. 2004
Appendix
74
Appendix
Question: Will the Training Foreman be expected to Job Site Report?
Answer: Yes. The Job Site Reporting and Temporary Base procedures contained within the Collective Bargaining Agreement will continue to be utilized for this Agreement.
Question: If an E Crew Foreman has one or more Apprentice Lineman on his crew, does he receive the Training Foreman rate of pay?
Answer: No. Only the Training Foreman classification and the appropriate upgrades to the classification receive the increased rate of pay. Having Apprentice Lineman on a regular E Crew does not qualify for a change in the E Crew Foreman’s rate of pay.
Question: Can a Training Foreman elect to opt out of the Training Foreman position and return to their previously held position in the bargaining unit?
Answer: Yes.

REVISION TO THE GROUNDMAN “A” AGREEMENT
This Agreement will supersede and take precedent over the original Agreement for Groundman “A” classification dated September 28, 2001. As described in that letter of understanding, the Company and the Union reached an agreement to create the Groundman “A” classification, eliminating the Apprentice In Training job classification and returning to the 3-year Lineman Apprentice program. The reason for this change is to provide an improved career path for our employees and IBEW members, which will also support the Company and Unions mutual objectives. It should be recognized that the job description of the Groundman “A” and the Groundman classification would be the same as the job description of the existing Groundman classification.
The Groundman “A” classification will be filled with employees whose intentions are to promote into Apprentice Lineman. The existing Groundman classification will be considered as a long term or career Groundman position. Employees in this classification will not be able to bid Apprentice Lineman positions, which constitutes the only change in the existing Groundman classification. The Company will determine the type and quantity of Groundman and Groundman “A” positions that will be filled and maintained. Both the Groundman and Groundman “A" classification will be maintained on the same evergreen list.
The prerequisite for an employee to sign a transfer into Groundman “A” position will be to have successfully completed the Groundman Aptitude Examination and the Introduction To Climbing Class. After being awarded the Groundman “A” position,
Rev. 2004
Appendix
76
Appendix
the employee will be required to successfully complete the Groundman Training Program. If in future, the “drop out" rate from the Apprentice Lineman classification is determined to be unacceptable due to failure of Apprentices to complete the Climbing School Certification program, the parties agree to discuss necessary changes to the entry requirements of the classification, including requiring satisfactorily completion of the Climbing School Certification program prior to being considered qualified to sign an Apprentice Lineman bid. It is also further agreed, that both parties commit to meet and discuss issues of interest raised by either party, which may occur in the future, relative to this Agreement.
Employees who enter into a Groundman “A” position will be eligible to bid Apprentice Lineman positions after 6 months of Groundman experience is completed, provided they have completed the Groundman Training Program. Groundman “A” will also have assignability as an Apprentice Lineman to other work locations located within a 35-mile straight-line radius of their Groundman “A” work location. When an Apprentice Lineman position is posted the most senior qualified bidder (with at least 6 months of Groundman experience), will be offered the position. All qualified Groundman “A” at the location of the Apprentice Lineman vacancy(s) are required to sign the bid posting. If there are no qualified Groundman “A” at the bid location, and no other Groundman “A" sign the bid posting, the senior qualified Groundman “A" within the assignability radius of the vacant bid posting location will be assigned the position. The assignability provision described in this Agreement pertains solely to the Groundman “A” classification, and has no effect on
77	Appendix	Rev. 2004
Appendix
any other assignability applications outside of this Agreement.
If in either case the senior qualified Groundman “A” decides not to accept the position offered, they will be removed from the Groundman “A” classification and be required to find another position per Article VII B of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The vacancy will be offered to the remaining qualified employees until the vacancy is filled. If within 30 days of the Apprentice Lineman vacancy being filled an employee “drops out” of the Apprentice Lineman classification, the original bid posting can be utilized to fill the vacancy created by the “drop out” without the need to re-post the opening. This type of vacancy will be filled in the same manner as described above for regular job bids.
The Groundman classification will not be permitted to bid on Apprentice Lineman openings. Groundman and other employees may transfer into Groundman “A” openings. Employees who bid/trans-fer into the Groundman “A” classification will be required to successfully complete the prerequisites for the classification as provided above.
Effective April 1, 2003, Apprentice Lineman, during their first year (which includes 1st and 2nd step), will be allowed to change locations one time through the bid process provided they were assigned to a location (under the assignability clause of the Agreement). Such Apprentices will be given preferential bid rights to the location of their choice. Existing Apprentice Lineman prior to April 1, 2003, will continue to be able to change locations as provided in the original Agreement. They will remain at the same step in the Apprentice progression when such a bid is awarded. Bids may only be signed
Rev. 2004
Appendix
78
Appendix
within the employee’s working unit. Any Apprentice Lineman signing a bid under this Agreement will be given priority over Groundman “A" and the bid will be awarded to the most senior employee.
Qualified Distribution Groundman “A”s will be considered eligible to bid Apprentice Lineman openings within the Distribution and Transmission/Substation work units. Jobs will first be awarded to qualified employees within the Transmission Work Unit. Once all qualified bidders and Groundman "A” who are assignable within the Transmission Work Unit are exhausted, qualified Distribution bids will then be considered. No Groundman “A”s will be forced to fill open Apprentice Lineman positions outside of their working unit.
Employees who are currently working as Apprentices In Training at the 2nd step of the wage progression will be placed into the Apprentice Lineman classification at the 1st step. Those employees in the Apprentice In Training classification at the 1st step of the wage progression will be placed the Groundman “A" classification at the 4th step of the progression. The wages for the Groundman “A” and the Groundman classification will be identical to the current wage progression of the existing Groundman classification as provided in Exhibit A of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
