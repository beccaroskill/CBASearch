SERVICE TRADES COUNCIL UNION AGREEMENT
FOR REGULAR PART TIME EMPLOYEES
ARTICLE 1	- PREAMBLE
THIS AGREEMENT entered into this 30th day of March 2014 by and between Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S., hereinafter called “COMPANY” and the SERVICE TRADES COUNCIL UNION, on behalf of signatory International and Local Unions, whose names are subscribed hereto and who have, through its duly authorized officers, executed this Agreement, hereinafter called “UNION.”
ARTICLE 2	- PURPOSE
WHEREAS, the operation and service of the Company’s Walt Disney World Resort requires a large number of employees, and the orderly and uninterrupted operation of Walt Disney World Resort is of significant interest to the economy of the State of Florida and of the mutual interest of the parties hereto, and it is the purpose of this Agreement that all work shall proceed efficiently, without interruption, and with due consideration for the protection of labor standards, wages and working conditions; and
WHEREAS, employees have the right to organize and bargain through representatives of their own choice;
THEREFORE, the parties hereto have entered into this Agreement to recognize the Union to establish fair wages, working conditions and benefits and to put into practice effective and binding methods for the settlement of all misunderstandings, disputes or grievances that may arise between the parties hereto, to the end that the Company is assured complete continuity of operation and that Labor Management peace is maintained and employees are guaranteed Union rights and protection as provided by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3	- RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes the Service Trades Council Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative of all of the Company’s Regular Part Time employees who are in the classification of work listed in Addendum A at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, but excluded are all other employees, Security and Supervisors as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended.
ARTICLE 4	- SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
SECTION 1.	AREAS INCLUDED IN AGREEMENT
This Agreement relates only to the Walt Disney World Resort comprising the “Magic Kingdom” Theme Park; Disney’s Polynesian Resort; Disney’s Contemporary Resort; Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa; Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort; Disney’s Beach Club Resort; Disney’s Port Orleans Resort; Disney’s Old Key West Resort; Disney’s Saratoga Springs; Disney’s Pop Century Resort; Disney’s Art of Animation; Disney’s Yacht Club Resort; Downtown Disney and Leased Retail Operations; Typhoon Lagoon; Disney’s Wilderness Lodge; Disney’s All-Star Resorts; Disney’s Boardwalk Resort; ESPN Wide World of Sports; Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort; Disney’s Animal Kingdom; Disney’s Animal Kingdom Lodge; Disney’s Blizzard Beach; Disney’s Hollywood Studios; Textile Services; the Main Entrance Complex; Fort Wilderness; Tri-Circle D Ranch; Mickey’s Retreat recreation facilities; Bay Lake and Seven Seas Lagoon; Epcot; Disney Event Group (DEG), Warehouses: Lee Vista and Orange,
1
Maingate Office Complex; and roadways, employee entrances, parking lots, guest/employee transportation facilities, vehicles and boats which directly service the above-referenced theme parks and resort properties.
Those employees of the Company in the classifications set forth in Addendum A come within the Scope of this Agreement, excluding the following:
1.	World Fellowship Program
2.	Specialty students/employees in such disciplines as agriculture and oceanography
3.	Concessionaires as defined in Article 6, Section 4, who operate with their own employees, including concessionaires who terminate any existing or future staffing agreement with the Company in order to operate with their own employees
4.	WALT DISNEY WORLD College Program students
5.	Project Future, Rising Stars, Rising Tides and Bridges High School students
SECTION 2.	AREAS EXCLUDED IN AGREEMENT
This Agreement does not apply to or in any way affect Reedy Creek Improvement District, Concessionaires (as defined in Section 4 of Article 6) who engage their own employees; Buena Vista Construction Company; Buena Vista Distribution Co., Inc., or any other present or future division or subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company except as specifically set forth in Section 1 of this Article.
The Service Trades Council Union and its individual international and local Unions disclaim any interest now, or in the future, in seeking to represent any employees of the Company other than those in the classifications set forth in Addendum A, except as to the classification described in Case No.12 RC 4531, affirmed 215 NLRB No. 89.
ARTICLE 5	- MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
SECTION 1.	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Except as expressly and clearly limited by the terms of this Agreement, the Company reserves and retains exclusively all of its normal and inherent rights with respect to the Management of the business, including but not limited to, its right to select and direct the number of employees assigned to any particular classification of work; to subcontract work; to establish and change work schedules and assignments; to implement and effect a lay off; to terminate or otherwise release employees from duty for lack of work or other just cause; to make and enforce rules for personal grooming, and the maintenance of discipline; to discontinue conduct of its business or operations in whole or part; to institute technological changes (e.g. scheduling methodologies) and otherwise to take such measures as Management may determine to be necessary to the orderly, efficient and economical operation of the business.
SECTION 2.	BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCONTINUATION/SALE OR LEASE OF ASSETS
(a)	The Company may discontinue business segments or sell/lease physical assets which include the operations without notification to or bargaining with the Union regarding the decision to discontinue, sell or lease. The parties agree and understand that the sale or lease of a physical asset may result in the continuance of operations by the third party at the Walt Disney World Resort and that such continuance of operations associated with the asset does not constitute subcontracting as defined in Article 25.
Should such discontinuation/sale/lease affect any positions covered by this Agreement, the Company will provide the Union with at least a sixty (60) day notice prior to the completion of the transaction and, upon request, meet and negotiate in good faith with the Unions to the full extent required by law with regard to the effect of the transaction on employees covered by this Agreement, including, but not limited to, severance conditions, transfer within the
2
unit, and/or the potential for continued employment with the purchaser. It is understood, however, that agreement between the parties as a result of such negotiations is not a prerequisite to the completion of the transaction at any time after the sixty (60) days have elapsed.
(b)	Should the Company subsequently re-acquire and begin to operate a business segment previously discontinued, sold, or leased pursuant to 2(a) above, such business segment shall automatically be included within the Scope of the Agreement defined in Article 4, Section 1.
ARTICLE 6	- WORK STOPPAGES AND LOCKOUTS
SECTION 1.	NO STRIKE - NO LOCKOUT
During the existence of this Agreement, there shall be no strikes, picketing, work stoppages or disruptive activity by the Union or by an employee, and there shall be no lockout by the Company.
SECTION 2.	FAILURE TO CROSS PICKET LINE - VIOLATION OF AGREEMENT
Failure of any employee covered by this Agreement to cross any picket line established at the Walt Disney World Resort is a violation of this Agreement. In applying the provisions of this section, however, it is not the intention of the Company to require employees to cross a picket line if, after a reasonable effort to gain entry has been made, it is apparent to Management that such entry will result in physical violence or injury to the employees.
SECTION 3.	UNION’S RESPONSIBILITY TO PREVENT WORK STOPPAGE, STRIKE OR DISRUPTIVE ACTIVITY
The Union shall not sanction, aid or abet, encourage or condone a work stoppage, strike or disruptive activity at the Walt Disney World Resort and shall undertake all possible steps to prevent or to terminate any strike, work stoppage or disruptive activity. No employee shall engage in activities that violate this Article. Any employee who participates in or encourages any activities which interfere with the normal operation of the Walt Disney World Resort shall be subject to disciplinary action, including discharge. The Union shall not be liable for acts of employees for which it has no responsibility. The failure of the Company to exercise this right in any instance shall not be deemed a waiver of this right in any other instances, nor shall the Company’s right to discipline all employees for any other cause be in any way affected by this Section.
SECTION 4.	DISPUTES WITH CONCESSIONAIRES
Disputes between the Unions parties hereto and any concessionaire operating in Walt Disney World shall be so handled as not to interfere with the Company’s business or the business of any concessionaire not a party to such disputes. No picketing or concerted action against any one or more of the concessionaires will be conducted at Walt Disney World Resort. “Concessionaire” as used herein, includes a concessionaire and also a licensee, exhibitor, participant, sponsor, contractor, subcontractor or lessee. In the event any other organization pickets at or near Walt Disney World Resort, the Unions signatory hereto agree that such picket line so far as they and the employees they represent are concerned shall not affect the operation of the Company or concessionaires who are not involved in the dispute.
SECTION 5.	EXPEDITED ARBITRATION FOR ARTICLE 6
Any party to this Agreement may institute the following procedure in lieu of or in addition to any other action at law or equity, when a breach of this Article is alleged.
(a)	The party invoking this procedure shall notify the permanent Arbitrator. In the event the permanent Arbitrator is unavailable, he/she shall appoint his/her alternate. Notice to the Arbitrator shall be by the most expeditious means available, with a notice by facsimile and/or e-mail to the Business Manager of the Union alleged to be in violation of the Agreement, and
3
a copy of the facsimile and/or e-mail to the Union Co-Chairman of the Management-Union Committee.
(b)	Upon receipt of said notice, the Arbitrator named above or his/her alternate shall set and hold a hearing within twenty four (24) hours.
(c)	The Arbitrator shall notify the parties by facsimile and/or e-mail of the place and time he/she has chosen for this hearing. Said hearing shall be completed in one session with appropriate recesses at the Arbitrator’s discretion. A failure of any party or parties to attend said hearing shall not delay the hearing of evidence or issuance of an Award by the Arbitrator.
(d)	The sole issue at the hearing shall be whether or not a violation of this Article has in fact occurred and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to consider any matter in justification, explanation or mitigation of such violation or to award damages, which issue is reserved for court proceedings, if any. The Arbitrator shall not have the authority to alter, amend, change, modify, add to or subtract from or reform any provision, Article or language of this Agreement. The Award will be issued in writing within three (3) hours after the close of the hearing, and may be issued without an Opinion. If any party desires an Opinion, one shall be issued within fifteen (15) days, but its issuance shall not delay compliance with, or enforcement of the Award. The Arbitrator may order cessation of the violation of this Article and other appropriate relief, and such Award shall be served on all parties by hand or registered mail upon request.
(e)	Such Award may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction upon filing of this Agreement and all other relevant documents referred to herein above, in the following manner:
Notice of the filing of such enforcement proceedings shall be given to the other party by facsimile and/or e-mail.
In the proceeding to obtain a temporary order enforcing the Arbitrator’s Award as issued under Section 5(d) of this Article, all parties waive the right to a hearing and agree that such proceeding may be ex parte. Such Agreement does not waive any party’s rights to participate in a hearing for a final Order of Enforcement. The Court’s Order or Orders enforcing the Arbitrator’s Award shall be served on all parties by hand or by delivery to their last known address or by registered mail.
(f)	Any rights created by Statute or law governing arbitration proceeding inconsistent with the above procedure, or which interfere with compliance thereof, are hereby waived by the parties to whom they accrue.
(g)	The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be divided equally between the moving party or parties and the party or parties responded.
ARTICLE 7	- NONDISCRIMINATION
SECTION 1.	UNION ACTIVITIES
The Company and the Union agree that there shall be no discrimination against any employee due to Union activities or affiliation.
SECTION 2.	NON-DISCRIMINATION AND NON-RETALIATION
The Company and the Union agree there shall be no discrimination against any employee or prospective employee due to race, color, creed, sex, age, sexual orientation, national origin, religion,
4
marital status, disability or on any basis prohibited by federal or state legislation. The parties further agree to support Affirmative Action efforts.
The Company and the Union agree there shall be no retaliation against an individual who has made a good faith complaint about violation of the Company’s Equal Employment Opportunity and Harassment policies, or has cooperated with an investigation into a complaint of violation of these policies. Employees who believe they have been harassed, discriminated against or retaliated against, in violation of the above stated policies, should promptly report the facts of the incident and the name of the person involved to the Human Resource Department, Employee Relations Department, or Union Representative.
SECTION 3.	AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
The Company and the Union acknowledge the reasonable accommodation commitment of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the protected status of qualified applicants and employees with disabilities. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as intended to be a barrier to reasonable accommodation to qualified persons with disabilities, provided any proposed accommodation is reasonable and does not unnecessarily usurp the legitimate rights of other employees under this Agreement. In this regard, the Company and the Union commit to meet to resolve potential conflicts between the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Agreement.
ARTICLE 8	- UNION ACTIVITY AND CHECK OFF
SECTION 1.	UNION SOLICITATION
Solicitation for Union purposes by the Union shall not take place on working time, in working areas, in public areas, nor in the tunnel complex (except in break areas contained there), but may be conducted in non-working areas and on non-working time in parking areas, break areas and lunch rooms.
SECTION 2.	ACCESS OF UNION REPRESENTATIVES TO PREMISES
Representatives of the signatory Unions, designated in writing to the Company by the Union, shall be permitted to enter the non-public areas at the Walt Disney World Resort for the purpose of determining that this Agreement is being complied with by the Company and for the presentation and handling of grievances. Such representatives, who shall not be at any one time more than a total of sixty (60) in number for all Agreements between the Company and the Union, unless mutually agreed otherwise, shall comply with the access regulation and security regulation of the Company, as furnished to each Union Representative by the Company, and shall not interrupt the performance of employee work assignments.
SECTION 3.	UNION ACCESS PROCEDURES
(a)	Union Orientation. The Company agrees that it will allow a Union Representative access to new Regular Part Time bargaining unit employees at orientation for twenty (20) minutes to introduce their organization and distribute Union literature. The Company will provide the Union with a room of adequate size to accommodate the group, equipped with sufficient tables and chairs. The Company will reserve this room on a priority basis for the Union’s use. Storage space will also be provided for the Union. Any change in the scheduling of Union Orientation will be discussed with the Union in advance. However, the time allotted for Union access will not be at the end of an orientation day.
(b)	Conversion to Regular Part Time. The Union will be allowed access to those Seasonal/Temporary employees who convert to Regular Part Time status. The names and work locations of individuals or small groups who convert to Regular Part Time status will be made available to the Union on a monthly basis, upon conversion, to allow access through the “one-on-one” procedure. When large numbers of employees are converted to Regular Part Time status and operating efficiency permits, the Union may conduct a group orientation meeting in lieu of the “one-on-one” procedure. These meetings will be held in the respective operating areas.
5
(c)	One-on-One Meetings. Authorized Business Agents will be granted access to non-members in their respective work locations. Such access/contacts will be subject to the following guidelines and restrictions:
1.	The Union may mail, distribute or request supervision to distribute a solicitation letter to non-members within a work department/location, provided a distribution list is furnished to the Company, or in the alternative, provide the Company with the distribution list and letters for distribution. If the Union notifies the Company the mail option is elected, the Company will furnish the addresses of non-members. Supervision will neither encourage nor discourage employees from electing to meet with the Union.
2.	The letter will not be disparaging to the Company and will clearly indicate that the employee has the option to meet or not meet with the Union.
3.	The Company will schedule one-on-ones for employees who return a signed letter to the Union indicating the desire to meet with the Union.
4.	Meetings will be conducted on Company time on a mutually convenient schedule. The location of the meeting site will vary from area to area. Contact should be out of the guest area, but reasonably accessible to the work location. Supervision and other employees should remain away from the meeting area to afford as much privacy as possible.
5.	Meetings should be kept to a reasonable limit (5-10 minutes), and Supervision shall be responsible for monitoring this time.
6.	Contacts under this Section will be limited to one meeting per employee.
SECTION 4.	SHOP STEWARD OR ALTERNATE
(a)	The Union shall have the right to designate Shop Stewards in an amount mutually agreed upon by the parties. The number of Shop Stewards may be changed by mutual agreement of the parties. The local Union shall, in writing, notify the Labor Relations office of the Company as to the identity of the designated Shop Steward. The Shop Steward shall have the right to receive, but not to promote, complaints or differences and to discuss and assist in the adjustment of the same with the appropriate Supervisor on Company property without loss of pay during his/her regular working hours. The Company will not discriminate against the Shop Steward in the proper performance of his/her Union duties provided that such duties do not unreasonably interfere with his/her regular work or with the work of other employees and he/she shall not leave his/her work station without first notifying his/her appropriate Supervisor as to his/her intent, the reason therefore, where he/she can be reached and the estimated time he/she will be gone.
(b)	Where the complaint or difference involves more than one (1) employee, it must be presented to Management by the Shop Steward and one (1) employee for the employees involved unless presented outside of regular working hours, or unless the Division Head involved gives permission for other additional employees to attend such presentation.
(c)	The Company agrees to notify the affiliated Union in the event a Shop Steward is placed on investigatory suspension or transferred to a different work area/location. In the event of discharge of a Shop Steward, the Company will notify the Affiliate Union Designee in advance of the lay-off or discharge. Failure of the Union to provide the Company with an up-to-date listing of Stewards will relieve the Company’s obligation of notification to the Stewards as provided in this Section 4.
6
(d)	A Shop Steward or Alternate will accompany representatives of Management whenever locker inspection(s) are made.
(e)	The Steward shall promote harmonious relations between the Company and employees. All new employee trainer checklists will include a notation regarding the introduction/identification of the Shop Steward for the new employee by the Trainer.
SECTION 5.	CHECK-OFF
The Company agrees to withhold from the wages on each payroll week uniform weekly membership dues, initiation fees and/or service charges for each employee who signs and submits an authorization card. The Company shall forward such dues to the certified financial secretary or other properly designated official of the Union on or before the third week following the last week in the month in which the dues are deducted. The Company shall also forward an electronic check-off report which lists employee name, Social Security number, statused origin/department/location and the amount of the deduction. The Union will give the Company a written statement no later than January 31st each year, identifying the amount of dues and/or initiation fees to be withheld. Additionally, the Union will provide written notice of changes to these dues and/or fees. The Company will implement such changes within ninety (90) days of receipt of written notice.
The Union agrees to indemnify and save the Company harmless against any and all claims, suits or other forms of liability arising out of the deduction of money for Union dues from employees’ pay. The Union assumes full responsibility for the disposition of the monies so deducted once they have been turned over to the certified financial secretary or other properly designated official of the Union.
In the event the term of this Agreement expires, the Company’s obligation to provide the dues/fees collection and remission services (hereinafter referred to as the “Services”) set out in Article 9, Section 5 will terminate if the Union does not accept the Company’s offer of an extension which includes the following:
(a)	Retroactive payment to Regular Part Time employees of any subsequently negotiated increases to base hourly wage rates during the term of the extension;
(b)	Subsequently negotiated increases to base hourly wage rates shall be effective the day following sixty (60) days from the ratification of the Full Time STCU Agreement through the term of the extension;
(c)	Payment of retroactive base hourly wage increases shall be based on each Regular Part Time employee’s hours paid between the day following sixty (60) days from the ratification of the Full Time STCU Agreement and through the term of the extension (precise method of calculation subject to negotiation);
In the event a successor Agreement is ratified, the Company is under no obligation to collect and/or remit retroactive dues/fees for the period of time that the Services were terminated.
SECTION 6.	MONTHLY REPORTS
(a)	The Company agrees to provide each affiliate with a monthly member/non-member list for their portion of the bargaining unit. The list shall include each employee’s full name, rate of pay, Social Security number, address, and e-mail address, if available to the Company. The information will be provided electronically in alphabetical order by origin, department and work location and shall indicate the employee’s Union or non-Union status.
(b)	The Company agrees to provide each affiliate with a monthly seniority list for their portion of the bargaining unit. The list shall include each employee’s full name, Social Security number and date of hire. The information will be provided electronically in order of seniority by origin, department and work location.
7
SECTION 7.	POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE (PAC) FUND
The Company agrees to deduct weekly voluntary contributions to the political action fund of each affiliate Union from the paycheck of all employees covered by the STCU Agreement. Those employees must notify the Company in writing of his/her desire to have such contributions deducted and the amounts designated from his/her paycheck. The Company shall transmit to each such affiliate’s fund on a monthly basis, in one check, the total amount deducted along with an electronic report of the name of each employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the employee’s Social Security number and the amount deducted from the employee’s paycheck.
The STCU and the affiliate Unions agree to indemnify and save the Company harmless against any and all claims, suit or other forms of liability arising out of the deduction of money for voluntary political deductions from employees’ pay. Each affiliate Union assumes full responsibility for the disposition of the monies so deducted once they have been turned over to the fund.
ARTICLE 9	- HOURS OF WORK
SECTION 1.	PAYROLL WEEK
A payroll week is a period of seven (7) days starting at 3:30 a.m. on each Sunday and ending at 3:29 a.m. the following Sunday. The Payroll Week may be changed once during the term of the Agreement, by the Company giving two (2) weeks’ notice to the Union, so long as it starts on a Sunday or Saturday with no more than an eight (8) hour change from midnight on Sunday.
SECTION 2.	SCHEDULING
(a)	The Company shall adhere to seniority in establishing work schedules in a department, location or scheduling pool unless required to deviate for reasons of availability, dependability, skill, abilities, and experience of employees and/or for the orderly and uninterrupted operation of the Company.

The Company and the Union agree that the Company will not be obligated to engage in any bargaining, whether over effects, impact or otherwise, over any such change or changes in the Grievance Procedure or over the implementation thereof.
SECTION 1.	GRIEVANCES SETTLED ACCORDING TO PROCEDURE
The parties to this Agreement agree that any grievance arising out of the interpretation or application of the terms of this Agreement, with the exception of terminations, discipline based on the Company’s policies of Equal Employment Opportunity and Harassment* 2 and policy grievances which will be expedited to Step 2, shall be settled promptly in accordance with the following procedure:
SECTION 2.	DEFINITIONS
(a)	Grievance: A grievance, within the meaning of this procedure, is defined as a dispute or difference of opinion between the parties concerning the meaning, interpretation, application or alleged violation by the Company of this Agreement.
(b)	Time Limits: The parties recognize that it is important that grievances be processed and resolved as rapidly as possible; therefore, the number of days indicated at each step of the grievance procedure should be considered as a maximum, and every effort should be made to expedite the process. All termination grievances will be given priority for processing. The time limits specified may be extended by mutual agreement as evidenced by a waiver in writing signed by an authorized representative of the Company and the Union; otherwise, the grievance shall be regarded as withdrawn.
(c)	Recording Devices: The parties agree that no recording devices of any kind shall be permitted to be utilized during Step 1,2, or 3 of the Grievance Procedure.
(d)	Back-pay Awards: The parties agree that any Joint Standing Committee or Arbitrator award of back pay shall be lessened by unemployment compensation or any other compensation received by the grievant during the period of termination prior to reinstatement.

(e)	Information Requests: The responding party will make every reasonable effort to provide any requested, relevant information regarding grievances to the requesting party within seventy-two (72) hours. In circumstances where the responding party is unable to provide information within seventy-two (72) hours, the requesting party will be provided with an estimate of the time of provision.
(f)	Any employee, believing that they have suffered a grievance, may discuss the matter with his/her immediate Guest Service Manager prior to initiating the formal Grievance Procedure in Section 3. The employee may choose whether to discuss the matter with their Guest Service Manager with or without the assistance of their Union Representative.
2 The Union may request a meeting with a representative of Employee Relations prior to the 2nd grievance meeting or as part of the
2nd or 3rd step grievance meeting to facilitate timely processing of the grievance.
21
SECTION 3.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Step 1. If the grievance shall not have been adjusted informally with the immediate Guest Service Manager, then the grievance shall be reduced to writing upon the accepted Grievance Form which shall set forth the relevant information concerning the grievance, including a short description of the alleged grievance, the date on which the grievance occurred, and an identification of the section of the Agreement alleged to have been violated.
In order to be deemed timely, a grievance must be filed at Step 1 within fourteen (14) calendar days after its occurrence or within fourteen (14) calendar days after the employee has had a reasonable opportunity to become aware of the occurrence, whichever is later.
The Area Manager or his/her designated representative and the Union Representative or his/her designated representative shall meet within seven (7) calendar days after invocation of Step 1 in an attempt to settle the grievance. It shall be incumbent upon the Union Representative to request such meeting. The Area Manager or his/her designated representative shall provide the employee and the Union Representative with a written reply within five (5) calendar days after the parties have met. If the Area Manager fails to give a written reply within the time limits provided, the grievance may be appealed to the next step of the Grievance Procedure.
Step 2. If the grievance shall not have been adjusted under Step 1, then within seven (7) calendar days from the date of the Area Manager's written decision or a date when the decision should have been submitted by the Area Manager, the grievance shall be presented in writing to the Labor Relations office.
A grievance meeting with the General Manager/Director or his/her designee, Labor Relations Representative, and the employee’s Union Business Representative or his/her designee shall be held within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the grievance being recorded, in an attempt to resolve the grievance. The General Manager/Director or his/her designee shall provide the Union Business Representative or his/her designee with a written reply within five (5) calendar days after the parties have met. If the General Manager/Director or his/her designee fails to give a written reply within the time limit provided, grievance may be appealed to the next step of the Grievance Procedure.
Step 3. If the grievance shall have been submitted but not adjusted under Step 2, either party may within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the written reply request in writing that the grievance be submitted to a Joint Standing Committee, which shall meet within fourteen (14) calendar days of the appeal, unless extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
The Joint Standing Committee shall consist of one (1) representative of the Company and one (1) representative of the affiliated Union(s).
The Joint Standing Committee shall meet at least twice per month to investigate, review, and if necessary, conduct a hearing of all outstanding grievances referred to it. Decisions of the Joint Standing Committee shall be final and binding upon all parties at interest. The Joint Standing Committee shall provide a written determination of all cases reviewed within three (3) calendar days after it has met. If the Joint Standing Committee is unable to resolve a grievance before it, the grievance may be appealed to the next step of the Grievance Procedure.
The parties agree that upon notification of the Labor Relations Executive or their designee and the President of the Service Trades Council Union, Step 3 of the grievance procedure may be waived and grievances addressing institutional issues, affecting either the Company or the Council, may be expedited to Step 4.
Step 4. If the grievance shall have been submitted but not adjusted under Step 3, either party may within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of the written reply request in writing that the grievance be submitted to an Arbitrator selected from a panel of seven (7) Arbitrators furnished by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS). The moving party shall be responsible for requesting the list
22
from the FMCS within seven (7) days of the request for Arbitration. At this point, the parties have a maximum of fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the list is received, to strike the panel or mutually agree to an Arbitrator. The Rules for the FMCS shall govern the selection of an Arbitrator and the conduct of the arbitration hearing. Unless agreed upon in writing by both parties, the Arbitration hearing must be scheduled to occur within thirty (30) days from selection of the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall not have the authority to alter, amend, change, modify, add to or subtract from or reform any provision, Article or language of this Agreement. The Decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties with no further appeal, except for reasons of setting aside an Arbitrator’s Award, as set forth in applicable Federal and Florida Statutes. Any joint expense incidental to or arising out of the arbitration shall be borne equally by the Company and the appropriate Union. Only one grievance shall be before a specific Arbitrator at one time.

ARTICLE 28	- ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY
For purposes of this Agreement, the terms “drug” or “drug tests” shall include both drugs and alcohol, as appropriate. The Employer and the Union recognize that many areas of the Employer's operations involve hazardous work with the potential for personal injury or property damage and that all areas involve directly or indirectly the public at large. Therefore, it must endeavor to provide safe and efficient operations for the protection and benefit of the general public, its customers and its employees. As part of its effort to achieve that goal, it must require that its work be performed by employees who do not use illegal drugs or misuse controlled substances and/or alcohol as follows:
SECTION 1.	The Company recognizes that employees have a right to privacy and that any adverse action taken against any employee for off-duty conduct shall take into account the employee's right to privacy and the impact of the employee's conduct on his/her job performance, the Company's reputation, or the public's perception of the Company's contract performance. Any disciplinary action for such drug-related conduct will be subject to the Grievance Procedure. With respect to any alleged off-duty related conduct, the arbitrator will be specifically instructed to balance the employee's right to privacy in his/her off-duty time with other legitimate job-related concerns in weighing the contractual propriety of disciplinary action.
SECTION 2.	Bargaining unit employees will be subject to drug and alcohol testing under the following circumstances:
(a)	Where there is an objective reasonable basis that an employee has an in-system presence of any illegal drug, controlled substance or alcohol, hereinafter referred to as “substances,” while on duty or on Company property immediately preceding or following the work shift. For
29
purposes of this Agreement, the terms “employee” or “bargaining unit employee” includes not only persons employed in positions covered by the STCU Agreement, but also persons being recalled into such positions.
(b)	As part of a post-accident investigation in cases where:
1.	The individual(s) subject to testing is directly linked to the accident.
2.	The accident resulted in death, injury requiring medical treatment other than basic first aid, or property damage estimated to exceed $4,500.00.
3.	One or more motor vehicle incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requiring the motor vehicle to be transported away from the scene by the tow truck or other motor vehicle. Testing associated with an accident will take place as soon as possible, under the circumstances.
(c)	A government agency duly concerned with Walt Disney World Co. (e.g. Department of Transportation, etc.) advises the Company that employees in specified classifications will be required to undergo job certification physical examinations, including drug tests as a condition of future employment. In such instances, the Union shall be given immediate notice of any such requirement or proposed requirement. Such testing shall be conducted in accordance with the government regulations and the procedures established by this Agreement and shall not commence until the Union and the Company have had a reasonable opportunity to discuss the impact of the government directive.
(d)	Random testing as part of follow-up to rehabilitation and only for a reasonable period of time after rehabilitation supervised by the Company’s Employee Assistance Program, or any successor thereto, not to exceed one year.
(e)	A random drug/alcohol testing program may be implemented for certain positions within this Agreement. If such a decision is made the Company will meet and agree with the affected individual Union affiliate regarding the positions subject to random drug/alcohol testing, the date of implementation and the logistics of the program. Employees transferring into any such position will be subject to drug testing prior to transfer. Such positions that are deemed to be subject to a random drug/alcohol testing pool will include testing of the same substances and at the same levels described in Section 9 below.
(f)	Employees transferring into positions for which the Company requires pre-employment testing will be subject to such testing prior to transfer.
SECTION 3.	An employee will not be tested under Section 2(a) above unless his/her actions and/or conduct or other related circumstances provide an objective reasonable basis to believe that the employee may have ingested drugs or alcohol and/or is suffering from impairment that will in some way adversely affect his/her alertness, coordination, reaction, response, safety, or the safety of others, while on duty or on Company property. Where possible, this shall be discussed with the Union Shop Steward. Such observation will be confirmed by another member of supervision wherever possible and will be documented. Employees will not be subject to such testing without the express consent of a senior member of Management different from the observation Supervisor, and prior notification to and consent of Labor Relations.
SECTION 4.	Any employee directed for testing shall be advised of his/her right to the presence of a Shop Steward before any pre-test meetings with Management. Provided a Shop Steward has been requested and is available, no specimen will be collected until the Shop Steward can discuss the matter with Management. The Union agrees that the procedures described in Sections 3 and 4 shall not operate in a manner that will impede timely collection of a biological specimen. Refusal to provide a biological specimen will result in immediate discharge without an opportunity at a later date to reconsider/retract the refusal.
30
SECTION 5.	Any employee who tests negative to any drug test under this Agreement (other than follow-up testing to rehabilitation) shall be compensated for all lost time, at the appropriate wage rate. Time lost under such circumstances shall be treated as time worked for purposes of premium eligibility.
SECTION 6.	Specimen collection for a drug test will be accomplished in a manner compatible with employee dignity and privacy. There will be no strip searches or opposite sex observation. In the usual case, the Company will not observe specimen production, but the Union agrees that specimen production may be closely monitored in those cases where the Company has a specific objective reason to believe that the employee may attempt to contaminate a test specimen. Any evidence of any form of tampering, altering, or diluting of a specimen will result in discharge.
SECTION 7.	Test specimens shall be sent only to laboratory facilities certified by an appropriate federal or state agency. The drug test laboratory and the specimen collection facility must establish and maintain a forensically acceptable chain of custody. It will be the burden of the Company to establish, in any case arising from a positive test result, that the appropriate chain of custody has been maintained.
If a dispute should arise over the selection of drug test laboratories, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration. The laboratory(s) selected must, upon request, identify the drugs tested for, the methods used, the manufacturers of the test, the analytical limits and levels used, the methods of reporting results and the chain of custody procedures used to produce forensically acceptable test results. To be qualified under this Section, the laboratory must participate in a program of “blind proficiency” testing where they analyze samples sent by an independent party.
SECTION 8.	The drug test will be performed utilizing urinalysis to screen for the following substances:
Amphetamines
Cocaine
Marijuana
Opiates
Phencyclidine
The initial test shall use an immunoassay that meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for Commercial Distribution. All specimens identified as positive in the initial test will be confirmed by a second procedure. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry or an equivalent scientifically acceptable method of confirmation will be used. All confirmed positive test results will be verified by a Medical Review Officer prior to release to the Company. The Medical Review Officer, upon written request from the employee, will report test results to the Union Business Agent. The Union agrees that Florida Hospital Centra Care is an acceptable Medical Review Officer but reserves the right to withhold approval of University Services with adequate notice in the event that Florida Hospital Centra Care status should change in the future.
SECTION 9.	The standard drug test thresholds for positive screen and GC/MS confirmation
tests shall be the same as those called out in the Federal Register, and may be modified whenever changed by the Department of Health and Human Services as advances in technology or other considerations warrant identification of new substances and/or concentrations.
In the event that the Company elects to utilize tests other than the EMIT screen or the GC/MS Confirmation, the Company will give the Union written notice of the test methodology used and the threshold levels employed. Positive thresholds for any other test methodologies will be reviewed with the Union before they are applied. Any dispute over the acceptability of such alternative test methodologies or the positive test threshold to be applied shall be resolved by arbitration. It will be the burden of the Company to establish the acceptability of the test and the reasonableness of the threshold.
31
SECTION 10.	The laboratory shall preserve a sufficient aliquot specimen as to permit independent confirmatory testing by the employee and follow-up re-analysis at the request of the Union or the Employer. Any re-analysis performed will be done on the original sample provided. The Medical Review Officer shall endeavor to notify the Employer and the employee of positive test results within five (5) working days after receipt of the specimen. The employee may request, in writing, a re-analysis within three (3) working days from notice of positive test result. Additionally or as an alternative, the employee may have the sample tested at a certified laboratory of his/her choice. Should this test result be negative, the test results will be considered negative.
SECTION 11.	Initial tests and re-analysis requested by the Company will be paid by the Company; costs of re-analysis for reconciliation will be split between the employee and the Company. In the event the initial test is proven to be a false positive the employee shall be reimbursed for cost of test procedures paid for by the employee.
SECTION 12.	The drug test laboratory and the specimen collection facility must establish and maintain a forensically acceptable chain of custody. It will be the burden of the Company to establish, in any case arising from a positive test result, that the appropriate chain of custody has been maintained.
SECTION 13.	Where employees are required under this policy to submit blood samples for alcohol testing, the samples will be taken in an appropriate collection facility. The collection facility and laboratory will use the same or equivalent chain of custody procedures and exercise the same or an equivalent level of professional care and scientifically accepted standards and procedures in the collection and testing of blood samples for the presence of alcohol as with urine samples for the presence of drugs. For the purposes of this policy if a test reveals the presence of alcohol at a level of .08% or more by weight, it shall be presumed that the employee has violated this policy. If the test reveals the presence of alcohol in excess of .05% by weight, but less than .08%, the results of the test will be considered along with all other relevant information (e.g. employee conduct, speech, performance, etc.) in determining whether the employee is in violation of this policy. If a test reveals the presence of alcohol of less than .05% by weight, it shall be presumed that the employee is not under the influence of alcohol in violation of this policy. The presumption regarding the presence of alcohol of less than .05% by weight is rebuttable based on consideration of all other relevant information (e.g., employee conduct, speech, performance, etc.). The Company bears the burden of proof in rebutting such presumption. In the event an employee objects to alcohol testing by blood sample, the Company will test the employee through an evidentiary alcohol breath analyzer which conforms to the same standards as cited above.
The parties agree that use of an evidentiary alcohol breath analyzer, which is properly calibrated and which is operated by a certified technician, shall be conclusive proof of the accuracy of the results.
Furthermore, the Company reserves the right to abandon blood samples in favor of the alcohol breath analyzer referenced above.
SECTION 14.	Any employee who has a confirmed positive test will be required to participate in the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Failure to seek and receive EAP assistance or failure to abide by the terms and conditions or prescribed treatment will be grounds for discharge. If an employee is subject to disciplinary action under existing practices, the use of substances shall not be a defense to circumvent existing practices or to avoid disciplinary action. Participation in the EAP shall be taken into account in considering appropriate disciplinary action. No employee shall be discharged as a result of a positive drug or alcohol test pursuant to Section 2(a), (b), (e) or (f) above, so long as he or she agrees to participate in an EAP, the cost of which will be covered by Company-provided health insurance to the extent required by the plan terms. In instances where it is necessary, a leave of absence may be granted for treatment or rehabilitation through the EAP for substances on the same basis as it is granted for other medical conditions.
SECTION 15.	Test results shall be communicated by the Medical Review Officer, or the designated Company representative. The Company shall be responsible for maintaining confidentiality of test records and test results will be communicated to job site Management strictly on a “need to know”
32
basis. Employee drug test records shall not be released outside the Walt Disney World Co. unless required by administrative action initiated by the employee or the Union. The employee shall be entitled to written notification of positive drug test results. Copies of such reports will be provided to the Union when authorized in writing by the affected employee.
SECTION 16.	Except in the case of a positive random test after referral to the EAP which shall be conclusive proof of just cause for termination, when and if it becomes necessary to impose discipline for drug-related conduct or job performance, discipline will be judged by the contractual just cause standard and will be subject to the Grievance/arbitration Procedure. Except to the extent the employee(s) withholds written consent as to particular documents personal to him, the Company agrees to provide the Union, in advance, with whatever documentation or information the Union reasonably requires to process the grievance and/or arbitration. By establishing this policy, neither the Company nor the Union waive any legal rights. The parties agree that this drug policy shall not diminish the rights of individual employees under state or federal law relating to drug testing.
SECTION 17.	The Company shall provide education for Management personnel regarding observation techniques, the availability and desirability of the Employee Assistance Programs and the need for observing strict confidentiality. Supervisors will be provided guidelines for maintaining confidentiality of all drug-related information and referring employees who may have a problem to appropriate counseling.
SECTION 18.	The Company agrees that it shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all complaints, claims, judgments, or demands that may arise out of, or in any way are related to, the Union's negotiation or participation in the foregoing drug policy applicable to bargaining unit employees and applicants, or the Company's activities in carrying out this drug testing program.
ARTICLE 29 - TERM OF AGREEMENT
SECTION 1.	TERM
This Agreement and any further amendment or supplement hereto shall be in full force and effect from March 30, 2014 and from year to year thereafter, subject to the right of either party to terminate the same at the anniversary of September 21, 2019 upon the giving of written notice of termination not later than sixty (60) days next preceding the effective date of such termination. Subsequently, the PT STCU Contract will automatically extend for sixty (60) days from the ratification of the Regular Full Time STCU Contract. Additionally, the parties agree that the Regular Full Time STCU negotiated economics (applicable to the PT STCU Contract) will apply to the PT STCU Employees.
SECTION 2.	COMPLETE AGREEMENT
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties, after the exercise of that right and opportunity, are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, the Company and the Union, for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered in this Agreement, except as provided specifically in Section 2 or 3 of this Article, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
33
SECTION 3.	LIMITED REOPENER
The parties agree to reopen the Contract upon written notice no later than sixty (60) days preceding September 24, 2017 solely to negotiate wage increases in accordance with Article 12, Section 1 and Addendum A. If the parties are unable to reach agreement regarding wages, thirty (30) days after September 24, 2017, the Agreement shall expire unless mutually extended by the parties.

Addendum B-1
UNITE HERE! Local 737
All Food and Beverage, Culinary and Stewarding
The Food and Beverage Policies and Procedures are applicable only when the Cast Member is working in a job classification to which the specific policy applies, e.g., If a Food and Beverage Cast Member transfers from a non-tipped position to a tipped position or vice-versa the applicable guidelines will be applied automatically without having to go through the re- signing process.
There will be a minimum of one (1) schedule bid per year for Food and Beverage Cast Members.
Walkouts, food allergy procedure violations and explanations to the Guest of the gratuity policy shall not result in automatic discipline.
FOOD AND BEVERAGE TIPPED
Service Charge for Parties of Six (6) or more
An eighteen percent (18%) service charge will be included on all guest checks of parties of six (6) or more.
1.	The guests will be advised of the policy by the first Host/ess (i.e., DRC, Guest Services, Concierge, or Seating Host/ess) to accept the guest's reservations.
2.	In addition to the above, the policy will be printed on the menus.
3.	If a party of six (6) or more, regardless of reservation size, arrives and is seated at the same table and receives separate checks, the automatic service charge shall apply.
4.	If a party of six (6) or more arrives and, for whatever reason, is split and seated at separate tables, with the same server regardless of the number of checks, the automatic service charge shall apply.
5.	If the party of six (6) or more arrives and, for whatever reason, is split, seated at separate tables with different servers, receives separate checks, and these checks are paid for by separate individuals, the automatic service charge does not apply.
6.	In situations where our guests refuse to comply with our policy, it will be the responsibility of the service person to locate a Manager prior to the guests leaving the restaurant so that Management can speak with the guests. If the service person fails to involve a Manager in the situation prior to the guests departing the restaurant, or receives discipline for poor service, the Company will not be responsible for the difference between what the guest left and eighteen percent (18%) of the guest's food and beverage total.
7.	The eighteen percent (18%) service charge will be automatically added to the guest check and will be calculated on the food and beverage totals. The server will not be required to inform the guest that a service charge has been included, unless he/she is asked by the guest.
8.	A twenty percent (20%) service charge will be automatically added to parties of six (6) or more only at Victoria and Albert's. With exception to the amount of the gratuity, all of the above aforementioned is applicable to Victoria and Albert's.
Gratuities/Fees
1.	Gratuities will be paid on food and beverage totals only. Gratuities will not be paid on miscellaneous pricing, including but not limited to merchandise, entertainment, (excluding Spirit of Aloha, Hoop-Dee-Doo, and Character Dining restaurants, where entertainment is included in the price), house charges, imaging, etc. Merchandise will only be included in the total food and beverage price for the purpose of
44
gratuity calculation if the Server is required by the Company to handle and deliver merchandise items to the guest as part of the Guest’s dining experience. Gratuities will not be paid on autograph books, pens and disposable cameras.
2.	Should the Company decide to reinstate package plans with automatic gratuity included, the parties agree the terms of the addendum expiring on April, 28, 2007 will remain in effect.
3.	An automatic gratuity of eighteen percent (18%) will be added for supplemental food and beverage purchased at prepaid venues (i.e., Spirit of Aloha, Hoop-Dee-Doo, Cinderella’s Royal Table, Princess Tea, Special Pre-paid events such as New Year’s Eve at California Grill.
4.	The Company agrees to negotiate with the Union, the application of the automatic gratuity for any future pre-paid venues, for the life of this agreement.
5.	An automatic eighteen percent (18%) will be added for food and beverage purchased from the Golf Carts, Pizza Delivery and Private Dining.
6.	It is the Company's understanding that when a business requires their guests to pay a Predetermined charge, which is given to employees of the business, the charges are considered a service charge. Furthermore, service charges are not considered a tip, but rather, are wages paid by the employer. Consequently, the tax code requires the Company to withhold taxes on all service charges.
7.	It is the responsibility of all service persons to report one-hundred percent (100%) of their tips and gratuities for income tax purposes. The Company will continue to report eight percent (8%) of the location's gross sales to the government and will withhold tax on the tips and gratuities declared by the employee to the Company. The Company reserves the right to amend and/or alter this position to conform to state and federal laws.
8.	Under Wage and Hour laws, the Company is required to report tips and service charges in overtime situations.
9.	An eighteen percent (18%) service charge will be added for Company sponsored Cast discounts, e.g. Cast Serving Cast, Cast discounted meals, and Cast Celebration discounted meals. The service charge will be based on the total Food and Beverage charges before any discounts have been applied. This provision does not apply to Tables in Wonderland and Disney Vacation Club.
10.	An automatic gratuity of eighteen percent (18%) will be added for all guests using Tables in Wonderland, based on the retail value of the Food and Beverage.
Transfers for Food and Beverage Tipped Employees
1.	A Food and Beverage tipped employee interested in transferring to a new location must:
(a)	Have six (6) months of previous employment in a Food and Beverage tipped classification.
(b)	Fill out a Food and Beverage tipped transfer form once a year. The employee may indicate on this form a maximum of five (5) restaurants where he/she may wish to transfer.
2.	In order to be considered for an open Regular Full Time Server position, the employee must be on the Casting skill code list at the time the requisition is opened. The employee selected for the position will be notified by Casting and automatically transferred to the open position. The position will be filled by eligible Cast in the following order:
•	Regular Full Time Food and Beverage Service Host/ess (T), by seniority.
•	Regular Part Time Food and Beverage Service Host/ess (T), statused to the restaurant with the opening, by seniority.
•	All Regular Full Time Food and Beverage Assistants (T), statused to the restaurant with the opening, by seniority.

•	All Non-STCU employees.
3.	Should an employee decline a position, they will be required to wait six (6) months before being eligible to post for another transfer.
4.	Employees transferring to Victoria and Albert’s will be required to participate in an interview with location Management prior to transferring. The final hiring decision remains within Management’s discretion.
5.	Food and Beverage Tipped employees who transfer to the same classification shall be placed on a twenty-eight (28) day qualifying period. If the Company determines during the twenty-eight (28) day qualifying period that the employee’s performance is not satisfactory, or if the employee requests a return within the twenty-eight (28) days, the Company will return the employee to his/her prior location. For new property openings the twenty-eight (28) qualifying period will begin on the day the restaurant opens to Guests.
Work Status and Utilization of Regular Part Time Tipped Employees
Tipped employees will be considered Part Time if they customarily work less than thirty (30) hours per week on an ongoing basis, or if they customarily work thirty (30) hours per week or more but less than seven (7) months per year. The aforementioned definition supersedes the definitions negotiated in the Main Body of both the 2014 Regular Full Time and Regular Part Time Service Trades Council agreements.
Table Service
1.	Split shifts may be added to the location’s schedule bid at Management’s discretion after advance notification and discussion with the Union. Turnabout pay as outlined in Article 11, Section 6(a) and will be waived.

46
4.	The Company agrees to pay all guaranteed gratuities for BEO’s when collected, and with respect to all other guaranteed gratuities, they will not be paid unless services are rendered (i.e. entree has been served).
5.	Regular Full Time food and Beverage Dinner Show Servers who are 7(i) and trained in the Catering location may pick up Catering shifts at 11:00 a.m., provided it will not result in overtime or double time at any time during the payroll work week.
Dinner Show Rotation
The following process shall be followed with regard to the rotation of Food and Beverage Service Host/ess at the Spirit of Aloha and Hoop-Dee-Doo Review Dinner Shows:
1.	Once a Dinner Show Server’s vacation schedule has been posted, it may no longer be canceled or modified, without Management approval.
2.	Servers who are statused as 7(i) will automatically be scheduled a sixth (6th) day, providing work is available, prior to Part Time Dinner Show Servers, being scheduled to work. Regular Part Time Servers will be scheduled to any remaining shifts based on their availability. If any shifts remain, 7(i) servers who have requested a seventh (7th) day will be scheduled. 7(i) and then non-7(i) servers will be scheduled to any remaining shifts. Servers will be allowed to preference their sixth (6th) and seventh (7th) work day.
3.	When the schedule is posted, scheduled Regular Part Time servers and 7(i) servers scheduled on a sixth (6th) or seventh (7th) day will not be assigned to a station.
4.	On the day of the show, if all stations are seated, any vacant stations (e.g. vacations, MLOA, etc.) will be covered by the server, (7(i) or Part Time), scheduled to work, but not assigned a station, or the server called to work. This may also be a Regular Full Time or Regular Part Time server. The server called to work will not be told what station(s) are available.
5.	On the day of the show, if not all stations are seated, vacant stations (e.g. vacations, MLOA, etc.) will be covered by moving a server from a closed station. A station is considered “closed” when no table within the station has been assigned. Dinner Show Servers will not be moved to cover a call-in if one (1) or more tables within their station are assigned.
6.	Every reasonable attempt to contact a Regular Full Time and/or Regular Part Time Dinner Show Server to cover a vacancy will be made, prior to contacting a Casual Limited Employee (CTs).
7.	The call line will continue to be utilized to communicate stations that are open.
8.	A Dinner Show Server requesting a day off after the schedule has been posted is required to request the time off through the HUB. If the request comes on the day prior to the day in question, the Dinner Show Server must still utilize the Portal system and, in addition, contact a Manager for approval. Day of requests will not be honored.
Private Dining
1.	Private Dining, when available, will staff all functions in guest room suites.
2.	The Company agrees to maintain Private Dining Bussers for the life of this agreement.
3.	A three dollar ($3.00) fee will be paid for delivery of Private Dining amenities.
4.	Private Dining Servers will be paid full gratuity on guest walkouts or if an order is cancelled after the Server has left the Private Dining area, based on the expectation that the Server is providing timely and efficient service.

shift Bellmen. Daily staffing will continue to be accomplished utilizing a traditional master schedule in accordance with operational requirements.
1.	★ Management will calculate the top fifty percent (50%) of Regular Full Time employees excluding graveyard by seniority prior to the scheduling process. If an uneven number of people result, Management will round off to the next whole number, e.g., 6.2 = 7. Should an employee in the top fifty percent (50%) select a floater line, then the top senior employee not in the top fifty percent (50%) shall be included.
When creating the pool of shifts for employees to select from, Management will include all shifts that are anticipated to be needed on a regular basis until the next schedule bid.
In order of seniority, the top fifty percent (50%) of eligible employees in the department will participate in the selection of their individual schedule. Those individuals will select their shifts within the following parameters:
•	Employees must select two (2) consecutive days off. In the event that a Cast Member voluntarily requests split days off, it may be granted based on Management discretion.
•	Employees must select all a.m. shifts by day (a.m. is a start time by noon) or all p.m. shifts, by day (p.m. is a start time after noon). In the event that a Cast Member voluntarily requests a mix of a.m. and p.m. shifts, it may be granted based on Management discretion.
2.	★ Management will then create the remaining lines. The employees will then make their selections in accordance with seniority:
•	Fifty percent (50%) of all lines excluding third shift will be cherry pick. If an uneven number of people result, Management will round off to the next whole number, e.g., 6.2 = 7
•	Up to twenty-five percent (25%) of all lines excluding third shift will be p.m. floats. If an uneven number of people result, Management will round off to the next whole number, e.g., 6.2 = 7
•	All remaining lines excluding third shift will be floats consisting of a.m. and/or p.m. shifts
•	Twenty-five percent (25%) of the p.m. floats and twenty-five percent (25%) of the floater lines will have days off assigned
•	In the event that an a.m./p.m. float Cast Member floats into a p.m. line, who ever has the greater seniority will have the preference on the more desired shift
•	The floater schedule will cover vacation relief
3.	If available, a Regular Part Time employee will be scheduled to cover the third shift in the event the employee who has bid that line is on vacation, a leave of absence, or in the event of any vacancy, for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. If a Regular Part Time employee is not available, the least senior available Regular Full Time T-2 employee will be assigned this shift, for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days per calendar year. Once the least senior available employee has worked sixty (60) cumulative days in a calendar year, shifts will then be filled by the next least senior available employee.
4.	★ When Management changes a selected bid schedule for an employee due to business necessity, all shifts that are available, including floater shifts, will be available for selection by the affected employee by seniority. If a more senior employee has selected a floater line, then that employee will select his/her shift first. The remaining shifts will be assigned to floaters by seniority. All shifts that cannot be scheduled will then be covered by Regular Part Time employees. Regular Part Time employees will be scheduled last.
★ This provision only applies to Regular Full Time employees
79
(a)	Management will make every reasonable attempt to contact affected employees for a schedule change within forty-eight (48) hours. This will allow affected employees to select a new shift from available shifts prior to the weekly schedule posting. If, for any reason, employees cannot be contacted within forty-eight (48) hours, Management will assign a schedule as close to the bid line as possible and continue the schedule posting.
(b)	If schedule changes are necessary after a posted schedule, then Management has the right to make schedule changes as required to manage the operation without references to the preposting process.
(c)	A minimum of two (2) schedule picks/bids per year will be conducted.
Upon transfer to a new resort, existing Regular Full Time Bell Services Tipped Employees will be eligible to exercise his/her seniority for time of day, hours per week, and location as a float Cast Member until the time of the next schedule bid. This provision does not apply to days off.
5.	★ If Full Time lines are added to the schedule in-between bids, and have been available for forty-five (45) days or longer.
When Full Time lines are added to the schedule either by converting Regular Part Time shifts or by business necessity, they will be filled through the transfer procedure and not by first converting affected Regular Part Time employees to Regular Full Time. If there are no Regular Full Time candidates from ReCasting (including T-2 third-shift personnel), Management may then fill the position through Regular Part Time conversion or the new hire process.
6.	★ Regular Full Time/Regular Part Time Mix
The Company agrees to preserve seventy percent (70%) of the total hours paid in Bell Services Tipped to Regular Full Time employees; the premium segment of resorts will not drop below seventy percent (70%). In the event the monthly average falls below seventy percent (70%) the Company will open Regular Full Time positions within forty-five (45) days to bring Full Time hours with-in compliance. The penalty for the Company's failure to not adhere to the above set guidelines by adding Full Time lines within forty-five (45) days after failing to maintain a seventy percent (70%) average of Full Time monthly hours will be as follows:
The employee on the top of the Casting skill code list for the open position will receive a payment of twenty dollars ($20.00) per day for each day from the time the grievance is filed with Labor Relations until the transfer process has been initiated.
7.	Scheduled third-shift (Graveyard) T-2 employees will be paid the appropriate Hospitality Host/ess rate between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. In addition, any employee covering a third shift line due to call sick, etc., will be paid the appropriate Hospitality Host/ess rate between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. This does not apply to employees whose shifts overlap into this time period for any reason.
★ Employees covered under the one (1) year rule (Article 13, Section 7) will be subject to bargaining unit seniority to bid shifts after employees with one (1) or more years in the Bell Service classification have made their selections. Seniority of those employees transferring from a non-tipped area who have transferred into a T-2 position will be by seniority date based on the date of transfer, until able to exercise Company seniority in the schedule bid process. The new hire seniority date will be honored after the transfer’s seniority has been considered.
Shop Stewards
T-2 Shop Stewards will be paid at their appropriate Hospitality Host/ess rate for the actual time (rounded to the nearest tenth) when they are taken out of rotation at Management’s request. The Shop Steward Card will be kept in rotation, and, if front missed, Bellman becomes first person up.
★ This provision only applies to Regular Full Time employees
80
★ Transfer Procedures
In order to be considered for an open Regular Full Time Bell Services position, the employee must be on the Casting skill code list for each specific Resort at the time the requisition is opened.
