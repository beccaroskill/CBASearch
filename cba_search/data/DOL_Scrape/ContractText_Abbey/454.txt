In making promotions as provided for in Article V hereof the Company will be the judge of competency.
8
ARTICLE IV (continued)
The provisions of this article will not abridge the rights of employees as set forth in any applicable provisions of this agreement.
ARTICLE V
Promotions-Demotions-Reductions
(a)	Vacancies and new jobs covered by this agreement will be filled on the basis of seniority and competency. Competency being sufficient, seniority in the various units as hereinafter defined will prevail, except that vacancies or new jobs in the classification of laboratory instrument technician I, laboratory instrument technician II, meter tester, assistant meter tester, and assistant telecommunications electrician will be filled on the basis of competency, and in filling such vacancies or new jobs, seniority will be considered only if competency is equal. Seniority will be reckoned by the following units: (1) generating plants and Birmingham Steam Heating System as a group; (2) General Shops as a separate unit; (3) Instrument Service Center as a separate unit; (4) Appliance Service; (5) Telecommunications Electricians; (6) the Birmingham geographic Division, including the General Warehouse, General Garage and Corporate Fleet Services as a group; (7) Eastern geographic Division; (8) Southern geographic Division; (9) Western geographic Division; (10) Mobile geographic Division; and (11) Southeast geographic division. To effectuate the seniority provisions of this agreement,
9
ARTICLE V (continued)
new seniority lists will be prepared and distributed by the Company dated December 31 and June 30 of each year, the midyear list being limited to employees' names and seniority. Such lists will include all employees to whom any seniority had accrued as of that date, arranged according to the foregoing eleven (11) units. Such lists will be revised semiannually and will determine seniority of employees therein. In making such revisions the position of the employees in their respective lists will be rated according to the added time which has accrued to them in their respective unit.
For the purpose of determining seniority, service with the Company will be deemed to be continuous unless it has been interrupted for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months. Seniority will not accrue during layoffs due to lack of work. Seniority will accrue during interruptions in service because of illness; leave of absence for Union business; leaves required by law under the Family Medical Leave Act; during periods of suspension due to disciplinary reasons; leave required by law for military service; brief absences for persona! business; or any mutually agreed upon reasons. Any employee who voluntarily resigns from the service of the Company or who has been rightfully discharged will forfeit all previous seniority rights. In the event two (2) or more employees are employed on the same date, seniority of such employees will be determined by the date of birth of such employees.
10
ARTICLE V (continued)
Service with the company will continue to accumulate during disciplinary layoff or suspension with respect to an employee's eligibility for vacation.
(b)	When vacancies or new jobs occur in any unit, to fill which there are no available qualified employees in such unit, and employees are transferred from other units into such unit to fill such vacancies or new jobs, their seniority in the new unit to which they are transferred will be that which accumulates during the first twelve (12) months in the new unit. After twelve (12) months in the new unit, their seniority will be their seniority in their former unit plus seniority accumulated in the new unit. When vacancies or new jobs are filled by transferring employees from other departments or jobs not covered by this agreement, their seniority in the unit to which they are transferred will be that which accumulates during the first twelve (12) months in the new unit. After twelve (12) months in the new unit, their seniority will be based on the length of their continuous service with the Company, if this continuous service began in a classification covered by the bargaining unit, plus seniority accumulated during the first twelve (12) months in the new unit. When employees are transferred to the Instrument Service Center from another unit to their former seniority unit, their seniority will be the same as in the unit from which they were transferred. Seniority of ail employees laid off for lack of work will not be lost unless their respective employment is interrupted for more than twenty-four (24) con
11
ARTICLE V (continued)
secutive months during which such employees do not work for or make time with the Company unless they are offered employment in their former or equivalent classification at locations designated by the employees and they fail to accept the same and report for work within a period of two (2) weeks. When it is necessary to increase forces of the Company in the classifications covered by this agreement, former employees whose employment was discontinued by the Company through a reduction of forces and whose seniority has not been lost will be offered re-employment on the basis of seniority at the locations designated by the employee provided they are available and competent. In the event a vacancy or new job is not filled as set forth above preferential consideration will be given to former employees whose seniority has been lost. However, refusal of temporary employment will not constitute grounds for interrupting seniority. An interruption of employment due to leave of absence will not cause employees to lose their seniority, but seniority will not accumulate except as provided for in this Article V (a). Any employee who voluntarily resigns from the service of the Company, or who has been rightfully discharged, will lose all previous seniority rights and other rights growing out of previous continuous service with the Company.
(c)	Competency for filling a job will be construed as requiring of the employee:
1.	The necessary mental and physical qualifications of the individual to do
12
ARTICLE V (continued)
the job satisfactorily.
2.	The necessary training and experience to perform the essential duties of the job, either immediately or after a brief breaking-in period [two (2) to three (3) weeks] at the new location or job; it being understood that a new worker in a job would not usually display the same proficiency as one who had been in the job longer.
3.	For promotions to any classification above that of helper, the necessary ability to progress within a reasonable time to the next higher classification in the particular line of work and to fill such classifications satisfactorily, and ultimately to progress to the classification of journeyman. For promotion to subforeman, lead lineman or lead cable splicer, the necessary ability to progress to and substitute for foreman.
(d)	A classification will be deemed to be "higher” if the maximum schedule rate of pay is higher.
(e)	Vacancies or new jobs in any classification except that of helper will be filled on the basis of seniority and competency by promoting or transferring employees unless there are no qualified employees available and except as otherwise provided herein. In the event of such vacancy or new job, the Company will
13
ARTICLE V (continued)
promptly post notice on the official bulletin boards of the unit affected [except as set out in sub-paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) below], and will promptly mail copies of such notices to the representatives of the Brotherhood designated to receive such notices in the respective units. Vacancies within line crews will be posted by location and not by supervisor or crew. When the new employee arrives at the new location, a selection process at that location by seniority will determine which employee fills the vacant position. This process will continue until all vacancies are filled. A good faith effort will be made to communicate all permanent jobs posted from all seniority units across the Company. The Company's failure to comply with this provision will not be subject to the grievance procedure. All notices will clearly identify vacancies or new jobs as to location. Exchange of the position of employees in the same classification between crews in the same line of work at the same location may be arranged by agreement between a Local Union representing such employees and the Company, however, nothing herein will be construed to prevent temporary transfers of employees between crews. Notices of job vacancies will be sent only to the President of each Local affected and to the System Council U-19, with the understanding that any employee who so desires may make application for such job vacancies and such applications will be considered in the event the job is not filled from within the seniority unit. The Company will likewise post notice as promptly as possible in the event any job becomes vacant and
14
ARTICLE V (continued)
is to be discontinued. The Company may fill a vacancy or new job temporarily with any available qualified employee. In filling any such vacancy or new job temporarily at any location the Company will endeavor to utilize local employees, taking into account seniority and competency; it being understood that they must be able to perform the necessary duties of the job. Time spent in filling any such vacancy or new job temporarily, and experience gained while thus employed, will not militate against any other employee of greater seniority who may make application for the jobs as provided for later in this Article V. Such employees filling vacancies or new jobs temporarily will be paid at the minimum rate of pay for the vacancies or new jobs while so temporarily employed, unless their regular rate of pay is higher, in which event they will continue to receive their regular rate of pay. For a period of ten (10) days after the notice is posted any employee in the unit affected may apply for transfer to the vacancy or new job. Application blanks for this purpose will be provided by the Company at each local office, and crew headquarters; or application may be made by letter. One (1) copy will be sent to the respective Company representative of the unit affected as follows: Manager-Metering Services/Testing for the Instrument Service Center; Manager-Fleet Services for the General Garage and Fleet Garage; Manager-Material Services for the Corporate Materials Distribution Center and the Division Managers for the respective geographic divisions. One copy will be retained by the employee. No
15
ARTICLE V (continued)
application will be considered unless it reaches the above-named Company representative of the unit affected within ten (10) days after the notice of vacancy or new job is posted. Within twenty-five (25) days after the notice of vacancy or new job is posted, the Company will designate an employee from the qualified applicants, if any, to fill the vacancy or new job and will promptly post notice on the official bulletin boards of the unit affected (except as set out below) of the employee so designated. A copy of such notice will be sent only to the President of the Local Union of the location affected and to the System Council U-19. Applicants from the unit to whom a job is awarded will have five (5) days within which to accept or decline such job after the date when such award is posted and will promptly notify their respective immediate supervisor in writing of their decision to accept or decline such job, but if no such notice is given the supervisor, the employees will be deemed to have accepted the job awarded them. Employees may decline no more than one (1) vacancy or new job awarded them during a calendar year. If the employee to whom the job is awarded declines the job, the Company will proceed promptly to fill same from the remainder of the list of bidders, if any be qualified, without reposting the vacancy subject to the same conditions governing the original award. If the vacancy or new job is filled by an applicant from the unit but is not filled according to seniority, the filling will be considered as temporary for a further period of fifteen (15) days after the notice of the filling of the vacancy or
16
ARTICLE V (continued)
new job is posted, during which time it may be made the basis of a grievance. In cases where no applications are received from qualified employees within the unit, applications received from employees in other units will be considered and notices will be posted on the same basis as set out above. In cases where no applications are received from qualified employees, the vacancy or new job will be filled from any available source and notice to the effect will likewise be posted company wide within twenty-five (25) days after the notice of the vacancy or new job has been posted. Where notice that the vacancy or new job will be filled from any available source is posted applicants who have not been awarded the job shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of posting such notice during which time their failure to receive the job may be made the basis of a grievance. Applications received as a result of any available source postings will be considered, however, the filling of such vacancy by any available source will not be made the basis of a grievance. If the job is not filled within ninety (90) days after posting as above outlined then the vacancy or new job will be reposted as required for bidding under the initial above procedures. When such job is filled, copies of notices of fillings will be sent to Brotherhood representatives authorized to receive original vacancy notices. The successful applicant for a vacancy will be moved to such vacancy within thirty (30) days from date of job award notice, except in the case of jobs created in connection with the staffing of new plants, units, or crews and new opera
17
ARTICLE V (continued)
tions, in which case, the successful applicant will be transferred within thirty (30) days from the anticipated date of such staffing which date will be specified on the job notice. The following will constitute exceptions to the method of posting notices described above:
1.	TEMPORARY JOBS - Notices of vacancies or new jobs in classifications covered by this agreement which are temporary, that is, expected to last ninety (90) days or less, will be posted only at the respective local offices or crew headquarters where such vacancies or new jobs occur. However, if any such temporary new job lasts for more than ninety (90) days, it will be discussed with the local committee of the Brotherhood and if it appears that it will become permanent, it will be posted on the official bulletin boards of the unit affected, and treated as a permanent new job as described above under this paragraph (e).
Whenever a temporary job is filled by the Company, notice of such filling will be promptly posted at the respective local office or crew headquarters where filed.
Whenever job vacancies created by employees bidding and receiving temporary vacancies or new jobs are posted, such resulting vacancies will be
18
ARTICLE V (continued)
posted as temporary vacancies. Whenever the employees filling the initial temporary vacancies or new jobs returns to their former permanent jobs, or bid into other permanent jobs, temporary jobs which resulted from such initial temporary vacancies or new jobs will be terminated.
Employees who bid and receive temporary jobs or vacancies will, upon the termination of such temporary jobs or vacancies, be returned to their former jobs provided such jobs have not been abolished or occupied by senior employees as a result of a reduction of forces. In the event of a reduction of forces while employees are filling temporary jobs or vacancies, such employees will be considered as filling their former jobs for the purposes of such reduction of forces.
2.	Text Deleted .
3.	INSTRUMENT SERVICE CENTER -Notices of vacancies or new jobs at the Instrument Service Center will be posted on all bulletin boards, but only those employees who have had experience in electronic instrument testing and repair, instrumentation and control, or meter test work or the equivalent will be considered for such vacancies.
19
ARTICLE V (continued)
(f)	Employees in the classification of apprentice, who have attained competency to advance to journeyman, but who after accumulating four (4) years in apprentice classifications have not been promoted to journeyman will be offered advancement to the classification of journeyman at locations in their respective seniority unit where the services of an additional journeyman can be utilized to best advantage. In the event an employee in the apprentice classification is offered advancement to the journeyman classification under the provisions of this paragraph (f), and is subsequently advanced to journeyman at a location where no journeyman vacancy exists, the Company will retain the option for a period of one year to place a journeyman from that same crew into a vacancy of the same classification at that same location which may subsequently be created or become vacant.
Vacancies in journeyman classifications may be held open for a maximum of twenty-one (21) days prior to the date on which such employees' four (4) years combined accumulated service is completed during which time it may be filled by such employees. Also, the assignment of such employees to a definite location may be delayed for a period not in excess of twenty-one (21) days if it is anticipated that vacancies in the journeyman classifications for which they are eligible may occur during that period.
If a position of local operations lineman or service installer is created or held open to pro
20
ARTICLE V (continued)
vide for promotion of an apprentice under the above provision, it will be made available to all employees in the unit under the usual bidding procedure, and the first journeyman job other than lead lineman or troubleman so vacated will be offered to the apprentice for whom the job was created or held open. However, if this bidding does not result in a journeyman vacancy for which the apprentice is qualified, then the award, if any, to the successful bidder for the job created or held open will be cancelled, as well as any succeeding awards that resulted and the job created or held open will be offered to the apprentice who is eligible for promotion under the provisions of this paragraph (f).
In the event an employee is determined not physically qualified due to an injury, but is otherwise deemed competent for advancement under the provisions of this paragraph, the Company will re-evaluate the employee's competency within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of initial eligibility for advancement. If the employee is determined competent, the employee will be advanced in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, effective on the date of advancement.
In case apprentices elect to decline advancement so offered at another location but elect to remain at their then present location, they will continue to retain the classification of apprentice during future employment unless promoted or transferred on application made by them and considered in the manner
21
ARTICLE V (continued)
prescribed for applying for and filling vacancies and new jobs which are thereafter posted.
Employees who have attained the journeyman classification but are displaced from such journeyman classification and moved into a lower classification due to a rollback caused by the settlement of a grievance, an employee's return from a leave of absence, a reduction in forces, or incompetency, will not be eligible to advance to the journeyman classification until their combined accumulated service as a journeyman and/or as an apprentice equals four (4) years provided such employees do not elect to progress to journeyman under the terms and conditions of the bidding procedure as outlined in this Article V. At the time the employees' individual combined accumulated service as a journeyman and/or as an apprentice equals four (4) years and provided the employees are competent to advance to journeyman, they will be offered advancement to the classification of journeyman at a location in their seniority unit where the services of an additional journeyman can be utilized to best advantage.
Employees who have attained the journeyman classification but who choose of their own free will to bid into a lower classification will not be eligible for progression from apprentice to journeyman under the provisions of this paragraph or paragraph (k) of this Article V, until they satisfy the original requirement for apprentice progression, that is, until their respective accumulated service in the appren
22
ARTICLE V (continued)
tice classification is equal to four (4) years after bidding out of the journeyman classification.
When, as a result of reduction of forces, journeymen whose respective combined accumulated service as journeymen and/or as apprentices equals four (4) years or more move into a lower classification other than apprentice, they may when an apprentice opening is available bid on the apprentice job in accordance with the bidding procedure as outlined in paragraph (e) of this Article V; and if awarded such available apprentice job will immediately be promoted to the journeyman classification in that line of work. If they are not able to perform such work at the journeyman level, they will be demoted as set out in paragraph (I) of this Article V and will not be permitted any future claim to progression from apprentice to journeyman under the provisions of this paragraph.
(g)	When employees are transferred and raised from a classification to a higher classification or if employees are transferred permanently from one location to another by the Company without application or request from the employees, the Company will pay their moving expense to the new place of residence in the general vicinity of their new location. Employees who are transferred to another location in their unit to avoid being laid off, will pay their own moving expenses.
Relative to the movement of mobile homes, the Company agrees to apply the
23
ARTICLE V (continued)
terms and conditions of this paragraph to include certain expenses incurred as a result of moving mobile homes. Such expenses will be limited to escorts for mobile homes fourteen (14) feet in width or wider; disconnecting of utilities; taping of windows as necessary; and other preparations necessary to secure the internal portion of the mobile home for movement.
In addition to the expenses normally reimbursed for the movement of a mobile home under this paragraph, the Company will agree to pay the expenses associated with the movement of a heat pump(s) and/or a central air-conditioning unit(s).
(h)	If, in filling a vacancy or new job in a classification covered by this agreement, employees are transferred upon their request and application to a lower classification, their rate of pay in the lower classification will be at the minimum of such classification unless their training and experience justify a higher rate in that classification,
(i)	When job awards are made under the seniority provisions of this agreement and displacements are made due to incompetency during the first twelve (12) months following the job awards, employees will be returned to their former job and other employees awarded jobs in the sequence will also be returned to their former jobs. Employees displaced on account of incompetency will pay their own return moving expenses.
24
ARTICLE V (continued)
(j)	The Company has the right to lay off or discharge any employee for sufficient and reasonable cause, but the employee will be advised of the reason or reasons for such layoff or discharge; and the Brotherhood will, upon request, be advised of the reason or reasons for such layoff or discharge.
(k)	The Company will endeavor to provide the Union with reasonable notice in the event of a reduction in forces. In case of reduction of forces or displacement from classifications due to incompetency, except as provided for in paragraph (i) of this Article V, it is agreed that such reduction of forces or displacements will be made in reverse order of seniority, except as provided below, in each of the separate seniority units as defined in paragraph (a) of this Article V. Employees so displaced may roll into existing vacancies or new jobs which are of equivalent or lower classification rather than displacing other employees, or employees may have the option to return to any job classification in their seniority unit, provided they had formerly held such classification in that seniority unit and are competent, and if their seniority will allow such return. The Company will agree to coordinate the application of rolling into a vacancy by identifying existing vacancies within a seniority unit and providing this to the Union at least three (3) work days prior to the commencement of a reduction in forces or displacement. The Union will determine the desire and seniority of employees who might want to move to such vacancies under the provision of Article V, paragraph (e)
25
ARTICLE V (continued)
of the Contract. Employees laid off as a result of a reduction of forces or demotion will initially designate locations or, subsequent to layoff, additional locations where reemployment is desired for the purpose of recall from layoff. Locations so designated will be any of the six (6) geographic divisions, any generating plant, Power Delivery Transmission, and/or the General Services Complex. Vacancies not filled through the initial posting or vacancies in the helper classifications at the respective locations as designated will be offered to employees on layoff who are subject to recall as set forth in paragraph (b) of this Article V. In the event of a reduction of forces, employees in the classification of helper who have been displaced as a result of such reduction of forces will have the option of taking a layoff rather than displacing another employee.
In case of reduction of forces journeymen whose combined accumulated service as a journeyman and/or as an apprentice equals four (4) years or more will retain their journeyman classification provided there is either a journeyman or apprentice in their seniority unit with less seniority whose job they are competent to perform and whom they choose to displace. In the event a journeyman displaces an apprentice and retains the journeyman classification as provided above, the Company will retain the option for a period of one year to place a journeyman from that same crew into a vacancy of the same classification at that same location which may subsequently be created or become vacant.
26
ARTICLE V (continued)
It is understood that the employees retained as a result of the reduction of forces will result in classifications and competency sufficient for the work to be done and that no employees will be retained to fill a job for which they are not qualified, and it is further understood that layoffs in the reverse order of seniority will be worked out promptly with representatives of the Brotherhood, and will usually result in laying off employees with the least seniority in the particular units.
In the event of reduction of forces in the Instrument Service Center, transfers will be made in reverse order of length of service at Instrument Service Center; and such employees will be transferred back to the units from whence they came with total seniority accumulated up to the time of such transfers from the Instrument Service Center, for all the purposes of this agreement.
In the event that a reduction of forces or staffing adjustment may be necessary, the Company and Union may agree to apply any such severance or early retirement plan as may be approved and in effect at the time.
ARTICLE VI
Grievances
(a)	The Company agrees to meet and treat with the duly accredited officers and committees that are elected or selected by the
27
ARTICLE VI (continued)
Brotherhood upon all questions and grievances that may arise between the parties hereto during the life of this agreement. Every effort will be made by the parties hereto to settle disputes promptly and at the location where they arise. A local Union/Company committee will be formed as needed to discuss disputes for resolution using the mutual gains process before a formal grievance is filed. It being the desire of the parties to settle grievances promptly, the Brotherhood will endeavor to provide the available information as to date of occurrence, facts and circumstances giving rise to the grievance, contract provisions allegedly violated, employees involved, and remedy sought. Such information will be furnished to the Company prior to the first step of the grievance procedure, but may be amended prior to any subsequent step of the grievance procedure as may be necessary to reflect new information. It is understood, however, that failure to provide such information as set forth above, will not prejudice the position of the Brotherhood in any grievance.
As necessary for settlement, grievances will be reduced to writing and handled in two successive steps at the locations/departments as indicated:
Operating Divisions, General Garage, Fleet Garage, Instrument Service Center and General Stores:
Step 1. Between the aggrieved employee and/or representatives of the
28
ARTICLE VI (continued)
Brotherhood acting in the employee's behalf, and the employee's immediate supervisor and supervisor in general charge of the operation in which the grievance arose.
Step 2. Between the aggrieved employee and/or representatives of the Brotherhood acting in the employee's behalf, and the Manager-Labor Relations, together with the Vice President in charge of the operation in which the grievance arose or their designated representatives.
In the event any grievance is not settled by any of the preceding steps of the grievance procedure, it may be submitted to arbitration. The Brotherhood will have a maximum of ninety (90) days from the date of the Company's written decision in the final step in which to give written notice to the Company that a grievance is not satisfactorily settled and that the Brotherhood desires to submit the grievance to arbitration as provided in Article VII of this agreement.
The Company's decision will be reduced to writing and a copy furnished to the Brotherhood as soon as possible after the conclusion of each grievance step.
If a stenographic report is made of the proceedings of any such meeting by the Company
29
ARTICLE VI (continued)
or the Brotherhood, a typewritten copy will be furnished to the other party within five (5) days.
(b)	It being the desire of the parties hereto to settle grievances promptly, it is agreed that no grievance will be considered unless it is brought to the attention of the Company as a grievance in the manner provided for herein within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of the facts giving rise to the same or within fifteen (15) days of filling a vacancy as provided in Article V (e). It is further agreed that a maximum of seven (7) days will be allowed from the time of receipt of such notice that a grievance exists until such grievance will be handled as provided in Step 1 of this Article VI, paragraph (a). Upon completion of Step 1 as provided in this Article VI, paragraph (a), the Brotherhood will have a maximum of fourteen (14) days from the date of the Company's written decision in which to give notice to the Company that such grievance is not satisfactorily settled, and that the Brotherhood desires to proceed to the next higher step. Upon receipt of the notice that the Brotherhood desires to proceed to the next higher step as provided in this Article VI, paragraph (a), the Company will have a maximum of seven (7) days to complete such step. Failure to comply with the time limits as set forth above will serve to terminate the grievance, and such grievance, if terminated, cannot be brought up the second time. However, should the Company fail to comply with such time limits as set forth above, the grievance may be moved to the next succeeding step. Notwithstanding the provision of
30
ARTICLE VI (continued)
this Article VI, paragraph (b), time limits as specified herein may be extended by mutual agreement.
(c)	Employees who have been suspended or discharged will have the right to have their respective case taken up as a grievance by the officers or committees of the Brotherhood with the duly accredited officers of the Company; and in such cases where it is found that such employees that have been suspended or discharged were unjustly suspended or discharged, they will be reinstated to their former position and other employees' affected will be displaced pursuant to Article V, paragraph (i) where such reinstatement is within twelve (12) months of the employee's discharge otherwise the terms and conditions of Article V, paragraph (k) will apply with respect to other employees affected. Further they will be paid the wages to which they would have been entitled had they continued in the Company's employment during the period of suspension or discharge.
(d)	Disagreements with respect to Workers' Compensation and similar issues which are also controlled by Local, State or Federal Laws, are not subject to the grievance process.
If for whatever reason a Workers' Compensation claim which was initially disallowed is later accepted, the following will apply:
31
ARTICLE VI (continued)
1.	All employee benefits will be fully restored.
2.	The Company will not request any reimbursement from the employee for the difference between what the employee was paid and Workers' Compensation.
(e)	The Company will pay reasonable travel expenses for Company employees involved in the grievance process.
ARTICLE VII
Arbitration
In case of a dispute concerning the interpretation of any of the provisions of this agreement that cannot be settled by the Company and local representatives of the Brotherhood, they will refer the dispute to a board of arbitrators composed of three (3) members. Each of the parties hereto will select one (1) member of this board, and two (2) thus selected will select the third member of the board. In the event the two (2) members of the board of arbitration fail to select a third member within ten (10) days, the parties will jointly request the American Arbitration Association to appoint a third member. Both parties will be bound by such appointment. In the event one of the parties refuses or fails to join in such request, the party in default will forfeit its case. The decision of
32
ARTICLE VII (continued)
any two (2) members of the board in agreement on the matter in dispute will be binding on both parties hereto. When the dispute involves interpretation of wage schedules, any decision rendered will be retroactive to the date on which the dispute originated. Each of the parties hereto will pay the compensation and expense of the member of the board appointed by it; and the expense, and also the compensation, of the third member of the board will be borne equally by the parties hereto.
The board of arbitration will be governed wholly by the terms of this agreement and will have no power to add to or change its terms.
ARTICLE VIII
General Working Conditions
(a)	New employees will be on probation for the first six (6) months of their employment. During the trial period the Company may, at its option, transfer, lay off, or dismiss such employees, but they will enjoy all other rights and benefits provided for in this agreement. In filling any job from among probationary employees, competency being equal, the length of service of the employees in the probationary period will prevail and upon the completion of the six (6) months probationary period the seniority of such employees will commence and will be dated back to the date of their employment. However, the Brotherhood may discuss with the Company any cases of
33
ARTICLE VIII (continued) discrimination respecting such employees.
(b)	Each new full-time employee will be allowed a maximum of one (1) week [i.e., forty (40) hours] sick leave with pay upon completion of the initial employment probationary period as described in Article VIII, paragraph (a), if such sick leave is necessary because of the employee's own sickness.
Each full-time employee will be allowed an additional maximum of one (1) week [i.e., forty (40) hours] sick leave with pay upon completion of the initial six (6) months of continuous employment with the Company following such probationary period if such sick leave is necessary because of the employee's own sickness.
Thereafter, the Company will allow two (2) weeks [i.e., eighty (80) hours] sick leave with pay per calendar year to each full-time employee who has been in the employ of the Company for an immediately prior continuous period of six (6) or more months if such sick leave is necessary because of the employee's own sickness.
Employees will be allowed forty (40) additional hours sick leave in any calendar year following a year in which the employee did not use any sick leave.
An employee may accumulate unused sick leave up to a maximum of one thousand forty (1040) hours, including sick leave for the
34
ARTICLE VIII (continued) then current year. Under no circumstances will an employee be entitled to more than one thousand forty (1040) hours sick leave with pay in any calendar year.
Unless it is impossible to do so, employees or members of their immediate family will notify their respective immediate supervisors of such sickness and its probable duration as much in advance of the starting time of their shift as may be possible. Repeated failure to report for work without giving such notice will be grounds for disciplinary action or discharge. Should employees fail to notify supervision before the end of the second day of such absence, they will not qualify for sick leave with pay unless it can be shown that it was impossible for them to give or cause such notice to be given to their supervisors. In the event of absence due to sickness, supervisors may make such reasonable investigations as they deem desirable, and the Company may require a doctor's certificate as to the nature of the sickness causing such absence from work. Failure to give notice as required or to supply a doctor's certificate if required will forfeit all rights of sick leave with pay during the particular absence from work. The Brotherhood will cooperate with the Company to prevent or eliminate abuses of sick leave privileges.
Employees who are laid off due to a reduction in forces, but who return to the employ of the Company in a permanent job within a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of such layoff, will retain any unused
35
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
accumulated sick leave to which they were entitled at the time of their layoff; and will be eligible for such unused accumulated sick leave upon re-employment in a permanent position.
(c)	The Company will continue to give two (2) weeks [i.e., eighty (80) hours] vacation with pay during each calendar year to each full-time employee who has been in the employ of the Company for an immediately prior continuous period of one (1) or more years.
Each full-time employee who has been in the employ of the Company for an immediately prior continuous period of one (1) year or more will be eligible for three (3) weeks [i.e., one hundred twenty (120) hours] vacation with pay at the beginning of the calendar year in which the employee will accumulate seven (7) or more years of service, so long as such service was not broken by resignation or discharge for cause.
Each full-time employee who has been in the employ of the Company for an immediately prior continuous period of one (1) year or more will be eligible for four (4) weeks [i.e., one hundred sixty (160) hours] vacation with pay at the beginning of the calendar year in which the employee will accumulate fifteen (15) or more years of service, so long as such service was not broken by resignation or discharge for cause.
36
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
Each full-time employee who has been in the employ of the Company for an immediately prior continuous period of one (1) year or more will be eligible for five (5) weeks [i.e., two hundred (200) hours] vacation with pay at the beginning of the calendar year in which the employee will accumulate twenty-five (25) or more years of service, so long as such service was not broken by resignation or discharge for cause.
Each full-time employee will accrue vacation on December 31st for the succeeding year. The employee must have been employed for at least a continuous period of one (1) year and must be employed on December 31st in order to accrue the vacation. The employee is not required to work in the succeeding year in order to qualify for vacation.
Vacations will not be cumulative; however, employees will be allowed to carry from one (1) calendar year to the next up to eighty (80) hours vacation. Vacations may be arranged in advance of March 15 with their respective supervisors giving full weight to seniority provided that the full vacation allowance is scheduled on consecutive days. However, employees who choose to select vacation periods which are not consecutive will be entitled to exercise their seniority in the selection of the first such vacation period. Subsequent selections of vacation periods will not be made until all other employees have had an opportunity to
37
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
make selections under the same conditions. Vacations will be taken at such time as will not unduly interfere with the efficiency of operations. Employees who have not selected their vacations on or before March 15 will have to select periods that are untaken after that date and such periods will then be selected and scheduled in order of requests made. Employees will not be required to take their vacations in units of less than one (1) week [i.e., seven (7) consecutive days].
Employees scheduled for vacation will not be subject to being called out on their off days which are continuous with their vacation period. If employees are scheduled for vacation, which is less than five (5) consecutive days, on a day continuous with their off days, such employees will be subject to being called out during such off days. It is agreed that the Company currently recognizes holidays which are continuous with scheduled vacation days to meet the requirements as set forth in this Article VIII, paragraph (c), with regard to call out. Nothing contained in this paragraph will prevent an employee from being called out in an emergency situation.
Should employees be recalled for emergency duty while on vacation, the Company will defray any extra expenses which they may incur as a result of such recall including transportation and other reasonable expense back to the place from whence they were recalled, or to any equivalent point. If they desire to resume their vacation at the conclusion of the
38
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
emergency, additional vacation time will be granted them in lieu of time lost as a result of such recall, including time spent in traveling incidental to such recall.
If a holiday occurs during the employees' vacation, they will be allowed an additional day off with pay at the beginning or end of their vacation.
In the event of a death in the employees' immediate family while such employees are on vacation, Article VIII, paragraph (t) of this agreement will apply, provided the employees' respective supervisor is promptly notified. Such employee will be allowed to reschedule that portion of their vacation covered by the above mentioned Article VIII (t), consistent with the terms and conditions of this Article VIII, paragraph (c).
If employees leave the service of the Company and they are eligible for a vacation as above stated, they will be paid for same, provided such employees have not been discharged and provided in case of resignation they have given two (2) weeks' notice of their intention to resign from the Company.
In the event employees resign from the employ of the Company, they will be paid only for that unused vacation to which they were eligible as of the date the notice of resignation is received.
39
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
(d)	Insofar as possible without interfering with the necessary operations of the various units, the following holidays will be observed and granted without loss of pay: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Veterans Day (or such other national holiday as may be established in lieu thereof), Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve Day, and Christmas Day. Except for shift employees, when a holiday falls on an employee's scheduled off day, the holiday will be observed in the following manner: (1) If a holiday falls on an employee’s first scheduled off day, the preceding work day will be observed as the holiday; (2) If a holiday falls on an employee's second scheduled off day, the following work day will be observed as the holiday. For shift employees the holiday will be observed on the day which it occurs. As much notice as possible will be given to employees required to work on holidays; however, schedules as posted will constitute notice to shift employees who are required to work on holidays. When employees work on a holiday they will be paid at one and one-half (1-1/2) times their regular straight time rate for all hours worked on the holiday, and in addition thereto they will receive pay for eight (8) hours at their regular straight time rate. When a holiday falls on employees' respective off-day they will be allowed a day off in lieu thereof within thirty (30) days, or, if the Company concludes that it will not be able to grant time off in lieu of such holiday, it will pay for the same at regular straight time rates. If a holiday falls on the
40
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
employees' respective off-day and it is necessary to call out or to prearrange the employees to perform work, they will be paid at one and one-half (1-1/2) times their regular straight time rate for all hours worked, and in addition thereto, they will receive pay for eight (8) hours at their regular straight time rate.
If a holiday occurs during the employees' vacation, they will be allowed an additional day off with pay at the beginning or end of their vacation.
If a holiday falls on a regular scheduled workday and the employee works eight (8) hours or more, the employee may be paid eight (8) hours at the straight time rate and request the holiday be banked. If more than eight (8) hours are worked, all hours over eight (8) hours will be paid at one and one-half (1-%) time. Employees working shifts other than eight (8) hours per day will be allowed to bank the entire shift, hour for hour, if they work their regular scheduled hours or more on a holiday and are paid at the straight time rate for such regular scheduled hours worked. All hours worked outside regular scheduled hours will be paid at one and one half (1-%) time. Holidays that occur on an employee's off day may only be banked as eight (8) hours. For holidays that occur on a regular scheduled workday and are not banked, all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours will be paid at one and one half (1-72) time. An employee may bank up to three (3) holidays. Should employees change to a longer schedule, they must
41
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
use dock time or vacation to make up the difference when taking a banked holiday. If they change to a shorter schedule, they will be paid for the difference or have the option of taking the excess hours off as if it were vacation.
Banked holidays can be carried over from year to year, but at no time can an employee have more than three (3) days banked. Banked holidays must be taken in blocks of hours equal to the regular scheduled workday, arranged for like a day of vacation. Employees may request payment for banked holidays in blocks of hours equal to the regular scheduled work day, with payment made at the current straight time rate in the employees regular paycheck.
At least twenty four (24) hours prior to the beginning of a holiday each supervisor will make known if the needs and conditions are such that members of the work group may volunteer to work on the holiday and thus bank the holiday for future use. If more ask to work than are needed then seniority will be the basis for selecting those asking to bank a holiday.
It is not the Company's intention to change schedules on a temporary basis to avoid paying for more than eight (8) hours.
(e)	The Company will continue its present policy of carrying group life insurance at its own expense on all full-time employees who have been in the employ of the Company for a continuous period of six (6) months or more, so
42
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
long as such insurance continues to be available to the Company at substantially the present rates and under substantially the present conditions.
Employees returning from layoff as a result of reduction of forces within twenty-four (24) months of such layoff will be entitled to the amount of non-contributory group life insurance to which they were entitled at the time of layoff.
The Company adopted a Pension Plan covering certain of its employees, including those now represented by the Brotherhood, on July 1, 1944. Such Pension Plan has been amended from time to time since its adoption and the Company has entered into supplemental pension agreements with the Brotherhood relating to such plan.
(f)	Employees performing jury duty will be paid their regular rates for time lost from their regular work while so serving. Employees who are permanently discharged from such jury duty will be expected to report such discharge as soon as practicable to their respective supervisors. The Company agrees to allow sufficient time off with pay for voting, not to exceed two (2) hours, to those employees whose work on election day does not otherwise permit sufficient time to vote.
(g)	Employees who are members of the Brotherhood's committees representing the Local Unions above-mentioned will be allowed
43
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
time off to attend meetings with Company officials. They will give their respective supervisor, or in the supervisor's absence the supervisor's designee, reasonable notice in advance of their desire to attend such meetings. The number of representatives of the Brotherhood in attendance at such meetings on Company time will be limited to the number reasonably necessary to transact the business at hand. The Company will pay such employees at their regular rates of pay for time lost from their regular work as a result of attending such meetings.
Officers and authorized delegates not to exceed four (4) from each Local Union, who are called upon to transact business for the Local Union or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which temporarily requires their absence from duty, will, upon written request to their department or division supervisor, be allowed sufficient time for such business without pay. It is understood, however, that except for the foregoing there will be no transaction of Brotherhood business, including solicitation, on Company time or on any property of the Company where employees are on duty.
(h)	Should employees become Business Manager in Alabama for the above-mentioned Local Unions or accept a full-time position with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or the Alabama Labor Council, the Company agrees that they will be given a leave of absence for the period of this agreement, or
44
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
any extension thereof, and that they will retain and accumulate seniority and service just as though they continued to work for the Company, and that they will be permitted to return to their former or an equivalent classification with the Company immediately upon conclusion of their term as such, and provided they are competent to fill the position. It is understood, however, that any necessary demotions made in carrying out the provisions of this paragraph (h) will not be made the basis of any grievance.
Service time will accrue for employees who are on a Union Leave of Absence. Employees who have returned from a Union Leave of Absence will be eligible for retroactive accrual of service time for purposes of vacation, service awards and retirement plaques.
(i)	Employees who are required to work outside in the rain will be furnished raincoats or rain suits (as agreed on locally) and rain hats. Employees required to work in water will be furnished rubber boots. The Company will endeavor to provide a reasonable assortment of sizes of such equipment. Such equipment will remain the property of the Company, will not be devoted to personal use, and will be turned in when not actually required. If any employee desires such individual equipment for their own use, upon written request, the Company will supply it at thirty per cent (30%) of the cost to the Company (including cost of handling), but in that event such equipment will be kept readily available by the employee to
45
ARTICLE VIII (continued) satisfy the requirements of this paragraph. The Company will also make replacements of such individual equipment at thirty per cent (30%) cost at reasonable intervals.

(k) Paragraphs 1 through 12, inclusive:
1.	When employees are designated by their supervisor to temporarily relieve or substitute for another employee of a higher classification than their own, the employee will be paid at the minimum rate for the higher classification. If the employee works in such higher classification for as much as four (4) hours in a workday [as defined in paragraph (v) of this Article VIII], the employee will be paid for the full day at the rate determined above; provided, however, that the employee will not suffer any reduction in rate while thus temporarily relieving or substituting. When employees temporarily relieve or substitute for an employee in a lower classification, they will continue to receive the pay of their own classification.
2.	Whenever substitution is made under a provision of this paragraph, the senior competent employee available in the respective crew or shift will be designated to relieve or substitute for an employee in a higher classification, except in the case of a journeyman being designated to take charge where no foreman, sub-foreman, lead lineman or lead cable splicer is available and when a warehouseman or materialman is designated to take charge in the
46
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
absence of the warehouseman's or materialman's supervisor.
3.	Where no foreman, lead lineman or lead cable splicer is available in a crew, a journeyman will be designated by the supervisor to take charge of the crew and be paid as a lead lineman or lead cable splicer while in charge of the crew.
If a foreman is available to exercise general supervision but is removed from the vicinity of the job, the senior available journeyman in the crew will be designated to take charge and will act and be paid as a lead lineman or lead cable splicer while in charge of the crew.
If a foreman is absent, i.e., not available to exercise general supervision, a journeyman will be designated to take charge of the crew and be paid as a lead lineman or lead cable splicer while in charge of the crew.
4.	When both the foreman and subforeman are absent for one half (1/2) work period or shift or more on a regular workday from either the shipping or receiving section of the General Stores, a warehouseman-general or a materialman will be designated by the supervisor to substitute for the absent subforeman provided there is available in that section a warehouseman-general or a materialman competent to perform the duties of the absent subforeman. When a warehouseman or a materialman is designated to substitute for a supervisor or storekeeper for one-half (1/2)
47
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
work period or shift or more, the warehouseman or materialman will be paid an additional sixty-five (650) cents per hour while being substituted.
5.	Text Deleted.
6.	When a journeyman is absent for one-half (1/2) work period or shift or more from a garage, line or underground crew to which two (2) or less journeymen are normally assigned, an employee will be designated to substitute for such journeyman provided there is available at that garage or in that crew an employee competent to perform the duties of the absent journeyman.
7.	When the number of journeymen falls below two (2) for one-half (1/2) work period or shift or more in any line crew to which more than two (2) journeymen are normally assigned, an employee will be designated to substitute for such journeyman in order to bring the crew up to a minimum of two (2) journeymen, provided there is available in that crew an employee competent to perform the duties of the absent journeyman.
8.	When a journeyman is absent for one-half (1/2) work period or shift or more from a local operation to which two (2) or less employees in journeyman classifications are normally assigned, an employee will be designated to substitute for such journeyman, provided there is available at that local operation an employee competent to perform the duties of the
48
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
absent journeyman.
9.	In any crew when a journeyman is substituting for a foreman, the journeyman will be considered as being absent from the crew for the purpose of determining whether substitution as provided for in this Article VIII, paragraph (k) shall be made.
10.	Under the above provisions, substitution for the absent journeyman in any line or underground crew will be made even though the crew is combined with another crew, provided there is available in the crew from which the journeyman is absent an employee competent to perform the duties of the absent journeyman.
11.	When a lead lineman is absent, a journeyman will be designated to substitute for such lead lineman provided the unit to which the lead lineman is assigned requires the services of a lead lineman as provided under Article XIII, paragraph (b) of this agreement.
12.	When both the foreman and subforeman are absent for one-half (1/2) work period or shift or more on a regular work day from the geographic division garage, a utility fleet technician I will be designated by the supervisor to substitute for the absent subforeman provided there is available at that garage a utility fleet technician I competent to perform the duties of the absent subforeman. The subforeman or utility fleet technician I substituting for the absent subforeman will continue to perform
49
ARTICLE VIII (continued) work as a utility fleet technician I while in charge of the garage.
At locations where there is no subforeman and the foreman is absent for one-half (1/2) work period or shift or more on a regular work day, a utility fleet technician I will be designated to take charge of the work group and be paid at the subforeman rate of pay while in charge of the work group, provided there is available at that garage a utility fleet technician I competent to perform the duties of a subforeman.
(I)	When an employee is offered a promotion by the Company and for any reason fails to accept it, such failure will not affect the employee's seniority or status, except as provided in paragraph (e) of Article V.
(m)	Any employee who is called for work while off duty will be given as much notice as possible.
(n)	Where it is practicable to do so, employees who are unable to report for work will send word to or notify their respective supervisor of such inability and its probable duration. Such notice will be given as much in advance of the starting time of their shift as may be possible. Repeated failure to report for work without giving such notice or without good and sufficient reason will be grounds for disciplinary action or discharge.
50
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
(o)	Employees will keep their supervisors informed of their correct home or living quarters address.
(p)	The Company will not use superintendents, assistant superintendents or foremen to displace employees in classifications covered by this agreement; however, nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent them from doing such work in emergencies, in training employees, or in the inspection and adjustment of equipment, and performing incidental tasks which contribute to the obvious efficiency of the crew or work group, but will not displace a covered employee. It is not the parties' intent for these classifications to become working classifications that can perform routine bargaining unit work without limitations.
Such classifications' primary responsibility is to supervise work being performed. The above referenced incidental tasks do not include the foremen doing routine switching or using tools.
(q)	When employees are recalled for work and report for duty after a regular work period or on one of their regular off-days, they will be paid for actual time spent working or standing by, plus an additional amount equal to their overtime rate of pay for one hour for the inconvenience involved in such recall, but in no event will they receive less than two (2) hours pay at their overtime rate.
51
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
Employees who are provided Company vehicles for the purpose of such recalls and respond to the recalls from their homes, will not be eligible for the one hour at the overtime rate to compensate for the inconvenience of the recall. Such employees will be paid for the actual time spent working or standing by but in no event will they receive less than two (2) hours pay at their overtime rate.
When employees are recalled for work and report for duty while they are off duty during their regular scheduled lunch period, they will receive one (1) hour pay at their overtime rate.
When employees are required to report for work on a scheduled workday after having been released on one of their scheduled workdays and were notified to this effect before the end of their last scheduled work period, they will be paid the equivalent of three (3) hours at the overtime rate or the actual hours worked, whichever is greater, except as set out below.
When employees are required to report in advance of the normal starting time on one of their scheduled days of work, and were notified to this effect before the end of their previous scheduled workday, they will be paid at their overtime rate for all time worked prior to their normal starting time.
When employees are required to report for work on one of their off-days and were notified to this effect before the end of their last
52
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
previous scheduled work period hours or in the event a prearranged overtime assignment begins on a regular work day and extends into an off-day or begins on an off-day and extends into another off-day, they will be paid the equivalent of four (4) hours at the overtime rate or the actual worked, whichever is greater.

Except as described above, employees may be rescheduled for temporary periods upon at least thirty-six (36) hours prior notice stating the probable duration but, except for shift work, such
58
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
rescheduled work periods will be for five (5) consecutive days between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., and will not include Sunday and will be limited to that reasonably necessary to render and maintain continuous and adequate service.

ARTICLE VIII (continued)
their last scheduled work period and who so report will be paid at the overtime rate for all hours worked thereafter until they have had eight (8) consecutive hours off duty. Employees who are instructed to report for duty six (6) hours or more before their next regular scheduled starting time following an off day will continue to be paid at the overtime rate for all time worked until they have had eight (8) consecutive hours off duty. However, in either instance at the completion of the work for which the employee so reported, the Company may at its discretion continue the employee at work or give them eight (8) hours off duty and if any part of the eight (8) hours off duty falls within or overlaps into the employees' next regular scheduled work period, they will be paid for all such hours off duty within their regular scheduled work period at the straight time rate.
Any employee continuing to work beyond their regular scheduled work period will be paid at the overtime rate for all hours worked thereafter until they have had eight (8) consecutive hours off duty and if any part of such eight (8) hours off duty falls within or overlaps into the employees' next regular scheduled work period, they will be paid for all such hours off duty within their regular scheduled work period at the straight time rate.

61
ARTICLE VIII (continued) ment, provided there are classifications available that the employee can perform without prejudice to their physical condition and further provided that the employee will not be precluded from exercising other available options.
Permanently disabled employees electing to exercise the roll rights given under this paragraph, who are subsequently determined to be incompetent to perform the duties of their new classification during the first 12 months following the roll back, will be demoted under the provisions of Article V, paragraph (k).

If the Company provides traveling accommodations other than by Company car or truck, it will pay for all time spent in traveling just as though such time were worked. In such cases, if employees desire to provide their own transportation or to determine their own mode, route, and time of traveling to and from such temporary employment, they will make mutually satisfactory arrangements with their respective supervisor in advance as to the time and expense to be paid for by the Company and as to the time and place where they will report.
If traveling is by Company car or truck the Company will pay for all time spent traveling just as though it were time worked. If in lieu of utilizing a Company car or truck, which will make the trip in any event, employees desire to provide their own transportation, they will
63
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
pay their own transportation expense but will receive time as if they had traveled by such Company car or truck.
In the event employees who are working temporarily at some location other than the place where they regularly work and who would normally have their room and board paid for at the temporary location as provided for in the first sentence of this paragraph (bb) or the first sentence of Article XIII, paragraph (a), choose to return to their home after each day's work, the Company will provide their evening and morning meals at the temporary location and at the option of the employee the Company will allow such employees for traveling or transportation expenses the amount that would otherwise be paid by the Company for the employees' lodging.

The first sentence of this paragraph will not be construed to require employees to report each date to their assigned headquarters if in the normal performance of their duties such reporting is not necessary, unless the employees are instructed to report to such headquarters by their respective supervisor.
Where employees are required to report or quit at some headquarters or reporting place, the Company will pay for time spent in traveling between the job and such headquarters or reporting place, plus any time spent working at such headquarters or reporting place.
65
ARTICLE VIII (continued)
(ee) Along with their paycheck for each pay period the Company will furnish to all employees a statement showing the number of hours for which they are paid at straight time rates; the number of hours for which they are paid at overtime rates; and the number of hours worked in substitution during the payroll period covered by such paycheck; together with the respective rates of pay.

In case a disciplinary notice is given, the employee concerned will be given a letter summarizing the discussion. If the employee chooses, a representative from the Brotherhood may be present at the time of such discussion. If the employee thinks unfair treatment is given, a grievance may be initiated and such discussion, by mutual agreement, may be considered the first step of the grievance procedure. The letter summarizing a disciplinary notice will not be made a part of the official files of the Company until the outcome of the grievance has been determined.
(jj) Employees who are instructed to climb a steel radio tower over 100 feet in height and believe that due to their physical or mental limitations or their lack of skill they cannot perform the job safely and so inform their supervisor, will not be required to climb such tower.

(a)	Each line, maintenance, and tree trimming crew will have a definitely assigned headquarters and the Company will pay the reasonable and necessary board and lodging expenses of employees in such crews when they are required to work away from such headquarters. Headquarters of tree trimming crews may be changed from time to time as required by location of the work to be done, but such changes of headquarters will not be made more than once in three (3) months for any one (1) crew, and in event of such change the Company will pay, for the first thirty (30) days in each location, the reasonable and necessary board and lodging expense of any employees who may be transferred.
(b)	Paragraphs 1 through 3, inclusive:
1.	Line crews of four (4) employees or more, exclusive of foremen, will include at least two (2) journeymen; and line crews of three (3) employees, exclusive of foremen, will include at least one (1) journeyman. In each of the crew headquarters locations consisting of line or underground crews, the regular full strength ratio of apprentices to journeymen will not exceed one apprentice to each two journeymen. In line and underground crews where apprentices are utilized there may be more than one apprentice to each two journeymen as long as the ratio is maintained at the crew headquarters location. Nothing herein will be
72
ARTICLE XIII (continued)
construed to require the Company to promote apprentices to the classification of journeyman unless they are competent to perform the essential duties of such classification.
2.	At their regular full strength, underground crews and line crews of seven (7) employees or more, exclusive of foremen, will include a lead cable splicer or lead lineman who will be considered as a journeyman in computing the ratio of apprentices to journeymen.
When line or underground crews are split and operating separately in small groups, each group of three (3) or more employees, exclusive of the foreman, will be under the direct supervision of a foreman, lead lineman or lead cable splicer, or a journeyman designated to act and be paid as a lead lineman or lead cable splicer. A lead lineman or lead cable splicer or a journeyman designated to act as a lead lineman or lead cable splicer may work at their discretion when practical to do so while maintaining the safety and efficiency of the crew.
When it is necessary for the foreman to leave the vicinity of the job, if there is no lead cable splicer or lead lineman in that crew, a journeyman will be designated to act as a lead cable splicer or lead lineman and such journeyman designated to act as a lead cable splicer or lead lineman may work at their discretion when practical to do so while maintaining the safety and efficiency of the crew.
73
ARTICLE XIII (continued)
A lead lineman or lead cable splicer or a journeyman designated to act as lead lineman or lead cable splicer will not be considered as the second journeyman on the job for the purpose of Article XIII (e) if the number of employees supervised exceeds four (4) [five (5) including the designated employee}. It is understood, however, that if the number of employees supervised does not exceed four (4) [five (5) including himself] such lead lineman or lead cable splicer or journeyman designated to act as lead lineman or lead cable splicer will be considered the second journeyman on the job for the purpose of Article XIII (e).
If the foreman is absent, i.e., not available to exercise general supervision in such a crew, and a journeyman is designated to act as a foreman, the journeyman may work at his discretion when practical to do so while maintaining the safety and efficiency of the crew.
3.	A line crew will be considered as a mechanized crew when regularly equipped with two (2) or more pieces of major equipment composed of line trucks equipped with derricks and/or trucks equipped with aerial lifts in any combination under the supervision of one (1) foreman.
Personnel in mechanized crews will be regularly assigned to work units corresponding generally to each major piece of equipment assigned to that crew. However, personnel may be transferred from one (1) unit to anoth
74
ARTICLE XIII (continued)
er either on a permanent or a temporary basis when required due to the nature of the work to be done or due to the absence of one (1) or more crew members.
Derrick trucks in line crews will be operated by employees in the truck driver classification or higher.
Whenever it is necessary to call out three or more line crew employees outside their regular scheduled hours and such employees are not under the supervision of a foreman, an effort will be made to include a lead lineman in the group. In cases where there are no classified lead lineman or when classified lead lineman are not available, whenever it is necessary to call out three or more line crew employees outside their regular scheduled hours and such employees are not under the supervision of the foreman, a lineman competent to act as a lead lineman will be designated to act and be paid as a lead lineman for hours worked outside scheduled hours of work.
Upgrading of a lineman to lead lineman under these circumstances will not be evidence of competency for other purposes. The Company is willing to apply this understanding provided some satisfactory arrangement can be worked out with regard to the distribution of overtime between linemen and lead linemen. This understanding supersedes the understanding contained as Item 7, Memorandum of Understanding - Operating Agreement 1965 Negotiations dated January 7, 1967.
75

The employee must be qualified through CK&S prior to advancement or for full substitution. Limited substitution may be made based on the employee's ability to safely perform the work at hand. Limited substitution will not
76
ARTICLE XIII (continued) deem an employee to be qualified for full substitution nor for advancement.
An employee holding the apprentice classification may take the appropriate journeyman CK&S written and skills tests on a "request” basis prior to the end of the one year outlined above. If the employee passes these tests, he will be "prequalified" for the journeyman classification; however, he may not be fully substituted nor awarded a journeyman job until the passage of one year as outlined above.
An employee holding the apprentice classification may not take the CK&S tests for journeyman on a "demand" basis until he has satisfied the one year requirement outlined above.
In no case will an employee with less than one (1) year, (singular or combined) experience as an apprentice and/or journeyman be awarded a journeyman job.
(e)	Where it is necessary for employees to work on energized lines or equipment in excess of 600 volts, there will be at least two (2) journeymen on the job unless in extreme emergency involving immediate hazard to life or property.

If drivers of trucks are required to report before the beginning, or to work after the end of the regular work day for their respective crews, they will be paid for such excess time at their respective rates of pay and such time will be taken into account in computing overtime.
(g)	When a cable splicer is working on or near exposed parts energized at fifty volts or more in a pullbox, manhole, or vault, it will be at the discretion of the journeyman if additional journeymen are needed. When clean-up work is being performed in a vault, two (2) journeymen will not be required.
When switching within a manhole, vault or other enclosed space, it will be at the discretion of the journeyman in charge of the work to determine if it is necessary to have the assistance of another journeyman, lead cable splicer or foreman within the manhole, vault or other enclosed space.
78
ARTICLE XIII (continued)
(h)	When a manhole or vault is open and employees are working in same, an employee will be stationed at such opening instructed not to leave the opening except with the permission of the employee in charge of the work in the vault or manhole; and such employee will assist the employees in the vault or manhole by passing tools or materials to them, or otherwise as they may direct.

DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT
OUTSTANDING MOUs
The consolidation of MOUs from 1960 -2000 is an attempt to clean up outdated language and publish as many MOUs as possible.
If by chance, MOUs or language have been deleted and should not have been, the Company and Union agree that these MOUs and language will be applicable.
NEGOTIATIONS

1974
7.	Based on present and future needs and conditions, the Company will reorganize the Alabama Power Company Stores. Such reorganization shall be as follows:
(a) The Company will, where practicable and efficient to do so, convert the "charged out" storerooms in the
119
operating divisions to accountable storerooms. Where it is not practicable and efficient to make this change, the storerooms will remain in the "charged out" status. Where a storeroom is unattended and is changed from a "charge out" to an accountable storeroom, the first employee at the facility will be a noncovered, operating employee. Where the volume of work dictates, a second employee at each such location will be added and will be a covered employee in the classification of materialman.
1982
Effective June 1,1983 and consistent with the provisions of Article VIII, paragraphs (i) and (ff), employees in classifications regularly assigned meter reading and collections work, and employees prearranged to relieve or substitute for absent employees in such classifications, will be furnished adequate rain gear to assure the continuance of meter reading and collections work during rain, sleet or snow conditions. It is understood, however, that such employees will not be expected to work in any severe weather condition. It is further understood that employees assigned to supplement meter reading and collec
120
tions efforts (i.e., not relieving or substituting for an absent employee) will not be required to continue reading and collections work during rain, sleet or snow conditions.

(2)The Company may transfer helpers-general for training without regard to seniority, except for those employees who were above the utilityman classification on the effective date of this agreement.
It is the Company's intent that vacancies will be filled by C. (1) above when such filling is consistent with efficient operation.

The Company cannot agree, however, to remove discipline issued for violations of the Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy. In addition, the Company cannot agree to remove any written discipline resulting in multiple day suspension issued under the old progressive discipline policy after January 1, 1995.
All discipline issued after June 1, 1995, under the Nonpunitive Discipline System, will be removed according to the policy’s guidelines.
17.	The Company will administer a Drug and Alcohol random testing program to the entire employee population including those now covered by the Department of Transportation regulations covering the commercial drivers license.

f.	Remote site reporting would not be required more than 65 days between August 14, 1995 and August 15,1996; 80 days between August 15, 1996 and August 15, 1997; and 90 days between August 15, 1997 and August 15, 1998.
g.	When reporting in excess of 30 road miles the employee will be reimbursed for the equivalent of the excess travel time, to be accrued on a weekly basis, along
124
with the corresponding excess mileage, provided the new reporting location requires the employees to exceed their normal daily commute
h.	For purposes of this particular proposal, Article VIII, paragraph (bb) and Article XIII, paragraph (a) or any other provision of the contract dealing with travel time or expenses will not add to or limit the application of remote site job reporting procedures.

Based on present needs and circumstances, master level certification requirements are
•	Fluid Power Certification
•	ASE Master Truck with Diesel Certification
•	Critical Welds Certification

METER READERS MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
October 30, 1999
As a result of certain discussions between representatives of Alabama Power Company and representatives of the nine (9) local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers listed below, the parties have agreed on certain matters which are embraced in this Memorandum of Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed between Alabama Power Company and such local unions as follows:
1.	The purpose of this Memorandum is to provide assistance to present Meter Readers in transition due to technological changes. However, this Memorandum addresses only the effects of this transition and does not waive any position previously maintained by either party unless specifically addressed in this agreement. It is further agreed that the local unions will not grieve, arbitrate, or submit to the NLRB the issue of continuing to use contractors to read meters during the time frame of this agreement. Both parties agree that this Memorandum will not be used as a guide, set any precedent, or be used in any future proceedings.
2.	Present Meter Readers will continue to be eligible for individual counseling by Human Resources personnel in areas of future career opportunities at the
154
Company. As training needs are identified, the Company will assist in providing resources, facilities and instructors for mutually agreed on courses of study.
3.	The Company will post Meter Reader vacancies on the initial posting state-wide. Bids will be accepted only from Meter Readers with consideration given to seniority within the bid unit first followed by seniority outside the bid unit; however, where a Meter Reader vacancy is created when a Meter Reader is voluntarily assigned to a line crew, substation crew or underground crew, the vacancy will be posted and filled only within the affected division. Meter Readers will be given an additional opportunity to transfer laterally one time per calendar year under this agreement.
The Company may elect to fill Meter Reader vacancies as stated under Article V of the DS Memorandum of Agreement.
4.	Allow Meter Readers to transfer based on seniority to vacant Helper-General positions across the state. These Meter Readers will be considered before new hires and will be allowed only one transfer. Meter Readers wishing to participate in a voluntary transfer must submit their desired location(s) to their respective Human Resources departments. (HR should poll Meter Readers within 30 days of the date of this agreement to determine their preferences. Meter Readers should
155
make known any changes to this initial polling by notifying their HR department) The pay for Meter Readers who voluntarily transfer to Helper-General will be frozen (except for general increases) for a period of twelve months from the date of transfer.
5.	Based on needs and conditions, Meter Readers may volunteer to be assigned, based on seniority, to line crews, substation crews and underground crews. Meter Readers who are offered this assignment may decline the offer without penalty for future consideration. Meter Readers so assigned will maintain existing Meter Reader pay for one year (including step increases and general increases). Once CK&S qualified, these Meter Readers may be assigned the full range of apprentice duties and all time worked following CK&S will count toward automatic progression. After one year of transferring to a crew, Meter Readers who have become CK&S qualified for apprentice will be reclassified as apprentice and paid at the top step of the apprentice classification. If during the 12 month period the Meter Readers do not become CK&S qualified for apprentice, the Meter Reader may return to the Meter Reader position formerly held at their previous work location, (Company employee or contractor), as provided for in Article V(i). The Meter Reader may return to the Meter Reader position formerly held at their previous work location, (Company employee or
156
contractor), within 12 months of CK&S qualification. Further, any time a Meter Reader bids and is awarded a permanent apprentice job, their initial pay will be at the middle step for the apprentice classification.
It is not intended for an "apprentice in training" to move into an apprentice job which comes open without following the normal bid process.
6.	In the event of a roll back within the first 12 months after the Meter Reader moves into a new position, affected Meter Readers will be allowed to return to the Meter Reader position formerly held at their previous location (Company employee or contractor).
In the event that a Meter Reader is rolled, the affected Meter Reader will retain the same bid rights as other Meter Readers under this MOU. (It is understood that this applies to all Meter Readers who where rolled after February 9, 1995.)
7.	Both parties agree to meet and discuss problems associated with this transition and will attempt to settle disputes arising from this Memorandum or this transition through direct meetings between Company and Union representatives at the affected locations, and to utilize the grievance procedure as a last resort.
157
8.	It is the Company's intent to first offer all pre-arranged meter reading overtime to qualified and trained covered employees.
9.	This memorandum will expire on December 31, 2001, unless both parties mutually agree to extend.
Unless specifically referenced above, the terms and conditions of the Basic Memorandum of Agreement will apply.
This memorandum of Agreement is entered into this 30th day of October 1999.

Work sharing assignments shall be made at the discretion of the Company, in the spirit of the agreed purpose, and shall in no way imply the permanent assignment of Information Resources work to IBEW telecommunications personnel, nor the right of the IBEW to claim exclusivity of this work as denied in this M.O.U. It is acknowledged that nothing contained within this supplemental agreement shall
164
abridge the Company's right to subcontract.
3.	The definition of "traditionaJ telecommunications work," that is, work which in the past has been in part performed by Telecommunications Electricians or other IBEW employees, is work consisting of the installation and maintenance of hardware on the following telecommunications systems:
A)	Two-way radio systems
B)	Analog and digital microwave systems, and fiber optic systems
C)	Analog and digital microwave and fiber optics multiplex systems.
D)	Engine generator systems, telecommunications building air conditioning and electrical systems, communications towers, antenna systems, and inside and outside plant wiring systems.
E)	Maintenance and installation of hardware on IR Data Networks and modems, excluding Corporate Headquarters and Plant Farley.
F)	Maintenance of hardware on division telephone switches, excluding Corporate Headquarters and Plant Farley.
165
4.	Training shall be provided to IBEW Telecommunications Electricians for non-traditional Information Resources systems based on the existing needs as determined by the Company.
5.	Overtime assignments for non-traditional Information Resources work shall be made at the discretion of the Company.
6.	The definition of Information Resources work is work which is not referenced in paragraph 3 as "traditional telecommunications work".
7.	While the Company cannot guarantee job security for Telecommunications Electricians (TE), it does commit in good faith that there are no plans to reduce the current number of TE's, as of the effective date of this M.O.U., based upon projected needs.
8.	Consistent with the terms and conditions set forth and agreed to by both the Company and Union representatives at the initial meeting on November 13, 1989, any and all conversations, proposals, and comments, both written and oral, made during these discussions on the subject of "work sharing" shall not be used in any way without the expressed consent of both parties. This M.O.U. shall not be used during its term nor thereafter as the basis or support for any labor related action on behalf of either party.
166
9.	Both parties agree to attempt to settle disputes arising from this M.O.U. through direct meetings between Company and Union management at the affected locations, and will utilize the grievance procedure as a last resort.
This Memorandum of Agreement is entered into and becomes effective on this the 11th day of May, 1994, and will continue in effect for a period of two (2) years from effective date and thereafter indefinite until canceled by a thirty (30) day written notice from either party.

EQUIPMENT OPERATOR TRANSMISSION July 14, 1993
As a result of certain discussions between representatives of Alabama Power Company, the System Council U-19, and the nine local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers listed below, the parties have agreed to certain matters as set forth below.
1.	Based on present needs and conditions, the Company will establish a new classification of Equipment Operator -Transmission under Exhibit A, Section 2 of the Operating Agreement, with the following rates of pay:
$3000	$3015	$3030
2.	The job duties of this classification shall primarily be operating heavy equipment, including but not limited to: Crawler Tractors, Commander II and larger Derricks, Transmission type Aerial lifts, and all equipment associated with Transmission work. Employees holding this classification shall also be proficient in loading, securing, hauling, and unloading miscellaneous units of equipment. This classification will include limited climbing duties in cases when the job does not require duties associated with heavy equipment and may be routinely assigned any duty performed by a lower classification within the transmission line crew.
168
3.	This classification will be posted as provided for in Article V, paragraph (e) and filled on the basis of seniority and competency. An employee must have at least one (1) year experience in an apprentice or higher classification within a transmission line crew or at least two (2) years experience in an apprentice or higher classification in a distribution or substation crew prior to being awarded an Equipment Operator -Transmission job. This experience requirement will be eliminated after a Craft Knowledge and Skills Test (CK&S Test) is developed and implemented for this classification.
4.	The Company agrees not to eliminate a Truck Driver-A classification within a transmission crew in order to post an Equipment Operator-Transmission classification within that same crew if, and only if, the employee holding the Truck Driver-A classification in the crew was holding such Truck Driver-A classification as of the effective date of this agreement.
5.	The establishment of this classification in no way precludes the use of apprentices, truck drivers or linemen from operating any equipment. When employees holding the classifications of truck driver or apprentice lineman operate any of this equipment due to necessity or convenience, there will be no upgrades or substitutions. When employees holding the classification of Helper-General are required to operate this equipment for purposes of training,
169
convenience, or necessity they will be upgraded to Truck Driver A. An employee must satisfy the CK&S or experience requirements as set forth in paragraph 3 above before being considered for upgrade or substitution to the Equipment Operator classification.
This memorandum of agreement is entered into this the 14th day of July, 1993.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT PROCEDURES RELATING TO PROVIDING OR PAYING FOR MEALS
STATEMENT OF POLICY
The Company will defray the reasonable extra costs incurred by or for employees for meals resulting from their being required to work overtime outside their scheduled or rescheduled hours and days; or as an alternative, at its option the Company will provide such meals at Company expense.
GENERAL PRACTICES UNDER THE POLICY
1.	In general, the Company will reimburse employees a $9.50 meal allowance for all meals due under the provisions of this agreement. However, the Company intends to continue its long-standing policy of providing meals in the event of long hours of continuous work and in emergency situations when meals are unavailable elsewhere.
2.	In general the Company will not pay for time spent eating meals unless employees are required to remain at work or standby at some definite location.
3.	In cases where the Company is to provide
188
meals the obligation is on the supervisor in charge to see that they are provided, if available, and that they are adequate as to quality, quantity and timing. Timing is understood to mean that meals will be made available at, or as nearly as practical at the normal regular mealtimes and approximately each six (6) hours thereafter until released from duty. However, it is recognized that during emergencies, outages, and extended cases of trouble it may not be possible to stop and eat at these six (6) hour intervals. In the case of long continued emergency work every reasonable effort is to be made to get meals or refreshments as necessary to maintain strength and morale.
4.	In cases where employees are directed by the Company to purchase and to be reimbursed for meals the obligation rests on them to request reimbursement through the proper channels and to present satisfactory vouchers or receipts for payments made for such meals to the responsible supervisors. Employees are not to purchase meals for reimbursement except as directed by the Company.
5.	The intent and provisions of these practices will be interpreted and applied in accordance with the following general and specific procedures:
189
GENERAL PROCEDURES
A. WITH RESPECT TO ALL EMPLOYEES COVERED
I.When employees work only their scheduled hours and days in the usual manner at or from their assigned headquarters or reporting places (i.e., places to which they report, from which they start work, and to which they return) they will provide their own meals immediately before, immediately after and between scheduled working periods in the same day at their own expense.
2	. When employees are required to spend one or more nights away from their regular headquarters or reporting place while working either or both scheduled or unscheduled hours and days, the Company will provide or pay for all usual meals occurring between departure from and return to headquarters which they are unable to eat at their homes or at their regular eating places.
3	.When employees are prearranged to work on an off day, midshift meals will not be provided or paid. Otherwise, when employees are required to work outside their regularly scheduled or rescheduled hours and days of work either at or away from their assigned headquarters or reporting places as described below, the Company will provide or pay a meal allowance for all usual meals which are eaten during such periods.
190
4.	Except as described below, if between periods of work in the same day outside their regularly scheduled or rescheduled hours and days employees prefer to eat any usual meals which occur during that day at their homes or at their regular eating places, and if they can be and are released for the time necessary to do so, the Company will pay a meal allowance for such meats.
SPECIFIC PROCEDURES
B. WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEES ON NON-SHIFT WORK
1.	Early Start: In case employees on nonshift work are required to start work one hour or more before their regular starting time, and are notified to this effect before the end of their last scheduled work period, the Company will pay a meal allowance for their breakfasts and if such employees normally bring their lunches, the Company will pay a meal allowance for their lunches if not brought from home.
2.	Working After Regular Quitting Time: In case such employees are required to continue work more than two hours beyond their regular quitting time, the Company will pay a meal allowance for their suppers.
3.	Call-Outs: If such employees are called out and as a result are unable to eat any usual meals which occur during such
191
periods at their homes or at their regular eating places, the Company will pay a meal allowance for such meals obtained elsewhere. If such employees are called out any time prior to their normal starting time and as a result were unable to eat their breakfasts at their homes or at their regular eating places, or were unable to make their usual arrangements for lunches, the Company will pay a meal allowance for the breakfasts and/or lunches obtained elsewhere. If such employees are called out on their off-days, time required for eating meals occurring during the period of such callout will be counted as time worked unless circumstances are such that the usual regular hours for meals can be observed and the employees are permitted to obtain meals in a manner and at a place of their own discretion.
4.Off-Day Work: For prearranged work assignments on an employee's off day, midshift meals will not be provided or paid. Otherwise, if employees are required to work on their off-days and have not been prearranged, the Company will pay a meal allowance for all usual meals which occur during such periods when the employees are working at their overtime rates. If work starts and stops at the usual time employees will provide their own breakfasts and suppers, otherwise (1) and/or (2) above will apply.
5	.Continuous Work: In case such employees are required to work for long
192
periods, the Company will provide for extra meals or pay a meal allowance for all meals eaten at reasonable mealtime intervals of approximately six (6) hours from the last usual mealtime and approximately each six (6) hours thereafter until released from duty. However, it is recognized that during emergencies, outages, and extended cases of trouble it may not be possible to stop and eat at these six (6) hour intervals. Time required for eating meals occurring during such periods will be counted as time worked unless circumstances are such that the usual meal periods can be observed and the employees are permitted to obtain meals in a manner and at a place of their own discretion. If such work continues without break into the following day, whether it be a scheduled or unscheduled day, the Company will pay a meal allowance for all usual meals which occur during such periods.
6	.Call-Out on Holiday: If such employees are called out to work on a holiday which occurs on the employees regular scheduled work day, the Company will pay a meal allowance for all usual meals which occur during such periods. If work starts and stops at the usual time, employees will provide their own breakfasts and suppers, otherwise (1) and/or (2) will apply.
193
SPECIFIC PROCEDURES
C.WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEES ON SHIFT WORK
1	. Early Start:
Breakfast: In case employees on shift work are required to start work one hour or more before their regular starting time, and are notified to this effect before the end of their last scheduled work period, the Company will pay a meal allowance for their breakfasts and if such employees normally bring their lunches, the Company will pay a meal allowance for their lunches if not brought from home.
Dinner and Supper: In case employees on shift work are required to start work one hour or more before their regular starting time, and are notified to this effect prior to the end of their last previous scheduled work period and as a result were unable to eat their usual meals at their homes or at their regular eating places, the Company will pay a meal allowance for the meal or meals obtained elsewhere. In cases where the Company pays a meal allowance under the provisions of this paragraph and such employees usually bring their lunches, the Company will also pay a meal allowance for a meal or meals which occur during the shift.
2	.Working Beyond Shift Quitting Time: In case such employees are required to con
194
tinue work more than two hours beyond their regular shift quitting time and as a result are unable to be at their regular eating places at mealtimes, the Company will pay a meal allowance for the meals obtained elsewhere.
3	.Doubling-Over: When employees are required to double-over and work continuously through the next succeeding shift, the Company will pay a meal allowance for meals which occur during the extra shifts.
4	.Call-Outs: If such employees are called out and as a result are unable to eat any usual meals which occur during such periods at their homes or at their regular eating places, the Company will pay a meal allowance for such meals obtained elsewhere, and the time required for eating meals occurring during the period of such call-out will be counted as time worked unless circumstances are such that the usual meal periods can be observed and the employees are permitted to obtain meals in a manner and at a place of their own discretion. If employees are called out any time prior to their normal starting time and as a result were unable to eat their usual meals at their homes or at their regular eating places or were unable to make their usual arrangements for meals to be eaten during the shift, the Company will pay a meal allowance for the meal or meals obtained elsewhere.
5	. Off-Days: For prearranged overtime assignments on an employee's off day, mid
195
shift meals will not be provided or paid. If an employee doubles on an off day, the Company will pay a meal allowance for meals for the second shift.

If work starts and stops at the usual shift times, employees will provide their own meals immediately before and following such periods, otherwise (1) and/or (2) above will apply.
6	. Premium Pay Shift: Employees who are working regularly scheduled shifts which are part of their normal forty (40) hour work week but who are working at an overtime rate for hours worked in excess of eight (8) in a twenty-four (24) hour work period will provide their own mid-shift meals.
7	.Call-Out on Holiday: If such employees are called out to work on a holiday which occurs on the employee's regular scheduled work day, the Company will pay a meal allowance for all usual meals which occur during such periods.

ALABAMA POWER COMPANY DISTRIBUTION AND SUPPORT DEPARTMENT
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT PAYMENT FOR TRAVEL EXPENSE FOR EMPLOYEES REQUIRED TO
WORK OVERTIME
Subject to the limitations and provisions set forth in paragraph 2 below in respect to work on a callout basis, the Company proposes the following to apply when employees are required to work on a prearranged basis on their off-day or on a work day when the overtime worked does not run into or is not a continuation of work beyond their regular schedule:
1.	The Company will reimburse employees who live five miles or more from their headquarters measured by the shortest traveled route for travel expense as follows:
a.	If travel is by public conveyance, the Company will reimburse the employee the actual expense incurred.
b.	If travel is by personal automobile, the Company will pay for use of car at the current rate per mile. This payment will be made to only one employee in the event several employees ride in the same car.
c.	Deleted
197
d.	In each case, involving travel expense to be paid by the Company, the employees will be expected where practicable to reach an understanding with their respective supervisors as to the mode of travel and the expense involved, and the supervisors, at their option, may provide Company or other transportation rather than have the employees incur expense for which they would otherwise be reimbursed.
2.	The Company will not pay travel expense when overtime work is on a call-out basis that does not extend into the next regular work period. However, the Company will reimburse employees for the travel expense in excess of their normal travel expense where they are required to work overtime on a call-out basis which extends into the next regular work period; provided they do not receive pay for inconvenience time in excess of the two-hour minimum for the callout.
In no case will the Company utilize the callout as a means of eliminating travel expense for which the employee would otherwise be reimbursed.
