AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into by and between The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, FirstEnergy Service Company, FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC), and FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FEGCO), subsidiaries of FirstEnergy Corp., hereinafter referred to as the "Company," its successors and assigns, as hereinafter defined, and the Utility Workers Union of America (successor to the Utility Workers Organizing Committee) affiliated with AFL-CIO, on behalf of Local No. 270, hereinafter referred to as the "Union," representing certain employees of the Company, hereinafter referred to as "employee" or "employees."
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
The Company agrees that if it sells, assigns or otherwise transfers any of its business operations to any FirstEnergy Corp. or non FirstEnergy Corp. related entity during the term of the agreement and that transaction involves the transfer of employees currently represented by Local 270, such entity shall be considered a successor to this agreement, and the transaction shall be made contingent upon the agreement of the entity to recognize the Union, and be bound by the terms and conditions of employment set forth in this Agreement in the event the entity or its designee continues the business. The Company will provide the Union with those documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Article as soon as practicable after the intent to transfer is made public.
Nothing in the foregoing shall require the successor entity to offer employment to all persons in the existing workforce. The successor entity’s only requirement shall be to offer employment to that number of employees at the facility that the successor entity believes are necessary to satisfy its staffing level requirements at the time of the transfer. Any offers of employment shall be in order of seniority as provided in this agreement. If the successor entity offers employment to all members of the existing workforce at that facility and has further employment needs thereafter, job offers may be made to qualified members of Local 270 who may be on layoff with recall rights. Any employee not offered employment by the successor entity shall, at the employee’s option, choose either of the following options: 1. The exercise of the employee’s seniority rights under Article VI, Section 6b, to The Company or 2. The receipt of severance benefits as specified under The Company’s Severance Benefits Plan.
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, The Company is engaged in furnishing an essential public service which vitally affects the health, safety, comfort and general well-being of a large number of the population; and
WHEREAS, the very existence of the Company is conditioned and dependent upon the faithful carrying out of its obligations and responsibility in service to the public; and
WHEREAS, this responsibility to the public is the mutual responsibility of both employees and the management of the Company and requires that any disputes arising between the employees and the management be adjusted and settled in an orderly manner without interruption of said service to the public; and
WHEREAS, both parties hereto recognize this mutual responsibility of service to the public; and
WHEREAS, both parties hereto desire to enter into an agreement eliminating as nearly as possible any reason for strikes, stoppage of work or lockouts during the term of the said agreement and during any period while negotiations are in progress between them for any change or renewal of said agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and agreements hereinafter contained, it is agreed that:
ARTICLE I
Recognition of the Union
Section 1.
The Company recognizes the Union-the Avon, Cleveland and Ashtabula Divisions having been certified by the National Labor Relations Board, October 18, 1943, Case Numbers R-5358 to R-5367, inclusive, to which certification reference is hereby made--as the exclusive collective bargaining agency in all matters pertaining to wages, hours, working and all other conditions of employment, for all operating, maintenance and construction employees, but excluding office, clerical, sales and technical employees, employees in the Civil and Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Wire Relations, Survey and Records elements, production and test engineers, load and trouble dispatchers, chemists and laboratory assistants, Property Protection employees, Electrical Inspectors, and all supervisory employees with authority to hire, promote, discharge, discipline or otherwise effect changes in the status of employees, or effectively recommend such action.
The Company and Union agree to treat all employees covered by said certification as a single bargaining unit for purposes of collective bargaining.
This agreement shall have no application to any employee who is not within the unit described in Section 1 of this Article.
Section 2.
It is the policy of the Company and the Union that the provisions of this Agreement be applied to all employees covered by this Agreement without regard to such employees’ race, color, creed, sex, religion, national origin, age, handicap, or Vietnam Era Veteran status.
Section 3
The Company will pay not more than three (3) Union representatives from the Union, Local 270 U.W.U.A. as follows; The Union representatives will be paid their regular straight time rate of pay from their scheduled work period while engaged in contract negotiations with the Company (limited to eight (8) hours per day).
ARTICLE II
Union Membership and Dues
Section 1.
(a)	Any employee hired into or transferred to a job within the bargaining unit shall, within thirty (30) days after the first day of the month next succeeding the date on which he was transferred or comes under the terms of this agreement as provided in Article XIV, Section 2 (whichever is later) become and remain a member of the Union for the duration of this agreement as a condition of continued employment unless:
(1)	Such membership is not available on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members; or
(2)	Membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender periodic dues and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
The provisions contained above applicable to transferred employees shall apply to a person who returns to active employment from a military leave of absence or a layoff period.
(b)	The Company will submit to the Union in writing within the first week of each month a list of those employees who, for any reason, have become eligible for Union membership and subject to the provisions of subsection (a) during the preceding month.
(c)	The Union will submit to the Company in writing a list of those active employees who have failed to tender their regular initiation fees and dues for a period of one month. The Company will notify promptly those persons named and will discontinue employment to such persons who are not in compliance with the terms of this section within thirty (30) days after such notification. A disagreement between the Union and the Company with respect to the tenure of employment of such persons named will be handled through the grievance procedure.
(d)	If the first pay period ending in any month results in all time spent on one-half (1/2) pay sick leave, or industrial injury pay provisions of this agreement, or if the employee is not entitled to any pay for such pay period, payment of Union dues for that month is waived.
Section 2.
(a)	All employees who sign the following authorization card shall have their Union dues deducted as therein set forth, except as outlined in Section 2(c):
ASSIGNMENT AND CHECKOFF AUTHORIZATION
I hereby assign to the Utility Workers Union of America (Affiliated with AFL-CIO) and Local No. 270 an amount equal to my monthly dues as provided for in the collective bargaining agreements between The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, FirstEnergy Service Company, and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC), and FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FEGCO), subsidiaries of FirstEnergy Corp., its successors and assigns, as defined, and the said Union in effect from time to time.
I authorize FirstEnergy Corp. to deduct the said amount from my wages payable to me for the first pay period ending in each calendar month. I further authorize the Company to pay the amount so deducted in the manner provided in the said agreements.
This assignment and authorization shall become effective on the first day of the month next succeeding the date on which the Company receives the authorization card and shall continue in force from year to year so long as there is a checkoff of dues provision in the collective bargaining agreements between the Company and said Union except that it is automatically revoked if I go on military leave, resign, am laid off, discharged, released, or transferred out of the bargaining unit; and except that it can be revoked:
(1)	At any time before it becomes effective,
(2)	At any time during the period from April 1 to April 10 in each year,
(3)	For a period of 10 calendar days following the designated termination date of any such agreement between the Company and the Union, and
(4)	At such other times as may be required by law.
Such revocation shall be made by written notice sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the Manager of Industrial Relations of the Company.
(Signed)................Department	............
Name....................Date	..............
(Print)
(b)	On or before the effective date of this agreement, the Financial Secretary of the Local Union shall certify to the Company the amount of monthly dues of each member of the Union and will from time to time notify the Company in writing of any change in such amounts. The Company shall be entitled to rely on such certifications in complying with the checkoff provisions of this agreement.
(c)	The Company will, except in case of an employee on half (1/2)-pay sick leave, or casualty under the industrial injury pay provisions of this Agreement, deduct Union dues as provided for in the authorization card, from the wages payable for the first pay period ending in each calendar month of each employee who has signed such authorization card. For the purpose of this paragraph,
the employee will be considered to be on half-pay sick leave or casualty under the State-Basis Workers' Compensation Plan only if the entire pay period is spent on half-pay or casualty.
(d)	The Company will remit to the National office of the Union the total sum of such deductions on or before the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month in which such deductions are made.
(e)	On the 1st day of April, 1963 and 1964 and annually thereafter if the termination date of the agreement is any date other than May 1, 1964, the Company shall post the following form of notice on its bulletin boards usually used for the purpose of giving notices to Union members: "Article II, Section 1 of the current collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Union proves that a Union Shop is in effect for certain employees. Union dues may be paid either through properly authorized payroll deductions or by such other methods as may be mutually satisfactory to the employee and the Union. According to law, all employees who have authorized payroll deductions for dues payment must be given an opportunity to revoke such authorizations at least once each year, whether covered by a Union Shop provision or not.”
"All members of Utility Workers Union of America (Affiliated with AFL-CIO) Local No. 270 who have signed and caused to be delivered to either the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., FirstEnergy Service Company, FirstEnergy Generation Corp. (FEGCO), or FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC), as appropriate, its successors and assigns, as defined, an assignment and check-off of dues authorization reserve the right to revoke the same during specified periods. Such revocations are valid only if made by written notice sent by certified mail with a return receipt requested to the Manager of Industrial Relations, FirstEnergy Corp., 76 S. Main St., Akron, Ohio 44308, on or before May 1, 20....... All un-revoked assignment and check-off authorization shall
continue in full force and effect without a right of revocation until ............."
"A revocation of Assignment and Checkoff Authorization of Union dues will be considered as an election by the employee to make payment of membership dues in another manner and not a withdrawal from membership in the Union."
The Company may substitute the name of the Manager of Industrial Relations in the foregoing notice and shall fill in the appropriate dates.
(f)	The Company shall notify the Union within the first week of each month of all revocations, automatic or otherwise, of assignment and checkoff authorizations, which the Company made or received during the preceding month.
Section 3.
The Union will not engage in Union activities on Company time or property, except as required under the grievance procedure.
Section 4.
a)	After receiving a written authorization and assignment from the individual employee, the Company shall deduct from each pay for each month, the employee’s pledge to the Union’s COPE and/or United Way Programs. The Company will notify within the first week of each month all authorizations, assignments and revocations received during the preceding month and will remit all pledges to the Union Officer designated by the Union at that time.
b)	The Company will not be required to make the authorized payroll deduction outlined in Article II, Section 4(a) if the employee is on half (1/2)-pay sick leave or casualty under the industrial injury pay provisions of this agreement only if the entire pay period is spent on half-pay or casualty.
c)	A revocation of authorization may be accomplished at anytime by a written notice sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Manager of Industrial Relations.
ARTICLE III
Rights of Management
Section 1.
The Company shall have the supervision, direction and control of its property
and operations and shall have the right to determine how many employees it will employ or retain in various capacities, and the size and composition of working forces. It is the intention of the parties that this section shall not alter or supersede other provisions of this Agreement specifically covering any matter. It is also the intention of the parties that nothing herein contained shall serve to deny, or constitute a waiver of the right of the Company to exercise other normal functions of management, not enumerated herein, provided that these rights shall not be exercised for the purpose of unjust discrimination against any employee, or to avoid any of the provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE IV
No Strikes or Lockouts
It is mutually agreed that there will be no concerted failure to report for work, cessation of work, slowdown, strike, picketing or lockout during the term of this agreement, or during any period of time while negotiations are in progress between the parties hereto for the continuance or the renewal of this Agreement.
Any employee who is responsible for, or participates in a breach of this provision shall be subject to such disciplinary action, including discharge, as appears advisable in the judgment of the Company and, if a member of the Union, shall be subject to disciplinary action by the Union. This section is subject to the employees' privilege of bringing a grievance as herein provided for in Article V.
ARTICLE V
Grievance and Arbitration Procedure
Section 1.
a.	Unless the parties mutually agree otherwise, the following grievance procedure shall be used by the Union to settle or adjust any disagreement concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement. When a number of days is mentioned it shall be exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and the holidays listed in Article VII of this Agreement.
Step One
When the disagreement is presented by the employee or his Union representative to the employee’s supervisor, the grievant or his Union representative may request a Step One meeting to discuss the matter. Within five (5) working days of such request, a meeting will be held with the employee and his supervisor or with the employee and/or his Union representative and appropriate supervision designated by the Company.
If not settled through this meeting with supervision, a grievance may then be written by the authorized Union representative on a standard form mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union, stating the facts, including the name of the individual or individuals involved, and the reasons and the contract provisions, upon which the grievance is based and signed by the Union representative. If a grievance does not comply with these requirements, the Union representative will be so informed when he delivers the grievance, and the area or areas of deficiency will be explained to him. A grievance will not be accepted for filing until after the area or areas of deficiency have been corrected. The grievance will be filed when delivered to and accepted by supervision, at which time the supervisor will initial and date the form. If a grievance is not so filed within twenty-five (25) calendar days of its occurrence, or five (5) days after the last initial contact held within the twenty-five (25) day period, or five (5) days after the grievance is delivered with deficiencies to be corrected, whichever is later, it will no longer exist. Offers of settlement by either party shall not be binding in subsequent steps of this procedure. Further, any settlements at Step One shall not constitute a precedent for future grievances.
Any grievance appealing the discharge of an employee must be filed within ten (10) working days of such discharge or it shall no longer exist. To afford an expeditious resolution of such a grievance, it shall be processed in accordance with the procedure of this paragraph in lieu of the procedure or time limits set out elsewhere in this Article. The grievance shall be filed, in
writing, within the ten (10) days by presenting such grievance to the employee’s supervisor or general supervisor. The initial grievance meeting shall be at the Step Two level. The Step Two meeting shall be scheduled within five (5) days of the receipt of the grievance, and the meeting shall be held within ten (10) days of receipt of the grievance. If not resolved at the Step Two level, it may be processed to arbitration within ten (10) days of the date of the final Step Two meeting. The party receiving the notice of intent to submit to arbitration shall have five (5) days to answer the request for arbitration. Unless both parties agree otherwise, briefs are to be filed within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the transcript. The Arbitrator shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of the briefs, or from the date of the close of the hearing if no briefs are filed, to render the award.
Step Two
Not later than fifteen (15) days after a grievance is filed, the Company shall notify the Union President of the date, time and location of the meeting in Step Two, which date shall be no later than fifteen (15) days after the day of notification. At the meeting the Company and Union shall be represented by the appropriate representatives, the Union may be represented by its three (3) Divisional Chairman and another Union representative and the grievant may also be present. The Company and the Union shall each designate an official spokesman who shall have full power and authority to settle the grievance, and to give all notices and make all requests required in this step of the grievance procedure. At Step Two the relief sought and the relief offered shall be specified on the grievance form.
If a grievance is not submitted to the persons designated above within the time limit specified, the grievance shall be deemed to no longer exist.
b.	Any meeting to be held in connection with Step Two shall be at the grievant’s regular fixed reporting point at a time mutually agreeable to the Company and the Union. However, the Company will pay not more than two (2) members designated by the Union at their regular straight time rates of pay (not exceeding (8) hours in any day) for all time lost from their scheduled work period to attend a Step Two meeting, and for the actual cost of their transportation from their normal reporting location to the place of the meeting providing that if private automobile transportation is utilized the costs shall be limited to the current IRS mileage rate.
Section 2.
1)	A written request for arbitration shall be served on the Manager, Industrial Relations within fifteen (15) days after the decision in Step 2 above. Within ten (10) days after service of such written notice, the Union will be served with a notice confirming the request to arbitrate. Within twelve (12) months of such confirming notice, the Union may request to schedule the arbitration for a hearing. If the Union desires to schedule an arbitration, the Union shall give notice, to the other party, within the twelve (12) month period or the grievance shall be deemed no longer to exist. Once proper notice to schedule an arbitration has been received, within ten
(10) working days, the parties agree to select a neutral arbitrator from the permanent panel of arbitrators established in accordance with paragraphs (2), (3) and (4).
2)	The American Arbitration Association (AAA) or the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) will be asked to provide the Company and Union a list of forty (40) arbitrators who reside within a three hundred and fifty (350) mile radius of Cleveland. In addition, those arbitrators submitted to the parties should have experience in the utility or steel industries.
The Company and Union will meet in an effort to jointly select nine (9) of those arbitrators as the permanent panel. In the event agreement cannot be reached on any or all of the positions available, the AAA or FMCS will provide a second list of forty (40) qualified arbitrators and mutual selection will continue until nine (9) arbitrators are selected.
The arbitrators selected will be provided a copy of the current Agreement.
3)	Once a grievance has been submitted for arbitration, the AAA, FMCS, or the Company and Union will select an arbitrator, from the panel, by way of a random drawing.
The arbitrator selected will provide dates of availability through the AAA, FMCS, or directly to the Company and Union. The hearing date will be the first mutually selected date based on the availability of each party.
4)	Either party shall have the right to request the removal, without challenge, of an arbitrator from the panel. Should an Arbitrator withdraw or be removed, selection of a replacement will be by mutual agreement of both parties, based on names provided by the AAA or FMCS.
5)	Each party to the Agreement shall bear the expense of its own representative at the arbitration hearing. As to the expense of the neutral arbitrator, the following shall apply. The expense of the neutral arbitrator shall be shared equally by both parties hereto. For purposes of the foregoing, expenses of the neutral arbitrator shall include all fees or other amounts incurred by the neutral arbitrator as well as appearance fees and related expenses of the court reporter, including costs associated with furnishing the neutral arbitrator with a copy of the hearing transcript. In the event that either side desires to withdraw, postpone, or cancel an arbitration less than thirty (30) days prior to hearing date, such party shall be responsible for all costs associated with the withdrawal, postponement or cancellation, including any related fees owed the neutral arbitrator and/or court reporter, unless the parties agree otherwise.
6)	No arbitrator shall have the power to change, add to, or subtract from any of the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator's function shall be limited to the interpretation and application of existing clauses.
7)	For any arbitration under this Article, except those relating to a discharge or suspension, the parties may mutually agree to an expedited arbitration. For all discharge and suspension arbitrations, as well as those in which the parties have not mutually agreed to an expedited arbitration, the arbitrator shall render a decision within thirty (30) days, following the hearing or
following receipt of the briefs or expiration of the time limit for submission of such briefs, whichever is later. For an expedited arbitration, there will be no transcript of the proceedings, no post hearing briefs and the neutral arbitrator shall issue a summary decision as soon as practicable following the hearing.
Section 3.
a.	Any steps in the grievance procedure may be waived or combined by mutual consent in writing of the President of the Local Union and the Company or any persons designated by either of them.
b.	At any step of the grievance procedure, including arbitration either party may change the ultimate facts, reasons, or contract provisions on which it relies, but if it does, the other party shall have the option of referring the grievance back to Step One of the grievance procedure without decision at the point where the amendment was made.
c.	Either of the parties may have present at grievance meetings any additional person or persons whom it may consider necessary to the proper consideration and settlement of the grievance for the period of time necessary for them to present additional pertinent facts.
Section 4.
The investigation of grievances by the Union shall be on its own time and its own expense. Cases may arise where an investigation can be made conveniently only on the job or on Company property during working hours, in which case the following rules shall apply: All members of the collective bargaining committee, including the President and/or Vice President of the Union, or departmental representatives of the Union employed on the property of the Company shall be permitted to enter upon the property of the Company at all reasonable times provided such entry is necessary for the purpose of making an investigation of any grievance arising between the members of the Union and the Company and such entry shall not be disruptive to Company operations. No such entry shall be made upon the premises for such purpose until the appropriate Company representative in charge of such department or plant has been advised and permission granted.
ARTICLE VI
Seniority
Section 1.
For the purpose of layoff in Section 6 and transfer to a starting job in Section 3(d), continuous service seniority shall be defined as the date of entry into the bargaining unit. Seniority, as otherwise used herein, is defined as the status accruing to employees through length of service, which entitled them to the preferences provided for in this Article. Seniority shall be determined by
length of service in a job classification except as otherwise provided in Section 4 and 5 of this Article.
Section 2.
(a)	An "occupational group" is defined as the employees in all connected job classifications within a line of promotion as shown on the promotional charts contained in the Job Manual which was adopted by the Company and the Union on November 23, 1945, and amended from time to time. By November 1st of each year, seniority rosters for each occupational group will be posted by the Company on bulletin boards throughout the departments affected. Each roster will contain the names of all employees within the occupational group, arranged by job classification and, within each classification, in the order of their seniority. Each roster will also show the location seniority, company seniority, job classification seniority date, seniority roster history; and the continuous service date of each employee within the occupational group unless such dates are the same as shown on the last previously published roster.
Each roster will list those employees, if any, on layoff and on military leave of absence status within the occupational group.
(b)	Any exception taken to the seniority of an employee as shown on his seniority roster must be taken within ten (10) days of the posting of such rosters. All exceptions shall be reconciled by the Union and the Company within thirty (30) days of such posting, after which the rosters will be considered accurate as of that date. The posted seniority rosters will be brought up to date every year. An employee who is absent during any portion of the ten-day period referred to above may take exception to his own seniority as shown on the seniority roster within ten (10) days of his return to work.
(c)	The designation of occupational groups for seniority purposes shall not preclude the continuance of jobs involving work in more than one occupational group nor the regular, seasonal or temporary assignment of employees in one occupational group to jobs in other occupational groups for which they are qualified, in order to balance schedules or provide other work for employees during seasonal or other slack periods. When an employee works in any other job classification or line of promotion he will continue to accumulate seniority in his regular job classification.
(d)	When a probationary employee comes under the terms and provisions of this agreement, as provided in Section 2 of Article XIV, his seniority shall be determined by retroactive application of the rules of seniority provided in this Article.
Section 3.
(a)	It is hereby declared to be the policy of the Company to fill vacancies by promotion from the ranks of employees, rather than to hire others for such purposes. The Company reserves the right; however, to hire others for such purposes if there is no employee within the ranks qualified for promotion.
(b)	Selection for promotion to a vacant job within the bargaining unit will be made from available employees in the next lower job classification in the line of promotion in which the vacancy occurs, on the basis of job qualifications and seniority. Seniority shall be given preference, provided the senior employee in the line of promotion has the necessary qualifications. In addition to considering the employee's record and past performance, the Company may require the employee to satisfactorily pass reasonable tests - oral, written or practical - to determine his qualifications.
Employees in other occupational groups, will, under certain conditions stated in Item 3 of the Foreword to the Job Manual, be given preference over non-employees.
When no qualified employees from the occupational group are available or willing to fill a higher classified opening, the Company will post the job opening and applicable wage rate on Company bulletin boards for a period of five days and, before hiring nonemployees for the position, will give prior consideration to qualified employees requesting the job by certified mail to the local Human Resources Office, within the five (5) days.
If the normal line of promotion to any given job classification is from two or more lower job classifications, seniority for promotion to said job classification will be determined by the total service in all such lower job classifications from which promotion can be made.
If it should become necessary in making a promotion to bypass an employee's seniority for any reason, the Company will fully discuss the matter with the Union in an endeavor to arrive at an understanding thereon before such bypass is made. In the event of disagreement the Union may file a grievance.
To effectively implement this section, an employee may be required to designate in writing the regular headquarters within the zone or regular fixed reporting point outside the zone to which he would accept a promotion. If a promotional opportunity for which the employee is qualified is available at any of the headquarters or fixed reporting points designated by the employee, such employee will be promoted at that location, based on his job classification seniority, in the order of his preference. The written designation, if used, will be for the promotional opportunities available to fill a manning change and will not be filed and used on a continuing basis.
(c)	A reasonable number of engineers may be assigned work at different occupations within the bargaining unit in any department as part of a training period, and while so employed, shall neither be affected by provisions of this agreement nor by their employment effect the status of other employees of the department.
(d)	When a vacancy exists in a starting job, either an existing or a newly created job, the Company will post a notice on the Company bulletin boards for a period of ten (10) days. The notice will state the applicable wage rate and will include the Job Specifications with qualifications. Employees who are interested in being considered for the vacancy must file a written request by certified mail to the local Human Resources Office. The selection of qualified employees will be made on the basis of continuous service seniority. When an employee is
transferred pursuant to this subsection, he will not be eligible thereafter to reply to another such starting job notice for a period of eighteen (18) calendar months from the effective date of such transfer if he has less than ten years of continuous service at the time of such transfer, or for a period of twelve (12) calendar months if he has ten (10) or more years of continuous service at the time of such transfer.
When a vacancy exists in a starting job at more than one location, the employee, when responding to the notice, will indicate his preference of reporting locations and the foregoing provisions shall apply.
The Company will have seventy-five (75) calendar days following the posting period to fill vacancies in starting jobs outside of Perry Plant and one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days following the posting period to fill vacancies in starting jobs at Perry Plant. Prior to proceeding with the actual transfer of employees, the Company will notify the Union in writing of the following:
(1)	Names of all bargaining unit applicants and their respective Continuous Service dates, indicating the names of employees who will be transferred.
(2)	The number and names of additional transfers from non-bargaining unit positions and/or the number of new hires necessary to fill the remaining vacancies.
If an employee who has transferred pursuant to this subsection elects to return to his/her former job in accordance with the terms of Section 5, the seventy-five (75) calendar day or one hundred and twenty (120) calendar day requirements will no longer apply.
(e)	Except for employees within the Electrical Operator's line of promotion: (i) employees located at a regular fixed reporting point outside the zone may request a change to another fixed reporting point outside the zone or to a regular headquarters within the zone; (ii) employees having a regular headquarters within the zone may request a change of headquarters within the zone or to a regular fixed reporting point outside the zone. The procedure for requesting such changes is as follows:
(1)	The Company will post a notice at appropriate locations advising employees of the opportunity to make a request for change in reporting location. The notice shall specify the time limits during which written request must be filed and the deadline for filing, which shall be at least ten (10) days after the date of posting.
(2)	Any employee who is eligible to request a change in accordance with the notice must submit his written request to the local Human Resources Office within the time limit specified on the notice. If an employee, in accordance with this opportunity, submits requests to have his location changed to two or more different headquarters or fixed reporting points outside the zone, he shall indicate in the appropriate space provided on the request form his order of priority, i.e., first choice, second choice, etc.
(3)	The regular headquarters or fixed reporting point outside the zone, as the case may be, of eligible employees so submitting requests will be changed to the extent of the availability of openings. In making such changes, the Company will honor the requests on file in the order of the employees' job classification seniority.
(4)	Changes resulting from requests filled in response to a posting will, to the extent practical, be made within fifteen (15) days after the deadline for filing a request. Thereafter, all such requests will be discarded and any subsequent opportunities will again be posted.
No moving expenses will be paid an employee whose reporting location is changed as a result of his request. In the event there is an insufficient number or no request for change received, and there is a surplus at another location in that job classification, the qualified employee with the least job classification seniority at the location at which the surplus exists will be transferred to fill the vacancy.
Employees using their seniority to request changes of reporting points indiscriminately may be denied future changes of reporting points.
The foregoing provisions shall apply within an occupational group.
Section 4.
An employee who is transferred from one seniority roster to another shall continue to accumulate seniority on the roster he was transferred from for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer, except as provided in Section 5 of this Article. During this period if he is transferred back to his former roster, it shall be without prejudice to his seniority status, except as provided in Section 5 of this Article. At the end of this period, seniority on the new roster shall be established as of the date of transfer. Seniority on the former roster shall be abandoned except that if the transferred employee is threatened with a demotion resulting from layoff following his transfer he may, for the sole purpose of avoiding such demotion or layoff, exercise his occupational group seniority in the job classification from which he was transferred, to displace any employee of lesser seniority in the same or any lower job classification provided he meets the job specifications and qualifications.
Section 5.
In the event an employee is excused from accepting a promotion or transfer or fails to qualify for a promotion as provided in this Article, it shall have no effect upon his future opportunity for promotion or transfer. In the event an employee is promoted or transferred and within six (6) months he proves incapable of holding his new position, he shall be allowed to return to his former position without prejudice, subject to the provisions of this agreement. In the event an employee is promoted or transferred to a different job, and within six (6) weeks, or at the completion of his initial training (whichever is longer but not longer than sixty (60) days in any case) elects to return to his former job, he shall be allowed to do so without prejudice, subject to the provisions of this agreement. Where such an employee elects to return to his former job after six (6) weeks, or at the
completion of his initial training (whichever is longer but not longer than sixty (60) days in any case), and such return is agreeable to the Company, his job classification seniority date in the job to which he returns shall be the date of such return.
Section 6.
(a)	The Company will give one week's notice or one week’s pay of forty (40) hours in lieu of notice to an employee being laid off. An employee intending to resign will give the Company one week's notice. The Company will notify the Union at least two weeks in advance of any proposed layoffs and afford the Union an opportunity to discuss the matter fully with the Company.
(b)	If it becomes necessary to reduce the working force in any job classification, reductions shall be made in the following manner:
Starting with the job classification in which the surplus exists, the surplus employees will be determined on the basis of those having the least occupational group seniority. The surplus employee or employees in the order of their occupational group seniority will first be given the opportunity of exercising any rights they may have under Article VI, Section 4. If no such rights exist, or the employee declines to exercise such rights, then he shall be given the opportunity of displacing any employee in a job of lower classification provided he has greater occupational group seniority than the employee being displaced in the lower job classification and provided he is qualified and capable of performing the work. Employees who are displaced from their jobs by this process will be given the opportunity of displacing employees in lower job classifications in the same manner. Employees who are so transferred or demoted (but not laid off) shall retain their seniority in their former job classification and be entitled to fill any subsequent vacancies in such job classification in the inverse order of their transfer or demotion therefrom without regard to the seniority of employees of lower classification.
Any employee who is unable to displace any other employee in his line of promotion and is thereby surplus in the lowest job classification in that occupational group will be given the opportunity, based on his continuous service seniority, to displace a probationary employee in a starting job for which he can qualify or the employee with the least continuous service seniority in a starting job which the surplus employee meets the job specifications and qualifications, before he is laid off. Regular employees who are so transferred or laid off shall retain their seniority in their former job classification for a period of two (2) years from the date of layoff and shall be entitled to fill any subsequent vacancies in such job classification in the inverse order of their layoff without regard to the seniority of employees of lower classification, if any. On a subsequent increase of such working force within a period of two (2) years, employees will be called back to work in the inverse order of their layoff, if available, and able and qualified to return to work, before new employees are added from other departments or from outside the Company.
In order to avoid unfairness that may exist in any unusual or special case, the layoff and rehiring procedure of this section may be varied by agreement between the Union and the Company.
Section 7.
(a)	An employee with ten (10) or more years of continuous service who becomes surplus, other than as a result of an employee exercising his rights under Section 5 of this Article, will receive no reduction in his hourly rate of pay. In addition, he will receive no future general increases as long as his rate remains above the maximum rate of the job classification into which he is placed. This paragraph will have no application to incapacitated employees or employees who are unable or unwilling to qualify for available work.
(b)	If after the application of Section 6(b) of this Article, one or more employees with ten (10) or more years of continuous service with the Company have been reduced to the lowest classification in the occupational group where the reduction of the work force took place, and this creates a surplus in such job classification, one or more of these employees with ten (10) or more years of continuous service will be offered a bargaining unit job, including a bargaining unit job currently being performed by a contractor, which he can do. The job he is offered will be such that his placement in that job will not displace an employee who at the time of transfer has greater continuous service with the Company than the employee faced with layoff. Nothing in the foregoing shall require the Company to create a new job, nor guarantee the continued employment of any employee.
(c)	His seniority in the job classification in which he is placed will be established by agreement between the Company and the Union. He shall retain recall rights to his former job classification according to his occupational group seniority in that occupational group.
(d)	If an employee with ten (10) or more years of continuous service refuses the job offered him under this section, he will be laid off with all rights and privileges provided under Section 6(b) of this Article.
Section 8.	Incapacitated Employees.
(a)	Any employee who, because of an injury suffered in the course of and arising out of his employment with the Company, cannot in the opinion of the Company physician perform his regular duties but is capable of performing a job in an existing job classification in the bargaining unit, will be assigned to a job, the duties of which he is capable of performing. In the event that such placement involves a demotion, such employee will not have his rate reduced but shall not receive any general wage increase unless and until his rate is equal to the maximum rate for the job classification in which he is placed. If such employee has completed twenty (20) or more years of service he may elect to receive benefits under the second paragraph of this Section in lieu of benefits under this paragraph.
(b)	Further, any employee who has completed twenty (20) or more years of service and who, at that time, in the opinion of the Company's physician has become incapacitated during the term of his employment and who cannot perform his regular duties but is capable of performing
a job in an existing job classification in the bargaining unit, will be assigned to a job, the duties of which he is capable of performing. He shall receive the maximum rate of pay for the job classification in which he is placed, plus a percentage of the difference between his former rate of pay and such maximum for the new job. Such percentage will be twenty-five percent (25%) for twenty (20) years of service and increased by five percent (5%) for each additional year of service but not to exceed, in total, ninety percent (90%) of such difference and provided further that he shall receive one-half (1/2) of any general wage increase, but no such employee shall receive less than the appropriate rate for the job he is then performing.
(c)	When an employee who has been off due to industrial injury has been released by his physician for light duty, and the Company has offered such employee light duty, the employee shall initially be carried at his regular rate for a two (2) week period. At the end of this initial period, he shall be reviewed, and this process shall be continued with a review at the expiration of each two (2) week period. The primary purpose of these periodic reviews is to assure that the employee is returned to his regular duties as soon as he is able to do so. Conversely, if, at the expiration of ninety (90) but no later than one hundred fifty (150) calendar days from his return to modified duty he is unable to resume his regular duties, he shall be treated as incapacitated in accordance with this Section.
(d)	The monthly rate of pay plus amounts, if any, paid for Workers' Compensation, shall not in the aggregate exceed the rate of pay which he was receiving for the job from which he was transferred, except that he shall not be paid less than the appropriate rate for the job to which he is transferred.
(e)	Article VI. of this contract entitled "Seniority" shall not be applicable when complying with the terms of this Section, and if transferred to a job in the bargaining unit such employee's seniority in the job classification in which he is placed shall be that which he had in the job classification from which he was transferred.
(f)	Any employee displaced by an employee assigned to a job pursuant to the first or second paragraphs of this Section shall be treated as though he had been displaced under Article VI, Section 6.
(g)	Any employee who is unable to be placed into an existing job under either paragraph a. or b. of this section shall receive, if he so qualifies, either disability retirement benefits under the terms and conditions specified in the Pension Plan or effective January 1, 2004, benefits set forth in the terms and conditions of the Long-term Disability plan.
Section 9.
All leaves of absence for periods of more than two (2) weeks except sick leaves and military leaves shall be requested and approved in writing and shall state the conditions thereof. A copy of each such leave of absence shall be kept on file by the department manager and a copy furnished to the employee and to the Union.
(a)	An employee elected as President or Vice President of Local 270 will, upon proper notice, be given a leave of absence without pay for a period of three years without the necessity of 90-day renewals and an employee who is elected to any other office in the Union or is selected as delegate for specific activities for or on behalf of the AFL-CIO, or its affiliates, which requires their absence from duty with the Company will be given a leave of absence without pay, any extension or renewal thereof being optional with the Company, and will be reinstated to their former position provided they are able and qualified to return to work. The return of the President or Vice President shall be accomplished in a similar fashion to the provisions of Article III of the Separate Agreement covering Military Leave of Absence. During such period of absence, said officer's seniority shall continue to accumulate. Further, the President and Vice President are each eligible to participate, at the Union's expense, in the Company's Health Care, Life Insurance and Pension Plans, so long as each is on full time leave of absence under this paragraph (a). The Company will submit a bill to the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to the start of the quarter for which coverage under a plan is requested. Payment must be received by the Company prior to the start of each such quarter or coverage shall terminate as to the Health Care and Life Insurance Plans, and no earnings shall be credited as to the Pension Plan.
(b)	An employee who may be called upon to transact business for the Union which requires his temporary (not exceeding thirty (30) consecutive days) absence from duty with the permission from the proper representatives of the Company, be allowed to absent himself from duty without pay, but without loss of seniority rights, for sufficient time to transact such business. During such periods of absence, his seniority shall continue to accumulate.
(c)	While receiving sick leave benefits, an employee will accumulate seniority.
(d)	Re-employment, benefits and seniority rights of employees leaving for and returning from military service are set forth in a separate memorandum of agreement dated May 1, 2003.
A leave of absence is defined as any absence without pay requested by the employee in excess of ten (10) working days.
Section 10.
Seniority will be terminated in cases of resignation, discharge for cause, failure to reply within five (5) days to recall to work sent to the former employee's last know address by certified mail, return receipt requested, failure to report absence from work within three (3) scheduled work days without reasonable excuse or justification, violation of the conditions of a leave of absence, or failure to report for work within one year of the expiration of sick leave benefits, and as provided in Section 9(c) of this Article. In any case where seniority has been terminated, it is understood that there is no further obligation to offer re-employment.
Section 11.
The Company will promptly notify the Union, in writing, of any employee who exits the Bargaining Unit for the purpose of accepting a non-represented job within the Company. The notification will include the employee’s name, former position and date of exit.
Article VII
Hours of Work
Section 1.
For the purpose of computing overtime, sick time, holiday and vacation pay the following definitions will apply:
The Company's standard workday is the period of twenty-four (24) hours starting and ending at midnight.
The Company's standard workweek is the period of seven (7) consecutive days starting at 12:01 A.M. on Monday and ending at midnight (12:00 a.m.) on Sunday.
The Company's pay period covers two standard workweeks. Payment shall be through direct deposit in accordance with the Company’s direct deposit program.
An employee’s basic workweek consists of the first forty (40)-scheduled hours within a standard workweek. Such hours will be scheduled as five (5) 8-hour days, or four (4) 10-hour days in accordance with Appendix B. As an exception to the foregoing, the Company may, in its discretion, establish a 12-hour schedule for any shift operations that is cost-neutral over a pay period, provided that it is agreeable with the majority of the department employees. The general parameters with respect to a 12-hour schedule are contained in Appendix B.
Overtime work is time worked outside of an employee’s basic workday or basic workweek. As an exception, an employee scheduled for two (2) consecutive regular shifts will receive payment of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the hourly rate for the second regularly scheduled shift.
Section 2.
Payment for overtime work shall be made at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the hourly rate except as provided elsewhere in this agreement.
Section 3.
For all hours actually worked on an employee's second scheduled day off within a standard workweek, an employee will be paid at the rate of double time. The employee's second overtime day off shall be considered his Sunday, except that when a calendar Sunday is one of the scheduled
off days, it shall be considered the double rate day. Only one double rate day will be deemed to exist in any calendar week, except in case of a holiday in a given week.
Payment for overtime work with a rate in excess of time and one-half will be computed by multiplying the basic straight time hourly rate by the overtime factor and adding shift premium and /or Sunday premium if applicable.
Section 4.
Each department of the Company has established regular schedules of days and hours of work for a period of one or more weeks. Except in cases of emergency, the Company will make no change in a regular schedule until it has afforded the Union an opportunity to review and discuss the same.
The Company will base such changes upon need for revision, such as new or changed work requirements of a regular or recurring nature.
Procedure for review:
(a)	The Company will advise the Union of the new schedule and the proposed effective date.
(b)	The Company will also advise the Union concerning its reasons for making such change.
(c)	The department manager or his representative will arrange a meeting with the Chief Job Steward, who will bring a representative of the group involved, at least seven (7) days before the posting date.
(d)	They will discuss the matter thoroughly, each considering the viewpoint and suggestions of the other.
(e)	The Company will post the new schedule at least seven (7) days before its effective date.
The Company will review and discuss with the Union all suggestions for improvements in regular schedules which are brought to the attention of the Company by Union Officers.
Section 5.
Each employee will be assigned to a regular schedule.
Conditions at times require the Company to change the schedule of one or more employees.
(a)	When such conditions arise which require work outside of an employee's regular
schedule, the schedule change shall be a full shift of eight (8) hours or more. Such a change will not be considered as a change of a regular schedule even though two or more employees are so affected. Changes under this subsection will be for a specific job or for an estimated period of time of limited duration and the provisions of subsection (b) will apply.
(b)	When the Company deems it necessary to change an employee’s scheduled hours of work the company agrees to give not less than forty-seven and one-half (47 1/2) hours notice of such change prior to the time the said employee is to start work on the new schedule. In the event the Company does not give such forty-seven and one-half (47 1/2) hours notice, the employee shall be paid not less than one and one-half (1 ^) times the employee’s straight time rate for the first eight (8) hours under the new schedule if worked.
When the change of a work schedule of a shift employee shall involve the employee’s normal days off, and forty-seven and one half (47 1/2) consecutive hours notice shall not have been given to the effected employee, then said shift employee shall be paid for the two (2) normal off days worked in the first week of the new work schedule on the same basis as if the employee had been called to work on the employee’s normal days off.
Section 6.
In all operations where assigned schedules include Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, such schedules shall, wherever feasible, be rotated in such manner as to equalize Saturday, Sunday and holiday work among the employees involved.
Section 7.
A shift or "day-off" exchange within the same workweek by mutual agreement between employees in the same job classification will be permitted when: (1) it does not require the payment of overtime or change in rate of pay; and (2) in the judgment of the supervisor, he has received sufficient notice and it will not hinder the work or unduly inconvenience fellow employees.
Such revised schedule, if approved, will become the employee's effective schedule for purpose of determining the employee's first and second scheduled days off.
It is understood that the provisions of Article VII, Section 9 and Article VIII, Section 3(c) and the exception referred to in Article VII, Section 1 of this agreement will not apply when a shift or "off-day" exchange results in an employee meeting the conditions described therein.
Overtime
Section 8.
(a)	The Union for and on behalf of itself, its officers, and its members, for whom it is the collective bargaining agent, agrees that such employees will work overtime when requested by the Company and will respond promptly when called out for special or emergency work.
A callout occurs when an employee, while off duty, is requested to respond promptly for special or emergency work before the beginning of his/her next regularly scheduled shift, but shall not include any time while an employee is on Company premises and is waiting for the beginning of his next regular shift.
Planned or pre-scheduled overtime is time worked outside of an employee’s regularly scheduled working hours so long as at least twelve (12) hours notice is provided to the employee in advance of such planned or pre-scheduled overtime.
Any employee who is "called out" to work, in accordance with this Article VII, Section 8(a) shall come under the provisions of Article VIII, Section 3(c). If an employee qualifies for earned rest under one of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, Section 3(c) and is not released from work at his regularly scheduled starting time on his regularly scheduled shift, he/she shall be paid 2 times the regular straight time rate for all hours worked until he/she is released from work. Holiday premiums shall be in lieu of callout pay as applicable.
When employees are released from work and permitted to take time-off under the conditions set forth in Article VIII, Section 3(c), they will receive straight time pay for all regularly scheduled hours on their regularly scheduled shift while on rest, if applicable. When the rest period is exhausted the employee may be required to return to work, and this will not be considered a callout.
(b)	Overtime work shall be equitably distributed by the Company among qualified employees who are reporting at the location, insofar as it is practicable to do so. The method of distribution based on either the number of hours worked or the number of overtime assignments or a combination of the two will be worked out in each department, section or location, between the Union and the Company. Records of such overtime will be kept by the Company and posted at regular intervals at the respective regular fixed reporting points. The record posted shall be considered as correct unless a question regarding the credits as posted on his/her overtime roster is raised by an affected employee with his supervisor within forty-eight (48) hours of its posting. If the affected employee is absent from work during any portion of the forty-eight (48) hours, he/she may question the overtime record as posted within 48 hours of his/her return to work.
(c)	Overtime work will be given equitably to employees or crews working in the location or work area in which the work is required. The Company will not be required to call out employees when others are already on duty or to break up normal crew groupings.
(d)	Employees shall not be required to take time off without pay during scheduled working hours for overtime worked or to be worked. Nothing in this Section shall require the calling of any employee for a job for which he is not qualified nor the taking of an employee off a job
which he is doing and which requires overtime work of a few hours' duration in order to give said overtime work to another employee; provided further, that any employee who refuses to work overtime will be charged for such overtime for the purpose of maintaining a proper sequence or rotation on the Overtime Agreement List. Distribution of overtime in accordance with the Overtime Agreement List will constitute equitable distribution of such overtime work.
(e)	As determined by the Company, an "on call crew" of two (2) or more qualified employees may be established in each department and/or section. Employees assigned to the "on call crew" shall rotate on a weekly basis and such weekly rotation shall be considered as equitable distribution of overtime, unless the Company and the Union agree otherwise. Employees on such "on call crew" shall be provided pagers and shall have the right to trade with other qualified employees. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to arrange such trade, transfer the pager, and notify the appropriate supervisor when such a trade is made.
(f)	Where an error is made by supervision in the administration of the Overtime Agreement List, or callout system used in lieu thereof, and an employee is thereby denied a callout, the Company will pay that employee the premium in excess of his regular straight-time rate for the number of hours he would have worked had the error not been made.
Section 9.
When an employee has completed 16 hours of work out of the previous twenty-four (24)-hour period without at least eight (8) continuous hours of rest, and he is required to continue working, he will be paid at the rate of double time for all time worked beyond sixteen (16) hours.
Section 10.
An employee shall not be required to take time off during his scheduled working hours for overtime worked or to be worked unless, in emergencies, he is required to work overtime to such an extent as to be unable to obtain sufficient rest before the start of his next regular working period. In such instances, the employee involved will take such time off duty without pay as may be mutually agreed upon between him and his supervisor before returning to his regular schedule. In no instance after he has completed an overtime assignment shall an employee who requests it be denied at least eight (8) hours of rest. If, after discussion of the requirements of the job and the physical condition of the employee, the parties are unable to agree, the decision of the supervisor shall control at the time, but shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
See Article VIII, Section 3(c) for provisions for excused absence with pay after sixteen hours of work in any twenty-four (24)-hour period or excused absence with pay after five (5) hours or more of work in the ten (10)-hour period immediately preceding an employee's next regularly scheduled working time.
Section 11.
When an employee is called out to perform emergency work, he shall be compensated for such emergency work at the appropriate overtime rates and shall be paid from the time he or she arrives at the reporting location for such callout, but in no event shall he be paid for less than three (3) hours at such overtime rate. Where the period of the callout (or the minimum three (3) hours) extends beyond midnight he/she shall be paid for the time prior to midnight at the overtime rate appropriate for the day ending at midnight, and for the time following midnight at the overtime rate appropriate for the day commencing at midnight. When any part of such emergency callout time overlaps the normal starting time of his regular workday or shift, the overtime compensation for callout shall be in lieu of the straight-time rate for such normal working time up to the minimum of three (3) hours. When overtime is paid for normal working hours due to overlapping of time as above, such overtime shall not affect the payment of overtime after the expiration of the normal workday.
Zones and Per Diems
Section 12.
For the purpose of establishing uniformity in fixing reporting points and in determining traveling time and expense chargeable to the Company, the following standard zone and general provisions are hereby established for all departments, except those employees having a fixed reporting point at the Eastlake, Lakeshore or Ashtabula Power Plants and the Perry Nuclear Power Plant and supersede all existing zones and practices:
(a)	The zone limit shall be the middle of the following streets: Starting at Lake Erie, south on-Bratenahl Road to E. 105th Street - south on E. 105th Street to St. Clair Avenue - northeast on St Clair Avenue to Lakeview Road - south on Lakeview Road to Euclid Avenue - southwest on Euclid Avenue to Stokes Boulevard - south on Stokes Boulevard to Baldwin Road - southwest on Baldwin Road to Woodhill Road - south on Woodhill Road to E. 93rd Street - south on E. 93rd Street to Miles Avenue - west on Miles Avenue to Broadway Avenue - northwest on Broadway Avenue to Harvard Avenue - west on Harvard Avenue to the Harvard-Denison Bridge - west on Harvard-Denison Bridge to Denison Avenue — west on Denison Avenue to Lorain Avenue - west on Lorain Avenue to West 117th Street - north on W. 117th Street to Lake Erie.
The foregoing zone limits and all territory within them plus Brooklyn and Miles Warehouses and Yards are hereinafter called the "Zone".
(b)	A reporting point may be either a regular headquarters, a job at a designated place, or a designated meeting place. Reporting points shall be within the Zone for all employees except those assigned to a regular fixed reporting point or route outside the Zone.
(c)	For work outside of a Zone or a location, but within the Company’s geographic territory, the Company may elect to establish storerooms and/or reporting places on the job. On such specific construction or maintenance projects, the Company shall pay to each employee so
reporting a transportation allowance of the current IRS mileage rate to a maximum of one-hundred dollars ($100.00) per day. Said mileage will be the distance from the employee’s permanent reporting place to the temporary assigned reporting place. When a temporary reporting place is established, the employee will be required to travel to such temporary reporting place on his or her own time. Any employee who is so reporting at such storeroom and/or reporting place and is exceeding the maximum mileage allowance, shall receive, in lieu of the above transportation allowance and in lieu of lodging and meals, fifty dollars ($50.00) per day plus mileage to and from the storeroom and/or reporting place once each week, up to a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per week. In all cases it shall be the employee’s obligation to pay such costs and apply to the Company for reimbursement. The appropriate reimbursement will be included in the employee’s paycheck as soon as practicable following application for reimbursement. Employees assigned to an established storeroom and/or reporting place may apply in advance for anticipated mileage and per diem reimbursement. For purposes of the foregoing, a Location is defined as the Eastlake Plant, Perry Nuclear Plant; Ashtabula Plant and the Lakeshore Plant.
Should the opportunity for work outside the Company’s geographic territory arise, the Company and the Union agree to discuss the terms and conditions under which such assignments may be filled. When an employee regularly stationed at one location is temporarily assigned to duties at another location, outside of the Illuminating Company’s geographic area, which assignment makes it necessary for him to remain away from home overnight, and to purchase meals, lodging, transportation, etc., such necessary expense will be paid by the Company upon approval of his immediate supervisor. Each employee so affected shall also, except in emergencies, be notified of such assignment before being released from work on the previous day.
(d)	For any transmission line construction and transmission line maintenance work performed by the Transmission Services, outside of the Illuminating Company's jurisdictional boundaries, the Company may elect to establish storerooms and/or reporting places on the job for specifically defined jobs or projects.
When the Company establishes a temporary reporting place pursuant to the above paragraph, the Company shall pay to each employee who drives their personal vehicle so reporting a mileage/transportation allowance at the IRS rate and any highway tolls. Said mileage will be the distance from the employee’s permanent reporting place to the temporary assigned reporting place. When a temporary reporting place is established, the employee will be required to travel to such temporary reporting place on his or her own time. When the roundtrip mileage to such storeroom and/or reporting place exceeds one-hundred and seventy-five (175) miles, each employee shall receive the mileage allowance once each week and a daily allowance of eighty-five ($85.00) dollars for lodging and meals.
(e)	In a mutual assistance situation when an employee is sent to work in another electric utility’s service territory, other than any FirstEnergy Corp. utility, such employee shall be compensated for all hours worked, Monday through Sunday and Company recognized holidays at two (2) times the straight-time rate.
Personal Vehicles
Section 13.
Where the Company expressly authorizes an employee and the employee agrees, to use his private automobile in connection with the Company business after reporting for work, the IRS rate will be paid per mile for such use.
(a)	In situations where such use is for the purpose of protection of life or property or to maintain service other than in routine daily assignments, the employee will cooperate with the Company to the extent possible.
(b)	Meter Readers in the performance of their work assignments are encouraged to drive their personal vehicles. Company owned and currently assigned vehicles will be available for purchase, on terms determined by the Company, by Meter Readers for use in the performance of their work assignments. The Company, at its discretion, may change the terms of purchase. Once an employee chooses to drive their personal vehicles, the Company will no longer be obliged to provide a vehicle. Employees new to the meter reading, as a condition of employment, will be required to provide a personal vehicle. Business use mileage reimbursement for use of a personal vehicle will be paid at IRS rate.
(	c ) Employees hired prior to May 1, 2003, will not be required to provide a personal vehicle for Meter Reading purposes if surplussed by way of reduction in force or incapacitation.
(	d ) If the Company develops a new program that would address the driving of personal vehicles with an increased mileage allowance or the use of a Company provided vehicle, the Company will discuss this with the Union and provide the opportunity for the Union to participate in such plan.
Holidays
Section 14.
The Company observes the following holidays:
New Year’s Day
Good Friday
Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
The Day before Christmas
Christmas Day
The Day before New Year’s Day
Holidays which are fixed calendar dates and which fall on Sundays are observed on the Monday following except that when Monday is a holiday, the Sunday holiday will be observed on Sunday. Holidays, which fall on any other day, will be observed on that day. If an employee’s scheduled day off falls on a Company observed holiday, he will be given an additional day off with pay or at the discretion of the Company, a day’s pay in lieu thereof.
The additional day off if granted by the Company, will be the employee’s last scheduled workday preceding or his next scheduled workday following the Company observed holiday, or a date subsequent to the holiday if the employee makes a request and it is agreed to by the employee’s supervisor.
(a)	The Company’s operations require that certain work be performed every day of the year including holidays. Employees engaged in such work will be scheduled to work on holidays and for such work will be paid as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Except in cases of sick leave, jury duty, death in family, or rest provided after sixteen (16) hours worked in any twenty-four (24)-hour period, or excused absence with pay after five (5) hours or more of work in the ten (10)-hour period immediately preceding an employee’s next regularly scheduled working time, they will not be excused with pay if a replacement is required at additional overall cost. Other work is such that employees scheduled to work on a holiday may be excused and if excused will be paid as provided in paragraph (b) in this section.
(b)	If an employee is excused from working all or part of a holiday, he will be paid at his straight time rate for such an excused time.
For purposes of this section, an employee whose scheduled day off falls on a holiday, will be assumed to have the same schedule on the holiday as his last schedule proceeding the holiday. Such schedule will be his regular schedule unless he has been working on a temporary schedule for two or more days prior to the holiday, in which case his schedule for the holiday will be the temporary schedule.
For all hours actually worked on a Company observed holiday outside of his regular scheduled hours, an employee will be paid two times his straight time rate. For all scheduled hours actually worked on a Company observed holiday, whether previously excused or not, an employee will receive, in addition to the straight time hours, time and one-half his straight time rate.
If an employee’s scheduled day off falls on a Company observed holiday and he does not work, he will be paid for eight hours at his straight time hourly rate except when he receives an additional day off as provided in subsection (a) above. The minimum holiday guarantee referred to in this subsection will be granted in lieu of call-out or prescheduled minimum time guarantee.
(c)	If an employee’s schedule includes a shift which starts on an observed holiday and continues past midnight into the following day ( a so called “straddle shift”) the provisions of subsection (b) above will apply to all of that shift but will not apply to any portion of a shift that starts on the previous day and ends on a holiday. A scheduled day off for such an employee shall be any day when he is not scheduled to start a shift.
(d)	If an employee is on leave of absence or is otherwise absent without pay during any period which includes the schedule shifts immediately before and after observed holiday, unless such absence is a result of an employee being properly excused for Union business, he will not be paid for scheduled time not worked on the holidays. An employee having an unexcused absence from his scheduled shift immediately preceding or following an observed holiday will not be paid for scheduled time not worked on the holiday.

Effective May 1, 2009 the Company will pay (except as provided in subparagraph (c) below) fourteen dollars and fifty cents ($14.50) for each meal allowance to which an employee is entitled. Meal allowances shall be determined as follows:
(a)	When an employee is called out he will be entitled to meal allowances during the period of consecutive hours of reporting time thereafter (including scheduled time, if any) with the first allowance at 6:00 a.m., Noon, 6:00 p.m., or Midnight and additional allowances at each five (5) consecutive hour interval of reported time thereafter.
(b)	In all cases other than a callout, the employee will be entitled to one meal allowance for two or more overtime hours worked beyond their scheduled hours worked and additional allowances at each five (5) consecutive hour interval of reported time thereafter. For eight (8)-hour schedules, the first meal allowance will be at the 10th hour worked. For ten (10)-hour schedules, the first meal allowance will be at the 11th hour worked. For twelve (12)-hour schedules the first meal allowance will be at the 13th hour worked.
(c)	Notwithstanding subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, when an employee is informed in advance, but not later than leaving work on the last preceding workday, that he will be working extended hours on the following scheduled workday or days or he will be working on his scheduled day off, the first meal allowance will be five dollars and fifty cents ($5.50).

ARTICLE VIII
Full-Time Employment-Excused Absences with Pay
The Company agrees to make its practices uniform with respect to full-time employment and excused absences with pay and in connection therewith will pay all employees covered by this agreement on an hourly basis.
Section 1.
The Company agrees that all employees covered by this agreement, other than part-time employees, will be furnished full-time employment of forty (40) hours per week, except as modified by a twelve (12)-hour schedule pursuant to Article VII, Section 1 and Appendix B-5, which when combining the thirty-six (36) hour week and the forty-eight (48) hour week schedule, will be considered to have met this provision, provided they report for work and are in condition to perform their work. This is not to preclude layoffs upon proper notice as provided in Article VI, hereof.
Section 2.
The Company shall provide indoor work for regular outside employees during inclement weather. In no event shall such employees lose time because of inclement weather. Emergency work, however, shall be performed regardless of weather conditions. The application of this inclement weather clause shall be in agreement with the Local Union committee.
The parties agree that productive outdoor work can safely be performed during periods of rain or snow and that the Company representatives will exercise good judgment and reasonableness in considering the nature of the work to be performed. Decisions as to what work can be done safely must be made on a case-by-case basis under the following parameters.
a)	After leaving the reporting location during rain or snow, there will be no work performed on conductors, energized over 600 volts, except to complete customer service hook-ups.
b)	During rain or snow, crews will proceed to job site and perform that work, which can be done safely, based upon the prevailing conditions at the job site. The Company
will exercise good judgment and reasonableness in determining whether to direct crews to proceed to the job site in such conditions.
c)	Any disputes that occur at the job site as to what work can safely be performed during rain or snow shall be resolved as follows:
1)	If the crew leader, after arriving at the job site, is uncertain regarding the ability to perform the job safely, he or she may request a review of the job by the Foreman.
2)	If the assignment is unresolved, the next step is to involve the Line Supervisor, or in his or her absence, the appropriate District Supervisor or Area Foreman.
3)	If agreement still cannot be reached, the crew will be assigned, either to additional tasks at the current job site or work at another location. All such disputes will also be forwarded to the Union Management Safety Committee for discussion.
4)	Misuse of the appeal process will be just cause to call the Company and Union Negotiating Committee together to resolve such misuse.
Section 3.
In addition to excused absences, with pay, for holidays, sick leave and vacations provided for elsewhere herein, the Company agrees to permit excused absences with pay as follows:
a)	An employee serving on jury duty or subpoenaed to appear locally (within the Company’s service territory) as a witness, or in deposition, in court, or any other body empowered by law to compel attendance of witnesses by subpoena, will be excused with pay, at the regular straight time rate for time lost during his/her regularly scheduled basic workweek while in attendance for such service. The employee so serving as a juror or appearing as a witness will spend as much time on his/her regular job as he/she possibly can. If the employee is excused from jury service or witness appearance the employee is to report to work for the balance of the workday. If an employee is a party litigant, whether Plaintiff or Defendant, he/she will not be entitled to any pay for time away from work (This does not exclude an Employee’s access to vacation time or paid absence days). No deduction will be made from his pay for any pay received by him from the Government for such service, but the Company will require him to show his pay voucher in order to establish the period of such excused absences.
b)	Death in the family.
1)	In the event of the death of a father, mother, a person who has acted in the place and stead of a father or mother in rearing the employee from childhood, member of the employee's immediate family living in his/her home, legal guardian, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother, sister, wife, husband, or child of an employee, time off from regularly scheduled hours to attend the funeral will be granted with pay up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours during the period starting on the day of the death up to and including the day following the funeral. One (1) day with pay will be granted for religious or similar observance held in lieu of a funeral.
2)	One (1) day off within the basic workweek will be given with pay to attend the funeral of a stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, half sister, stepchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandmother, grandfather, grandson and granddaughter.
3)	In the event a relative listed under part (2) of this subsection was living with the employee at the time of death, part (1) of this subsection will apply.
(c)	An employee, who, upon being released meets one of the following sets of
conditions, will be entitled to time regularly scheduled duty.
Conditions
1.	If he has worked 16 or more hours in the preceding 24-hour period without time off of at least eight continuous hours.
2.	If he has worked less than
16 hours out of the preceding 24-hour period and is called out and works five or more hours
in the 10-hour period immediately preceding his next regularly scheduled working time.
3.	If he has worked less than
16 hours out of the preceding 24-hour period and works five or more hours on a prescheduled overtime assignment not continuous with his regularly scheduled hours in the ten-hour period immediately preceding his next regularly
off as indicated below before reporting for
Time Off
Eight (8) continuous hours from the time of his release.
Five (5) continuous hours from the time of his release.
Five (5) continuous hours from the time of his release.
scheduled working time.
Should he be scheduled to work within the hours of rest provided above, he will be excused with pay, at straight time for any part of his regularly scheduled hours which is within his scheduled hours at the Company’s request, he will be paid double time in lieu of straight time for hours worked.
(d)	No excused absence with pay will be considered an interruption of continuity of service.
ARTICLE IX
Wages
Section 1.
The wages set forth in the tables attached hereto and designated “Appendix A-1, A-2, A3”, which shall become effective May 1, 2006, and shall continue in effect thereafter from year to year.
Employee wages will be determined in accordance with the plan of wage administration, the wage schedule in effect, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Section 2.
The schedule of job classifications hereinafter set forth indicate the code numbers, labor grades and minimum starting steps for each occupational group. The hourly wage schedules hereinafter set forth indicate the progression steps within the wage ranges for each labor grade. Employees currently receiving a rate higher than those set forth will not be reduced, as long as they remain in their current classifications.
When an employee is promoted, or is upgraded to higher rated work, he will receive the starting rate for the new job, except where he is already receiving a rate equal to or in excess of said starting rate. In such event, he will receive an increase sufficient to bring him to the progression step in the new job next above his old rate, but not higher than the maximum rate for the new job. As an exception to the above, if any employee has worked at the maximum rate for his classification for a period in excess of two (2) years, when promoted or upgraded to a new
job in the same line of promotion he shall receive an extra pay step in the new job, if this additional step is not higher than the maximum rate for the new job. In cases of temporary assignment to higher rated work, the employee will revert to his old rate upon conclusion of such assignment. When an employee is transferred to a job in a different line of promotion, the Company will consider previous experience and qualifications in determining the appropriate step in the new job at which the employee will be placed.
Progression to the next progression step between minimum and maximum, inclusive, will be considered each six (6) months (or in the case of upgrading for each one thousand and forty (1040) hours of such assignment). If a review by his supervisors, which shall be made prior to the expiration of each such six (6) months interval (or in the case of upgrading for each one thousand and forty (1040) hours of such assignment), indicates that the employee's development, measured by demonstrated performance and ability, has been satisfactory, an increase to the next progression step will be made, effective on the day following the expiration of the particular six (6) months interval (or in the case of upgrading on the hour following the expiration of one thousand and forty (1040) hours of such assignment); and this procedure shall be continued until the employee's rate is the maximum rate for his job.
The setting forth of jobs in the schedule of job classifications shall not be construed as a requirement on the part of the Company to fill such jobs, or to establish and maintain quotas of personnel in such jobs.
Members of Local 270 will be eligible to participate in the FirstEnergy Corp. Employee Incentive Compensation Plan in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan document.
Note: The Hourly Wage Schedules designated as "Appendix A-1", "Appendix A-2 and Appendix A-3" indicate step rates from minimum to maximum for each job classification. However, those employees receiving rates higher than established rates for their jobs, except those incapacitated employees covered in Section 4.b. shall receive no increase, but no employee shall receive less than the appropriate rate for his job classification.
Section 3.
In the interest of obtaining improved service, better operations, or lower costs, the Management may make changes in equipment, operations, the organization of work, or the qualifications for any job, and it is understood that this is a proper function of the Management.
When any such change requires revision of the job specifications and/or promotional charts, the Company will furnish to the Union copies of such revised specifications and/or charts at least 45 days prior to putting the change in effect and will discuss them with the Union, if so requested.
The wage rate ranges for any newly created job classifications, or for existing job classifications with revised job specifications resulting from any such change, and the seniority of any employees who may be affected by such revisions, will be negotiated by the Union and the Company. Wage rates will be considered to be specific to each business unit (FENOC, FEGCO,
FirstEnergy Service Company, and Energy Delivery). The new or revised job may be placed in effect 45 days after notice is given, as provided above, and any wage rate determined for any new or revised job shall apply retroactively to the date the new or revised job was put into effect.
If the Union and the Company are unable to resolve the seniority of employees directly affected by such revisions within the forty-five (45) day discussion period, the Union will submit its determination of the seniority for promotion, demotion, layoff or transfer purposes, of each such employees within ten (10) days thereafter in writing to the Company, and such seniority shall become effective when received by the Company. The seniority so fixed shall be consistent with seniority as defined in Article VI, and if the Company believes it has not been so established, the question maybe determined under the grievance procedure. Promotions, demotions, and layoffs or transfers in accordance with such seniority will not be the basis for a grievance against the Company. If the Union does not submit its determination of seniority, then the seniority as established by the Company will become and remain in effect.
It is the understanding of the parties that this provision will not be applied in bad faith or in an arbitrary manner that would adversely affect any of the Company employees who are members of the Union; nor will it be used by the Company to rewrite job specifications as a means of settling grievances, and that if the Union believes that it has been so applied or so used the question may be determined under the grievance procedure.
Section 4.
An employee assigned temporarily to work carrying a lower rate of pay shall have no reduction in his classification or rate of pay during such temporary assignment. An employee assigned temporarily and for one hour or more in any one day to work of higher classification shall be paid the appropriate rate for such higher classification during such temporary assignment.
Higher classification work in the bargaining unit will be offered to the senior qualified employee(s) who normally works at the location or work area and is immediately available at the time the need for such assignment arises. If, however, such senior employee(s) declines such work, then the junior qualified employee(s) who is immediately available at the time the need for such assignment arises will be assigned to perform the work. Higher classification assignments in the bargaining unit will be used primarily for the replacement of employees absent for reasons covered by this agreement.
This section will not (1) require the Company to call out an employee or (2) be permitted to interfere with an employee training program or the equitable distribution of overtime work.
ARTICLE X
Benefits
Section 1.	Sickness and Injury Benefits.
Benefits shall be available to all full-time regular employees in the bargaining unit who are absent from work because of illness or injury in accordance with the following terms and conditions.
a.	Non-industrial illness or injury. An employee who is absent from work due to illness or injury (excluding any injury for which he receives Workers' Compensation from the Company under the laws of the State of Ohio and excluding any injury suffered by an employee while in the course of gainful employment for some employer other than the Company) shall be paid his normal straight time rate, less appropriate deductions for taxes, for all regularly scheduled hours during such period or periods of absence but not in excess of the regularly scheduled hours contained in the maximum number of working days for any one payroll year as provided by the following table:
ACCUMULATED FULL YEARS OF SERVICE AT END OF PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR	SICK	PAY	IN FOLLOWING PAYROLL YEAR

15 years or more, and less than 20 years	145	115
20 years or more	160	100
If an employee’s absence due to illness or injury extends into the next payroll year then: a) the employee will continue to receive sick pay based upon his or her entitlement from the previous payroll year; that is, the number of sick days remaining in the next payroll year will be equal to the employee’s sick pay entitlement from the previous payroll year less the number of sick days paid to the employee in the previous payroll year; b) if an employee returns to work for less than one hundred sixty (160) consecutive work hours, and is again absent from work for illness or injury, the employee will continue with the remaining sick pay entitlement from the previous payroll year; or c) if the employee returns to work for one hundred sixty (160) consecutive work hours or more, then they will re-establish their sick pay schedule entitlement for that payroll year.
At no time will an employee be entitled to more sick days, for any one-payroll year, than provided for in the table above.
Benefits payable to employees under this section will be reduced by the full amount of primary Social Security benefits that the individual is entitled to receive.
An employee who is confined as an in-patient in the hospital on the first day of absence will be paid benefits beginning the first day of such absence.
Before sick benefits are paid under this paragraph, an employee shall have the number of “wait days” as specified in the chart below:
WAITING DAYS BASED ON ABSENCES IN PREVIOUS PAYROLL YEAR

20 years or more	2	1	1	0	0	0	0
"Payroll year" means the dates established from time to time by the Company. Once established, the Company shall so notify the Union as soon as practicable.
b.	Industrial Injury. An employee absent from work due to an injury received in the course of, and arising out of, his or her employment with the Company and for which injury the employee is receiving or will receive weekly benefits (with the possible exception of the first week after the injury is received) under the Workers' Compensation law of the State of Ohio, shall be paid one-half (1/2) the difference between the amount received or to be received under the Workers' Compensation law of Ohio and his current regular straight time pay, less appropriate deductions for taxes, for not more than fifty-two (52) weeks of such absence or absences. This entitlement shall apply during the period commencing on the date of injury and lasting until the end of the payroll year in which such injury occurred.
Should such absence due to industrial illness or injury continue into the next payroll year, the employee will be entitled to be paid one-half (1/2) the difference between the amount received or to be received under the Workers’ Compensation law of Ohio and his current regular straight time pay, less appropriate deductions for taxes, until he returns to work or the end of such payroll year, whichever occurs first. Should such absence continue into the next payroll year, the employee shall be paid one-quarter (1/4) the difference between such Workers' Compensation and the employee's regular straight time pay, less appropriate deductions for taxes, until he returns to work or the end of such payroll year, whichever occurs first. Should the employee continue to be absent thereafter he shall not be entitled to further benefits under this Section until he has returned to his regular job for thirty (30) consecutive calendar days. Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to limit the Company’s right to terminate an employee who has reached maximum medical improvement and is not able to return to his regular job.
Benefits will not be paid hereunder for the first full day of the first absence due to an injury unless an employee is admitted to a hospital or ordered by his doctor not to work on such day. The employee shall furnish written confirmation of his doctor's order, which shall include the diagnosis, prognosis and work restrictions or limitations and the Company may require the
employee to be examined by its doctor to determine the validity of the employee's absence, which determination shall be conclusive.
c.	Benefits under a. and b. above shall be independent of each other and neither one of the two shall be charged against the allowance of the other.
d.	To become eligible for sickness or injury benefits during the first year of employment or re-employment with the Company an employee shall have completed six (6) months of continuous employment.
e.	"Accumulated service" shall include all time during which the employee was on the Company's payrolls, including time spent in the Military Service of the United States of America and authorized leaves of absence. In case of layoff the employee, upon recall, shall, if recalled within twenty-four (24) months from the date of his layoff, be deemed to have accumulated service during the layoff period. Except by reasons of Military Service or authorized leave of absence, any employee who terminates or has previously terminated his employment with the Company of his own volition or who is discharged for good and sufficient reasons or has previously been discharged for good and sufficient reasons, shall, for sickness or injury benefits, lose credit for all employment prior to such termination of employment or discharge.
f.	No benefits hereunder shall accumulate from one (1) service year to another.
g.	An employee will not receive any general wage increase or upgrade rate of pay while
absent because of sickness or injury.
h.	Benefits will not be paid unless the cause of absence is reported to the Company before the end of the first scheduled working day of such absence (except where physically impossible to do so) and no employee shall be entitled to any benefits until he has presented reasonable evidence of his inability to work due to sickness or injury, which evidence shall include the diagnosis, prognosis and work restrictions or limitations.
i.	Benefits will not be paid unless the employee adopts such remedial measures as may be commensurate with his or her condition and permits such reasonable examinations and inquiries by the Company's representative, at the Company’s expense, as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary to ascertain the employee's condition. If the employee is not satisfied with the conclusions thereof, he may, at his own expense, submit a report obtained from a doctor of his own choosing for consideration by the Company. Should any conflict result between the examination reports of the doctors involved, the two doctors shall, by agreement, select a third doctor who will consider the case submitted to him and render a decision within (1) week from the date he receives the case and his decision will be binding. The cost of the third doctor shall be borne by the employee. The provision of a third doctor shall have no application to Workers’ Compensation cases.
j.	Benefits will not be paid for any sickness or injury attributable to the use of drugs, intoxication, willful conduct, or for any injury sustained by an employee in commission of a crime or violation of law.
k.	All privileges and benefits available under this Section may at any time be withdrawn by the Company in any case where they have been abused. The foregoing shall be in addition to any other discipline, including termination that may be imposed as a result of such abuse.
l.	A full-time employee who is performing full duty work as of January 1, 2004 will be covered by the Long Term Disability Plan (LTD) as provided by the Company. A pre-existing exclusion will exist, however, for those employees not actively at work due to illness, injury or not working at a full duty status. In such cases, employees must work thirty (30) consecutive calendar days at full duty in order to be covered by the LTD Plan as provided by the Company for any new illness or injury. Employees unable to return to such full duty status, however, will continue to be covered by the disability benefit as it exists in the current Pension Plan. Such plan, however, will no longer be available to those who qualify for the Company provided LTD. The Company has agreed to waive the 3/12 pre-existing condition rule for all employees actively at work on January 1, 2004.
The LTD Plan is intended to work in conjunction with the existing Short Term Disability or Sick Pay Plan as described in Article X, Section 1 as follows:
1)	A full time employee who is absent from work for twelve (12) months as described in Sections 1(a) and 1(b), may apply for long term disability benefits. For those who qualify for benefits under the new Plan, group health and group life benefits will be extended in accordance with Article X, Section 3 and pension disability benefits may be extended in accordance with the provisions as described in Article X, Section 2.
2)	For the first twelve (12) months of long term disability, an employee retains the right to be re-employed to their previous job if in the opinion of the Company physician the employee has recovered sufficiently to perform the duties of their job, or any other bargaining unit job in accordance with Article VI, Section 8, Incapacitated Employees. If at the end of the first twelve (12) months of long term disability, the employee has not recovered sufficiently to be reinstated to their previous job or to be placed in another open bargaining unit job in accordance with Article VI, Section 8, then their seniority shall be terminated.
Section 2.	Pensions
Effective June 1, 2006 it is agreed that the Company has in effect a retirement plan as part of the FirstEnergy Pension Plan (hereinafter referred to as "Pension Plan"), and that the provisions of the Centerior Pension Plan applicable to employees who are members of Local 270, U.W.U.A., shall be incorporated into the Pension Plan.
The Pension Plan shall not, prior to December 31st, 2011 be subject to any amendment, which would change benefits applicable at the time of such amendment to any employee of the Company represented by the Union, except that the Pension Plan shall be amended for item (i) effective June 1, 2006 and for item (ii) and (iii) effective January 1, 2007 as follows:
i.	The Special Early Retirement benefit (referred to as “58/35”) set forth in Article
3 C.5 of the Pension Plan (which shall also include the “temporary benefit” defined in Article 3 C.5 (b) of the Pension plan) shall be extended to eligible employees who retired prior to January 1, 2012.
ii.	The Pension Plan shall be amended for employees represented by the Union who are hired on or after January 1, 2007. Those employees shall participate in the FirstEnergy Pension Plan as applicable on January 1, 2007 in accordance with the terms of the Plan Document.
iii.	Article 5 C of the Pension Plan has been deleted and replaced with a disability monthly pension benefit of four hundred dollars ($400) for all eligible employees with at least ten (10) years of credited service who become eligible for the benefits under provisions of the Company’s LTD plan. The Pension Plan shall further be amended to reflect that an eligible employee who is not awarded benefits under the provisions of the Company’s LTD plan, may still qualify for the disability monthly pension benefit of four hundred dollars ($400) if they are determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Company.
No employee hired after May 1, 2003 shall be eligible to vest or accrue in any benefit set forth in Article 3 C.5 of the Pension Plan.
No employee hired after May 1, 2003 shall be eligible to vest for the Commuted Benefit Option (referred to as the “lump sum benefit”) as defined in Article 6 C.1 of the Pension Plan.
The continuance of the Pension Plan as so amended is contingent upon the continued allowability in full to the Company as deductions for Corporation Federal Income Tax Purposes of the costs of the Plan and the continued tax-exempt status of the income of the Trust Fund and such Plan shall, within the limitations set forth above, be subject to any changes necessary or desirable to make such costs of the Plan eligible for tax deduction or to make the income of the Trust Fund exempt from taxation or to bring the Plan into conformity or compliance with applicable governmental regulations; nor shall the Plan as so amended be subject to demand for change or addition to or negotiation by the Union until sixty (60) days preceding May 1, 2011.
This Section shall survive any expiration of this Agreement.
Section 3.	Flexible Benefits Plan
a.	The Company will maintain a Flexible Benefits Plan to provide for Health Care, Dental Care, Vision Care, Group Life Insurance, Dependent Life Insurance, Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance, Long Term Disability and Flexible Spending Accounts, which is outlined in the FirstEnergy Benefits Handbook. Except as otherwise specified in this Section, participation in the Flexible Benefits Plan will be in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of the applicable plan as stated in said Benefits Handbook, as amended by the Company from time to time. Employees will have the option annually to enroll or re-enroll into various options subject to certain provisions contained herein. New employees will be able to participate in the Flexible Benefits Plan effective the first of the month following their date of employment.
b.	Effective January 1, 2006, and thereafter, the terms and conditions of the FirstEnergy Healthcare Plan option, as well as the remaining options under the Health Care Plan applicable to eligible employees shall be as established by the Company and on the same terms and conditions as are applicable from time to time for certain FirstEnergy bargaining and all nonbargaining unit employees.
The Union, on behalf of its entire membership, shall have the option to withdraw from or reenter the Health Care Plan portion of the Flexible Benefits Plan on January 1, 2007 and every January 1 thereafter while this Agreement is in effect. Notice must be given to the Company by August 1st (“notice date”) prior to the year the withdrawal or reentry is to be effective. The Company will contribute and forward payment to the Union for each employee an amount equal to the contribution it would normally make for each employee under the Company’s Health Care Plan provided the employee is enrolled in a comparable health care plan sponsored by the Union. This contribution must be utilized by the Union to purchase health care for the employee. The Union must provide documentation regarding the reason for any coverage status change that occurs after the notice date. The Company will adjust its contribution only if the coverage status change is a recognized qualifying event under the terms of the Flexible Benefits Plan. Employees must notify the Union and the Company of the occurrence of a qualifying event.
An employee electing to participate in the dental plan shall pay 100% of the cost of such plan.
Effective January 1, 2006, and thereafter, each employee’s monthly contribution to the FirstEnergy Health Care Plan shall not be greater than the monthly contribution required by the Company from time to time of its certain FirstEnergy bargaining and all non-bargaining unit employees.
Effective May 01, 2006, the Company's contribution for health coverage for an employee who retires on or after May 01, 2006 shall be based on such retiree's age and service at the time of retirement, the eligibility of the retiree and his eligible spouse for Medicare and the cost of the Health Care Coverage according to the following tables:
NO RETIREE OR SPOUSE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE
	Company Contribution ($) by Coverage

Effective May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2011 the Company’s health coverage for an employee who retires during the term of this agreement shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the health plan in effect for a regular full time represented employee.
The Company’s contribution for health coverage for an employee who retires prior to January 1, 1999 shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the health plan in effect for such employee at the time of retirement.
It is specifically recognized that post-retirement health care benefits as well as other post-retirement benefits, excluding pension, provided hereunder are not vested and may be amended or terminated by the Company at any time.
With respect to Group Life Insurance, the Company will provide a Surviving Spouse Benefit, under the same terms and conditions that were in effect prior to May 27, 1998, for employees represented by Local 270.
Section 4.	Savings Plan.
Employees who are members of Local 270, U.W.U.A. will be eligible to participate in the FirstEnergy System Savings Plan in accordance with the terms of the Plan document, as may be amended from time to time by the Company.
Section 5.	Other Benefits.
The Company, from time to time, provides all employees with additional benefits outside of the Flexible Benefits Plan, the Savings Plan or the Pension Plan. These benefits currently include an Employee Assistance Program, Business Travel Accident Insurance, Education Assistance, Financial Planning, Catastrophic Assistance & Relief for Employees (C.A.R.E.), Military Service Leave of Absence (MLOA) and Long-Term Care. To the extent that such benefits are available to other employees of the Company during the term of this Agreement, the Company agrees that for the term of this Agreement, any such benefits will be extended to members of Local 270, U.W.U.A. on the same basis. Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed to prohibit the Company from amending the terms or eliminating such benefits during the term of this Agreement.
Section 6.	Paid Absence Day.
Beginning January 1, 1999, to each full-time regular employee on the payroll January 1, of each year, the Company will grant three (3) Paid Absence Days (24 work hours) per calendar year. Such a day may not be the workday preceding or following a holiday or vacation and may not be used as a substitute for wait days as described in Section 1 of this Article. Such days must be taken by December 15, (unless notification is given prior to December 1) of each year and may not be taken with less than one week's notice except by mutual consent of the employee and his supervisor. If such days are not used during the calendar year they shall be lost and no additional compensation shall be paid in lieu thereof. The Company may, but will not be required to, grant a Paid Absence Day on a workday preceding or following a holiday or vacation.
In the event the number of employees who apply for a specific day are more than can be accommodated, the number that can be accommodated will be granted the day off in order of their application for the Paid Absence Day.
Section 7.
It is agreed that there will be a Joint Workers’ Compensation Committee. The committee will be comprised of four (4) Union appointed representatives and appropriate Company representatives. The joint committee will meet no more than three (3) times each year. Such meetings shall be limited to issues pertaining to the Ohio Workers’ Compensation laws and the negotiated industrial injury benefits under this Agreement.
ARTICLE XI
Vacation With Pay
Section 1.
Annual vacations with pay will be earned as follows:
a.	The amount of vacation with pay in any calendar year shall be determined by the length of continuous service with the Company as of January 1 of each year.
b.	An employee who on any January 1 has had continuous service with the Company of twenty-four (24) or more years shall receive a vacation entitlement of two hundred (200) hours for that calendar year.
c.	An employee who on any January 1 has had continuous service with the Company of fourteen (14) or more years but less than that specified in subsection b. above shall receive a vacation entitlement of one hundred sixty (160) hours for that calendar year.
d.	An employee who on any January 1 has had continuous service with the Company of five (5) or more years but less than that specified in subsection c. above shall receive a vacation entitlement of one hundred twenty (120) hours for that calendar year.
e.	An employee who on any January 1 has had continuous service with the Company of one (1) or more years but less than that specified in subsection d. above shall receive a vacation entitlement of eighty (80) hours for that calendar year.
f.	A new employee will earn forty (40) hours of vacation entitlement after six (6) months of continuous service with the Company and an additional forty (40) hours after twelve (12) months of continuous service.
g.	Effective January 1, 2007, employees will be eligible to participate in the
FirstEnergy Vacation Banking Program as set forth in the FirstEnergy Employee Compensation and Benefits Handbook, as may be amended from time to time. Currently the Vacation Banking Program provides that:
•	Employees use at least one half of their vacation entitlement per year.
•	Effective January 1, 2007, all banked vacation as of that date is frozen. No further vacation hours will be added to the frozen vacation bank. The maximum amount of banked vacation that may accumulate in the new account may not exceed 480 hours at any time. An employee using banked vacation will draw hours from the new vacation bank before using hours from the frozen bank. Hours taken from the frozen vacation bank may not be replenished.
If an employee retires, banked vacation may be taken as time off prior to retirement if mutually convenient to the employee and his/her supervisor, and/or may be paid as a lump sum.
Payment for banked vacation will be at the employee's pay rate at the time it is taken or paid. Banked time off is to be scheduled at a time mutually convenient to the employee and his supervisor.
h.	An employee who leaves the employment of the Company for any reason will receive vacation pay for any vacation he may be eligible for on January of the previous year if not already taken at the time of his exit. In addition, an employee who resigns with proper notice of forty hours of regularly scheduled working time after five years of continuous service with the Company, or who is laid off, or who is retired, will be paid a vacation allowance proportionate to the number of months worked in the calendar year under consideration.
i.	For the purpose of this section an employee’s continuous service is defined as the period of time during which he is continuously listed as an employee on the payroll records of the Company, including time lost on account of military service, accident, sickness and authorized leave of absence, Family and Medical Leave absence, and on account of layoff if reemployed within twenty-four (24) months of the date of layoff.
j.	An employee's vacation eligibility in any calendar year will be based upon his continuous service as defined in paragraph (i) of this Section, but will be reduced by one-twelfth of such amount for each month spent on leave of absence or other absence without pay during the previous calendar year. However, if a leave of absence during the previous calendar year for thirty days or more was granted for health reasons, and the employee furnished a doctor's certificate to that effect, no deduction will be made for the time spent on such leave.
k.	Upon request, an employee may take vacation in one whole day increments at the discretion of management. For employees in the Company’s fossil operations, the foregoing shall be limited to a maximum amount of five such single whole days, unless the employee is entitled to four (4) weeks of vacation in a calendar year. In which case, the employee may take ten (10) days of that vacation in single whole day increments at the discretion of management. An employee who has scheduled a full week’s vacation will be given preference over an employee who requests one whole day vacations regardless of seniority. Requests for these days must be made at least seven days prior to the date requested and must be approved by management. However, because of extenuating circumstances, a day of vacation time with less than seven days notice may be approved by the employee’s supervisor. The Company reserves the right to limit the number of employees who can be off on a specific day. The Company may, but cannot be required to, grant a one-day increment on a workday preceding or following a holiday or other vacation. The Company may fill the vacancy of partial vacations by upgrading. The employee will not be required for overtime during the twenty-four (24) hour period of his vacation day.
Section 2.
At an appropriate time each year the Company will obtain from employees entitled to vacations their preferences as to vacation periods and will, as soon thereafter as possible, establish workable vacation schedules. In establishing such schedules the Company will respect the wishes of employees as to the time of taking their vacations insofar as the needs of the service will permit. Conflicts among preferences shall be resolved in each department between the Company and the Union.
No department will require an employee to take his vacation outside of the ten-month period beginning March 1 and ending December 31. Any vacation in excess of four weeks, however, will be scheduled at the discretion of the Company and may be scheduled during the months of January and February.
Section 3.
Vacation periods generally will be taken in weeks and will start on Monday unless the employee’s immediate supervisor approves otherwise. Department managers may, insofar as needs of the service will permit, allow:
a)	The vacation weeks to be taken separately, and/or
b)	The vacation week or weeks to start on a day other than Monday.
c)	Single days of vacation on Saturdays and or Sundays preceding or following a full week vacation as provided for in Article XI, Section 1(k).
Section 4.
If a holiday for which an employee is entitled to straight time pay as provided in Article VII within his scheduled vacation period, he shall be given an additional day off with pay, on a day mutually agreeable to the employee and the Company, or at the discretion of the Company, a day’s pay in lieu thereof.
Section 5.
Upon the death of an employee, an allowance for all vacation not received will be added to the pay due him at the time of his death and disbursed therewith.
Section 6.
An employee who quits without having given advance notice of forty (40) hours of regularly scheduled working time or who is discharged for cause will receive no accrued vacation pay.
Section 7.
Should an employee be on sick leave at the time his vacation is scheduled to start he may be permitted to change the vacation then scheduled to a subsequent date which will not conflict with another employee’s vacation. Consideration of requests for such changes is contingent upon prompt notice and proof of illness to the employee’s immediate supervisor.
Should an employee have a death in the family which would entitle him to pay for time not worked under the provisions of Article VIII and notice is received by the Company prior to the start of any single week of scheduled vacation, such week of vacation will be rescheduled to a subsequent week which will not conflict with another employee’s vacation.
ARTICLE XII
Working Conditions
Section 1.

a)	The parties hereto agree to comply in all respects with the safety rules, regulations, and practices prescribed by the Company. At a minimum, the Company’s safety practices will be in compliance with OSHA regulations. Failure to abide by such safety rules, regulations and practices shall be grounds for discipline both by the Company and the Union.
b)	It is agreed that in the first bi-weekly paycheck following May 1 of each year, the Company will provide an allowance of $150.00 to each employee. This allowance will be in lieu of payment by the Company to an employee for personal protective equipment such as safety shoes and prescription safety glasses, license renewals and any government-mandated physical examinations. The Company shall continue to provide, at its cost, hard hats, rubber gloves, protectors, overshoes, non-prescription safety glasses, and work gloves, as well as any other personal protective equipment that an employer is required to provide, at its cost, to its employees under applicable OSHA regulations.
c)	Effective May 1, 2006, for designated employees of the Illuminating Company, the Company will provide an allowance of $1250 to each employee to be used by April 30, 2011 for the purchase of flame retardant clothing.

Any employee who enters a classification requiring flame retardant clothing in a year, in which no
money is credited to the account, shall receive an amount of $250 to purchase flame retardant clothing and $250 for any subsequent year of the agreement. The designated employees are those in the following job classifications:

Section 3.
(a)	A Union Representative authorized for such purpose may submit any safety recommendation in writing to the Manager, Industrial Relations, who will confer with such Union Representative on the merits of such recommendation. The safety recommendation so discussed, unless the Union withdraws it after discussion, shall be submitted to the Management. The Company will advise the Union of its action upon any submitted safety recommendations.
For the purposes of this section, the Company will recognize three safety committees; one for Fossil Operations; one for Nuclear Operations; and one for Transmission and Distribution Operations. The Company will recognize and pay the Union Safety Committees Chairman and two Representatives designated in writing by the Union for each committee. Each committee shall meet three times per year at a time and place as determined by the respective committee. Additional meetings may be called by the Company or the Union. The requirement for the Company to pay representatives from the Union shall not apply to any additional meetings called by the Union.
The Company will also recognize two Representatives, appointed by the Union and designated in writing to the Manager, Industrial Relations, as members of the Perry Plant ALARA Review Committee. Both Representatives shall be employees who have Perry Plant job classifications.
In a cooperative effort to insure the effectiveness of Joint Company/Union safety committees at the Department or Section level it is agreed that the Union representatives will select Union volunteers to serve as safety committee members for the calendar year commencing in January. It is the stated objective of the Joint Company/Union Safety Committee that this cooperative effort is directed at improving the safe work environment for all employees. Employees participating will be paid for all time lost from their scheduled work period while attending such meetings.
(b)	In connection with any injury sustained by an employee while on the job, the Company will provide such employee with a copy of any statement he may make in the investigation of the accident. The Company will notify the Union of the time and place that an investigator is to take the employee’s statement regarding the accident. Further, each department will, as soon as practicable, advise the appropriate Job Steward of any accidents involving employees he may represent. If requested, a Job Steward, who is at the location of the accident, will be granted up to one-half hour off with pay to investigate the accident. Upon request to his supervisor, any Chief Job Steward requiring additional time off at a location other than where the accident occurred will be excused without pay to investigate the accident.
Section 4.	Work Clothing
(a.) If two-thirds (2/3) of the employees, and in the job classification of mechanic in the Company's Garage Services Department, respectively, determine to wear work clothing, the Company will pay one-half (1/2) the cost (purchase, alterations, replacements, repairs and cleaning or rental) and all employees when so engaged and in such classification shall wear work clothing.
(b.) The Company will furnish work gloves and equipment for rainy weather and will make available protective clothing for the use of employees in the following work:
Outdoor work during rainy weather.
Work on Economizers, Superheaters, Precipitators, Fuel Bunkers, Boiler Tubes, Water Treatment, Fuel and Lube Oil Tanks and Filters, Coal Belt Conveyors and Car Thawing.

Section 5.
All employees are required to provide the Company with a telephone number where they may be reached in order to fulfill the obligation to respond to calls when the need arises.
Section 6.
When the permanent headquarters of an employee is changed at the Company's request (other than by reason of a reduction in force or the declaration of a surplus) and he decides to move his residence in consequence thereof, the Company will pay the mutually agreed upon moving expense incurred within a reasonable period of time after such change of headquarters, if the distance from the employee's old headquarters to his new headquarters exceeds fifty (50) road miles, unless the employee already lives nearer the new headquarters than the old headquarters. If it is not possible to give such an employee sufficient notice of the proposed transfer to permit him to arrange living quarters in the new locality and it is mutually agreed that it is necessary for him to live away from home until such time as he can move, the Company will pay his necessary living expenses away from home for a reasonable period of time.
Section 7.
No supervisor shall act in other than a supervisory capacity except in emergencies. This is not intended to prevent a supervisor from protecting life or property, giving occasional or emergency assistance or performing work for the purpose of instruction. However, the primary function of a supervisor is supervision and he is not to perform work, which will eliminate a man or interfere with supervision.
This section will also apply to an employee while he is assigned temporarily to the directive duties of a supervisor in his absence.
Section 8.
During the period May 1, 2006 through April 30, 2011, the Company will not layoff any employee, except under extraordinary circumstances such as acts of God, catastrophic events, bankruptcy, sale or shutdown or curtailment of a plant or generating unit, revocation of a nuclear operating license, or shutdown of a portion of the transmission or distribution system. The foregoing shall not be construed as a requirement to maintain any particular staffing levels. This paragraph shall not prohibit a layoff in the event that the Company sells or otherwise transfers a generating unit or a portion of all of its transmission and distribution systems. The rights of employees in the event of such a sale or transfer are dealt with in the Successor and Assigns Clause. An employee laid off pursuant to this section shall have the right to elect either to retain his rights under Article VI, Section 6 or receive severance benefits under the Company’s Employee Assistance Plan.
The Company reserves the right to contract to perform work in an efficient, cost effective manner. The Company further reserves the right to contract specific jobs, ordinarily and customarily done by regular employees, that are required to be done within a specified time, and the work cannot be done by regular employees in the time required or where the Company’s normal work force, skills, training and organization of its employees, its tools or equipment is inadequate. The Company will notify the Union of such outside contractor work on a timely basis, as conditions permit.
Section 9.
Employees who are unable to report for work shall notify their reporting place, supervisors or foremen at least one (1) hour before starting time of their shift of such inability to report for work. An employee returning to work after excused absences including sick leave shall notify his reporting place, supervisor or foreman at least six (6) hours before his normal starting time.
Section 10.
Where attendance is required by the Company, the Company will pay the affected employee(s) hourly rates, for time actually spent in attendance at safety meetings or other special meetings called by the Company for purposes of instruction or training outside of the employee’s regular working hours. No meals, meal allowances, callout or other fringe benefits shall be applicable to such time so spent unless such time at meetings exceeds two (2) hours.
Section 11.
No full-time regular employee shall (except as may be permitted when such employee is on authorized leave of absence) engage in work for any employer other than the Company to the extent that such additional work constitutes something more than casual employment and qualifies such employee for the benefits, if any, paid to employees generally by such other employer. If a violation
of this clause becomes known to the Company, the employee will be given fifteen (15) calendar days to correct the situation and failing to do so, the employee may be discharged.
Section 12.
When an employee who has been off work who in the opinion of the Company’s physician is capable of performing modified duty work, unless overturned by a 3rd doctor pursuant to the procedure specified in Section 1 i., and the Company, in its sole discretion, has offered such employee modified duty either within or outside of the employee’s regular duties, the employee shall initially be carried at his regular rate for a two (2) week period. At the end of this initial period, he shall be reviewed, and this process shall be continued with a review at the expiration of each week, so long as the Company in its sole discretion continues such modified duty. The primary purpose of these periodic reviews is to assure that the employee is returned to his regular duties as soon as he is able to do so. The Company may terminate the availability of modified duty at any time and nothing in the foregoing shall require the Company to make modified duty available in any particular case.
ARTICLE XIII
Conflicts With Laws or Regulations
Section 1.
If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with any valid governmental proclamation, directive or regulation or with any valid Federal or State law, order, or regulations now or hereafter enacted or issued, such provision hereof shall not remain binding, but the remaining portions of the Agreement shall remain binding. Any conflicting provision shall then be open for renegotiation between the parties hereto for the purpose of reconciling the conflict.
If any valid governmental proclamation, directive or regulation, or any valid Federal or State law, order or regulation, now or hereafter enacted or issued, requires the approval by any governmental agency or authority of any provision of this Agreement before it may become effective, the parties hereto shall not be bound by said provision until such approval has been obtained.

A temporary employee is one who is hired either for a specific period of time or for a specific job of limited duration. A part-time employee is an employee who is regularly scheduled to work less than forty hours per week. A temporary or part-time employee shall not be retained on a temporary and/or part-time employee status beyond twelve consecutive months. The months of employment shall be considered consecutive unless there has been a break in such employment of at least six calendar months. The Company will notify the Union when hiring temporary or part-time employees.
A newly hired employee, other than a part-time employee, shall be considered a probationary employee for twelve (12) months, during which period the Company will determine the suitability of such new employee for acceptance as a regular employee. Similarly, an employee whose status is changed from part-time to probationary shall be considered a probationary employee for twelve (12) months during which period the Company will determine the suitability of such an employee for acceptance as a regular employee. Prior service in a temporary status shall be considered as part of the probationary period. If such an employee is released by the Company for any reason during the twelve (12)-month probationary period, such action will not be the subject of a grievance. Part-time or temporary employees shall not have the benefit of the grievance procedure.
Section 3.

As such, this Agreement shall govern during its term the entire relationship with respect to wages, rates of pay, hours of employment and other conditions of employment, and shall be the sole source of any and all rights or claims which may be asserted in the adjustment of differences hereunder or otherwise.

Only one double rate day will be deemed to exist in any calendar week, except in case of a holiday in a given week.
n.	For the purpose of computing overtime, the workday shall consist of twelve (12) hours and the workweek of three (3) workdays (36 hours) or four (4) workdays (48 hours).

APPENDIX C
COMPANY POSITION ON USE OR POSSESSION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
•	The illegal use, sale, or possession of narcotics, drugs or controlled substances while on the job, or on Company property is a dischargeable offense.
•	Off-the-job illegal drug use that could adversely affect job performance, or jeopardize the safety of other employees, the public, or Company equipment is proper cause for disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
•	Employees arrested and convicted in off-the-job drug activity shall be in violation of this Policy.
•	The use of prescribed controlled substances while undergoing medical treatment is not a violation of this Policy. However, use of drugs that may alter an individual’s physical or mental ability may make it necessary to change an employee’s job assignment while the employee is undergoing treatment. Employees undergoing prescribed medical treatment with a controlled substance are solely responsible to report their treatment to their supervisor or Human Resource Representative where appropriate (except personnel with unescorted access at the Perry Plant, the treatment must be reported to the Supervisor), who will forward the information to the local human resources representative for retention. If assistance is needed to determine an employee’s ability to work, the local human resources representative will consult the Company Medical Office in the Industrial Relations Department.
•	Use or possession of alcoholic beverages while on the job is prohibited. Employees in violation of this rule shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
•	An employee whose job performance indicates that he or she is unfit for duty shall not be permitted to work until investigation into the cause has been completed. The Company reserves the discretion to require a medical examination by its doctor, including recognized diagnostic tests as part of the investigation. If use of unauthorized drugs or alcohol is substantiated, disciplinary action will be imposed up to and including termination of employment.
•	As in the past, employees seeking assistance with personal, alcohol, or drug problems are encouraged to contact the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP for all non-FENOC employees is Magellan Behavioral Health, Inc. at 1-800-424-4615. The EAP for all FENOC employees is Magellan Behavioral Health, Inc. at 1-800-424-4935. Employees voluntarily using the services of the Employee Assistance Program may do so without jeopardizing their continued employment with the Company.

ARTICLE II
Re-employment and Seniority Rights
Section 1-Re-employment
An employee returning from a military leave of absence will be reinstated in the employee’s former position providing the employee meets all of the following requirements:
Applies to the Company before the employee’s military leave expires.
Has received a certificate of satisfactory military service;
Is able and qualified to perform the duties of the employee’s former job; and Has not accepted other employment since the date of release from active duty.
Section 2.
The seniority of all employees returning to the Company from military leave of absence will be cumulative.
ARTICLE III
Promotions
When a veteran returns to work, the veteran will be restored to the veteran’s former job classification, provided the veteran meets the qualifications set forth in Article II, above. In the event that one or more employees who had less job classification seniority, or who were in lower classifications in the same line of promotion, were promoted to classifications above that which the veteran left, the following principles will govern:
The veteran will be given training to qualify him for each higher classification in the line of promotion to which employees of lesser job classification seniority were promoted due to his absence. It is understood that the training period for each such promotion shall not exceed the time qualifications set forth in the job specifications for each higher classification.
If the veteran becomes qualified for promotion during the training period, and if no vacancy exists, one will be created in each such classification above the one to which the veteran returns. The employee reduced will be the one who was last promoted into such classification and who had less job classification seniority than the veteran, or who was in a lower classification in the same line of promotion.
The veteran will be promoted to each such classification when the veteran is qualified. It is understood that any obligation to the veteran arising under this section will be terminated when the veteran has failed to qualify during the training period established in (1) above for any higher classification.
Upon the first and subsequent promotions resulting from the application of these principles, the veteran will be given a job classification seniority position ahead of any employees who had lesser job classification seniority at the time the veteran left for military service.
It is the intent of the Company and the union to protect to the fullest extent required by law the rights of those employees who serve our country in the military. In the event that cases involving hardship or inequity result from the application of these principles, such cases may be discussed by the President of the Union and the Manager of Union Relations. If no agreement is reached, such cases may be subject to the grievance procedure.
