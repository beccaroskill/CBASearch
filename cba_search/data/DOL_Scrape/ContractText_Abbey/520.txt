ADDENDUM
PRIVATE SCA VFNGER INDUNTRY/IO1NTLAROR-MANAGFMFNT
ALCOHOL AND DRUG FREE WORK ENVIRONMENT
The Employers and the Union are parties to the Private Scavenger Agreement made effective October 1, 2003 and they intend hereby to adopt said Addendum as it pertains to certain operations and certain employees of the Employers. Accordingly, the Employers and the Union agree to make the following modifications to said Private Scavenger Agreement:
L PREAMBLE
The Employer is firmly committed to providing its employees with a safe work place, and maintaining high standards of employee health.
Being under the influence of alcohol or any legal or illegal substance can pose potentially serious safety and health risks to the user and to those who come in contact with the user. The use of such substances also can impair employee performance and judgment.
An alcohol/drug free work environment is especially important in the waste disposal and transportation industry because of the basic responsibility to serve the public safely without interruption. A user of alcohol/drugs, whether an addict, a recreational or occasional user, is a potential safety hazard while driving or working under the influence.
The safety and well-being of the public, who put their trust in us, demand that all of our employees perform their jobs free of the effects of alcohol or illegal drugs. The Company’s goal is to protect employees, host communities, and customers from the dangers of substance abuse in the workplace.
ILSCOPE
This Policy applies to employees in DOT covered positions and employees who work in “safety sensitive” positions. For purposes of this section, a “safety sensitive” position is any non-DOT covered employee who:
1.	receives a periodic company medical evaluation (eg. heavy equipment operators, helpers), OR
2.	operates heavy equipment or non-CDL licensed vehicles, OR
3.	works in an active operation around vehicles, equipment, or machinery, (e g.

B.	Controlled Substances
1.	Legal Drugs:
Improper use of prescription or “over-the-counter” drugs is prohibited.
Employees taking prescription or “over-the-counter” drugs, that their medical advisor or the manufacturer warns may affect behavior or performance, must advise their supervisor that they are taking such drugs for medical reasons.
The employee may be relieved of his/her job duties or reassigned by the Company during any period in which the proper use of prescription or “over-the-counter” drugs may adversely affect job safety or performance.
2.	Illegal Drugs:
Any employee who is under the influence of an illegal drug or manufactures, distributes, dispenses, possesses, uses on or off duty or sells an illegal drug while on Company premises or while performing Company business is in violation of Company Policy.
