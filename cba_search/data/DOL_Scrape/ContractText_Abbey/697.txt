For these reasons, it is the purpose of this policy to establish and maintain a work environment free from the effects of drug and alcohol use, recognizing that both drug and alcohol abuse are illnesses which can be treated. Accordingly, both parties agree that it is the intent of this policy to deal initially with violations of the policy by treatment and education, rather than through discipline or termination.
ARTICLE 2: DEFINITIONS
