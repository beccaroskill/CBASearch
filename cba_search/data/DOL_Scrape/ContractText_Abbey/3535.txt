For each musician who elects the coverage, the Symphony will provide individual health insurance coverage including hospitalization and major medical coverage, ninety-five percent (95%) of the cost of which will be paid by the Symphony. For the first year of this Agreement, the parties have selected the Preferred Care Blue plan provided by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Kansas City. In order to keep increases in the cost of health insurance to a manageable level, Symphony Management may solicit bids from reputable insurance carriers on an annual basis, and the Musicians’ Committee may also request that Management solicit such bids. Bids shall only be solicited from carriers offering national insurance packages reasonably comparable to the Blue Cross & Blue Shield coverage listed above.
2.	Family Health Coverage
Family health insurance coverage shall be made available to the musicians. If a musician elects family coverage, then, in addition to the payment that the Symphony would make to cover his individual health insurance premium, the Symphony shall pay the following percentage of the remaining cost of family coverage in accordance with the provisions below:
a.	In the 2014-15 season, the Symphony shall pay 30% of the remaining cost bf family
coverage;
b.	In the 2015-16 season, if the premium increase for the current season does not exceed 9.9% of the premium paid in the previous season, the Symphony shall pay 35% of the remaining cost of family coverage;	;
c.	In the 2016-17 season, if the premium increase for the current season does not exceed 9.9% of the premium paid in the previous season, the Symphony shall pay 40% of the remaining cost of family coverage.
Furthermore, if two Symphony musicians who are married to each other elect Family coverage, the . Symphony shall pay the amount that would have been paid for the individual health premium for each musician. In addition, the Symphony will pay two (2) times the percentage that the Symphony has agreed to pay toward the remaining cost of family coverage for other musicians who have elected such coverage (2014-15 - 60%, 2015-16 — possibly 70%, 2016-17 - possibly 80%); except that no married couple will contribute less than two (2) times the amount of premium paid by musicians who elect individual health insurance coverage.
In the event a Musician is married to a same sex partner in a marriage valid where made, and the Musician elects family coverage, the Symphony shall provide comparable insurance benefits as paid to other married couples to that couple to extent feasible with the carriers. If the carriers refuse to provide such coverage, the parties agree that up to the amount the Symphony would pay for family coverage would be paid to the.Musician.
B.	Insurance Committee
1.	Joint Insurance Committee
There shall be an Insurance Committee consisting of at least three members of the Musicians’ Committee and an equal number of management representatives, which shall convene to review coverage options at any time either party so requests, or automatically if Symphony Management 31
solicits bids for new health, life, long-term disability, or dental insurance coverage. The Committee shall be fully informed of any and all bids solicited from potential providers, and the Musician representatives on the Committee may submit the names of additional carriers from which Symphony Management shall solicit bids. After bids are received, the Committee may, by mutual agreement, change carriers and/or plans. If a carrier initiates minor modifications in a plan - for example, by adding or removing physicians, adding, removing, or changing drug formularies or lists of covered drugs, or making minor adjustments in available benefits - those changes will not require the parties to negotiate over the changes.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, changes in deductibles, co-pay amounts, out-of-pocket maximums, loss of major hospital provider, or other significant changes shall not be considered minor.
2.	Insurance Plan Change.
In the event either party wishes to change carriers or plans, maintenance of an overall package of benefits that compares favorably to the existing benefit plan in question, while controlling cost increases^ shall be the primary objective of the change. Changing carriers or plans shall not be used as a method of cost-cutting. The parties will monitor premium increases for each plan, each year. The rate of premium increase shall be considered as a rolling, three-year average, except that in the second year of the contract, the rate of increase shall be the rate of increase for that year, and in the third year of the contract the rate of increase shall be the average of the rate increases (if any) for the first two years. The presumption shall be that the Symphony will maintain current plans and carriers so long as the rolling average premium increase does not exceed ten percent (10%), and that the parties will make changes or find replacement coverage in any year in which the rolling average premium increase exceeds or would exceed ten percent (10%) if the existing plan is retained.
Even if the rate of premium increase exceeds ten percent (10%), the Insurance Committee may determine by majority vote, after reviewing bids for replacement coverage, that no alternative plan or carrier provides a reasonably comparable package of benefits while maintaining a cost level lower than the proposed premium increases, in which case the Symphony will maintain the then-current plan.
3.	Arbitration
If the premium rate increase, as measured above, exceeds ten percent (10%), the parties will make every good faith effort to reach a mutual agreement bn appropriate changes or replacement coverage. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement on changes or replacement coverage, the matter shall be submitted to interest arbitration. If arbitration is to occur, the parties will first attempt to agree on a mutually acceptable arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within fourteen days after either side requests arbitration, then the arbitrator shall be selected from a panel of seven names obtained from FMCS, with the parties alternately striking names from the list, and the last remaining individual on the list becoming the designated arbitrator. At the arbitration hearing, each party shall identify a single plan that the party believes offers the best mix of cost control and benefit maintenance, and the selected plan may be a replacement plan or the existing plan. Any plan selected must include a national network of health care providers available to the musicians.
The arbitrator shall select one of the two plans as the replacement plan. Factors for the arbitrator to consider shall be percentage of premium increase, benefits offered, plan design, out-of-pocket costs to participants, and scope of the network.

B.	Stage Schedule and Deportment
Musicians are required to be in the hall at least ten (10) minutes prior to and in their seats five (5) minutes prior to the beginning of any rehearsal or performance otherwise the musician may be considered tardy. Up until thirty (30) minutes before performances, the harpist shall have time to tune on stage without interruption by Symphony musicians. Musicians may be seated in their chairs on stage thirty (30) minutes prior to curtain for unobtrusive warm-up. Musicians are required to remain in their seats for rehearsals until dismissed by the Conductor or Personnel Manager, and for performances until the exit of the Concertmaster, including instances of rehearsal or performance overtime. For pit orchestra performances, musicians are required to stand for bows when asked and to remain in the pit until all bows are completed, except as provided for in X.G.4.d.iv.
C.	Absence Notification
It is the responsibility of the musician, in the event he is unable for any reason to attend any service, to contact the Personnel Manager or Assistant Personnel Manager by phone or by text message on their cell phone. The musician shall notify the Personnel Manager or Assistant Personnel Manager at least one hour prior to the start of the service to the extent practicable. No musician shall send a substitute musician to any service. Failure to notify the Personnel Manager may result in the absence being considered unexcused.
D.	On Call Status
Any musician who is not performing on a specific program, due to the orchestration requirements of the repertoire, may be required to substitute on his contracted instrument(s), for a musician who suffers an emergency absence or in the case of an emergency program change. Any absence due to illness or injury or other emergency absence which is known by Management more than ten (10) days prior to the first service does not qualify as an emergency and may not result in the “on call” musician being required or requested to substitute. To facilitate this matter, one musician per section, except in the string sections, which may have up to two (2) musicians, may be assigned to be “on call.” Titled players may be placed “on call”, but may only be required to perform in their own titled position or higher as specified in their
individual contract. Continue the current practice that in any case where the orchestra is split, no “on call” musician(s) shall be assigned. “On call” assignments shall be made and posted no less than twentyeight (28) days before the start of the first service.
For all programs, the “on call” musician(s) shall be released at the start of the final dress rehearsal unless they have played the entire program in rehearsal.
If such musician is not reasonably available by phone to be notified that he is needed for such services(s) or is not available for such services upon notification, his absence from such services may be regarded by the Symphony as unpaid leave. In the event that an “oh call” musician wishes to request leave during the services after they have been assigned to be “on call”, it is understood that such leave will only be charged if the need to bring them in later arises. In the event no “on call” musician is assigned to a service or the assigned musician cannot be reached or cannot attend the service because of illness, act of God, or other force majeure, another musician may be asked to perform as the substitute and shall be compensated at their per-service rate. If the “on call” musician is unable to attend the service due to illness or injury they shall not be penalized but will be charged a sick day for any services missed. Reasonable time will be allowed for the musician to reach the service without penalty. Until the time of release, the musician will receive service credit for any services for which they are “on call.” To the extent practical, these assignments will be made in a systematic and equitable manner, but will not apply to any musician who has been officially granted vacation, relief time, or any type of leave.
E.	Part Assignments
Principals, unless otherwise directed by the Conductor or Management; shall decide the assignment of parts and inform the Personnel Manager of their decisions at least one month prior to the first rehearsal. All part assignments shall be communicated to those affected at least two (2) weeks before a given work is rehearsed.

G.	Bowing Responsibilities
Each string principal, or titled player assigned to perform as principal, will mark and return bowings directly to the library or security desk at the KCPA within a maximum of seven (7) days from receipt of parts from the librarian. The librarians shall notify the Personnel Manager and/or the Chair of the Musicians’ Committee in the event bowings are not returned within the stated timeframe.

Members of the Symphony shall dress for performances in accordance with the official dress designated by this Agreement.

If either party desires assistance with the negotiations, they may enlist the services of a mediator and/or a fact finder to be mutually agreed upon, or in the absence of an agreement to be appointed by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The Union, the mediator, and the fact finder shall have access to all of the Symphony’s financial records including projected budgets.
If by February 1, 2017, the parties have not reached agreement then either party may file for arbitration through the procedures of the FMCS. The issue before the arbitrator shall be: Is the Symphony reasonably and financially able to meet the Union’s latest proposal? If the arbitrator answers the question in the affirmative, the Symphony shall comply with the arbitrator’s decision and said decision shall become the terms of the hew agreement for a period not in excess of one year, unless the Board of Trustees of the Symphony determines, in its discretion, that compliance will pose a serious risk to the financial stability of the Symphony. If the parties reach a timely agreement regarding the provisions to be effective during future seasons, then the term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for a period of additional years equal to the length of the agreement reached. Nothing herein shall prevent the parties from amending the remaining provisions of this Agreement by written agreement. Either party may request that the mediator or fact finder referenced above issue a written, non-binding recommendation regarding proposed changes in the remaining provisions.
The expenses, if any, of any mediator, fact finder, or arbitrator shall be bome equally by the Symphony and the Union.
XXIV.	FORCE MAJEURE
In the event it becomes impossible to continue the series of concerts and rehearsals provided for under the terms of this Agreement by reason of any act of nature such as fire, flood or pestilence, or because any of the rules or regulations promulgated by federal, state or municipal authorities, of a civil or military nature, or for any other reason beyond the control of the Symphony, then the Symphony will have the right to cancel the season upon the payment of stipulated compensation to the date of such cancellation. The Symphony will make every reasonable effort to continue the season. Any such cancellation of a single season, or part thereof, shall have no effect on the remaining seasons covered by this Agreement; rather, unless notice to the contrary is given by the Symphony prior to
SR
or during subsequent seasons, this Agreement shall be deemed in effect during subsequent seasons.*;
It is the intention of the Symphony to continue the scope of its activities and the period of. employment of the musicians: There may be circumstances, however, in the judgment and discretion of the Symphony, when its financial condition does not justify the completion of a season. If such circumstances exist as determined by a resolution duly adopted by the Executive Committee of the Symphony’s Board, then the Symphony shall have the right to cancel the season upon the payment to the musicians of stipulated compensation to the date of such cancellation. Any such cancellation of a single season, or part thereof, shall have no effect on the remaining seasons covered by this Agreement; rather, unless notice to the contrary is given by the Symphony prior to or during subsequent seasons, this Agreement shall be deemed in effect in subsequent seasons. In the event the Symphony cancels a season or part thereof for reasons set forth in this paragraph, and does not resume operations at the beginning of the next season, the Union may give thirty (30) days notice of reopening this entire Agreement upon such failure to resume operations.
In the event of cancellation pursuant to this section, the Symphony will make its best effort to give as much notice as possible of the cancellation of the season, but in no case will it give less than thirty. (30) days notice to the Musicians’ Committee and the Union of such cancellation or, if such notice is not available, thirty (30) days pay to each musician or such amount, if greater, which may be required by Federal law. At the earliest possible date, a meeting will be held between representatives of the Symphony, the Musicians’ Committee and the Union to discuss the reasons for such cancellation, including a full and frank discussion of the circumstances leading to the decision. Either party may request the services, of a mediator or fact finder and the parties will meet to discuss proposals which might permit continuationsof the season. The mediator or fact finder may, upon the request of either party, issue a report stating whether cancellation is appropriate based on the Symphony’s financial condition. If any proposal which would permit continuation of the season is ratified by the Musicians and the Symphony’s Board, the notice of cancellation will be withdrawn.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed by their, duly authorized representatives as of this first day of May, 1998 and further agreed to and accepted on the 9th day of November, 1999, and further agreed to and accepted on this 25 th day of November, 2003, and further agreed to and accepted on this 31st day of May, 2007, and further agreed to and accepted on this 4* day of June, 2009.

ADDENDUM A:
CODE OF ETHICAL PRACTICES FOR NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL AUDITIONS
Purpose and Scope of Code
It is of utmost importance to musicians, managers, and conductors that auditions be conducted in accordance with guidelines ensuring competition that is fair to all who audition while providing the best results for orchestras seeking musicians.
Therefore, the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians (ICSOM), and the Major Orchestra Managers Conference (MOMC) propound the following ethical and fair audition practices to which all parties should adhere, subject to local contractual considerations.
I.	Preparation for Auditions
a.	Notices of auditions should be given only for genuine vacancies, including newly created positions, which the management intends to fill as a result of those auditions, with no predeterminations having been made as to who will be hired. Musicians taking such auditions should only do so with the intention of accepting the position if it is offered.
b.	Auditions should be advertised in appropriate places, including the International Musician and the AFM central auditions office. Notices should be clear and complete, specifying the position intended to be filled by the auditions, the person to contact in response to the notice, and the dates that applications are due and that auditions will be held. Notices should appear far enough in advance of auditions for interested musicians to apply and to adequately prepare.
c.	All applicants should be sent written responses to their applications. Invited applicants should be sent clear instructions setting forth the date, time and place of the audition, the complete audition repertoire (excluding sight reading repertoire), and parts for announced excerpts not generally available. All parts supplied by the orchestra should be legible and identical for all candidates.
d.	Applicants should be given notice that if they choose not to attend the audition they should promptly notify the personnel manager or other designated person.
II.	Conduct of Auditions
a.	In preparing for and conducting auditions, all participants should be aware of policies and procedures governing those auditions, including this code.
b.	Although the existence and composition of an audition committee and the nature and extent of its participation in auditioning and hiring is determined locally, musicians’ involvement should at least include the initial screening of applicants.
c.	Applicants should not be disqualified from auditioning on the basis of information about them obtained from current or previous employers or.from other institutions to which they have applied.
d.	Auditionees should be given sufficient time and, to the extent possible, adequate private facilities in which to warm up and practice.Parts supplied by the orchestra for auditions should be in good condition, legible, and clearly marked as intended to be played at the audition.
e.	There should be no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, age, creed, national origin, religion, or sexual preference; steps ensuring this should exist in all phases of the audition process.
f.	There should be reasonable accommodation for the handicapped.
g.	Auditionees should be given opportunity and encouragement to comment, anonymously if desired, to the audition committee and management about the audition process.
h.	Auditionees should be notified of their status in the audition process immediately upon such
61
determination. Candidates under active consideration after auditions are completed should be so notified and given an estimated time of final decision.
i.	Auditionees should be informed prior to auditions of the orchestra’s policy regarding reimbursement of auditionees’ expenses for additional stay or travel incurred at the request of management.
Administration and Review of Code
A joint committee of representatives of the Major Orchestra Managers Conference, ICSOM, and the AFM Symphony Department shall be established to oversee and review this code periodically.
(Published in Senza Sordino Volume 23 #2. December 1984)
ADDENDUMS:
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Ratified on 8/99	, , . .
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into on August 13, 1999, between the Kansas City Symphony (“Symphony”) and Local 34-627 of the American Federation of Musicians (“Union”).
The parties agree that, under Article Vl.a of the current Agreement between the parties, the Symphony has the obligation to maintain at least eight Co-Principal/Associate positions within various designated sections or other sections may be mutually agreed. The parties also agree that the Symphony has the right to maintain more than eight such Co-Principals/Associate positions and upgrade positions without adding headcount.
The Symphony and Union further agree that, for some period of time prior to this Memorandum of Understanding, Kathy Raid has performed on a regular basis in the position of Associate Principal (Second Violin) and Nancy Newman has performed on a regular basis in the position of Associate Principal (Bass) without having their positions formally recognized with the appropriate title of Associate Principal.
In light of the foregoing and in light of the Symphony’s right to maintain more than eight Co-Principal/Associate positions, the Symphony and Union hereby agree that it would be appropriate to upgrade Kathy Raid’s title to Associate Principal (Second Violin) and to upgrade Nancy Newman’s title to Associate Principal (Bass), effective with the 1999-2000 season.
The parties acknowledge that, with the foregoing changes, the Symphony will have ten Co-Principal/Associate positions among the sections designated in Article Vl.a. The parties also acknowledge that these ten positions will be within those sections designated in said Article Vl.a (that is, first and second violin, viola, cello, flute, oboe, clarinet, horn, trumpet or such other sections as may be mutually agreed, including the bass section by mutual agreement). In addition, and as is applicable to all titled positions, the parties agree that the Symphony’s right to demote or reduce the responsibility/title of a musician holding any of said ten Co-Principal/Associate positions is subject to Article XVIII of the Agreement.
This Memorandum of Understanding does not set precedent nor should it be construed as setting any type of precedent for future titling or upgrading of positions or any process related to same.

The Symphony shall install and use a “Saddle Span/SA80” type tent structure that is closed on three sides with an opening at the front of the stage area. Such opening shall be positioned in such a manner to keep direct sunlight from reaching any Musician at any time during a service.
The Symphony shall make every effort to provide air-conditioning in the “Saddle Span/SA80” structure whenever the on-stage temperature is expected to be in excess of 90 degrees at any point during the performance and/or sound check. If the on-stage temperature cannot be regulated to a maximum of 92 degrees the following temperature premiums shall be paid to each Musician scheduled to perform.
1.	An on-stage temperature of 90-92 degrees shall be considered a “grace period” and no additional compensation shall be required.
2.	When the on-stage temperature reaches 93-94 degrees $25/Musician shall be paid per hour, or any portion thereof, of scheduled service call time to include concert/sound check.
3.	When the on-stage temperature reaches 95-96 degrees $50/Musician shall be paid per hour, or any portion thereof, of scheduled service call time to include concert/sound check.
When the on-stage temperature exceeds 96 degrees the Symphony and Musicians’ Committee shall meet to discuss the situation and may mutually agree upon an additional temperature premium or other course of action.
Under no circumstances shall any Musician, individually or collectively, be requested or required to perform a concert or sound check when the on-stage temperature reaches 100 degrees or higher.
The average of four thermometers’ readings shall be deemed the official temperature, which shall be used to calculate the temperature premiums paid to Musicians. The four thermometers shall be placed in the following areas of the Saddle Span structure; one in the trumpet/ trombone row, one in the oboe/flute row, one in either the first or second violin section and one in either the cello or viola section. Such thermometers shall be placed on the fixed center post of the appropriate music stands, just under the stand desks.
If any Musician(s) feels that conditions constitute a danger to the Musician’s health and/or instrument, such Musician(s) may consult with the Personnel Manager and Musicians’ Committee concerning such problem. The Symphony will continue its long standing practice of releasing such Musician(s) from the service under such conditions.
The Symphony shall provide adequate separate dressing rooms (including outdoor tents) adjacent to the performing site for all Musicians. In the event that these facilities are not air-conditioned the Symphony shall park at least one air-conditioned, first-class motor coach adjacent to the performance site and dressing rooms for use by the Musicians as conditions warrant. An adequate number of rest rooms (including port-a-potties) shall be provided adjacent to the performance site for use by the Musicians.
Transportation to and from the actual performance site shall be by air conditioned, first-class motor coach unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Musicians’ Committee at least (4) four weeks in advance of the scheduled event.
77
The scheduled arrival time at the actual performance site shall not be earlier than (60) sixty minutes prior to the start of the sound check and/or performance, whichever is scheduled earlier unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Musicians’ Committee at least (4) four weeks in advance of the scheduled event.

ADDENDUM H:
SIDE-LETTER REGARDING MATERNITY AND PATERNITY LEAVE
1.	This addendum is intended to clarify the use of maternity and paternity leave (bonding leave) under Article XTV.D. Under the FMLA, maternity and paternity leave must be taken in a single block of time. The parties hereby mutually agree that all musicians shall have the option of taking leave for the birth and care of a child or following placement of a child for adoption or foster care in the musician's home either in a single block of time or in two blocks of time, as described below.
2.	Musicians who elect to use leave in two blocks of time must use the first block of time to cover an initial week of leave commencing with the birth or placement of the child. The musician shall return to work immediately following this initial week of leave time, except that the leave shall be extended and charged against the musician's available leave time if returning to work precisely after one week of initial leave would return the musician to work at a time when the musician would be ineligible to perform in an upcoming performance because he or she had missed more than fifty percent (50%) of the practice sessions devoted to preparing for the performance. Where it is necessary to extend the initial leave period to return the musician to work after a performance for which he or she would not be eligible, the musician shall have the option either to use accrued sick leave or personal days to cover the pay for the extended leave days, or to take unpaid leave.
3.	After this initial leave period, the musician may then take any remaining available leave in one additional block of consecutive days. This second leave period must be planned so that the musician will be eligible to participate in any performance scheduled after the musician's leave time has been exhausted. Further, this second leave period cannot be scheduled in such a way that it would fall on both sides of the summer layoff weeks, which would effectively break the leave into three intermittent periods in contravention of this addendum.
4.	The musician shall have the right to use accrued paid sick leave and/or personal days to cover all leave periods, or to instead take unpaid leave.
5.	All leave for the birth and/or care of a child, and all leave following the placement of a child for adoption or foster care in the musician's home, must be concluded within twelve (12) months after the birth or placement.
6.	Vacations will not count as covered leave time. Any musician on paid leave (i.e. using sick leave and/or personal days) both before and after the vacation week(s) will be paid for the vacation days. Any musician on unpaid leave either immediately before or after the vacation week(s) will not receive any pay for the vacation week(s).
7.	Consistent with FMLA regulations, any holidays falling during patemity/matemity leave will count against the musician's allotted leave time. Any musician on paid leave (i.e. using sick leave and/or personal days) both before and after the holiday will be paid for the holiday without needing to use any accrued paid leave for that day. Any musician on unpaid leave either immediately before or after the holiday will not receive any pay for the holiday.
8.	As set out in the FMLA regulations, when the need for leave is foreseeable, as is ordinarily the case in situations involving the birth or adoption of a child, the employee requesting leave must provide as much advance notice as is reasonably practicable of the anticipated date of the leave. Normally, notice of the anticipated request for leave should be given at least thirty (30) days in advance.
74
9.	If an individual case arises in which management, the Musician's Committee, and the individual musician all agree in writing, in advance of the commencement of leave, that it is in the interest of all parties for the leave to be taken on a schedule different than that set out in Paragraphs 2 & 3 above, the parties may agree to a special leave schedule for that particular situation. Any such departure from the specific terms of this Addendum shall take place only upon mutual written agreement of all parties, and shall not set any precedent or be referred to in dealing with any other leave request situation.

In addition, and as is applicable to all titled positions, the parties agree that the Symphony’s right to demote or reduce the responsibility/title of a musician holding any of said thirteen Associate positions is subject to Article XVIII of the Agreement.
