ARTICLE 10 APPOINTMENTS
Section A. Appointments. There shall be the following types of ASF Member appointments:
Subd. 1. Fixed-Term. A fixed-term appointment is an appointment for a limited period of time. A fixed-term appointment terminates at the end of th<appointment period and does not imply that any future employment will be offered.
(a)	Fixed-term appointments may be used to fill vacancies created by leaves of absence, to fill positions when the President determines that normal recruitment and selection procedures cannot be implemented due to time constraints (an emergency fill), to meet peak work demands, to fill positions that involve head or assistant coaching responsibilities or for special projects.
(b)	Normally, a fixed-term appointment shall not exceed twelve (12) months in duration. However, the President may extend such an appointment to a maximum of twelve (12) additional months when such action is deemed to be in the best interest of the
9
university. Fixed-term appointments involving head or assistant coaching responsibilities shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.
(c)	If the position is being used to fill a leave of absence pursuant to Article 19, Section A, or to replace an individual on an acting or interim appointment in a higher range within the bargaining unit under Article 12, Section I, Subd. 2. (a) a fixed-term appointment may extend beyond twenty-four months, but shall be limited by the length of the leave granted or the duration of the acting or interim appointment.
(d)	If there is a need to terminate the appointment prior to the appointment end date, the ASF member will be given forty-five (45) calendar days notice of such termination.
(e)	Current or future ASF Members in a probationary, permanent, or externally funded position who are assigned coaching duties will not be involuntarily converted to fixed term status. For positions involving head or assistant coaching responsibilities, ASF Members may only be assigned fixed term assignments under this subdivision if the coaching duties are at least fifteen percent (15%) of the position duties.
Subd. 2. Externally Funded.
(a)	An externally funded appointment is an appointment made to a position financed by monies from a source of funding external to the institution which may terminate such funding in a manner beyond the control of the Employer. Such appointments are not subject to the two (2) year limitation in Subd. 1.
(b)	Positions filled by an externally funded appointment do not become probationary when a portion of the funding is supplied from state money or state generated revenue. An externally funded appointment terminates when the external funding ceases, unless the university determines to continue the position when external funding ceases. An externally funded appointment does not imply that any future employment will be offered. Any ASF Member hired on an externally funded appointment who subsequently becomes fully funded by state appropriated monies in the same position shall be converted to a fixed term or a probationary appointment. The probationary period for ASF Member(s) moved from externally funded positions to probationary status as a result of this subdivision shall be governed by Subd. 3c.
(c)	Any ASF Member hired on probationary status shall not be involuntarily changed to externally funded status.
(d)	Non-Renewal and Personnel Reduction. Any ASF Member with an externally funded appointment with four years or less of service may be non-renewed at the end of his/her appointment. Such non-renewal shall not require just cause, but shall require ninety (90) calendar days advance written notice. The decision of the president to non-renew an externally funded ASF Member shall not be subject to the arbitration step of the grievance procedure. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article
10
22,	ASF members with externally funded appointing rits with more than four years of service shall receive written notice of personnel reduction one hundred eighty calendar days (180) in advance of termination. Fer purposes of this paragraph, a personnel reduction shall not include the eliminatio 11 of externally funded positions due to cessation or reduction of external funding.
(e)	Discipline. Any ASF Member with an externally funded appointment shall be subject to discipline only in accordance with the “ji: st cause” provisions set forth in Article 23.
Subd. 3. Probationary.
(a)	Definition. A probationary appointment means tha I: the individual holding such an appointment is being evaluated for purposes of det ^rmining whether or not he/she will be offered an appointment with permanent stat us.
(b)	Length. The total period of probationary servic e, prior to the acquisition of permanent status, shall be four (4) consecutive appo ntment years of service within a university. For purposes of this Article, an appointment year is defined as service during a period starting from July 1 through June 30 annually that is at least one-half time (.5 FTE) for nine (9) to twelve (12) months.
(c)	Computation. The event that an ASF Member is on a fixed-term or externally funded appointment, and is appointed to a probationary posi lion within the bargaining unit at the same university, the ASF Member involved sh ill receive one (1) appointment year of credit toward permanent status for each app ointment year of service up to a maximum of three (3), but in such case shall serve a minimum of one (1) appointment year probationary status in that position. Notwithstanding the above, prior service in the classified service, if such service is in the ASF Member's current position, shall be counted toward completing the probationary period up to a maximum of three (3) appointment years.
Probationary ASF Members who are assigned to a different position within the bargaining unit shall complete their probationary pe riod in the new position or serve a one (1) year probationary period, whichever is greater.
(d)	Dismissal. Dismissal shall only be for just cause.
(e)	Non-Renewal. A probationary ASF Member may be non-renewed at the end of his/her appointment year. Such a non-renewal shall not require just cause. Non-renewal prior to the completion of the probationary period shall require a three (3) month written notice by April 1 to be effective on June 30 for ASF Members in the first appointment year of probation. If the ASI Member's first appointment is less than nine (9) months, written notice of non-rene wal shall be given by May 31 to be effective on June 30. If notice of non-renewal is given during the second, third, or
11
fourth year, written notice shall be given by January 31 to be effective on June 30. Nothing contained herein modifies the computation of service applied to probation under (b) and (c) above. The decision of the President to non-renew a probationary ASF Member shall not be subject to the arbitration step of the grievance procedure. A probationary ASF Member who is in the final appointment year and has passed the January 31 notice date without receiving a notice of non-renewal remains on a probationary appointment through June 30 of that year.
(f)	Evaluation. Probationary ASF Members shall be provided an annual, written performance evaluation based on job performance as established by each campus. Job performance deficiencies noted in this evaluation are to be addressed in a plan for performance improvement developed by the supervisor after consultation with the ASF Member.
(g)	Special Probation. Permanent ASF Members who have been assigned to a different position within the bargaining unit (except if assigned to an interim/acting position) after they have attained permanent status shall be subject to a probationary period of 395 calendar days beginning on the first day of the appointment in the new position. If an ASF Member does not successfully complete this special probationary period, he/she shall be provided thirty (30) calendar days advance notice as described below, and then be returned to his/her immediately preceding status, without access to the grievance procedure. The advance notice may be provided up to the end of the 365th calendar day of this special probationary period.
Subd. 4. Permanent Status. An appointment with permanent status is an appointment granted by the Employer upon successful completion of the probationary period specified in Subd. 3 above. Appointments with permanent status are for an indefinite time period and individuals holding such appointments continue in employment status within the university, but not in any particular position, unless terminated under the provisions of either Article 23, Dismissal, Suspension, and Disciplinary Demotion, or Article 22, Layoff.
Subd. 5. Position Requirements. All MSUAASF position appointments of greater than six (6) months duration require minimum qualifications of a Bachelor’s degree/appropriate professional certification, or an equivalent combination of education and experience. The six month period may be extended by an additional six (6) months if the Employer notifies the Campus Association in writing that the Employer has experienced a failed search with respect to the affected position. ASF Members employed prior to July 1,1999, shall not be discharged or demoted based upon this provision.
Section B. Current ASF Members. ASF Members whose initial appointment with a university in a position in the bargaining unit commenced prior to March 5,1976, shall be subject to the following provisions:

An ASF M lumber may elect to return to a position in that academic program in which he/she holds tenure if said ASF Member is eligible to claim a position pursuant to the contract provisi ons of the Agreement covering ASF Members in that academic program. If, however, such reassignment requires the termination of an ASF Member in the academic program wl o has less seniority, the effective date of the ASF Member’s reassignment shall be deferred u ritil a vacancy exists or until the end of the next subsequent academic year, whichever is earl er. In the interim period prior to reassignment, the Employer may assign the ASF Member tc another administrative position at the university at a comparable salary level. An ASF Member who has earned or earns tenure may also hold permanent status under the provision!! of this Article.
Section C. Notification of Appointment. Each ASF member v ill be notified in writing at the beginning of each fiscal year of his/her salary, salary range, title, type of appointment, starting and ending dates of the appointment, full or part-time status (if part-time, percentage of full-time will be shown), probationary months worked, if any, payment option, soft n :.oney designation, and any other relevant special conditions of employment, if any, such as “live-in” requirements and applicable rental charges for residence hall staff.

Section A. Base Pay Rates. The following base pay rates will apply:
Subd. 1. FLSA Exempt ASF Members. The salary ranges, and annual base salaries set within those ranges, are for the full fiscal year (July 1 - Jun ? 30), and shall not be added to or subtracted from to reflect fluctuations in the number of work days (260, 261, 262) in a given year. Any appointment of less than twelve (12) month: i; shall have the base salary prorated based on the FTE of the appointment, as determined by that portion of the actual duty days worked in a given fiscal year (e.g., 260, 261, or 2C2 as appropriate). Any other appointment of less than full time shall have the base salary pro-rated based on the FTE of the appointment, as defined in Article 11, Section D.
13
Subd. 2. FLSA Non-Exempt ASF Members. The salaries indicated on the salary schedule are based on full time employment for a 40-hour work week over twelve (12) months. Any appointment of less than twelve (12) months shall have the base salary pro-rated based on the FTE of the appointment, as determined by the portion of the actual duty days worked in a given fiscal year (e.g., 260,261, or 262 as appropriate). Any other appointment of less than full time shall have the base salary pro-rated based on the FTE of the appointment, as defined in Article 11, Section D. Variations in an ASF Members actual hours worked will be compensated as provided in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and this Article.
Section B. Work Schedule. The Employer and the Association endorse the principle that non-traditional working patterns may provide the best means for the discharge of professional responsibilities. In such context, the Employer agrees that schedule adjustments as approved by the President or his/her designee shall be made to adjust for unique requirements of the ASF Member’s assignment. Additionally, the Employer and the Association agree to the following concepts regarding schedule adjustments:
Subd. 1. ASF Members hold professional positions within the Association, and are responsible for accomplishing the necessary work reasonably expected of the positions.
Subd. 2. The Association and the Employer agree that programs, departments and service areas of the universities need to operate for determined hours and to provide determined services to the clientele of the universities.
Subd. 3. Work Schedules for FLSA Exempt ASF Members.
(a)	Within each program, department or service area, ASF Members as assigned may work in excess of their normal bi-weekly work period to meet peak work demands. These peak demands may be considered as annual recurring requirements of the position, or periodic normal requirements of the position. The Employer agrees that ASF Members shall be permitted to schedule flexible work schedules to offset these peak work periods.
(b)	It is also understood by the Association and the Employer that the flexible work schedules will be implemented following the peak work periods and approved in advance by the appropriate manager or supervisor. The Employer agrees that administrators, managers and supervisors shall make a reasonable attempt to honor requests for these applications, dependent upon staffing and project needs. Such requests, where honored, must be completed within the biennium.
(c)	The Association and the Employer agree that the time management understanding outlined herein does not entitle any ASF Member to an hour for hour offset for time worked in excess of their normal bi-weekly work period.
(d)	The Association and the Employer agree that the application of these procedures
14
shall be on a request by request basis and shall not result in the establishment of formal or informal compensatory time banks.
Subd. 4. Work Schedules for FLSA Non-Exempt ASF Members.
(a)	The normal work period for full time FLSA non-exempt ASF Members shall be forty (40) hours of work during seven (7) consecutive days. A university may use other work schedules permitted by the FLSA, and shall notify the affected ASF Members when those other work periods are in effect. Tours worked in excess of the maximum number of hours permitted in each app icable work period are overtime hours. All paid vacation time, paid holidays, paid si ck leave, paid compensatory time off, and other paid leaves of absence shall not be considered “time worked” for overtime compensation purposes. All overtime work requires prior approval by the supervisor.
(b)	Balancing Hours Within a Work Period. By m .tual agreement, an FLSA nonexempt ASF Member and the immediate supervise r may adjust hours during a work period.
Section C. Fair Labor Standards Act. No provision of this Agreement shall abridge, violate or diminish rights of ASF Members as guaranteed by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Section D. Part-Time Scheduling. Subject to Section B of this Article, the Employer and the Association endorse the principle that less than full time equivalent ("FTE”) positions shall, within reason, be expected to work a biweekly work period that equates to an eighty (80) hour work period multiplied by the position’s FTE. (e.g. 80 hours @.75 = 60 hrs).
It is further understood by both parties that ASF Members assigned to less than a FTE position may be required, during the peak work periods, to exceed their normal biweekly work period. FLSA nonexempt ASF Members who work a part-time schedule will earn overtime for hours worked in excess of forty (40) in a work week.
The Employer agrees to review any ASF position that is less than one (1) FTE if the Association can demonstrate that the position has regularly been required to work a work period that substantially exceeds the normal work period as defined above, and adjust the '.-TE of the respective position as deemed appropriate by the Employer.

Subd. 1. Eligibility for Compensatory Time. Only ASI Members who are non-exempt under the FLSA are eligible to accrue compensatory time in lieu of cash overtime.
Subd. 2. Accrual of Compensatory Time. By mutual agreement between the eligible ASF Member and that individual’s supervisor, overtime hours worked may be accrued as compensatory time in lieu of cash overtime. Overtime hours worked that are accrued as
15
compensatory time will be credited at the rate of time and one half. In the absence of an agreement to credit overtime hours worked as compensatory time, the overtime hours shall be compensated in cash at a rate of 1.5 times the individual’s regular rate of pay.
Subd. 3. Limit on Accrual of Compensatory T ime. The maximum amount of hours that may be accrued as compensatory time at any given time is two hundred and forty (240) hours. All overtime hours worked over this maximum will be compensated in cash.
Subd. 4. Scheduling Compensatory Time. An eligible ASF Member, who has accrued compensatory time and requested use of this compensatory time, shall be permitted to use such time off within a reasonable period after making the request, if such request does not unduly disrupt the operations of the university. Nonetheless, the university may require an ASF Member to use accrued compensatory time by providing reasonable advance notice to the ASF Member prior to the scheduled time off.
Subd. 5. Liquidation of Compensatory Time.
(a)	Payments for all or a portion of an ASF Member’s compensatory time may be made at anytime and shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the ASF Member at the time the employee receives such payment.
(b)	Upon termination of employment, the individual shall be paid for unused compensatory time at a rate of compensation as provided in 29 C.F.R.. 553.27(b).
(c)	If for any other reason (including, but not limited to, movement to a FLSA exempt position or layoff) an ASF Member becomes ineligible for compensatory time under this collective bargaining agreement, the ASF Member’s unused compensatory time shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee in the individual’s last ASF FLSA non-exempt position. Further, if an eligible ASF Member moves for any reason to the jurisdiction of another Appointing Authority, the ASF Member’s unused compensatory time shall be paid at the last rate earned by the employee at the sending university.

Positions in this category also are accoun able for determining overall objectives, priorities, and policies within a program area. Higher level positions in this category handle significant and involved relationships with governmental leadership. Incumbents of these positions have the authority to exercise disci /tionary powers on a regular basis," and
2.	The position creates or formulates, influences or manages policy or directs the enterprise, and
3.	The position is responsible for making key operating decisions h: gh up in the enterprise on an on-going basis, or specifically delegates them to others responsible to the position, and

Assignment of Duties from Another Unit
Employees of the unit represented by IFO or by MSUAASF, administrator and excluded professional unit, or the excluded, may be assigned duties that would normally be assigned to employees in another unit. If the non-primary unit assigned duties exceed forty-nine percent (49%) of the position duties, then the position shall be reviewed by the two units involved and the Chancellor’s Office representative to determine whether duties should be removed or percentages assigned reduced, or whether it should be placed in another unit.
As position duties get close to the forty-nine percent (49%) limit, a position will be re-evaluated to make sure that the position is assigned to the appropriate bargaining unit.
Every position must specifically state at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the duties that would place the position within a single bargaining unit.
No Waiver
None of the parties to this Agreement have in any way waived the right to request unit clarification or other action from the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services on any single position or positions to which the agreed-upon criteria is applied. Each party expressly reserves the right to challenge factual determinations relative to these criteria.
In Witness Thereof the Parties have set their Hands this day of, 1992.
