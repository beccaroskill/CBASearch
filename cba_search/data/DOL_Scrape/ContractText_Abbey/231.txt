4.	a. Before the Company finally decides to contract out an item of work as to which it claims the right to contract out, the Union committee members will be notified. Such notice will be given in advance of the final decision to contract out the work except where, in the Company’s judgment, emergency situations or emergencies related to customer requirements prevent such timely notice. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be sufficient to advise the Union members of the committee of the location, type, scope, duration, and timetable of the work to be performed, and the name of the contractor expected to perform the work, so that the Union members of the committee can adequately form an opinion as to the reasons for such contracting out.

Except in emergency situations or emergencies related to customer requirements, such discussions, if requested, shall take place before any final decision is made as to whether or not such work will be contracted out. Should the committee resolve the matter, such resolution shall be final and binding, provided that the location, type, scope, duration, and timetable of the work to be performed, or the conditions related to the reasonable factors as defined in Paragraph 6 of this Article II, Section N have not changed in a meaningful fashion, Should a discussion be held and the matter not be resolved, thenin all cases, except those involving emergency situations or emergencies related to customer requirements that are thirty (30) or less days in duration, the matter may be appealed by the Union directly to expedited arbitration as outlined in Paragraph 5 below.

No employee may file a grievance to claim that any job description or job classification is incorrect or that a different rate of pay should have been established for any occupation that is not changed during the term of this Agreement.
2.	The Company, at its discretion, from time to time may establish new occupations or change the job requirements of an existing occupation with respect to any or all of the job classification factors. The Manual shall be used to determine whether the classification of any occupation should be changed because of changes which may be prescribed by the Company during the term of this Agreement in the job requirements of any occupation, to establish the proper classification of any occupation so changed, and to establish the proper classification of any new production or maintenance occupations which may be established by the Company during the term of this Agreement.
3.	If a new or changed job description and job classification for a new or changed occupation has been prepared, as provided in the Manual, a copy of the new or changed job description and classification will be furnished promptly to the Union and will be posted in the department where the occupation is or is to be performed. However, before such posting, the proposed change will be discussed with the Chairman of the Job Evaluation Committee for the plant where the occupation is performed. Should the Chairman of
B-41
V, H
the Job Evaluation Committee for the plant where the occupation is performed believe further discussion to be necessary, such chairman may file a written request with the Company for a meeting to be held within five (5) calendar days after receipt of such request. Any such meeting must be held within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of such posting, or if no employee is permanently classified on and performing the primary function of such occupation on the date of such posting, then within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date the first employee is permanently classified on and performing the primary function of the occupation. Any employee then working in such occupation, with the approval of the Union, may, at any time within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of such posting, file a grievance alleging that the job is improperly described and/or classified under the Manual and stating in particular in what respect the job description is claimed to be incorrect and/or the factors which are alleged to be improperly classified and the classification which the. employee contends should be assigned for such factors. If no employee is permanently classified on and performing the primary function of such occupation on the date of such posting, then the grievance may be filed within ninety (90) calendar days from the date the first employee is permanently classified on and performing the primary function of the occupation. When a new or changed job description and job classification has been prepared in accordance with this Paragraph 3, the Company will provide written notice to the Union of the date when the first employee is permanently classified on and performing the primary function of the occupation. Such,grievance shall be processed commencing in Step 3 of the grievance procedure prescribed by Article IX of this Agreement and may be appealed to arbitration in accordance with the further provisions of said Article IX.
V, H
B-42
If a grievance concerning a job description or job classification is appealed to arbitration, the,issue before the arbitrator shall be limited to the portions of the job description or the factors in the job classification specified in the grievance. The Company has the sole right to determine what duties shall be included in each occupation, in case of a grievance concerning a job description, the arbitrator’s sole function shall be to determine whether the job description correctly describes the job in accordance with the principles set forth in Section III of the Manual and, if necessary, to order that the Company prepare a new and correct job description in accordance with such principles. In case of a grievance concerning a job classification, the arbitrator shall determine whether the job has been placed at the proper level or degree in each of the job classification factors alleged in the grievance to be improper and. if not, to determine the correct level or degree at which the job should be placed as to such factors in accordance with the Manual and to order that the job be reclassified, if necessary, in accordance with the Manual. If the arbitrator orders a correction of such job description or of such job classification to comply with the Manual, his decision shall be effective as of the date when the new occupation was established or the change or changes in the occupation were made, and corresponding adjustments in pay shall be made for all employees who have worked on the occupation since that date.
If no grievance is filed within the time provided following the posting of such new or changed job description and/or classification, or if such a grievance is not appealed to arbitration within the time provided, thejob description and job classification as prepared .by the Company shall be deemed to be correct.
4.	If the Company prescribes changes in any occupation which, in the opinion of the Company,
B-43	V, H
do not require a change in the job classification under the Manual, it will post in the department wherein such occupation is performed a copy of the memorandum which has been prepared concerning such changes and also send to the Union a copy of the memorandum. The failure of any employee then employed on the occupation to file a grievance in accordance with Paragraph 5 of this Section, upon the making of the changes described in such memorandum, shall not constitute the acceptance of the Company's evaluation of the extent of the change, and at any later time when further changes are made in the occupation, the effect of any such prior changes which have not theretofore been the subject of a request for review or grievance may be brought into question. If the cumulative effect of such changes in the occupation is such as to require a change in the job classification under the Manual, and the Company fails to do so, a grievance may be filed in accordance with Paragraph 5 of this Section following the latest change which the employee believes has resulted, cumulatively, in a change of the occupation to the extent that a change in the job classification is required under the Manual.
5.	If the Company does not prepare a changed job description and job classification for an occupation which has been changed, and any employee then classified in the occupation believes that a changed job description and job classification are required under the Manual, any such employee, with the approval of the Union, may, at any time within ninety (90) calendar days from the date when such changes in the occupation are alleged to have occurred, file a grievance requesting that a changed job description and/or job classification be established in accordance with the Manual. Such grievance shall be processed as prescribed in Paragraph 3 of this Section. Any changed job classification resulting from such
V, H
B-44
procedure shall be effective as of the date when the change in the occupation occurred, and corresponding adjustments in pay shall be made for all employees who have worked on the occupation since that date.
6.	For trade and craft jobs as defined in the Manual, different job classes are prescribed for each job or training grade and are set forth on the tables marked Appendix B and attached to this Agreement. Training schedules may also be established for nontrade and craft jobs in accordance with the Manual, Employees shall be assigned to the lower grades and shall thereafter advance to the higher grades in accordance with the Manual. The advancement of the employee to the higher grade shall be effective at the start of the next pay period after the employee has qualified for advancement.
7.	The term “Trainee”, in this Paragraph 7 and in the following numbered Paragraphs 8 through 12, applies to non-trade and craft jobs only. If a Trainee is not advanced at the end of any training period of five hundred twenty (520) hours, the Company will explain to the Trainee the reasons why such advancement was withheld and will offer further assistance in training to qualify for the next higher grade. If such Trainee believes that he is qualified, he may file a grievance claiming that he is qualified for such advancement. Such grievance may be filed at any time after the end of a training period of five hundred twenty (520) hours. If the grievance is granted, the advancement shall be effective as of the date of filing the grievance. If the grievance is not granted, then no other grievance so alleging may be filed until the end of the next five hundred twenty (520)-hour training period. No employee shall have more than one (1) such grievance pending at one time.
8.	A Trainee working at a job where an individual
B-45
V, H
type incentive applies may request that he be placed on a full incentive basis and will be so placed when, in the judgment of his supervisor, he is capable of performing the work in a satisfactory manner at an incentive pace. When so placed, his earnings will be calculated on his production according to the incentive plan and the hourly rate of the full job class of the job will apply as the minimum guaranteed rate. If the Trainee fails to earn more than the minimum guarantee over any reasonable test period (whether immediately following his placement on an incentive basis of pay or at any time thereafter), he shall then be returned to a non-incentive basis of pay for the training grade to which he is entitled by his total training hours and demonstrated ability. When a Trainee has been so returned to a non-incentive basis of pay, the Company shall thereafter decide at what time the Trainee may be again placed on a full incentive basis. If the Trainee is so placed and again should fail to earn more than the minimum guarantee, then he shall be returned again to the non-incentive basis of pay lor the training grade to which he is entitled.
9.	When a Trainee who has been placed on an individual incentive basis of pay performs any non-incentive work, he will be paid for any hours so worked at the hourly rate of the full job class of the job, unless and until he is taken off the incentive basis of pay in accordance with Paragraph 8 above.
10.	A Trainee working at a job where the employees in the full job class are participants in a group-type incentive plan shall be considered as an extra employee not charged to the incentive group nor participating in the incentive earnings and shall be paid at the applicable Trainee hourly rate.
11.	When it is determined by his supervisor that he can make a reasonable contribution to
V, H
B-46
the performance of the group, he shall thereafter participate fully in the group incentive plan;and the minimum guarantee of the full job class shall apply; and when such incentive group, including the Trainee, works at hourly (non-incentive) rate, the Trainee shall be paid at the rate of the full job.
12.	If the Trainee leaves the incentive group, either because he is not needed to fill the crew or because he fails.to make a reasonable contribution to the group performance, he shall be returned to the training grade to which he is entitled.
13.	Occupations may be terminated by the Company at any time when no hours of work have been performed on that occupation for a year prior to the termination of that occupation. Notice of the termination of an occupation shall be given promptly to the Union.

In such cases, during the period of a temporary assignment on a non-incentive occupation or on an occupation to which a non-standard hour incentive rate is applicable, the employee will be paid for the total hours worked on the temporary assignment during each week at the higher of, either an amount equal to the hours on the temporary assignment paid at an hourly rate determined in accordance with Section M plus the cost-of-living adjustment then in effect, or an amount computed on the basis of the pay rates then applicable to the temporary assignment.

ARTICLE VI - HOURS OF WORK AND HOLIDAYS
A.	Sections B and C of this Article are intended to provide a basis for calculating overtime pay and shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week.
B.	Hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day or in excess of a total of forty (40) hours in a work week shall be paid for at one and one half (1-1/2) times the normal rate of pay. Overtime payment shall be made on the basis of either daily or weekly overtime hours worked, but an employee shall not be paid both daily and weekly overtime for the same overtime hours worked.
C.	The Company agrees to use a normal work schedule as far as possible of five (5) consecutive eight (8)-hour days, Mondays through Fridays, for a total of forty (40) hours per week. It is understood that this provision shall not apply to plants, departments, or employees who are engaged in continuous operations or who are required to work different schedules because of production or operation requirements.
Should the Company find it necessary to establish schedules departing from the normal work week, the Grievance Committee of the plant if an entire plant is involved or a Steward of any affected department if less than an entire plant is involved and representatives of management of the plant, may, at the request of either party, confer to determine whether, based upon the facts of the situation, satisfactorily modified schedules can be arranged, but the right to arrange working schedules rests with the Company; provided, however, that such right of the Company shall not preclude further negotiations between the Local Union President, the Local Plant Grievance Committee, and the Company in an attempt to arrive at more
VI
B-63
satisfactorily modified schedules upon written request for such meeting addressed to the Superintendent of Industrial Relations in the plant affected.
Determination of the starting time of the daily and weekly work schedules shall be made by the Company and such schedules may be changed by the Company from time to time; provided, however, that indiscriminate changes shall not be made in such schedules and provided, further, that changes deemed necessary by the Company shall be made known to the affected representatives of the Union in the plant as far in advance of such changes as is possible.
D.	In any department or a portion of a department scheduled on a two (2) or one (1) shift per day basis, management may, at its discretion, establish a work schedule calling for eight (8) hours of work per day interrupted by a one-half (1/2) hour lunch period.
E.	Employees who are regularly scheduled or who are notified to report and who do report for work at the scheduled starting time shall be paid for four (4) hours’ work in the event they are advised by their supervisor that there is no work available, and employees who are scheduled and report and actually begin work at the start of a turn shall be paid for a minimum of four (4) hours’ work.
In all cases of emergency where employees are called in after completing a normal day's work or when called in on their regularly scheduled days off, such employees shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours’ pay for such call-in, regardless of length of time worked.
All such payments shall be at the occupational rate of the occupation at which they were scheduled
B-64
VI, C
or for which they were notified to report. In the event the occupation for which the employees have reported for work or at which they have worked is regularly paid on an incentive basis, the regular pay shall be based on average hourly earnings for the turn or pay period or the guaranteed occupation rate, whichever is the greater. In the event any employee accepts other work, he shall be paid for the time worked at the prevailing rate or rales paid for the work performed. In the event strikes or work stoppages in connection with labor disputes shall interfere with work being provided, the provisions of Section E do not apply.
F.	Active employees will receive pay for holidays in accordance with the following provisions;
1.	The following days, or days observed in lieu thereof, shall be considered holidays: New Year’s Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving Day, December 24,. and Christmas Day. When a holiday falls on any day of the week but Sunday, the holiday shall be observed on such day only. When a holiday falls on Sunday, the holiday will be observed on the following Monday and Monday only will be the day for which holiday pay will be paid, except that in the event that December 24 falls on Sunday, it will be observed on Sunday. There will be five (5) additional holidays during the term of this Agreement. The holidays shall be December 26, 2012, December 23, 2013, December 26, 2014, December 23, 2015, and December 23, 2016.
2.	Employees will be paid holiday pay of eight (8) hours, computed as hereinafter stated for each of said holidays, except as follows:
a.	An employee who has been scheduled or notified that he is required to work on a holiday and
VI, F
B-65
then does not work, will receive no pay for that day.
b.	An employee who is absent from work for any reason other than vacation, paid jury service, paid witness service, paid funeral leave, paid military leave, or hospitalization on a regularly scheduled work day immediately preceding or following a holiday, will not receive holiday pay unless he was scheduled to work on a holiday and did work on such holiday. It is agreed that a voluntary extra day on which an employee agreed to work shall not be regarded as a scheduled work day. Any employee who is absent from work the day before or the day after a holiday with the prior knowledge and approval of his supervisor because of an industrial injury sustained in the course of employment with the Company, shall not be regarded as scheduled on any such day.
Holiday pay shall be computed on the basis of the employee's average straight-time hourly earnings determined in accordance with Section M of Article V.
3.	Employees who work on a holiday will be paid at the employee's regular rate of pay plus one haff (1/2) in addition to pay provided in Paragraph 2 above. Payment for hours worked under this Paragraph will not be duplicated by payment under Section B of this Article.
G.	For the purpose of calculating overtime for work performed on the sixth or seventh days of a regularly scheduled work week, holidays shall be considered as days worked whether worked or not and regardless of whether they are scheduled as days of work or days of rest provided, however, that:
1.	Any employee who has been scheduled or notified that, he is required to work on a holiday and
B-66
VI, F
does not work, shall not have the holiday counted as a day worked for the purposes of this Section H.

ARTICLE VIII - SENIORITY
A. 1. Seniority shall be deemed to consist ol rights based on length of service, of transfer, retrogression, layoff, recall,, and shift or schedule selection as specified in this Article. The rights, based upon seniority, shall not cover any other advantages, including, but not limited to work assignments within an occupation, machine selection, equipment selection, employment during temporary reductions of work, or employment for overtime work, but the foregoing shall not preclude any employee from requesting any such advantages from his supervisor with the express understanding that the supervisor’s rejection of any such request shall not be arbitrable under Article IX.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the following shall apply when the Company determines that a permanent vacancy exists in an occupation covered by multiple incentive plans; or when the Company determines that,there is a need for an additional employee in 1) the manning of an incentive plan on a shift or schedule in the Steel Plants or 2). a work assignment listed in Appendix E on a shift or schedule in the Bearing Plants, but not in the occupation. When there is a need, as determined by the Company, to fill a permanent need pursuant to this Paragraph, the Company will offer the assignment to all other employees in the same occupation, same shift and schedule, in order of continuous service. The employee placed on the incentive plan will participate when he is fully qualified.
B-72
VIII, A
2.	Unless otherwise expressly stated in this Article, the relative rights of different employees based on seniority as herein provided shall hereafter be determined by their respective lengths of continuous service in each plant, as hereinafter defined, computed in accordance with Section K of triis Article; and the terms “seniority", “length of service", and “continuous service”, wherever used,in this Article VIII, shall be so construed.
3.	Whenever used in this Basic Labor. Agreement, the terms “job" and “occupation” will be considered to have the same meaning.
4.	For a period of fifteen (15) calendar days after the 15th days of November and May in the years in which this Agreement is .in effect, each employee on each occupation may file written application for assignment to a different shift or shifts on such occupation other than the shift on which the employee is working. The application for assignment to a different shift or shifts on such occupation shall remain in effect so long as the employee remains on such occupation but no longer than the term of this Agreement. The employee’s name will be removed from the shift preference list if the employee is transferred or retrogressed fronf such occupation or for any other reason no longer holds such occupation. The employee shall have the right, however, to change his application in accordance with the terms of this Paragraph 4. Any employee who is transferred, retrogressed, or recalled into the occupation or who is involuntarily assigned to a different shift after such fifteen (15)-day period or who is absent from work because of vacation, physical disability or force reduction during all of such fifteen (15)-day period, may file his application within fifteen (15) days after his transfer, retrogression; recall, shift assignment, or return to work. When a new shift is created by the Company, the Company will fill the
VIII, A
B-73
vacancies on the new shift by first canvassing, on the basis of continuous service, the> employees in the occupation for which a new shift is being created. Thereafter, for a period of fifteen (15) days after the filling of all of such vacancies, all other employees who have not been placed on such shift may file their respective applications indicating preference for assignment to the new shift. When a new schedule is created by the Company, the Company will fill the vacancies on the new schedule by first canvassing, on the basis of continuous service, .the employees in the occupation on the shift on which the new schedule is being created. Thereafter, for a period of fifteen (15) days after the filling of all of such vacancies, all other employees who have not been placed on such schedule may file their respective applications indicating preference for assignment to the new schedule. Each employee shall be given a copy of any such application filed. At the end of such fifteen (15)-day periods, the names of the employees who have applied for shift assignment will be arranged on the basis of continuous service on a shift preference list for each shift on each occupation to be maintained in the department. It is understood, however, that the name of any employee who is transferred into an occupation shall, for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer, be placed at the bottom of the shift preference list. Following such period, the name of the employee shall be immediately arranged on the shift preference list on the basis of continuous service. Thereafter as vacancies occur on shifts whenever practical in the judgment of the Company, the vacancies will be offered to employees in the same occupation in the order that their names appear on the shift preference list prior to filling such vacancies under the provisions of Section E of this Article. An employee may at any time request that his name be removed from any such list; Any active employee who is absent on the day such shift vacancy would
B-74
VIII, A
be ottered to him shall be deemed to have accepted assignment to the shift ottered and shall be assigned to such shift on his return to work. In the case of occupations for which there are rotating or other work schedules in lieu of or in addition to stationary shifts, employees may request assignment from or to such work schedules in the same manner as heretofore described. For the purpose of this Paragraph, an occupation shall be considered to be an occupation for which there is a separate job description and differences in the daily starting time and/or daily lunch period for employees classified on a given occupation shall not constitute a different schedule. Id cases where the Company determines that there is a need for additional employees on any shift but not in the occupation, and no one in the occupation has requested assignment to such shift, the Company will assign the most junior employee from another shift to such shift, unless another employee, on’the same shift as the most junior employee, has requested the shift assignment, in which event, the shift assignment may be offered to the more senior employee. The provisions in this Paragraph 4 shall not apply to any movement of employees on shifts or schedules on those occupations into which employees are retrogressing. The Company may assign an employee to fill a need on a shift or schedule for not longer than one hundred eighty (180) working days within a twelve (12)-month period, after which the vacancy will be filled as specified in Paragraph 4 of Article VIII, Section A. The foregoing sentence shall not apply when the shift or schedule need is created by a vacation, injury, illness, leave of absence, or any projects or special conditions and the Company does not anticipate that such heed will culminate in a shift or schedule vacancy.
5.	An employee who is absent due to physical disability for more than one (1) calendar year and
VIII, A
B-75
thereafter returns to work with unbroken continuous service will be returned to the.occupation on which he was working at the time of layoff, provided his continuous service is sufficient to permit him to hold on such occupation, displacing that employee classified on such occupation with the least continuous service. In the event that the returning employee’s continuous service is not sufficient to permit him to hold on such occupation, he will be assigned to another occupation in the same job class in the line of occupations if he has more seniority than any other employee on any such occupation, displacing that employee in that job class with the least continuous service; or, in the event his continuous service is not sufficient to hold on any such occupation in the same job class, he will retrogress to an occupation in the next lower job class where his continuous service is sufficient to permit him to hold, displacing the employee with the least continuous service on any occupation in that job class.

The Company retains the right, however, to determine the number of employees who are required in any occupation, shift, or crew; and notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the events specified above, the Company may elect not to replace the employee who is vacating the occupation, shift, or crew if it determines that a reduced number of employees in that occupation, shift, or crew is sufficient to perform the available work for that occupation, shift, or crew.
5.	Any vacancy which is not a permanent vacancy as defined above shall be considered a temporary
B-86
VIII, D
vacancy and may be filled by the Company by any means at its discretion. However, if there are employees retrogressed from the occupation in which the temporary vacancy occurs, the Company will, whenever practical in the judgment of the Company, first offer to fill the.temporary vacancy, on the basis of seniority, from the employees retrogressed from the occupation in which the temporary vacancy occurs.
6.	A temporary vacancy which has been filled by assignment of employees on a temporary basis for longer than one hundred eighty (180) working days within a twelve (12)-month period shall be considered a permanent vacancy unless the need to fill such temporary vacancy continues longer than the above defined one hundred eighty (180) working days because of an injury, Illness, leave of absence, or any projects or special conditions and the Company does not anticipate that such temporary vacancy will culminate in a permanent vacancy.
E.	Subject to the provisions of Section A of this Article, all permanent vacancies in any occupation covered by this Agreement will be filled in the following manner:
1.	Recall to an occupation in accordance with Section H, Paragraph 1, of this Article.
2.

In all cases, employees in the
VIII, E
B-87
Security Pool or a laid off employee will be offered such a vacancy only if he has the apparent ability to do the work and is not forbidden by law to do the work.
3.	If not filled by either of the foregoing, at the Company’s option, by assigning any employee from any occupation who is willing to transfer; provided, however, that before a vacancy is otherwise filled under this Section E, Paragraph 3, it shall first be offered to the senior employee who is on the list of employees who requested transfer to the permanent vacancy but who is not eligible to transfer under the provisions of Section F, Paragraph 3, of this Article. In all cases, an employee on such list shall only be eligible for such an offer if he has the apparent ability to perform the occupation as provided in Section F, Paragraph 3. In determining apparent ability for the purpose of this Section E, Paragraph 3, Subparagraph (1 > of Section F, Paragraph 3 shall not be considered as a necessary element of apparent ability.
4.	Recall in accordance with Section H, Paragraph 2, of this Article.
5.	Any permanent vacancy not filled according to Article VIII, Section E, Paragraph 1, 2, 3, or 4, shall be filled by requesting transfer to another plant in accordance with the provision of Article VIII, Section F, provided that if there are any employees in the Security Pool or laid off employees described in Section H, Paragraph 2, of this Article who have greater length of continuous service in the plant than any active employee who has requested a transfer into the permanent vacancy under Section F of this Article, the vacancy will first be offered to such employees in the order of their continuous service. In all cases, employees in the Security Pool or a laid off employee will be offered such a vacancy only if he has the apparent ability to do the work and is not forbidden
B-88
VIII, E
by law to do the work.
6.	Hiring of new employees, provided that before hiring of new employees, all laid off employees from all plants, with the apparent ability to do the work, shall be given at least one (1) opportunity to be recalled.
F.	The following procedures will be followed to enable active employees to request a transfer into a permanent vacancy in an occupation in accordance with Section E, Paragraph 2, of this Article.
1.	Notice of any permanent vacancy in an occupation except pool occupations in Labor Grades 1, 2, and 3 will be posted in the plant where the vacancy occurs for a period of seventy-two (72) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and such Holidays as prescribed in Article VI.G.) beginning at 12 midnight.
2.	Any employee desiring to be considered for ■ transfer into the vacancy may apply by obtaining a Request for Transfer Form from his supervisor or the Associate Services Department and filing such request with his supervisor or the Associate Services Department within such seventy-two (72)-hour posting period.
3.	To be eligible for transfer, the employee (a) must have completed his probationary period, (b) must have completed the required periods of time specified in Paragraph 13 of this Section F, (c) must have the apparent ability to do the work of the occupation to which he is requesting transfer, and (d) must not be prohibited by law from doing such work, provided,
(1)	that the parties have agreed upon and initialed a list of certain occupations for which experience in a qualifying occupation on the occupation
VIII, F
B-89
chart then in effect is required. Such occupations may be referred to as “limited bid occupations”. Limited bid occupations in the Harrison, Gambrinus, and Faircrest Steel Plants, which are grouped together on Limited Bid and Qualifying Occupation Lists, may be referred to as “mutually qualifying occupations". To be eligible for transfer to a limited bid occupation, the employee must have been permanently classified on a qualifying occupation or a mutually qualifying occupation within the last five (5) years, having completed a qualification period thereon. Provided, however, in the case of a limited bid occupation which has never been filled on a permanent basis, if no employee has completed a qualification period on the qualifying occupation, any employee permanently classified on the qualifying occupation shall be regarded as having the necessary experience required on the qualifying occupation for that occupation. Any employee who has held such limited bid occupation on the list referred to above on a permanent basis within the last five (5) years, having completed a qualification period thereon, shall be regarded as having the necessary experience required on the qualifying occupation for that occupation;
(2)	if, during the term of this Agreement, a change to an occupation in existence on the effective date of this Agreement is prescribed by the Company which necessitates a revision to the Limited Bid and Qualifying Occupations List for that occupation and the revision is unsatisfactory to any employee affected thereby, it is agreed that a grievance in respect of such revision to the Limited Bid and Qualifying Occupations List may be filed in the second step of the grievance procedure as described in Article IX - Adjustment of Grievances, which grievance shall be arbitrable under said Article IX;
<3} in the case of occupations for which the successful completion of an Apprenticeship Program
B-90
VIII, F
is a prerequisite, the employee must have completed such program;
and for such limited bid occupations, the foregoing shall be considered as part of the necessary elements of apparent ability for purposes of this Article.
4.	That eligible employee requesting the transfer who has more continuous service than any other employee who has requested a transfer into that vacancy will be offered a qualification period as specified in Paragraph 13 of this Section F.
5.	The name and continuous service date of the employee who is awarded the transfer will be posted, for a period of seventy-two (72) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and such Holidays as prescribed in Article VLG.) at all locations where the notice of the permanent vacancy was posted. Any employee who requested the transfer and was not awarded the transfer may file and process a grievance, in accordance with Article IX, on the ground that he should have been awarded the transfer under the provisions hereof. Such a grievance must be filed within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of posting of the name of the employee who was awarded the transfer, and if not then filed, no claim shall thereafter be asserted by such employee based in whole or in part on the Company's failure to award him such transfer.
6.	If the employee to whom the transfer is awarded is absent from work because of vacation, temporary illness, authorized leave of absence, jury duty, or being'subpoenaed as a witness in a court of law at the time he would otherwise be scheduled to begin work in the vacancy to which he is to be transferred, such vacancy will not be permanently filled until such employee returns to work, but in no case shall it
VIII, F
B-91
remain unfilled for more than thirty (30) working days. In such interim period, the Company may fill such vacancy on a temporary basis.
7.	a. An employee who by either his own or the Company’s determination cannot satisfactorily perform the work in the occupation to which he has been transferred during the qualification period will be returned to the occupation from which he was transferred. It is understood, however, that during the first seven (7) days of the qualification period, an employee may unilaterally return to the occupation from which he transferred displacing the employee with the least continuous service who has transferred to such occupation and who has not completed a qualification period on the occupation. The displaced employee will be returned to the occupation from which heJwas transferred, in turn displacing the employee withthe least continuous service who has transferred to that occupation and who has not completed a qualification period on the occupation. In the event there is no employee who has been transferred to and has not completed a qualification period on the occupation to which an employee is being returned under this Paragraph, the returning employee will displace the employee on such occupation with the least continuous service, unless his continuous service is.not sufficient to hold in such occupation, in which event he shall retrogress or be laid off, as the case may be, in accordance with seniority.
b. An employee from one plant who has been transferred to an occupation in another plant pursuant to Article VIII, Section E, Paragraph 5, and, who, by either his own or the Company’s determination cannot satisfactorily perform the work in said occupation during the qualification period, will be returned to the;; occupation at the other plant from which he was transferred. It'is understood, however, that the first
B-92
VIII, F
seven (7) days of the qualification period shall be considered to be a transition period. During such transition period, an employee may unilaterally return to the occupation from which he transferred without the transfer limitations referred to in Section F, Paragraph 10, of this Article VIII. Any return to the other plant will be done in the same manner as that provided in Section F, Paragraph 7.a.
8.	Any employee who requests, is offered and refuses a transfer under this Section will not have any further requests for transfer considered for a period of twelve (12) months following such refusal. It is understood, however, that any refusal of transfer to a vacancy posted during a given week shall not prohibit acceptance of transfer to any other vacancy posted during the same calendar week. It is further understood that if an employee who requests transfer to a vacancy(s) which has not been awarded and subsequently requests and is awarded another vacancy, the refusal of previous transfer request(s) will not result in a twelve (12)-month refusal limitation. All refusals of transfer must be signed by the employee so refusing.
9.	Any employee will be permitted only one (1) transfer under this Section during the periods of time specified in Paragraph 13 of this Section F commencing with the date of transfer. Any employee who is transferred and then is retrogressed from the occupation into which he has been transferred, shall not have that transfer count against this limitation during the specified period.

period shall be ineligible to bid for a transfer for a period of twelve (12) months.
11.	The Company may postpone for not more than three (3) months the transfer to which an employee would otherwise be entitled if:

c.	in the judgment of the Company, the transfer of any additional employees out of such occupation would seriously impair the efficient operation of any department.
Provided, however, that the employee affected by such postponement shall have his “Transfer Limitations", as determined in accordance with the table in Paragraph 13 of this Section F, reduced by a time period equal to the duration of any such postponement. During such postponement, the vacancy to which such employee is entitled may be filled on a temporary basis.
12.	Any employee may file with the Associate Services Department a Request for Transfer to a pool occupation in Job Classes 1, 2, or 3 other than the occupation on which the employee is then permanently classified. Such requests shall be effective for a period of six (6) months after they are filed, but the employee may at any time withdraw his request. Thereafter as
B-94
VIII, F
vacancies occur on such occupations, vacancies in each such occupation will be offered to the employees who have such requests currently on file in the order of their continuous service. If any employee is absent from work for any reason on the day when a transfer under this Paragraph is available, that employee shall be bypassed until another vacancy on such occupation occurs. Requests for Transfer under this Paragraph shall be subject to all the provisions of this Section F except Paragraphs 1, 2, 5. and 6.
13.	a. The following table will be used to determine the length of qualification periods for all occupations, except trade and craft occupations as covered under Subparagraph b. below, to which an employee is hired, transfers, retrogresses, or is recalled. It will also be used to determine the minimum length of time required, commencing with the date of hire or transfer, before an employee may transfer from an occupation into which he was hired or transferred, as the case may be, in one of the following groups of job classes. Moreover, an employee who is recalled to a job, other than a pool job, pursuant to Section H, Paragraph 2, hereof, may not transfer from the occupation info which he was so recalled until he has remained on such occupation for a period of time from the date of recall equal to the applicable qualification period for said occupation set forth in the following table:

IX, I
B-125
claim, if such a grievance is appealed to arbitration by the Union, the arbitrator shall be required to have a hearing and first dispose of the single question as to the arbitrability of the grievance. If it is determined that the grievance either arose under a preceding collective bargaining agreement or is based upon an event or happening that occurred prior to the effective date of this Agreement, there shall be no further hearing in respect of such a grievance.
J.	If any employee quits while any grievance which he has filed or in which he is interested is pending hereunder, such grievance shall terminate as to such employee as of the date on which he quits, except as to any claim that any employee may have as to back pay arising out of any grievance which such an employee may have pending under Section C, Article V - Rate Establishment and Adjustment.

The parties recognize that when the Union is involved.in an organizing campaign directed at unrepresented employees, there is a risk that the campaign activities of either party may have a harmful effect upon the relationship of the parties. The parties agree that they should take appropriate steps to ensure that all organizing campaigns involving such employees are conducted in a manner free of harassment; which does not misrepresent to employees the facts and circumstances surrounding their employment and in a manner which does not demean either the Company or the Union as an organization nor their respective representatives as individuals. It is further understood and agreed by the parties that all their actions and all communications made by them or in their behalf in connection with any organizing campaign shall be fair, factual, non-coercivei free from manipulation,
XV, A
B-133
and respectful of the other party and the process of collective bargaining.
B.- In further recognition of their commitments in regard to organizing campaigns, the parties agree that except for the salaried employees of the Company’s facilities located in Stark County, Ohio, the Union may elect to use an expedited procedure for determining whether the unrepresented employees at a facility of the Company (including U.S. subsidiary operations that are owned fifty percent (50%) or more by the Company) desire to be represented by the Union. If the Union advises the Company that an organizing campaign is in progress to organize a unit of unrepresented employees and the Union has elected to proceed under the expedited procedure to resolve the issue of representation rather than under the National Labor Relations Act, the parties will meet as soon as practicable, but not more than within five (5) working days of the notification for the purpose of reaching agreement on the proper description of the unit which the Union seeks to organize, the identity of the employees in the unit, and the selection of an. arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association who shall verify the authenticity of the cards and determine whether a majority of the employees in the unit have signed union authorization cards. If the parties reach agreement on such matters, the Company agrees to provide to the Union a list of all employees in the unit within seven (7) days which provides the home address and shift or crew for each employee. In order to proceed further under the expedited procedure, the Union must present, within sixty (60) days for a unit consisting of one hundred (100) employees or less; seventy-five (75) days for a unit consisting of between one hundred and one (101) and five hundred (500) employees; and ninety (90) days for a unit consisting of five hundred and one (501) or more employees, after receipt of such list of
B-134

employees, authorization cards signed by a majority (fifty percent [50%] plus one [1]) of the employees in the unit to the arbitrator. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon the description of the bargaining unit and/or the identity of the employees in the unit, the parties agree that the arbitrator shall hear evidence from the parties, within five (5) days of the Union's notification,, and decide the issues between them based upon the principles of the National Labor Relations Act. In the event that the.arbitrator is required to resolve such an issue, the Company shall present the list of employees in the unit during the seven (7)-day period following its receipt.of the decision of the arbitrator, and the designated time period for presenting the authorization cards to the arbitrator for the determination of whether an election should be conducted shall begin on the date the list of employees is furnished to the Union.
Once the list of names, home addresses, and shift or crew has been received by the Union, the Company will permit employees from any other Company facility to occupy areas of its property near entrances and exits of the facility utilized by employees of the proposed bargaining unit three (3) days each calendar week for the purpose of distributing union literature and material and soliciting employees of the facility to sign authorization cards and vote for the Union, provided that no more than two (2) such employees from any other facilities of the Company may occupy the area at the same time. If there are multiple entrances and exits for the facility involved in the campaign, the restriction of two (2) such employees from any other facilities of the Company will be increased to a maximum of four (4), provided that no more than two (2) such employees from any other facilities of the Company are at any such entrance or exit at the same time. The Company will also permit off-duty employees from the unit sought to be organized to distribute union

literature and materials and to solicit employees to sign authorization cards and to vote for the Union at those employee entrances to its facility which are used by the employees of the unit to enter or exit the facility, provided that no more than two (2) off-duty employees of that facility may engage in such activity at any such entrance at the same time. The Company will not object to display of support by employees for the Union by the wearing of Union shirts, the wearing of Union hats in non-hard hat areas, or the display of Union buttons or stickers on the personal property of the employees. The parties agree that the activities of its employees supporting the Union and/or the activities of the employees from any other Company facilities shall not be permitted to compromise safety, disrupt ingress to or egress from a facility, or disrupt the business activities conducted at the facility. The Union agrees that neither its supporters at that facility nor employees from any other facilities of the Company will use loud speakers or similar devices on the Company property.
1. The arbitrator shall be chosen by Wie American Arbitration Association, hereinafter called the “Association" in accordance with its Election Rilles which concern the conduct of elections by the Association. If the arbitrator is unable or unwilling to agree to make the determination within five (5) days after being presented the authorization cards by the Union, a new arbitrator shall be chosen in the same manner and such procedure shall be repeated as many times as is necessary to select an arbitrator who is able and willing to make the determination within five (5) days after being presented the cards by the Union. Authorization cards to be considered valid by the arbitrator must clearly state that an employee who signs the card is designating the Union as the employee’s exclusive collective bargaining representative and must be signed during the
B-136
XV, B
designated time period immediately following the date the Company presented the Union with the list of employees. The arbitrator shall determine whether the names of the signers are on the list of employees in the bargaining unit supplied by the Company to the Union and shall compare the signatures on such authorization cards to actual employee signatures for verification. The parties expressly agree that neither the representations of the Union nor the investigation of the cards by the arbitrator shall create an obligation on the part of the Company to bargain collectively with the Union and that the authorization cards may not be presented as evidence by the Union or any third party in any proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board. If the arbitrator determines that a valid majority of the employees in the bargaining unit have signed authorization cards, the following expedited procedure shall be applicable:
a.	After receipt of the arbitrator’s determination, the parties will promptly make arrangements with the Association to conduct a secret ballot election in accordance with its Election Rules at the Company’s facility for the purpose of determining whether a majority of the voting employees in the unit desire to be represented by the Union. The election shall be held on a mutually agreeable date within the ten (10) working-day period (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) following the date of the arbitrator’s determination. The election will be scheduled to afford all unit employees a reasonable opportunity to vote during their scheduled shift, and the Company will post notices setting forth the mutually agreeable date, times, and locations of the election. The Company and Union will agree upon a releasing schedule which permits employees to vote without unreasonable interruption of the Company's operations. The Company and Union will each select an observer to assist at each election session
XV, B
B-137
and such observers shall assist in the counting of the ballots when the balloting is completed. If the Association certifies that a majority (fifty percent [50%] plus one [1]) of the voting employees have selected the Union as their representative, the Company will recognize the Union as the bargaining representative of the employees in the unit, and enter into goodfaith negotiations. If the Association certifies that the Union has not been selected as the representative of the employees in the unit by a majority of the. voting employees, there can be no subsequent recognition election conducted by the American Arbitration Association or the National Labor Relations Board in the unit for a minimum of one (1) year following the date of the certification of the Association.
b.	Within the five (5) calendar days following receipt of the arbitrator's determination, the Company will post on all bulletin boards where notices of the Company are customarily posted for the employees sought to be organized by the Union notices which read as follows:
NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES
We have been advised that the United Steelworkers, AFL-CIO, is conducting an organizing campaign to determine whether a majority of employees in (description of bargaining unit) desire to be represented by the Union as their collective bargaining agent. This is to advise you that:
1.	The Company will bargain collectively with the Steelworkers if a majority of employees choose the Union as their representative in a secret ballot election conducted by the American Arbitration Association.
2.	The choice of whether or not to be represented by the Union is yours alone to make.
B-138
XV, B
3.	The Company will not interfere in any improper manner with your right to choose.
c. After receipt of the arbitrator’s determination, the Company will permit employees from any other Company facility to occupy areas of its property near entrances and exits of the facility utilized by employees of the proposed bargaining unit five (5) days each calendar week for the purpose of distributing union literature and material and soliciting employees of the facility to vote for the Union, provided that no more than two (2) such employees from any other facilities of the Company may occupy the area at the same time. If there are multiple entrances and exits for the facility involved in the campaign, the restriction of two (2) such employees from any other facilities of the Company will be increased to a maximum of four (4), provided that no more than two (2) such employees from any other facilities of the Company are at any such entrance or exit at the same time. The Company will also permit off-duty employees from the unit sought to be organized to distribute union literature and materials and to solicit employees to vote for the Union at those employee entrances to its facility which are used by the employees of the unit to gain entry to the facility, provided that no more than two (2) off-duty employees of that facility may engage in such activity at any such entrance at the same time. The Company will not object to display of support by employees for the Union by the wearing of Union shirts, the wearing of Union hats in non-hard hat areas, or the display of Union buttons or stickers on the personal property of the employees. The parties agree that the activities of its employees supporting the Union and/or the activities of the employees from any other Company facilities shall not be permitted to compromise safety, disrupt ingress to or egress from a facility, or disrupt the business activities conducted at the facility. The Union agrees that neither its supporters at that
XV, B
B-139
facility nor employees from any other facilities of the Company will use loud speakers or similar devices on the.Company property.
2. If the arbitrator determines that authorization cards have not been signed by a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit; the Union will be barred from electing to proceed under either the expedited procedure or the National Labor Relations Act for a determination of representation of the bargaining unit for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of the arbitrator’s determination.
C. Either party shall refer any alleged violation or dispute involving the terms of this Article XV to a Joint Committee of the Union's District Director and the Company’s Corporate Director of Industrial Relations. If the alleged violation or dispute cannot be satisfactorily resolved by the said representatives, either party may request expedited arbitration to resolve such alleged violation or dispute. If expedited arbitration is requested, the parties will jointly request the Association to furnish a list of seven (7) arbitrators. To select an arbitrator from the list, the parties will, within five (5) working days after receipt of the list, alternatively strike the names on the list until one (1) is left. The parties shall notify the arbitrator of the selection by forwarding a joint notice of selection to the arbitrator. The time limits and procedure for such expedited arbitration shall be as follows:
1.	Promptly after receipt of the notice of selection from the parties, the arbitrator shall agree with the parties as to a mutually satisfactory date. The hearing shall be held within fifteen (15) calendar days after the date the notice of appeal to expedited arbitration is filed with the arbitrator.
2.	If the arbitrator is unable to schedule and hold
