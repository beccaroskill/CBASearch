Section 29 SUBSTANCE ABUSE
Local 26 and the Mechanical Contractors Association of Western Washington believe that substance abuse testing, treatment, and protection are as necessary in the skilled construction trades as they are in other high technology and safetysensitive workplaces. Substance abuse testing and treatment measures are appropriate for all employer non-bargaining unit employees as well, including company executives and officers. MCAWW and Local 26 also recognize that broad mandates of such policies are being issued increasingly from both public and private purchasers of construction.
MCAWW and U.A. Local 26 regard worker safety, health and well being as integral to top quality work performance and successful project delivery. Therefore, in the mutual interests of contractors, Local 26, workers and their families, and the purchasers of construction services, MCAWW and U.A. Local 26 jointly subscribe to the following elements of substance abuse policies:
•	public and/or private owner, customer, general contractor and signatory contractor substance abuse and testing mandates;
•	prohibitions against the possession and use of alcohol and illegal substances at work;
•	a prohibition against impairment at work;
•	testing on the basis of pre-employment, reasonable suspicion, random, post-accident, annual, and return-to-work from treatment;
•	stringent controls (such as computerized selection of individuals for unscheduled testing) against abuse in selecting individuals for testing;
•	• testing methods using non-invasive procedures; (no blood or hair samples)
■ • thresholds for positive results shall be' consistent with state and federal law if applicable;
•	treatment coverage (EAP’s)
•	those to be tested in the event of an accident, in addition to those directly involved, shall be by mutual agreement of the Foreman, Steward and Superintendent responsible for the work
•	the employee shall be paid actual time required for testing.
•	the reporting of results of the drug test shall be handled discreetly between the testing facility and Employer. The results shall be reported as follows:
. A. Yes, the employee is within the limits described by the Employer.
B. No, the employee is not within the limits described by the Employer.
•	employees that generate a positive test result from a '‘quick" or litmus test shall not be returned to the Hiring Hall or terminated until the results of the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (CG/MS) are reported.
•	in the event of a negative test result on the re-test, the Employer shall pay for the re-test and any lost wages
.. • the.Employer and the testing facility agree that the detailed results of the described tests are to be held in the strictest GONFIDENCE between the Employer and the testing facility, unless due to contractual agreement the owner or general contractor is the program administrator, then any information given will not go beyond the negative or positive outcome of any test conducted. They further agree that the results of the above tests will not be provided to anyone without express written consent of the employee.
•	the Employer and U.A. Local 26 agree.that the grievance procedure contained in the Labor Agreement shall apply for dispute resolution relative to this policy.
Local 26 agrees to abide with alcohol and drug testing policies that conform to these guidelines.
