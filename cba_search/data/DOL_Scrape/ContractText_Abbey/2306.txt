LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING RE TEMPORARY AGENCY EMPLOYEES
RE: Temporary Agency Employees
Personnel dispatched from a temporary employment agency shall not be covered under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement until they have worked thirty (30) shifts during the six (6) month period commencing with their first shift worked.
The six (6) month period is not a rolling one. If the individual does not work thirty (30) shifts in the first six (6) months of employment, then the test is applied again during the next six (6) months of employment with no shifts carried over from the first six (6) months. This process continues in successive six (6) month blocks of time until the individual meets the test. Once the individual meets the test, then the individual is thereafter an employee under the Collective Bargaining Agreement for all purposes. For example, if a temporary agency employee works thirty-one (31) shifts from January 5th to July 5th, they are covered under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement beginning with their thirty-first 1st) shift. If a temporary agency employee works twenty (20) shifts from January 5th to July 5th, then they are not covered under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If that temporary agency employee then works their next shift on November 1 st their subsequent six (6) month period is from November ISt to May 1st.
If a temporary employment agency employee works thirty (30) shifts in six (6) months and then loses their seniority under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, this process starts over again if the employee returns to the Arena as a temporary employment agency employee.
