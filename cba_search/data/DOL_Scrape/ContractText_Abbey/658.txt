NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
During our most recent negotiations there was much discussion concerning the proper interpretation and application of Article 20 - No Strikes or Lockouts provision in the Labor Agreement between Allied Employers, Inc., on behalf of its members, and UFCW Union Local #81. This letter is to confirm the parties’ agreement that in the event a primary labor union picket line at the Employer’s premises is established to support a legal strike and such picket line has been approved by UFCW Union Local #81, Article 20 permits the employees covered under our Labor Agreement to refuse to cross such primary labor union picket line, provided, however if such picket line is removed and thereafter reestablished during the same labor dispute, such picket line will not be considered a sanctioned picket line by UFCW Union Local #81.

The wage rates were deleted for Lead Service and Service Counter employees hired prior to June 4,1986, and prior to May 11,1989, because of a conclusion that there are no longer any apprentice employees that were hired prior to such dates. However, in the event there is an Apprentice Service Counter employee that has not yet achieved the Thereafter rate, the appropriate adjustment shall be made by applying the appropriate increases to the deleted 3120 hour progression brackets.
This agreement would also apply to any Lead Service or Thereafter employee hired prior to the above referenced dates.

CORPORATE CAMPAIGN
This Letter of Understanding is by and between Allied Employers, Inc. on behalf of its members and UFCW Union Local #81 and it should be considered as incorporated by reference as part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that will go into effect on May 2, 2004. The Agreement is as follows:
The Employers signatory hereto and the UFCW Locals, during the negotiations for the Clerks and Meatcutters Agreement in Puget Sound, believe they have a good faith working relationship and will not take any action to depart from that relationship or take any action inconsistent with maintaining that relationship. Consistent with its duty of fair representation under the Agreements and their grievance procedures, UFCW Local #81 will not be a party to, instigate or support class action litigation (except charges with the National Labor Relations Board) or engage in any type of corporate campaign against any involved Employer
It is also recognized that various monies from the Local Unions are paid to UFCW International Union funds. The Local does not control such funds. Consequently, the UFCW International Union’s use of those funds for purposes contrary to this Agreement will not be a violation of this Agreement.

SCHEDULING
This Agreement is to confinn the resolution of a dispute that has arisen between UFCW Local 81 and Fred Meyer, Inc., over the proper method of scheduling meat cutters and meat wrappers.
The dispute concerned the proper application of three prior unpublished arbitration awards: Food Industry, Inc. andA.M.C. Local 81 (Peck, 1966), Allied Employers, Inc. andA.M.C. Local 81 (Gillingham, 1970), and Olson's Foods, Inc. and UFCW Local 44 (Tinning, 1995). The parties agree to resolve their dispute as follows:
The Employers agree that the Tinning decision is null and void and that Meat scheduling must be carried out according to the Peck and Gillingham decisions (daily seniority) as per the practice in the industry over the last three decades. In consideration for that agreement, the Unions agree that the Employer may schedule Meat department employees for forty hours per week Sunday through Saturday (instead of Monday through Saturday).
Because the involved language is identical to language in several other labor agreements in Western Washington, and given that the parties to those agreements agree that this is a fair and proper resolution of the dispute, it is the intent of all parties below that this Agreement shall apply to each of the labor agreements listed in Attachment A.
AGREED this 23rd day of April, 2001.

1.	Food Service (Chef Express) employees are a classification whose duties are limited to work on products which have already been processed by meat cutters into retail case ready cuts that are stocked in meat counters. Food Service (Chef Express) employees will take meat products, which have already been processed by meat cutters, and “value add” ingredients to convert them to oven ready entrees. Food Service (Chefs Express) employees will be considered a separate classification for all purposes including seniority. Seniority shall be applied on an individual store basis.
2.	Food Service (Chefs Express) employees shall not be permitted to cut, bone, or grind fresh meat or perform any wrapping or pricing of meat products in preparation for sale in self-service meat cases.
3.	Food Service (Chefs Express) employees may modify any prepared cut (which has already been processed by a meat cutter) in order to value add for the Chefs Express product category, or use the slicing or cube machines to value add to a Chefs Express product (which has already been processed by a meat cutter).
4.	The Chefs Express product case shall be a separate identified case. The Food Service (Chefs Express) employees may stock the Chefs Express case with value added Chefs Express products which have been previously wrapped and priced by meat wrappers and which are in storage ready for sale.
5.	Lead Food Service (Chefs Express) employees shall be a separate classification. Food Service (Chefs Express) employees assigned to the lead shall not lose their seniority status. Seniority shall not apply in the selection of the Lead Food Service (Chefs Express) employees.
6.	Any stores incorporating a Chefs Express Department shall have designated at least one employee at the top wage scale of the Lead Food Service classification.
7.	Any stores incorporating a Chefs Express Department shall have designated at least one employee at the top wage scale of the Lead Food Service classification.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
All parties would benefit from a dispute resolution procedure that is both more timely and more efficient. To that end, the parties agree to the following:
1.	All disputes that are resolved at the store level (whether a formal grievance has been filed or not) shall be on a non-precedent basis (unless otherwise expressly stated in writing) and shall not be used by any party in any other situation or procedure regarding another employee or union agent and any manager or supervisor at the store or regional level.
2.	The parties should strive to share factual details regarding a grievance (or pregrievance issue) as early as possible in the process. The filing party should provide as much detail as possible in the original grievance or soon thereafter. The responding party should provide as much detail as possible with its response. This will allow both parties to more effectively investigate and assess the grievance and hopefully resolve the matter short of needing an in-person grievance meeting.
3.	Written warnings need not be processed beyond the union filing a grievance in order to preserve the union’s right to challenge the warning if it is used as progressive discipline in the future.
4.	For grievances being handled by Allied, Allied and the union will use a new method of scheduling by having standing monthly (as needed) meeting dates set aside for labor relations meetings. When a labor relations meeting is requested, the parties shall attempt to set it for the next standing meeting date. If that is not practical, the parties will either schedule a separate meeting or set it for the following standing date.
5.	Arbitration: On a trial basis, when selecting an arbitrator, instead of the current system of striking from a FMCS panel, the parties shall take turns striking names off the list of the following permanent panel:
1.	Gary L. Axon
2.	Michael H. Beck
3.	Michael E. Cavanaugh
4.	Joseph W. Duffy
5.	Eric B. Lindauer
6.	Jane R. Wilkinson
7.	Kathryn R. Whalen
UFCW Local #81-Meat
