In the event that any such Employer shall furnish the Bond of a corporate surety, the Association shall, out of the funds of said Industry Advancement Program, pay the premium for such Bond, provided such premium is in a reasonable amount; if such premium shall be ir an amount greater than usually charged for such Bond, such Employer shall, himself, pay the difference between Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) and the amount of said premium, and the Association shall pay, out of the funds of the Industry Advancement Program, Six Hundred Dollars ($600.00) of said premium.
(B)	. If the Association, pursuant to Section 8(A), elects to furnish its own undertaking in the form of a Bond, limiting its liability thereunder to Industry Advancement Program assets only, said undertaking shall provide that, upon certification by the Trustee to the Association that any Employer is in default in the payments required of him by this Section 8, such undertaking shall continue to assure payments required of said Employer by this Section 8 to an amount of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) over and above the amount of such payments in default.

After the Employer has contacted the Fund, the Fund will inform the Employer in writing within 72 hours if the proposed subcontractor does not have a fringe benefit bond, and/or an Agreement. The Employer will not enter into a subcontract until the subcontractor has posted a bond and signed an Agreement. The failure of the employer to comply with this Section 9, will require the Employer to be responsible for all wages and Fringe Benefits of a sub-contractor who does not have a Bond and/or Agreement with the Council.
The Employer agrees that, upon written notice
41
from the Fund that its subcontractor is delinquent in the payment of fringe benefits on his particular project, the Union, the subcontractor, and the Employer shall meet to resolve said delinquency In the event that satisfactory arrangements to collect the delinquency are not made, a jointly payable check in the amount of said delinquency shall be issued to the Funds by the Employer. This will not preclude the Union from exercising its rights provided in Article 14.
