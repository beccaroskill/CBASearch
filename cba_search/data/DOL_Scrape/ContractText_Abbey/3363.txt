B.	Filling Vacancies
1.	An employee seeking a transfer to a vacant position shall apply for the position to the Personnel Services Division. A list of such applicants shall be forwarded to the Worksite Administrator for consideration. The Board shall endeavor to fill vacancies with qualified applicants currently employed by the Board. Before new personnel are hired for vacant positions, employees with the greatest seniority who have requested transfer to such positions shall be given foremost consideration provided such employees have equal or better ability to satisfactorily perform the work in question as determined by the Worksite Administrator. Upon transfer within the same classification, the employee shall remain at the same step in the salary schedule. In any promotion, the employee shall be assured of no loss of steps.
8

d.	If an employee is promoted to a temporary position within the same school/department the employee at the termination of the temporary position shall return to their former position with no loss in step or pay as if the employee had remained in their former position. Any such temporary promotion shall be at the discretion of the immediate supervisor.
C.	Other Provisions

9
annually. Such evaluation shall be timed at the discretion of the evaluator but shall take place no later than April 30.
When an employee is transferred or promoted to a new position, the first formal evaluation shall have the length of service in the new position clearly stated on the evaluation form.
The first evaluation may be extended by thirty (30) days for an employee who transfers or is promoted into a new position.
Each employee shall be given a signed copy of the evaluation instrument prepared by their Immediate Supervisor. No such report shall be placed in the member's official personnel file without the employee receiving a signed copy and an opportunity for a conference. A summative performance rating of “needs improvement” shall require a conference between the Immediate Supervisor and the employee for the purpose of establishing a time line for improvement. Reasonable effort will be made to discuss performance problems with employees as they arise. No employee (of the Bargaining Unit) shall be permitted or required to formally evaluate another employee.
The negotiated evaluation instrument and directions for completion are included as Appendix B of this Agreement.
SECTION 4:	REAPPOINTMENT
By May 15 of each year, employees shall be informed in writing if they are not being recommended for rehire the next year. Any recommendation for rehire of an employee with a summative evaluation of “needs improvement” may be delayed to accommodate any established time line for improvement. If a non-reappointment occurs the affected employee may request, in writing, the reasons.
SECTION 5:	VACANCIES REFERENCE FILE
A fiscal year file of all vacancies shall be available in the Personnel Services Division.
SECTION 6:	REDUCTION IN FORCE
A.	Reduction in force is defined as the separation of an employee, by lay off or non-reappointment, for lack of work or funds without any fault or delinquency on the employee's part.
B.	The Board agrees to provide the Association with a list of names of the employees being laid off or non-reappointed due to a reduction in force and such notice shall be sent at the time that it is issued to the employees affected. Employees to be laid off shall be notified as soon as possible after the decision is made. In no event shall the Board give less than ten (10) working days notice to affected employees.
C.	Procedures
1.	Reduction in Force
The employer shall determine when a reduction in force is necessary and shall determine the positions to be eliminated or reduced. In the event of a reduction in force, the following procedures shall be followed:
10
a)	The employer shall determine how many employees must be removed from the district by job classification.
b)	The employer shall reduce hours within that job classification at each affected worksite taking seniority into account.
c)	The superintendent/designee may then make the mandatory transfers that are necessary, if any, to insure that the reduction occurs at the worksite in which the administration sought to reduce the number of employees.
2.	Reduction of Hours
The employer shall determine when a reduction of hours is necessary and shall determine the number of hours to be reduced. In the event of a reduction of hours within a given job classification the following procedures shall be followed:
a)	The employer shall determine how many hours must be reduced from the job classification at each affected worksite.
b)	The employer shall reduce hours within that job classification at each affected worksite taking seniority and training into account. If an employee has their hours reduced, they shall be notified of the reduction by the immediate supervisor. If the employee requests, the immediate supervisor will meet with the employee to discuss the reduction.
c)	If, at a later time, hours in the classification at the worksite are increased, the fact that certain employees have been decreased in hours shall be taken into account in allocating the additional hours. Such right shall exist for the duration of the recall period.
3.	Exception
Any transfer of personnel deemed necessary by the Board as a result of any layoff or reduction of hours shall be exempt from the vacancy announcement requirement.
4.	Recall
Employees who have lost employment due to a reduction in force shall retain recall rights for one (1) year and shall have preference to work over other applicants.
a)	Recall shall be made by certified mail to the last address in the employee's records. The Association shall be provided a copy of the recall letters. Within five (5) work days of the certified receipt date, laid off employees must signify their intention of returning to work (to the Employee Services Department). Failure to respond to the notice shall constitute a resignation by the employee.
b)	When employees are recalled from layoff, the employee with the greatest seniority in that classification shall be recalled first. If the laid-off employee, when offered recall, is temporarily unable to return to work due to medical reasons, they may request an extension of recall rights, not to exceed two (2) months.
11
SECTION 7:	EMPLOYEE PROTECTION
The Board shall furnish legal counsel to members in defense of civil legal actions arising out of the discharge of their duties within the scope of their employment in the school system, unless the Board finds that the member acted in bad faith, with malicious purpose, or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights, safety or property.
SECTION 8:	EMPLOYEE DISCIPLINE

SECTION 2	- HEARING LEVELS
A.

If the response to the Informal Action is unacceptable to the complainant, the formal procedure may be initiated.
B.	Formal Level 1: If a complaint is not resolved in a conference between the affected employee and their immediate supervisor, the complaint may be formalized as a grievance. A formalized grievance shall be submitted, in writing, within seven (7) days following the verbal response.

CHILD A TTENDANCE IN SCHOOL WHERE EMPLOYEE (PARENT) IS ASSIGNED
The employee (parent) may place their child (using current definitions of child) at the school where the employee (parent) works (so long as the child is properly suited for the school, using usual criteria such as grade levels and programs offered) or at the school where the child would be assigned using the Board's usual procedures.

ARTICLE XXI
EMERGENCY DA YS
During times of emergencies, Volusia County School District employees are expected to maintain public services and to meet new service needs brought about by the emergency conditions. Service demands may go beyond the scope of regularly assigned duties, calling on staff to assume new responsibilities and remain on duty for extended periods of time. The Volusia County School District and the Volusia Educational Support Association, in the interests of maintaining a safe environment for the students during times involving critical incidents such as severe weather, hazardous material spills, fire, or other emergency situations, agree to the following:
1.	Should an event such as is stated above occur during the time when the District is responsible for the school children, members of the bargaining unit will cooperate with the administration in taking the steps necessary to reasonably provide for the students’ safety. If such actions require service beyond the regular work day, the administration shall work with bargaining unit personnel to see that while first providing for the security of the students, reasonable requests by personnel to insure the safety of their own families will be accommodated. The District will make reasonable efforts, when possible, to provide time off prior to the onset of a potential disaster for employees designated as essential to secure their homes and see to the safety of their families. Since it may not always be possible, it is imperative that employees have an emergency plan in place to address their family’s safety in their absence. Scheduled or approved leave is subject to cancellation.
30
2.	Any position may be designated by the administration as an Essential Position (EP).
Essential Position: EP personnel must be available to report to duty for emergency preparations and may be required to remain on duty throughout an emergency event. Such employees will support the maintenance of critical services and/or recovery efforts. EP personnel are required to advise their supervisor of their location and contact information throughout the emergency. If an employee has unique personal circumstance that would prevent him/her from serving in an emergency, the employee shall discuss these circumstances with the supervisor as soon as possible in order to allow the supervisor to make other arrangements where the circumstances allow.
All other personnel must remain available during an emergency. Employees will report to their supervisor or designated point of contact at their next report time.
3.	In the event that the superintendent officially closes a school, district office, or a combination of work centers to employees;
a.	Employees shall be paid for their regularly scheduled hours. Should the superintendent reschedule the workday for a later date, the employee shall be deemed to have been compensated in advance, and will receive no additional compensation.
b.	In the event that an employee is called in to work by their supervisors on emergency days when the work site is closed, the employee shall be compensated, in addition to the compensation discussed in the prior paragraph, as follows:
1.	For hours worked during regular work hours, the employee shall receive their regular rate of pay.
2.	For hours worked after regular work hours not in excess of forty (40) hours paid per week, the employee shall receive their regular hourly rate.
3.	For hours worked after regular work hours in excess of forty (40) hours paid per week, the employee shall receive one and one half (PA) their regular hourly rate.
4.	Compensatory time may be provided instead of the additional pay provided under paragraphs 1, 2 & 3 above, if the administrator and employee agree.
4.	Should either party wish to discuss actions taken during an event as stated above, the parties shall meet to discuss the issues.
31
ARTICLE XXII
TERM OF AGREEMENT
A.	It is agreed and understood that this Agreement constitutes the complete understanding between the parties and concludes all collective bargaining during its term.
B.	This entire Agreement may be reopened for negotiations if not approved by the School Board of Volusia County or ratified by the Bargaining Unit.
C.	The Agreement shall be effective subject to ratification by the Bargaining Unit and approval by the School Board of Volusia County and shall continue through June 30, 2006.
D.	The Board and the Association agree to reopen negotiations on or before May 1, to negotiate salary and benefits, two issues proposed by the Association and two issues proposed by the School Board.
E.	If either party so desires to alter, or renew this Agreement upon its expiration, a written notice must be submitted to the other party prior to March 1 of the year in which the Agreement expires. If such notice is given, negotiations shall be initiated on or before May 1, 2006. Negotiation sessions shall be held at mutually agreed upon times and places.
F.	The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon the parties hereto and upon their successors.

APPENDIX C
SICK LEA VE BANK PROCED URES
Volusia County School Board Voluntary Sick Leave Bank Covering Members of the Volusia Educational Support Association Bargaining Unit.
Purpose:
To enable employers to provide protection in cases of long-term catastrophic illness and to encourage employees to "save" sick leave for a valuable future economic benefit (terminal leave).
A.	To become a member of the sick leave bank, an employee must have accumulated ten (10) sick leave days. Following the accumulation of ten (10) sick leave days, the employee may join the sick leave bank by donating one (1) sick leave day to the sick leave bank.
B.	To utilize "bank days" the member must have been a member of the sick leave bank for at least ninety (90) days and must first use all other accumulated sick leave days. A member must be credited with five consecutive days of unpaid leave before drawing from the bank.
C.	The purpose of this Sick Leave Bank is to provide a mechanism to cushion the financial impact of serious illness or injury. Although by no means an exclusive list, typical successful claims would be hospitalization for a heart attack, cancer, automobile accident or major surgery. The Sick Leave Bank is not intended to provide benefits to an employee for such things as cosmetic surgery, elective surgery that could be scheduled during a non-work period, or other similar claims. Upon approval of application by the Sick Leave Bank Committee, a member shall be eligible for two (2) times the number of days accumulated at the beginning of the illness to a maximum of fifty (50) days subject to the following provisions:
1.	Drawing of sick leave days is based on the availability of sick leave days in the bank.
2.	All cases shall be re-examined by the Sick Leave Bank Committee when the twenty-fifth (25th) continuous day of benefits has been reached. At this time the Committee may request additional medical certification.
3.	The employee is not required to repay the number of days used from the Sick Leave Bank.
4.	Any sick leave drawn from the bank by a participating employee must be used for said employee's personal illness, accident or injury.
D.	Following any use of the sick leave bank provisions, the employee shall have to rejoin the sick leave bank as indicated in "A" above.
E.	Days from the bank may only be used for extended personal, physical or mental disability.
F.	The bank shall be administered as follows: The VESA Sick Leave Bank Committee.
G .	In cases of extreme hardship, the bank administrators may grant additional days voluntarily given by
other sick leave bank members.
37
H.	Following establishment of the Sick Leave Bank, if the balance in the bank is diminished below fifty (50) days all participating members shall contribute one (1) additional sick leave day in order to continue membership. Such special assessment shall be at the rate of one (1) day per member, not to exceed two (2) days for special assessment purposes per year. Assessment shall be automatic upon notification. If an employee is unable to contribute the day, that person shall be placed on suspension from the benefits of the bank until able to contribute this day. Special Assessment days are days that are assessed above and beyond the initial day contributed for membership.
I.	Alleged abuse of the Sick Leave Bank shall be investigated by the Sick Leave Bank Committee. If an employee is found to have abused the use of the Sick Leave Bank, the employee shall repay the days drawn from the bank and be assessed appropriate penalties.
J.	The bank administrators shall determine the eligibility of membership in the sick leave bank.
K.	A list of all sick leave bank members shall be provided to VESA upon written request.
L.	Forms for enrollment shall be available through the VESA office.
M.	The Sick Leave Bank can be terminated only by mutual agreement of the Bargaining Unit and the Board. Upon discontinuance, any and all sick leave days in the bank shall be distributed to the participating members at the time of such discontinuance in units of not less than one-quarter (1/4) day with any remaining days to be disposed of at the sole discretion of the Sick Leave Bank Committee.

APPENDIX E
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
The School District of Volusia County (District) and the Volusia Education Support Association (VESA) mutually recognize the value of open and continuous communication. The parties agree that it is beneficial to all if avenues for dialog are established to address concerns as they arise, in order to facilitate an early exchange of information and resolution of the concern. While continuing to maintain an open door policy is helpful, it is also believed by the parties that an established continuous process for dialog between the parties is necessary. Therefore, the parties agree as follows:
1)	The Superintendent and VESA shall establish a joint labor management committee. The committee shall consist of three (3) members appointed by the Superintendent, and three (3) members appointed by the president of VESA. The committee may call upon additional support as necessary.
2)	The committee shall meet on a monthly basis for the first six (6) months, and then pursuant to a schedule established by the committee.
3)	An agenda for the meetings shall be mutually agreed upon in advance by a representative from each party. The items to be discussed shall include any matters of concern regarding the operation of the school district as it impacts the members of the bargaining unit. The goal of these discussions is to have a mutual understanding of the concerns and an early resolution to the concerns.
For the School District:
Superintendent
For the Union:
