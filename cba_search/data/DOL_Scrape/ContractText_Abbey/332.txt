Due to the fluctuations in work it may become necessary to loan Local S6 members from their parent classification to another. In order to accomplish these loans, the following criteria shall be utilized.
The Company may loan Local S6 members from their parent classification into another Local S6 classification. When loaning into classifications that exceed 50 mechanics at the time of the loan notification, at no time shall the total manhours being worked by the loaned Local S6 members exceed 20% of the manhours worked by the Local S6 members in the loaned into classification in any one calendar month.
Additionally, when loaning into classifications that exceed 50 mechanics at the time of loan notification, at no time shall the total manhours being worked by Local S6 members loaned into another classification exceed 10% of the total manhours worked by regular members of loaned into classifications in any one calendar year. These limits may only be exceeded by agreement with Chief Steward or designee.
When loaning into classifications of 50 or less mechanics at the time of assignment, at no time shall the number of mechanics loaned into the classification exceed the number of ten in any one calendar month. At no time shall the Local S6 members loaned into any one classification exceed 50% of the number of regular members of the loaned into classification.

These limits may only be exceeded by agreement with Chief Steward or designee.
The people chosen to be loaned from one Local S6 classification into another Local S6 classification shall be chosen by volunteers by seniority, senior to junior by shift within an area (Fabrication, Pre-Outfit, Land Level, Ships Completion) where fluctuation is needed. Nonvoluntary assignment shall be done by junior to senior seniority order by shift by area.
Loans between Maintenance classifications will be treated as a facility-wide loan.
The loan may proceed as soon as the notification has been sent to Local S6.
For loans less than five (5) days, overtime will be with their core classification.
10
For loans of five (5) days or more loaned employees may work overtime in loaned classifications.
There shall be no loans into a classification on layoff.
There shall be no loans into a classification that has employees loaned out absent Chief Steward agreement.
Loans across areas or on a facility-wide basis, with the exception of loans between Maintenance classifications, must be pre-approved by the Chief Steward.
There shall be no loans out of a classification that is hiring absent Chief Steward agreement.
Loans of five (5) consecutive work days or longer shall begin on the first day of the workweek and end on a Sunday.
Any deviation from the above requires joint agreement from the Chief Steward or his designee.
BIW and Local S6 have agreed to implement a “back-up” process for critical jobs such as crane operation, rigging, and machine operation, and third shift material support assigned to paint issue stations consistent with past practice.

14
with the trade foreman, who will be expected to correct any abuse in meeting BIW’s commitment to the timelines specified above.

Section 5	- Selection Criteria:
1.	Job Ownership
Offered to the employee working the job at the time the assignment is made that is to be worked on overtime.
NOTE: Classifications that currently do not utilize job ownership may continue to do so.

Section 2	- Involuntary Layoff:
a)	Notice of Involuntary Layoff:
(i)	BIW will provide ten days notice to the Union and seven days notice to you. In the event you are absent on the day of notice, BIW will send you a certified letter of notice (copy to Local S6). The date of mailing will be the notice date.
(ii)	The notice period begins with the next day following the notice.
b)	Date of Involuntary Layoff:
Your date of involuntary layoff will be the expiration date of your notice or the date of accepting twenty-four (24) hours pay in lieu of work.
19
c)	Pay in Lieu of Work:
You may accept twenty-four (24) hours pay in lieu of working your notice period. Should BIW elect to retain you for work during the notice period, you will receive twenty-four (24) hours pay in addition to your pay if involuntarily laid off.
d)	Notice of Involuntary Layoffs Beyond Control of BIW:
No notice is required for involuntary layoffs for reasons beyond the control of BIW, such as power or machinery breakdown, fire, floods, and hurricanes or blizzards.
e)	Involuntary Layoff Process:
Layoffs will occur within a job classification in seniority order on a yard-wide basis. If needed, a tiebreaker will be based on your last name at time of hire.
Section 3	- Voluntary Layoff:
Under circumstances mutually agreeable between BIW and Local S6, you may have the opportunity to participate in a voluntary layoff. These voluntary layoffs will be for an agreed upon length of time.
Section 4	- Recall Process:
a)	Rehire Questionnaire:
You will be required to complete a rehire questionnaire at time of layoff. This important document will determine which jobs could become available to you during your involuntary layoff. You are encouraged not to list jobs on the rehire questionnaire that you have no intention of accepting. You shall have the right to decline only one job offer outside your core classification. If you choose to decline the job offer, you will only have recall rights back to your core classification.
b)	Eligibility of Notified Employees for Recall:
An employee who is given notification of an impending layoff shall not be required to separate their employment and leave the shipyard in order to accept a recall into another classification provided that the employee:
1)	Is still working at the Company during the seven day notice period specified in 2(a), above,
2)	Provides the Company with notice in their Rehire Questionnaire, detailed in 4(a) above, that they will accept recall into another classification, and
3)	Meets all the seniority and eligibility requirements for the recall specified in this Article.
20
c)	Notice to Local S6:
Local S6 will be notified in advance of any recall.
d)	Recall Process:
Employees will be recalled by job classification in the reverse order of the layoff.
e)	Notice of Your Recall:
Should we be unable to contact you by telephone for any job vacancy that may exist which you listed on your rehire questionnaire, BIW will certify mail (copy to Local S6) your recall notice to your address of record. Final notice of recall will be five working days from receipt or fourteen working days from date of mailing, whichever first occurs.
f)	Dual Recall:
Should you be recalled from layoff into another job classification within this bargaining unit, you will maintain your full seniority rights. You will continue your recall rights back to your prior job classification. Should you subsequently be involuntarily laid off from the new job class, you will also have recall rights back to that job classification.
Section 5	- Short-Term Recall Process:
•	Local S6 will be notified in advance of any short-term recall.
•	Employees will be recalled by job classification in the reverse order of the layoff, within classification first, then by yard-wide seniority outside of the classification being recalled.
•	Should you accept a short-term recall you will maintain your full seniority rights.
•	Should you refuse a short-term recall you will maintain your full seniority rights.
•	The short-term recall will be for a specified number of workdays not less than 10 nor greater than 30.
•	At the end of the specified period, the employee will be separated without any pay in lieu of work benefits.
•	If you are laid off from a short-term recall, your healthcare coverage will extend or continue for 2 months.
•	To be eligible for a short-term recall, any employee must present himself for work within five workdays of notice.
21
•	The recall process will be by telephone only, with a list of employees not contacted provided to Local S6 the same day. Notification to the Union shall be deemed sufficient.
Article 16 SENIORITY
Section 1	- Definition:
Seniority means your length of service from date of hire, unless otherwise specified. For seniority driven assignments where employees have the same hiring date, the last name at the time of hire will be used for tie breaking purposes.
Section 2	- Application:
Seniority will be broken in all cases if:
a)	You quit.
b)	You are discharged.
c)
(i)	You went on a non-occupational leave of absence prior to May 21, 2012. The date upon which seniority is or will be broken is your length of service or thirty (30) months from the leave of absence date, whichever is less.
(ii)	You went on an occupational leave of absence prior to May 21, 2012. The date upon which your seniority is or will be broken is your length of service or sixty (60) months from the leave of absence date, whichever is less.
(iii)	You went or go on a non-occupational leave of absence on or after May 21, 2012. The date upon which seniority will be broken is your length of service or twenty-seven (27) months from the leave of absence date, whichever is less.
(iv)	You went or go on an occupational leave of absence on or after May 21, 2012. The date on which seniority will be broken is your length of service or fifty-four (54) months from the leave of absence date, whichever is less.
d)	You fail to notify BIW of an address change while on involuntary layoff or leave of absence.
e)	Upon recall, you fail to report for work or provide reasonable excuse for failing to report for work to your regular job or any selected job on your rehire questionnaire within five (5) days from date of receipt of telephone or letter notification (fourteen [14] days from date of mailing), whichever occurs first.
f)	You are on involuntary layoff for a period longer than your length of service.
22
Section 3	- Occupational or Non-Occupational LOA:
a)	BIW will continue healthcare for employees on an occupational or non-occupational leave of absence under the BIW Healthcare Program until such time as their seniority is broken as long as the employee:
(1)	Pays the employee contribution in a timely manner (see Contributory Premiums for Employees under the Employee Benefit Program), and
(2)	Applies for Social Security Disability coverage within twelve (12) months of the leave of absence, and
(3)	Notifies the BIW benefits administrator regarding their eligibility for SSDI and/or Medicare.
b)	An employee that is eligible for Medicare because of SSDI entitlement must provide documentation and a signed release form whenever requested by the BIW benefits administrator regarding continued eligibility for SSDI and/or Medicare. BIW will coordinate benefits under the BIW Healthcare Plan as a secondary payor to Medicare and reimburse the employee Medicare Part B premium. Any employee terminated as a result of Section 2c during the life of this agreement who is Medicare eligible will be reimbursed their Part B premium for a combined leave of absence and termination period equal to their prior length of service. An employee that does not qualify for SSDI and/or Medicare shall continue to be covered by healthcare in accordance with the healthcare terms of this agreement and Section 2c.
c)	For a period equal to length of service, employees terminated as a result of Section 2c will be offered employment to a position within the bargaining unit with reinstated seniority upon release for work through medical certification from primary care physician. If BIW’s Medical Director disagrees with the decision, a third party (medical physician) will be called in and selected by mutual agreement between the employee’s medical primary care physician and Yard Medical Director. The third party physician will decide the issue.
Section 4	- Years of Service Credit for Healthcare Coverage:
If you are laid off, your healthcare coverage will continue as follows:
Years Service
Less than 8
8 or more
Healthcare Coverage Beyond Month of Layoff 3 months 6 months
Section 5	- Leave of Absence:
a)	Your seniority will be fixed as of the first day of involuntary layoff. All time on involuntary layoff will accrue for seniority purposes upon your return to work.
b)	Your seniority will be fixed as of the first day of leave of absence. All time on leave of absence will accrue for seniority purposes upon your return to work for a minimum of 30 hours of work within 15 working days of return to work from that medical LOA. New injuries or illnesses
23
incurred during this time frame shall not preclude an employee from having his seniority accrue under this provision.
c)	All leave of absence for sickness, injury or mental or physical disability will be granted with medical certification acceptable to BIW.
d)	Seniority will be accumulated when you are elected to a Local (City council, town selectman position only), State, or Federal Government office that requires your full-time presence.
Section 6	- Yard Injury:
Should you incur a yard injury that prevents you from working within your job classification and accept work within your limits in another bargaining unit at BIW and be subsequently involuntarily laid off prior to linking up your full seniority, you will be transferred back into Local S6 to protect your seniority rights in your prior classification and rate of pay.
For purposes of determining occupational and non-occupational leave of absence time limits only, any controverted workers’ compensation case being actively pursued by any employee who is covered by this agreement will be treated as occupational until such time as a formal decision is received.
If BIW prevails in controverting the claim, we will treat the entire time on leave of absence as non-occupational. If the employee prevails, it will continue as occupational. In the event that an employee files claims under both State and Federal law, the initial formal decision in either forum shall serve to determine whether seniority will be controlled by non-occupational or occupational time limits, subject to final determination.

Section 2	- Accrual:
The Compensated Time Off allowance accrues during any calendar month in which you received payroll compensation for 80 or more hours in that month. During the calendar year in which you complete a service anniversary that brings you to a higher allowance, you accrue Compensated Time Off at the higher rate for the entire year. Any unaccrued Compensated Time Off used during a calendar year will be debited from your allowance at the start of the next calendar year. Any hours not paid that are covered by an absentee code designated by an asterisk (*) (refer to Article 49) those hours will be credited for the accrual of your compensated time.
Section 3	- Usage:
You may use the following at any time during the calendar year: Accrued Compensated Time Off, Banked Compensated Time Off, and Accrued Compensated Time Off you anticipate for that year.
The minimum increment of Compensated Time Off permitted is 2 hours (i.e., 2, 4, 6, or 8 hours) with the exception that up to sixteen (16) hours may be used in any calendar year in one (1) hour increments.

You will receive payment for Compensated Time Off at your current base hourly wage rate.
In the event you separate employment from BIW, you will be paid for all your unused Accrued Compensated Time Off and Banked Compensated Time Off at your regular base rate. Any Compensated Time Off taken in excess of your Accrued Compensated Time Off and Banked Compensated Time Off will be deducted from your final paycheck.
Should you be laid off, in lieu of payment and upon receipt of your request to Payroll, your unused Accrued Compensated Time Off and Banked Compensated Time Off will be frozen pending your return to work. If you do not return to work by year-end, payment will occur at that time. In the interim you may request full payment of your unused Accrued Compensated Time Off and Banked Compensated Time Off. Payment will be made during the next regular pay period.

Article 21 EMPLOYEES’ BENEFITS
Section 1	- Employees’ Benefit Program:
Your Benefits Program consists of plans that provide you financial security and policies that provide you paid time-off away from work.
33
Health and welfare plans include healthcare, accident and sickness (A&S) insurance, basic life insurance, supplemental life insurance, vision care, and business travel accident insurance. Retirement plans include pensions and 40l(k). All of these plans require you to be a full-time employee. All of the health and welfare plans require you to complete a probationary period of 360 hours from date of hire before you can participate. For the IAM National Pension Fund, that eligibility period is 60 calendar days from date of hire. The 401(k) plan does not have a service requirement for eligibility. BIW pays the full cost of your pensions, A&S insurance, basic life insurance and business travel accident insurance, and pays most of the cost of your healthcare. BIW also matches a portion of your contributions to your 40l(k) account. These plans are ERISA plans and their terms and conditions are governed by plan documents and/or insurance contracts, all of which are available through the BIW Benefits Department. Therefore, the language contained in this Agreement for these plans is intended to represent only highlights of the plans. A summary plan description for each of these plans, which will give you further information in addition to these highlights, is available to you.
In addition to the ERISA plans above, BIW sponsors a wellness program and will continue to offer a program where you can obtain insurance for personal property.
Policies that provide you paid time-off away from work include compensated time-off, bereavement, jury/military/witness pay, and holidays.
Additionally, LS6 sponsors a dental plan, a long-term disability plan, and an A&S plan which supplements the A&S that BIW sponsors for you. Each of these plans requires you to make contributions if you choose to participate in them. The language contained in this Agreement is limited to the terms and conditions that BIW and LS6 have agreed to so that if you elect to participate in them, your contributions to these plans will be deducted from your paycheck. To the extent permitted by law, your contributions for the dental plan will be deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis. Your contributions for the supplemental A&S and longterm disability will be deducted on a post-tax basis. For information on the benefit provisions of these plans, contact the LS6 Union Hall. The Union agrees that it will provide the Director of Human Resource Services with a list of named employees by department and badge number participating in the Local S6-sponsored A&S supplemental plan upon request but no more than on a monthly basis. Such listing will be provided in a timely manner.
Section 2	- Healthcare Program:
The Healthcare Program that was in effect on May 20, 2012, will continue unchanged through December 31, 2012, including but not limited to employee contributory premiums and plan co-payments. Effective January 1, 2013, there will be changes to the Program. The highlights are described below.
a)	Choice:
You are eligible for BIW’s Healthcare Program once you have completed your probationary period. Through December 31, 2015 you may choose between two healthcare
34
options. Effective in January 1, 2016 you will have an additional plan choice. These options include:
•	Physician Open Access (POA)
•	Primary Care Physician Select (PCPS)
•	Personal Health Account Plan (PHAP) - available January 1, 2016
All options cover doctor visits, hospitalization, surgery, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, routine physical exams, child immunizations and check-ups, mammograms, routine eye exams (through December 31, 2013 only), and other services. The options differ in the amount you must contribute from your weekly paycheck and the amounts you pay when you obtain services.
Other options may be available to you if your primary residence is outside the Network Area.
b)	Enrolling in the Healthcare Program:
You must have medical coverage through BIW, unless you are covered under another healthcare plan (such as your spouse's employer) in which case you would indicate that during your initial open enrollment process by the due date specified. If you are not waiving coverage as specified in the previous sentence, you will be enrolled in the Program as specified by you during your initial enrollment. If you fail to enroll, you will automatically be enrolled in the POA Option with single coverage and a smoking status.
c)	Choosing Your Healthcare Option and Coverage Level:
You will be able to choose the healthcare option you want to participate in and your coverage level each year through the annual open enrollment process. If you and your spouse are both employed by BIW, one of you can choose to cover your spouse and children, while the other can choose the no coverage option. You can each cover yourselves, but your spouse and/or dependents cannot have “double” coverage.
Annual enrollments provide you the opportunity to change your healthcare option, or-coverage level, or smoking/non-smoking status. If you do not enroll by the due date specified, you will automatically be re-enrolled in the same option and at the same coverage level and smoking/non-smoking status you had as of the last day of that calendar year.
d)	Contributory Premiums for Employees:
Although BIW pays the majority of the cost of the Healthcare Program, you share in the cost through your employee contributions, which are deducted from your paycheck. To the extent permitted by law, these contributions will be deducted before taxes are withheld. If you are not receiving a paycheck, and are not placed on a leave of absence, your missed contributions will be deducted when you start receiving paychecks again. If you are not receiving a paycheck and are placed on a leave of absence, you will be responsible to make
35
payment when billed. Failure to pay by the grace period, which is 60 calendar days, will result in termination of coverage.
The amount of your contribution will depend on the healthcare option and coverage level you select, and whether you or your covered family members are non-smokers and have the non-smoking discounts for that calendar year. Your spouse and children under the age of 26 are eligible dependents that you may enroll in the Program. Also, children who are totally disabled at the time that they would no longer be eligible for healthcare coverage because of the age limits, may be eligible for continued coverage under the Program. Weekly contributions for each coverage level for each healthcare option are shown in the last part of the section that explains that particular option.
e)	Eligibility for Non-Smoking Discount:
Open Enrollment each year provides you with an opportunity to declare your smoking/non-smoking status for the following year. You are required to re-select your smoking/non-smoking status if it has changed.
You are eligible for the non-smoking discount if: 1) you and your covered dependents have not used tobacco products more than 3 times in the month before you complete the enrollment process, 2) you are committed to remaining smoke-free, and 3) you declare yourself and your dependents non-smokers.
You are not eligible for the non-smoking status if you and your dependents do not meet all three requirements stated in the paragraph above.
f)	Option 1: Physician Open Access (POA):
The POA gives you “open access” to the doctor (or hospital) of your choice, without requiring a referral. Each time you need care, you decide which type of doctor to see and whether to receive services from an in-network provider (one who participates in the plan network) or from an out-of-network provider.
Even though you may seek care from any provider, it’s still important to review the extensive network of participating hospitals, doctors, and other providers. That’s because more of your out-of-pocket costs are covered when you use an in-network provider.
You’re free to receive care from any network provider to qualify for in-network benefits. When you do, office visits are covered at 100% after a co-payment. Preventative Care Office Visits are covered at 100%. Prescription drugs are covered at 100% after a copayment that is determined based upon whether the drug is filled with a generic, preferred brand name, or non-preferred brand name. You can receive up to a 30-day supply through a retail pharmacy, and a 90-day supply through the mail-order program. Most other services are subject to an annual deductible, coinsurance, and an out-of-pocket maximum. Listed below is a summary of some fees for commonly used services from network providers.
36
	Through	After
	12/31/13	12/31/13
Preventive Care Office Visit	$-0-	$-0-
Office Visits (PCP)	$15	$20
Office Visits (Specialist)	$30/15	$50/25
Cardiac Rehabilitation	$-0-	$-0-
Physical Therapy Office Visit	$15	$25
Chiropractic Office Visit	$15	$25
Allergy Shots Office Visit	$15	office visit
Prescription Drugs		
Retail (30-day supply)	$10/20/50	$10/30/70
Mail Order (90-day supply)	$20/40/100	$20/60/140
X-rays, Labs, Diagnostics	20%; no deductible	20%; after deductible
Emergency Room	20%; after deductible	20%; after deductible
Inpatient Hospital Stay	20%; after deductible	20%; after deductible
Outpatient Surgery	20%; after deductible	20%; after deductible
Here is how your share of the cost for care is determined for those services where coinsurance applies. (Co-payments for office visits and prescription drugs do not count toward the annual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.)
Unless specifically stated above, you need to meet the annual deductible. For innetwork care, the annual deductible is:
Year	2012	2013	2014	2015	2016
Per Person	$350	$350	$400	$400	$400
Maximum Per Family	$700	$700	$800	$800	$800
Once you meet the annual deductible, you will begin to pay a percentage of covered services.
After your deductible and share of coinsurance reaches the out-of-pocket maximum, then the plan pays the remainder of covered services (excluding co-payments) for the rest of the year. This means the plan pays 100% of the usual, customary and reasonable costs for covered services where coinsurance applies. The out-of-pocket maximum is:
Year	2012	2013	2014	2015	2016
Per Person	$1,500	$1,500	$1,700	$1,700	$1,700
Maximum Per Family	$3,000	$3,000	$3,400	$3,400	$3,400
To participate in the POA Option, the following contributions will be deducted from your weekly paycheck. These contributions will be effective the first paycheck of each of the calendar years shown below:
37
PCPS	2012		2013		2014		2015		2016

Employee & Family	26.40	40.80	27.72	42.84	29.11	44.98	30.56	47.23	32.09	49.59
g)	Option 2: Primary Care Physician Select (PCPS):
The PCPS plan is primarily a copay-based plan. If you select the PCPS you must receive your care from a specific network of doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers. Out-of-network care is not covered. Except for emergencies and services preapproved by the insurer, if you receive care from out-of-network providers, you will be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
Listed below is a summary of some fees for commonly used services from network providers:
	Through	After
	12/31/13	12/31/13
Preventive Care Office Visit	$-0-	$-0-

h)	Personal Health Account Plan (PHAP):
(Available beginning 1/1/2016)
The PHAP is designed to conform to IRS regulations and federal legislation associated with the use of a Health Savings Account (HSA). The PHAP covers preventive care at 100% with no deductible when you use in-network providers. For all other covered service you must meet the annual deductible and then pay coinsurance until you meet your annual out-of-pocket limit. After meeting the annual out-of-pocket limit (which includes the deductible), all covered services are covered at 100% for the rest of the year.
Coverage Level	Deductible	Out-of-pocket Maximum
Employee Only	$1,500	$2,000
Employee & Spouse Employee & Child(ren) Employee & Family	$3,000	$4,000
You can use any health care provider you wish in the insurer’s network and are encouraged to select and use a primary care doctor. If you use providers not in the network, you will have a higher deductible, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum. Listed below are the coinsurances you would pay after meeting the deductible for commonly used services from network providers:
Preventive Care Office Visits (PCP, Specialists, Chiropractic, Physical Therapy, Cardiac Rehab, etc.) Prescription Drugs (Retail and Mail Order) X-rays, Labs and Diagnostics Emergency Room Hospitals (Inpatient and Outpatient)	Covered in full; no deductible 10% after deductible 10% after deductible 10% after deductible 10% after deductible 10% after deductible
39

	Non-Smoker	Smoker
Employee Only	$3.62	$8.28
Employee & Spouse	$6.53	$16.42
Employee & Child(ren)	$6.53	$16.42
Employee & Family	$10.27	$24.67
i)	Changes During the Year:
You can only make changes in the Healthcare Program during the annual enrollment period, unless you have a life event or "qualifying change in status" that affects the type of coverage you need. You or your dependents can enroll in or change your level of coverage during the year, consistent with the legal requirements for a qualifying change in status, only if one of the following events occur and you and your dependents sign up within 31 days to reflect the life event. Life events and status changes are:
•	Marriage, divorce, legal separation or annulment.
•	Birth, adoption or placement for adoption of a child.
•	Death of a covered dependent.
•	Change in your dependent's eligibility status (for example, your child reaches an age when coverage stops).
•	You lose coverage provided under another plan (for example, your spouse's plan is no longer offered).
•	Change in location (that is, your current medical coverage is not available in your new location).
•	Termination or start of employment by yourself, your spouse or your dependent.
•	Change in your or your spouse’s employment status that results in a gain or loss
of benefits eligibility (for example, a change in work schedule, termination of employment, or new employment).
j)	Participation and Contributory Premiums for Employees on a Medical Leave of Absence:
BIW will continue healthcare for employees on a medical LOA and their eligible dependents under the conditions specified in Article 16. Contributions equal to the active employee contribution will be required. Failure to pay these contributions in a timely manner (See Contributory Premiums for Employees), will result in termination of healthcare benefits.
40
k)	Participation and Contributory Premiums for Retirees:
If you are eligible to retire under the Pension Plan directly from employee status for any reason and are under age 65, you may elect to participate in the Healthcare Program.
If you are younger than age 62, your monthly payment to participate will be equal to BIW’s average cost for the coverage level you select.
If you are age 62 and under age 65 and terminate employment on any date that falls on or between October 15, 2012 and April 15, 2013, your monthly payment to participate will be equal to the monthly equivalent of the weekly contribution amounts for active employees. If you choose to waive participation in the Healthcare Program, you will receive a single taxable lump-sum of $8,000.
If you are age 62 and under age 65 and terminate employment on any date that does not fall between October 15, 2012 and April 15, 2013, your monthly payment to participate will be equal to BIW’s average cost for the coverage level you select.
If you are over age 65 you are not eligible for the Healthcare Program, however if you terminate employment on any date that falls on or between October 15, 2012 and April 15, 2013, you will receive a single taxable lump-sum of $8,000.
l)	Participation for Eligible Dependents of Deceased Employees:
An employee's spouse and/or eligible dependent children will be covered by the Healthcare Program for one full year from the end of the month of employee's death, with no contributory premiums required.
m)	Coordination of Benefits for SSDI/Medicare:
BIW will coordinate benefits under the BIW Healthcare Plan as a secondary payor to Medicare for all subscribers who are Medicare eligible as a result of an SSDI award.
n) Joint Committee on Healthcare Costs and Quality:
BIW and LS6 are committed to ensuring that employees have access to cost effective, quality healthcare coverage. Because of their ongoing concern about the quality of healthcare and costs, the parties agree to a Joint Committee on Healthcare Costs and Quality. The Committee will have an equal number of representatives, including a co-chair, from each party. When appropriate, healthcare experts and representatives from BIW’s health plans will be invited to attend Committee meetings. Each party may have their benefits consultants and advisors attend Committee meetings. The Committee also will meet with healthcare providers to express the parties’ interest in obtaining quality healthcare at affordable prices.
In furtherance of these objectives, any savings on the annual cost of healthcare will be passed on to employees. If annual per capita costs for healthcare decline between July 1
41
and June 30 of the following year, then employee’s weekly premiums will be reduced by 50% of the weekly equivalent decrease as of January 1. In a year or partial year where plan design changes occur, the claims experience incurred during the time frame that the previous plan design was in effect, will be actuarially adjusted to reflect the new plan design.
o) Changes in Healthcare Plan Design:
As healthcare information and tools to evaluate quality become available to BIW and Local S6, either party may propose using financial incentives or disincentives within the Healthcare Plans that will encourage members to use certain providers that have better outcomes. Proposals that reduce aggregate costs to both BIW and employees will be carefully evaluated by the other party for inclusion into existing plan design.
To the extent the plan design contained within this Agreement cannot be administered by the current or a future healthcare carrier, both BIW and Local S6 will work together in whole or in part in order to provide the health insurance coverage and benefits which are comparable as a whole to the coverages and benefits described in this Agreement.
Section 3	- Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA):
a)	Health Care FSA:
This is a special account where the money in the account may be used on a tax free basis for almost any un-reimbursed expense related to medical, dental, or vision coverage for you, your spouse, or your dependents. For example, you can use the money to be reimbursed for deductibles, co-insurance, and co-payments under an established plan (like the BIW healthcare program, or the LS6-sponsored union dental plan, or a plan through your spouse's employer), or for out-of-pocket expenses you have if you are not covered under an established plan. Contributions you make as a requirement to participate in a benefits plan, like payroll deductions for healthcare or dental coverage, are not eligible.
You can establish your own account by setting aside a portion of your wages on a pre-tax basis during the annual open enrollment process conducted each Fall preceding the calendar year. If you elect to participate in this account, you must indicate so during the open enrollment and decide how much to contribute during that year. Contribution limits will be consistent with federal laws and regulations.
To make sure you put the right amount of money in your account during open enrollment, you need to estimate your expenses for the next year. If you put more money into the account than you have expenses for, any money remaining in your account by the end of the year will be forfeited; notwithstanding that you have ninety (90) days after the end of the year in which to file receipts for services that were rendered in that year. See the BIW Benefits Department for a complete list of eligible and ineligible expenses.
42
You can only make changes outside of the open enrollment process during the year under certain rules. For those rules, see the "Changes During The Year" section under the Healthcare Program.
b)	Dependent Care FSA:
This is a special account where you can be reimbursed dependent day care expenses that meet certain requirements on a tax-free basis.
An annual open enrollment process will be conducted each Fall preceding the calendar year. If you elect to participate in this account, you must indicate so during the open enrollment and decide how much to contribute during that year. Contribution limits will be consistent with federal laws and regulations.
To make sure you put the right amount of money in your account during open enrollment, you need to estimate your expenses for the next year. If you put more money into the account than you have expenses for, any money remaining in your account by the end of the year will be forfeited; notwithstanding that you have ninety (90) days after the end of the year in which to file receipts for services that were rendered in that year. See the BIW Benefits Department for a complete list of eligible and ineligible expenses.
You can only make changes outside of the open enrollment process during the year under certain rules. For those rules, see the "Changes During The Year" section under the Healthcare Program.
Section 4	- Basic Accident and Sickness:
For eligible employees, the Basic Accident and Sickness Plan in effect on May 20, 2012 in the weekly benefit amount of two-hundred and twenty-five dollars ($225) will continue unchanged through May 31, 2012. For disabilities that occur on and after June 1, 2012, the weekly benefit amount will increase to two hundred and fifty dollars ($250).
Section 5	- Life Insurance Coverage:
a)	Basic Life Insurance:
For eligible employees, the Basic Life Insurance coverage in effect on May 20, 2012 in the amount of $40,000 will increase to $50,000 on the effective date of this Agreement, and will remain at that level for the duration of this Agreement.
If you are eligible to retire under the Pension Plan directly from employee status with BIW, you will be eligible for life insurance coverage during your retirement. Your benefit amount will be the same amount that was in effect prior to your retirement. Then, on the first anniversary date of your retirement, your life insurance benefit will be reduced by 10%. Thereafter, every year on the anniversary of your retirement, your benefit will be
43
lowered by the same amount it was reduced on your first anniversary date. The minimum benefit paid to your surviving beneficiary is $5,000.
b)	Supplemental Life Insurance:
You are eligible for additional life insurance for yourself.
You will have six (6) options to choose from each calendar year during the annual open enrollment process, which will be conducted each Fall preceding the calendar year. Your options will include:
•	No Coverage.
•	Coverage	at	$25,000.
•	Coverage	at	$50,000.
•	Coverage	at	$100,000.
•	Coverage	at	$200,000.
•	Coverage	at	$300,000.
Satisfactory proof of evidence of insurability is required for all increases.
If you elect supplemental life insurance, you will pay the full cost of the premium. This cost will be deducted from your paycheck on an after tax-basis. The cost can change each year and depends upon the coverage level you select and your age.
You can only make changes outside of the open enrollment process during the year under certain rules. For those rules, see the "Changes During The Year" section under the Healthcare Program.
Section 6	- Business Travel Accident Insurance:
If you die as a result of an accident while you are traveling on company business, your beneficiary will receive a lump sum benefit of four times your annual base pay.

44
•	No coverage.
•	Employee	Only.
•	Employee	and	Spouse.
•	Employee	and	Child(ren).
•	Employee	and	Family.
If you elect coverage under the vision care plan, you will pay the full cost of the premium. To the extent permitted by law, these contributions will be deducted before taxes are withheld. The cost can change each year and depends upon the coverage level you select.
You can only make changes outside of the open enrollment process during the year under certain rules. For those rules, see the “Changes During The Year” section under the Healthcare Program.
Section 8	- Personal Lines of Insurance:
You are eligible to receive a free no-obligation rate quote from an insurance carrier that BIW chooses for several different types of personal insurance coverage (i.e., automobile, home). Each employee who chooses to apply and is accepted for one or more coverages would be individually underwritten and rated, and will also have the option to have premiums automatically deducted from paychecks in equal amounts each pay period.
The insurance carrier reserves the right to not offer this Program in certain states, and may not underwrite certain high-risk individuals.

BIW and the Union agree, at the request of either party, to promptly meet mid-term to negotiate, in good faith, any modification of this agreement under a Funding Improvement Plan or Rehabilitation Plan recommended by the Plan Trustees as necessitated under the PPA.
Article 23 SUPERVISORS NOT TO WORK WITH THE TOOLS
Section 1:
It is not the intent or desire of BIW that supervisors be permitted to perform work on any hourly-rated job except in the following situations.
•	Emergencies: Supervisors will be allowed to give limited assistance to other employees where imminent danger to people or property exists or can alleviate an unsafe situation where no employee(s) are present in the immediate area to do the work.
•	Instruction of Employees: Supervisors will be allowed to explain how to do a job verbally. This does not allow them to do the work.
•	Training: If employees are assigned to a job with insufficient knowledge of how to do the work in question, a supervisor could demonstrate how to do the work in question in situations where no other employees are readily available.
•	Limited Assistance: In situations where an employee is doing a job that could bring him harm, a supervisor could help in situations where no other employees are available.
Section 2:
Violations of this Article will not be tolerated. In cases of alleged chronic repeat violations by a supervisor, the Union President can request a meeting with the cognizant Vice President who will meet with the Union President or his designee(s) to review the cases and take whatever appropriate action the Vice President deems necessary to resolve the cases to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.
46
Article 24 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1	- Definition:
Wherever used in this agreement, the term “grievance” shall mean any disagreement, difference, or dispute raised by any employee(s) or the Union that the Company has violated subjects covered in this Agreement.
Section 2	- (Step 1):
Prior to filing a written grievance, employees are encouraged to first discuss the issue with the appropriate supervisor and/or steward for resolution. If you fail to resolve the issue, the grievance shall be reduced to written form and presented to your Trade Foreman or designee. The written grievance should set forth the facts giving rise to the grievance, and, where possible, should provide the remedy sought, and specify the sections of the Agreement alleged to be violated.

When the Company anticipates that new technologies may have an impact on the work performed by Union represented employees, the Company will, as early as possible, so advise the Union, and at the time describe the location and nature of such technological changes and the extent to which they may affect the work performed by represented employees. In the event it becomes necessary to train you to qualify for new technology or other available jobs, BIW will institute the necessary programs.
Any new technology or new process as defined under Section 2 above will be subject to the Joint Agreement process. The Company agrees to notify the Union President of any proposed new technology or new process change in writing.
Section 4	- Technological Change Procedure:
The Joint Agreement Process in Article 39 will apply to new technologies and must be worked through in a timely manner.

NEW LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Universal Health Insurance
Mr. David Sullivan
Assistant Directing Business Rep
District Lodge 4, IAMAW
698 Lisbon Street
Lisbon Falls, Maine 04252
Dear Mr. Sullivan:
This is to confirm the understanding between the Company and the Union concerning Universal Health Insurance.
It is recognized that without any specific details of Federal or State legislation on Universal Health Insurance which could be enacted, it is not possible at this time to envision implications of such legislation on the Group Health, Dental and Life Insurance Plans. Nevertheless, it is mutually recognized that the Plans should not duplicate the benefits of a universal health insurance program and that if such duplication results from any such legislation or regulation, the parties will meet to restructure the Plans as needed to eliminate such duplication.
It is further agreed that in no case will the Company’s total liability for costs for any negotiated Plans, inclusive of any tax or premium contribution required from the Company by legislation or regulation, exceed that in effect immediately prior to the implementation of Federal or State Universal Health Insurance legislation or regulation.
Gerald Stergio
Vice President, I luman Resources
Accepted this 16ih day of May 2012
David Sullivan

May 12, 2012
