Teamsters Local 231 and City of Ferndale Public Works Collective Bargaining Agreement
1/1/2020-12/31/2022
This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the City of Ferndale, Washington, hereinafter referred to as City, and General Teamsters Union Local 231, hereinafter referred to as Union.
Preamble:
The purpose of this Agreement is to achieve and maintain a harmonious relationship between the City and the Union, to provide for equitable and peaceful adjustment of differences which may arise, and to set forth the understanding reached between the parties with respect to wages, hours of work, benefits, and conditions of employment.
The parties to this Agreement share a common commitment to serve the citizens and businesses of the City of Ferndale to address the needs of the community, for the greater good.
The parties are committed to a collective bargaining relationship, which acknowledges the unique nature of public service both in terms of the demands placed upon employees, as well as budgetary restraints for public agencies. Both parties strive to identify equitable solutions within these constraints, and to seek meaningful, sustainable, and competitive compensation. Both parties also seek to honor the diversity of the City’s workers, both in terms of the various backgrounds they may bring to the job, but the needs of each employee, with respect to health, family, childcare, and/or post-career expectations.
Both parties seek to provide high quality working conditions, and to enhance an ongoing relationship of trust and respect.
This Agreement has been jointly created by representatives of the City and the Union through the use of the Interest Based Bargaining (IBB) process. We are committed to continued use of the IBB process in our work together, and to resolving conflict whenever possible through achievement of consensus upon acknowledgement of all parties’ interests. To that end, a Labor Management Committee is established through Article 12, for the purposes of maintaining and enhancing this relationship.

Any work in excess of the 24 hours would then be paid at the overtime rate).

ARTICLE 8 FAMILY LEAVE
8.0	1 All employees who have worked for the employer for at least 1,250 hours in the last twelve months are entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid family leave every twelve (12) months to (1) care for the employee's newborn child or adopted child, or (2) care for a child under 18 years of age who is suffering from a serious health condition, or (3) care for the employee's parent or spouse whois suffering from a serious health condition, or (4) due to the employee’s own serious health condition. If both parents of the child are employed by Employer, they are together entitled to twelve (12) workweeks of unpaid leave in a twelve (12) month period. Parental leave taken for the care of a newborn or newly adopted child must be completed within twelve (12) months of the child's birth or placement for adoption. This policy will be administered in accordance with the Federal Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). Employees, if sick leave eligible, shall be required to utilize all accrued sick leave, compensatory time and all but five (5) days accrued vacation before any non-paid time off shall be utilized. Employees, if not sick leave eligible, shall use all accrued compensatory time and all but five (5) days accrued vacation before any non-paid time off shall be utilized. All leave granted in accordance with state or federal laws, whether paid or unpaid, shall count against the twelve (12) week period and each shall run simultaneously. For record keeping purposes, eligibility for the twelve (12) week leave shall be calculated on a rolling basis measured by looking at the twelve (12) months prior to the date a specific leave is to begin.
The City may recapture any premiums paid for health care for the employee on leave who fails to return to work for reasons other than the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate family member as defined by the FMLA. During the time employees are on unpaid leave, they shall not be entitled to any benefits granted under the terms of this Agreement other than health care.
8.0	2 The City will comply with the Washington State Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) law (RCW 50A), which establishes a program administered through the Washington Employment Security Department (ESD) to provide paid leave benefits to eligible employees who need leave for certain family and medical reasons. The City will post required posters (once available from ESD) to educate employees about this new state benefit and may adopt personnel policies to provide employees with guidance on PFML.
The PFML program is funded through premiums collected by ESD via payroll deductions and employer contributions. For the period ending December 31, 2020, premiums will total four-tenths of one percent (0.4%) of employees’ wages (unless otherwise adjusted by the State). Each year, consistent with the law, employees will pay through payroll deductions the full cost of the premiums associated with family leave benefits and forty-five percent (45%) of the cost of the premiums associated with the medical leave benefits, consistent with RCW 50A. 10.030. Should the State modify
Teamsters Local 231 and City of Ferndale Public Works Collective Bargaining Agreement
1/1/2020-12/31/2022
Page 9
PFML premiums or the percentage of premiums subject to collection through payroll deductions during the term of this Agreement, the City will modify payroll practices to reflect such statutory changes.
Employees can begin applying to ESD for leave and benefits as of January 1, 2020. ESD will make eligibility determinations. When applying to ESD, employees must also notify the City of the need for leave; employees should provide at least 30 days’ advance notice of foreseeable leave and for unforeseeable leave notice should be given as soon as practicable. Consistent with State law, PFML leave must run concurrently with FMLA if both are applicable.
If ESD approves a claim for benefits, benefit payments will be made by ESD directly to an eligible employee. Employees may not supplement the State PFML benefits with accrued or other paid leave from the City and will not be eligible for PFML benefits if receiving time loss benefits through the workers compensation system. When an employee is on leave and receiving PFML benefits from the State, the employee is deemed to be in unpaid status for purposes of City policies. Insurance coverage will be handled in the same manner as other unpaid leaves of absence, pursuant to City policy and subject to any FMLA requirements.
ARTICLE 9
JURY DUTY
9.01 Any employee covered by this Agreement that is called upon for jury service in any Municipal, County, State or Federal Court, shall advise the Employer upon receipt of such call and if taken from their work for such service, shall be reimbursed as provided herein for any loss of wages while actually performing such service provided they exhibit to the Employer their properly endorsed check and permit the Employer to copy the check or voucher they receive for such service.

It is the intent and purpose of the Union and the City to avoid and prevent grievances and misunderstandings. However, should such differences arise, an earnest effort shall be made to settle the difference as soon as practical between the aggrieved employee and/or the Union at the lowest level in the following grievance procedure. Grievances shall be settled in the following manner.
STEP ONE: A grievance shall be first discussed by the employee with his immediate Supervisor with or without his Union Steward present, as desired by the employee, within ten (10) business days of the incident or of the employee knowing of the incident. The Supervisor shall give an answer to the grievance within ten (10) business days of the discussion.
STEP TWO: If the grievance is not settled in Step 1 and the Union wishes to appeal the grievance to Step 2, it shall be referred in writing to the City Administrator within ten (10) business days after the Supervisor’s answer. The written grievance shall contain: (1) Facts upon which the grievance is based, (2) Whenever possible, reference to the section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated, (3) The remedy sought. The City Administrator shall answer within ten (10) business days after receipt of the grievance.
STEP THREE: In the event the grievance is not resolved in Step 2, either party may, within fifteen (15) business days after the City Administrator response, give written notice of arbitration to the other party.
Once the notice of arbitration is provided, the parties shall jointly request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to provide a list of seven (7) arbitrators. The parties shall, at a mutually agreeable time, attempt to agree on an arbitrator from the list. If such efforts fail, the parties shall select an arbitrator by alternately striking one name from the list until only one name remains, said person being the arbitrator. The order of striking shall be by a coin toss. The arbitrator selected shall be jointly notified of his selection.

Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and presenting their case, and 50% of the arbitration fees and all other costs. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties.
All grievances and replies shall be in writing and shall be decided within the maximum periods stipulated, but excluding Saturdays, Sundays and all holidays as business days. The Postmarked date shall be considered as the start date for the purpose of calculating time periods in this Article. No grievance shall advance to the next step until a good faith effort has been made to settle at the lower step unless mutually agreed by the Union and the City. In the event the parties do not comply with the maximum time limits established, the party who has not followed the time limits shall forfeit the grievance and the grievance shall be deemed waived and the other party shall prevail. Grievances so forfeited shall not establish a precedent. The time limits may be extended by mutual agreement of the Union and the City.

1.	If you are asked to attend a meeting with management which you believe may lead to discipline, ask to have a Union steward or business representative present. If possible, notify the Union steward or business representative of the meeting immediately. When in doubt, ask management whether or not anything said at the meeting could lead to disciplinary action.
2.	If you are unable to obtain representation before entering the meeting, you should:
(a)	Ask whether you are free to leave the room if you choose to do so;
(b)	Ask whether anything said at the interview could lead to disciplinary action or discharge;
(c)	If so, ask that (1) a Union steward or business representative be contacted and brought to the meeting place before any questioning occurs, and (2) you be permitted to speak to the Union steward or business representative in private prior to the questioning;
(d)	If a Union steward or business representative is unavailable, ask that the meeting be postponed until one can be present;
(e)	In the event the Employer nonetheless insists on proceeding with the meeting, ask that a fellow employee whom you trust be brought to the meeting to act as a witness.
IF THE EMPLOYER DENIES ANY OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING REQUESTS, THE UNION RECOMMENDS THAT YOU ATTEND THE MEETING BUT EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY LEAD TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION OR DISCHARGE.
