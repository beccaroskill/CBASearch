BETWEEN
TRIUMPH COMPOSITE SYSTEMS, INC.
and
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS
AND AEROSPACE WORKERS, AFL-CIO DISTRICT LODGE 751, LOCAL LODGE 86
THIS AGREEMENT, dated June 04, 2010 by and between Triumph Composite Systems, Inc., (the term "the Company" being hereinafter deemed in each instance to refer to such corporation), and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO, District Lodge 751 and Local Lodge 86, hereafter representing employees of the Company in the units described in Article 1 (the term "the Union" being hereinafter deemed in each instance to refer to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO).
ARTICLE 1
UNION REPRESENTATION
Section 1.1
The Company hereby recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees engaged in production, manufacture, maintenance, installation, repair, and all associated duties, including inspectors, tooling, transportation, building maintenance, shipping, receiving and excluding all other employees, guards and supervisors as defined by the National Labor Relations Act. Aboverecognized employees assigned away from the Spokane Plant are also recognized under this Agreement.
1
Section 1.2	Union Security.
All employees within the bargaining unit as defined in this Agreement, shall become members of the Union within thirty-one (31) days following the beginning of such employment or within thirty-one (31) days following the execution of this Agreement, whichever is later, and shall thereafter maintain their membership in good standing in the Union during the life of this Agreement, as a condition of continued employment.
Section 1.3	Satisfaction of Obligation.
Employees who are required either to become members of the Union or maintain membership in good standing in the Union may satisfy that obligation by periodically tendering to the Union an amount equal to the Union's regular and usual monthly dues.
Section 1.4	Failure to Satisfy Obligation.
In the event an employee who, as a condition of continued employment, is required to become a member of the Union, or maintain his membership in good standing therein, but in any such case does not do so, the Union will notify the Company in writing, or through such other office as may be designated by the Company, of such employee's delinquency. The Company agrees to advise such employee that his employment status with the Company is in jeopardy and that his failure to meet his obligation within five (5) days will result in his termination of employment.
Section 1.5	Explanation to Employees.
Either the Company or the Union may explain to any employee or call to his attention, at any time, his rights and obligations under any or all provisions of this Agreement.
Section 1.6	Indemnification.
The Union shall indemnify, defend and save the Company harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of action taken by the Company under Section 1.4 in reliance upon representation by the Union that an employee may be lawfully discharged under Section 1.4 of this Article. Such requests for discharge shall be made by registered mail from the Directing Business Representative (or his designee) to the Director of Human Resources (or his designee).
2
Section 1.7	Payroll Deduction for Union Dues and Initiation Fee.
The Company shall make payroll deductions for the Union's initiation fee, and its regular and usual monthly dues, upon receipt by the office designated by the Company of a voluntary written assignment from the employee covering such deductions on a form mutually agreed to by the Union and the Company. The list of such deductions will be itemized to include each such employee's social security number or permanent employee number, name, and amount of deduction, and such itemization will be forwarded to the Union. The initiation fee or regular and usual monthly dues shall either be in amounts that are specified on such assignments, or pursuant to a written formula, submitted by the Union to the Company which, in either case, the Company has approved in writing in advance as being administratively practicable.
Section 1.8	Contributions to Machinists' Nonpartisan Political League.
Upon receipt by the Company of a signed voluntary authorization by an employee, on a form approved by the Company, requesting that there be deductions made from his wages, in a monthly amount designated by the employee, such deductions to be forwarded to the Union for use by the Machinists' Nonpartisan Political League, the Company will thereafter make such deductions and forward them to the Machinists' Nonpartisan Political League, care of the Union. Such authorization will remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement, unless earlier canceled in writing by the employee.
Section 1.9	Contributions to Guide Dogs of America.
Upon receipt by the Company of a signed voluntary authorization by an employee, on a form approved by the Company, requesting that there be deductions made from his wages, in a monthly amount designated by the employee, such deductions to be forwarded to the Union for use by Guide Dogs of America, the Company will thereafter make such deductions and forward them to Guide Dogs of America, care of the Union. Such authorization will remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement, unless earlier canceled in writing by the employee.
ARTICLE 2
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS CLAUSE
Section 2.1
The management of the plant and direction of the working force is vested exclusively in the Company which shall include, but in no way limit, the right to hire, promote to supervision, suspend, demote from
3
supervision, discipline or discharge for cause, to transfer or lay off because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons, to determine the type of products to be manufactured and the method of manufacturing, to determine the location of the plant, or any department thereof, to determine whether components, pieces, parts or assemblies or subassemblies shall be manufactured or purchased, to determine whether inspection, research, design and maintenance services will be performed by members of the bargaining unit or purchased from others, and to plan and schedule production, determine methods and processes and means of manufacturing, to enforce reasonable plant rules on a uniform basis, and to determine what constitutes good and efficient plant practices or operation. The foregoing management rights clause is limited only by and subject to those matters specifically set forth in this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3
JOINT RESPONSIBILITIES OF COMPANY AND UNION
Section 3.1	Communication.
Realizing that certain commitments from both Management and the Union are essential for the long-range success of the Company, the parties agree to take the following necessary steps to achieve both business and personal goals. By working together with mutual respect and a positive business attitude, the parties will be able to share in profit-making decisions which are necessary to carry the Company successfully through the twenty-first century.
1.	The parties will work closely together in a cooperative relationship that extends from the shop floor to the top site management offices in order to solve problems quickly and effectively in a harmonious manner.
2.	Both parties will work at improving communication skills in various ways. As a starting point the following commitments will be agreed to as positive means to add structured communication to the organization.
a)	The Management of the Company will, at a minimum, agree to hold Company meetings which share honest, relevant information about past business performance and future business plans.
4
b)	A joint committee of Union Stewards and Management representatives will meet every other week to discuss day-to-day matters affecting the combined efforts of both parties.
3.	In the interest of achieving a positive business operation, Union and Management representatives agree mutual responsibility "must" be shared for establishing a positive, productive work environment. To that degree, it is agreed that:
a)	A Senior Manager will be available at all times to intercede in matters of importance on the shop floor which require immediate attention. The parties especially recognize that any behavior which outwardly shows disrespect for individuals will not be tolerated by Union or Management personnel and must be dealt with immediately.
b)	The Company will notify the Union Business Representative, in writing (including email), within five (5) working days of any changes to Human Resources policies, procedures or changes to the Employee Handbook that affect the collective bargaining unit employees.
Section 3.2	Lean Manufacturing Philosophy.
3.2(a) It is the intent of labor and management to promote a culture of continuous improvement. To this end, all products new and existing will be produced in keeping with lean manufacturing principles. At the time of introduction of a new product or re-configuration of an existing product, the manpower, skills requirements and IAM contractual job classifications will be identified and assigned to meet the planned production hours to manufacture the product. The employees assigned to the team will perform tasks required to manufacture and ship the product.
By applying Lean Manufacturing Principles, it is our objective to:
•	Create a sense of ownership among workers.
•	Make improvements an expectation of workers.
•	Create a structure of teams to utilize workers' ideas.
•	Be open to new ideas from teams.
•	Provide workers with training required to improving technologies and strategies.
5
•	Support teams as partners in improvements.
•	Encourage a culture that permits change and experimentation to improve our processes.
In all these matters we recognize mutual support reflects mutual success. These commitments have been developed to enhance the collective bargaining procedure -- not to replace it and will not supersede other articles of this Agreement.
3.2(b) Lean Process Improvement (“LPI”) Guidelines. Non-bargaining unit employees can design, manufacture or modify first unit run of products, shadow boards, shop layout, cards or similar equipment to be used for test or non-production prototype purposes. Non-bargaining unit employees can perform initial equipment cleaning as part of LPI.
Only IAM employees will manufacture production parts, tools, or assemblies and perform follow-on cloning of duplicate equipment. All activities, such as clean up, floor configuration and moving of equipment after an LPI event has been completed, which has customarily and historically been performed by IAM employees, will continue to be performed by IAM employees.
The Company will not assign Spokane plant work, which has customarily and historically been performed by IAM-represented employees, to non-IAM employees working at the plant (including management employees) except for training, safety, lean process improvement, and emergencies.
3.2(c) The Company and the Union agree that parts, materials, tools (excluding production tooling), and other goods or products furnished by an external supplier, vendor, contractor, or subcontractor may initially be delivered, managed or presented to the Company at specific locations to be designated by the Company with input from the Union. Once a vendor or supplier delivers supplies or products to their place of rest, all further movement will be by IAM-represented employees. No bargaining unit employee will be laid off as a consequence of vendor deliveries.
3.2(d) Computer and Phone Service Support. It is mutually agreed that non-union and IAM represented employees can work together to support moving phones and computers. This joint effort will allow employees to move phone and computing equipment hardware, pull cables, fiber optic lines, etc. The union and the company agree that this working relationship will not initiate jurisdictional ownership, complaints or grievances.
6
Section 3.3	Non-Discrimination.
The Company and Union agree that there shall be no discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, sex, creed, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry or age contrary to provisions of any Federal or State Law.
Section 3.4	Drug-Alcohol Policy.
The Company and the Union mutually recognize the necessity for the Company's policy on drug and alcohol abuse.
Section 3.5	Training.
The Company and the Union mutually recognize the necessity for a description of the qualifications and representative assignments for each job classification. The Company will continue its policy of training employees for future advancement opportunities.
Section 3.6	Safety Committee.
The Company agrees to create a Safety Committee consisting of equal numbers of Management Representatives and Bargaining Unit Representatives to be chosen by the respective parties.
Section 3.7	Employee Reviews.
The Company will review the general performance of each employee at least once annually. An Employee Evaluation Report will be completed by the employee’s Supervisor. The result of this evaluation will be discussed with the employee. The employee has the right to attach his/her own comments and statements, and talk to upper management, if he/she disagrees with any part of the evaluation. There shall also be space on the evaluation form for the employee to state his/her work goals, areas for training and improvement, and promotion requests. Such evaluations are an employee communication and development tool. Upon request employees will be given a copy of their individual reviews within five (5) working days.
ARTICLE 4
UNION REPRESENTATIVES AND UNION ACTIVITY
Section 4.1	Union to Furnish List of Representatives.
The Union shall inform the Company in writing of the names of its Grand Lodge representatives,
7
officers, Business Representatives and stewards who are accredited to represent it, which information shall be kept up to date at all times. Only persons so designated will be accepted by the Company as representatives of the Union.
Section 4.2	Bulletin Boards.
The Company shall provide bulletin boards for the Union's use in areas conveniently accessible to bargaining unit employees. New and replacement boards will be at least three (3) feet by four (4) feet in size. The Union may maintain the boards for the purpose of notifying employees of matters pertaining to Union business. All notices shall be signed by a representative of the Union who is authorized by the Union to approve Union notices.
Section 4.3	Union Representatives' Access to Plants.
Union representatives will be permitted access during working hours to areas in the Company's facilities where employees in the bargaining units defined in Article 1 hereof are assigned, for the purpose of conducting Union business to the extent government or customer regulations permit.
Section 4.4	Conditions Relating to Access to Plants.
Access of Union representatives to Company facilities for the purpose of investigating complaints or claims of grievance on the part of employees or the Union shall be subject to the following:
4.4(a) The Company shall be required to admit only those accredited Business Representatives who are being admitted as of the effective date of this Agreement, and such other Business Representatives as may be accredited by the Union as provided in Section 4.1 above, who provide the Company with sufficient advance notice of their visit.
4.4(b) Business Representatives and Union representatives who are entitled under Section 4.3 to admittance to the Company's facilities shall sign in where required through the Company-designated organization at the plant. Upon being admitted, they shall proceed to the shop or organization they wish to visit, contact the supervisor then present, inform him of the purpose of their visit and obtain his permission prior to contacting any employee in such shop or organization. Such permission will be granted except where there is a substantial reason for delaying the contact due to safety conditions or the fact that a critical operation is in process. Upon leaving the plant or facility they shall sign out and return any temporary identification badges which were issued for the purpose of the specific visit.
8
4.4(c) Business Representatives and Union representatives granted admittance to the Company's facilities under this Article 4 shall not engage in organizing or campaigning for Union or political office on Company premises. This Section 4.4(c) will not be interpreted as preventing Business Representatives or Union representatives from discussing, in non-work areas during non-work periods, matters of Union membership, fees or dues, with employees who are within one of the collective bargaining units described in Article 1 of this Agreement.
4.4(d) Union representatives who fail to comply with the provisions of Sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 shall forfeit their admittance rights.
Section 4.5	Union Activity During Working Hours.
Solicitation of Union membership or collection or checking of dues will not be conducted during working time. The Company agrees not to discriminate in any way against any employee for Union activity, but such activity shall not be carried on during working time, except as specifically allowed by the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 4.6	Stewards.
The provisions and rules regarding stewards shall be as follows:
4.6(a) The Union may designate one (1) employee as a steward for each seventy-five (75) employees, or fraction thereof, up to a maximum of three (3) for each shift. In the absence of the regular steward for any reason, the Union may designate a temporary steward to act for the regular steward. Such designation shall be in writing.
4.6(b) The effective appointment date of a steward will be the third workday following the date on which the appointment letter from the Union is received by the applicable designated office of the Company, provided the appointment is determined to be in conformance with Section 4.6(a) above.
4.6(c) The Company will notify the Union of cases requiring a selective reduction in the number of stewards to conform with Section 4.6(a) above. Within three (3) workdays following the date the Union receives such notice from the Company, the Union will notify the Company of the names of the appropriate number of individuals the Union desires to have deleted from the Company records as stewards. No surplus action will affect such excess stewards during such
9
three (3)-workday period. The above three (3)-workday waiting period will not apply in the handling of situations wherein no selective reduction is involved.
4.6(d) An employee while serving as a steward shall not be surplused, transferred or loaned from his job classification, or his shift so long as other employees remain in his job title, and on the shift for which he is designated as steward. If he is not eligible so to remain in his job classification, he will be offered a downgrade to the highest job classification within his normal line of promotion which is then being utilized on the shift for which he is designated as steward. If he declines such a downgrade or if he is relieved of his steward's status prior to such downgrade action, he will then be subject to normal surplusing procedures as provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
4.6(e) Stewards will be promoted and recalled from layoff on the same basis as provided in this Agreement for other employees, except that in the event a shift in a shop is deactivated and is reactivated by the Company within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after such deactivation, the former steward will be offered an opportunity to return to that shift provided the Company determines to utilize the steward's former job classification or a lower classification in the same job family in such shift within such one hundred twenty (120)-day period, and further provided that the former steward has not been replaced as steward by the Union in the interim.
4.6(f) A steward will retain his steward status while on approved medical leave of absence, provided that he has not been replaced as steward by the Union prior to expiration of such leave.
Section 4.7	Departure from Work Assignment by Stewards to Investigate Complaints or Claims of Grievance.
In order to permit a well regulated shop, each steward shall notify and obtain permission from his supervisor before leaving his work assignment for the purpose of investigating complaints or claims of grievance on the part of employees or the Union or contacting the Business Representative in regard to such claim or grievance. Such permission shall be granted except where there is a substantial reason for delaying the contact or the investigation due to safety conditions or the fact that a critical operation is in process. The supervisor may be present during any discussion relating to any complaint or grievance. However, upon the request of an employee or steward, the supervisor shall authorize a steward to participate in a private discussion with an employee or Business Representative, relating to a complaint or grievance. Discussions of the type described in Section 4.7 will require the employee or steward to clock in to "Union business." Any
10
charge alleging that a steward is spending an unreasonable amount of time (in excess of twenty (20) hours per month) in handling grievances or disputes, or performing other duties of stewards, shall be referred to the Director, Human Resources or Designee and discussed with the District President with a view to adjustment of such complaint. The twenty (20) hour reference above is not intended to restrict the ability of the steward to conduct Union business in excess of twenty (20) hours per month.
Section 4.8	Departure from Work for Union Business.
Except as provided in Section 4.7 above, each steward, local lodge officer or district council delegate with authorization from the Union, shall give his supervisor at least twenty-four (24)-hour advance notice if possible and clock out prior to departure from his work assignment to conduct Union business. If the work assignment given the steward, local lodge officer or district council delegate seriously interferes with the performance of his duties for the Union, or if Union business seriously interferes with his work assignment, the Company and the Union agree to cooperate in making arrangements to prevent such interference in the future. Stewards, local lodge officers and district council delegates shall not be paid for such Union business provided, that nonpayment by the Company for time spent on Union business shall not be considered as a penalty. This Section 4.8 shall apply to cases of stewards who are designated to act for Business Representatives in accordance with this Article for the temporary period the steward is authorized as a designee.
The Company agrees to grant a leave of absence without pay and without loss of seniority to any employee, not to exceed three (3) employees in number, for the purpose of attending a labor conference, it being further understood that such leaves shall not accumulate to more than ten (10) working days in any calendar year, and that such leaves of absence shall be requested by the employee in writing with as much advance notice as possible and countersigned by the Union. Additional leave or employees will not be unreasonably denied.
ARTICLE 5
WORKWEEK, HOURS OF WORK, SHIFTS
Section 5.1	Workweek.
The normal work schedule shall consist of five (5) consecutive workdays, Monday through Friday, followed by two (2) days of rest (Saturday and Sunday).
11
Section 5.2	Short Workweek.
The Company, upon receiving prior agreement with the Union, may deem it advisable to work any number of employees on a short workweek. The Union and the affected employees will be notified in advance which days are to be worked and such days worked shall be consecutive.
Section 5.3	Shifts; Lunch Periods; Rest Periods.
Each employee shall be assigned to a definite shift with designated times of beginning and ending. All shifts shall be an eight (8) hour and thirty (30) minute period, which shall include a thirty (30) minute unpaid lunch period. The designated times of beginning each shift during the scheduled workweek shall be: first shift - between 5:00 A.M. and 8:30 A.M.; second shift - between 1:30 P.M. and 6:00 P.M.; third shift - between 10:00 P.M. and 1:30 A.M. of the following day. Each employee shall be given a fifteen (15)-minute rest period in each half of the shift to which he is assigned, the time of starting each such rest period to be designated by the Company. Each employee who is required to report for work two (2) or more hours prior to the start of his regular shift shall receive a ten (10)-minute rest period prior to the start of his regular shift. Each employee who is scheduled to work two (2) or more hours of overtime after his regular shift shall receive a ten (10)-minute rest period prior to the start of the overtime. Changes of shift assignments shall be made on the first day of a new workweek whenever practicable.
Section 5.4	Shift Preference.
In order to ensure operational efficiency, the Company shall have the exclusive right to assign employees to any shift. Subject to the foregoing, senior employees who have a shift preference on file shall be given preference over junior employees who are assigned to the same job classification and shift, junior returning non-bargaining unit employees, new hires, recalls from layoff, and promotional candidates for placement in openings in their job classification and organization. Employees who have requested downgrades will not be given preference over senior employees in their organization who have shift preferences on file. Shift preferences must be filed more than three (3) working days prior to an organization effecting a shift change or declaring a job opening by submission of a dated open requisition. If an employee does not file a shift preference, it shall be assumed that he is on his preferred shift. If an employee does file a shift preference, it shall be assumed that it is his shift preference, and the Company shall have the right to act on it. Under no circumstances will the provisions of this Section 5.4 be construed to enable an employee, at his instance and request, to displace a less senior employee from his job and shift.
12
5.4(a) As stated, shift preferences as defined will not apply in instances where the exercise of such rights would affect the efficiency of Company operations in any organization on any shift. When such instances arise, it shall be the responsibility of the Company to prepare an exception request. Exception requests shall be discussed with the Union prior to submittal for final approval.
5.4(a)(1) When staffing a new shift, the Company maintains the right to assign employees necessary to accomplish the work, including the right to assign employees with key skills regardless of their shift preference.

Seniority employees as of June 1 each year are eligible, and also probationary employees on June 1 are eligible for a pro-rated bonus as described below, if they subsequently earn seniority.
All Company straight-time compensated hours, whether actually worked or paid leave, such as vacation, holiday, or PTO, will count as an hour worked for the pro-rated formula below.

a.	Employees who have a minimum of one thousand forty (1,040) straight-time compensated hours in the twelve (12) months prior to June 1 - full bonus
b.	Employees who have less than one thousand forty (1,040) straight-time compensated hours in the twelve (12) months prior to June 1 - bonus pro-rated according to formula:

Section 6.4	Cost of Living.
Employees covered by this Agreement shall receive Cost of Living Adjustments to the extent such adjustments become effective under and in accordance with all of the terms, conditions and limitations stated in this Section 6.4.
Seniority employees will be eligible to receive COLA increases as defined below. This payment will be based on months of active service and prorated accordingly. COLA calculations will be cumulative from each six (6) month period to six (6) month period.
A.	The Company agrees to a COLA which shall be adjusted, as set forth below, for changes in the cost of living during the life of this Agreement.
B.	Eligibility for COLA is extended to employees in the bargaining unit, including those on leaves of absence on a pro-rated basis as indicated above.
C.	The basis for determining COLA will be as follows: The COLA will be determined in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) (United States City Average, All Items, 1982-84=100), published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), United States Department of Labor, and hereinafter referred to as the “BLS Consumer Price Index.”
D.	The amount of the COLA which shall be effective for the periods provided below shall be based on the percent of increase between the average for the prior six (6) months and the Peg Point (213.34 equals $0.00) with one cent ($0.01) adjustment for each full 0.075% change in the average BLS Consumer Price Index for the appropriate six (6) month period indicated.
E.	The COLA shall be calculated and paid on a semi-annual basis, in the form of a lump sum payment. Said payment will be paid on or before September 1 and March 1 of each year.
17
F.	No adjustments, retroactive or otherwise, shall be made due to any revision, which may later be made in the published figures of the BLS Consumer Price Index for any base month.
The parties agree that the continuance of the COLA is dependent upon the availability of the official monthly BLS Consumer Price Index in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the BLS Consumer Price Index for the second six (6) months, calendar year 2010.
NOTE: Thirteen payroll periods constitute the referenced six (6) months. The Company will pay five-sixths (5/6), or 83.33%, of the COLA applicable to the period January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013, regardless of whether a renewal contract is negotiated and regardless of its terms.
Section 6.5	Gain Sharing Program.
The Company and Union will continue the current productivity-based incentive plan. This Gain Sharing Program is designed to motivate employees to meet or exceed production goals, established by management, with a payment not to exceed twice their normal weekly pay. Changes in the gain sharing formula, criteria, or structure shall be made at Company discretion after consultation with the Gain Sharing Committee and Business Representative.
Section 6.6	Shift Differentials.
6.6(a) An employee assigned to the second or third shift shall receive a shift differential of seventy-five cents ($0.75) per hour which shall be added to his base rate and made a part thereof.
Section 6.7	Jury Duty, Witness Duty, Military Leave, Bereavement Leave.
6.7(a) Jury Duty. An employee absent from work due to (1) required jury duty (including grand jury duty), (2) to testify as a witness for the Company, (3) to respond to a subpoena to appear as a witness in any legal proceeding, (4) to appear at an arbitration resulting from the referral, by a court, for a lawsuit that has been filed with the court (excluding arbitration pursuant to a Collective Bargaining Agreement or other contractual provisions) or (5) to respond to a subpoena to appear for a deposition will be paid for such lost hours at his current straight time rate, up to a maximum of eight (8) hours per day, for each regular work day of required jury or witness duty. Employees will be excused from their scheduled shift for each day they serve if they miss four (4) hours of their shift for such duty. In addition, an employee will not be required to report to work prior to jury duty, but shall report back to work if released from jury
18
duty before noon. Second and third shift employees summoned to jury or witness duty will be temporarily assigned to first shift on a weekly basis during the time required to serve. Fees received for jury or witness duty will not be deducted from such pay. To be eligible for time off with pay, the employee must furnish a copy of this summons or subpoena to management, before the appearance, to indicate that the absence from work as necessary to appear for a jury duty or to serve as a witness. In addition, management may require verification of such appearance. An employee is not entitled to pay under this Section 6.7(a) in circumstances where the employee (1) is called as a witness against the Company or its interests; or (2) is called as a witness on his own behalf in an action in which he is a party; or (3) voluntarily seeks to testify as a witness; or (4) is a witness in a case arising from or related to his outside employment or outside business activities; or (5) is subpoenaed as a witness while on leave of absence except when serving as a Company witness.
If an employee (regardless of shift assignment) is called for jury duty, his/her shift assignment will be considered as first shift, with a start time of 8:00 a.m. The effect of this would be if an employee is called for jury duty and is released before noon, he/she would be required to return to the plant and work until 4:30 p.m.
6.7(b) Military Leave. An employee who is a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces, who is absent due to required active annual training duty or temporary special services duty, shall be paid his normal straight time earnings, including shift differential where applicable, up to a maximum of ten (10) workdays each calendar year. An employee who, because of schedule adjustments by the reserve component, receives orders to report for two (2) training periods in one (1) calendar year may receive time off with pay in excess of the ten (10)-day annual maximum provided that the total time off with pay does not exceed twenty (20) workdays in a two (2) consecutive year period (either current and previous calendar years or current and following calendar years) and the employee was a member of the reserve component during both of the applicable consecutive years. Employees with military orders to serve additional days of duty will be excused on unpaid authorized leave of absence. The amount due the employee under this Section 6.7(b) shall be reduced by the amount received from the government body identified with such training duty or services, for the period of such duty (up to the maximum period mentioned above). Such items as subsistence, uniform and travel allowance shall not be included in determining pay received from state or federal government.
19
6.7(c) Bereavement Leave. Up to three (3) days bereavement leave with pay will be granted to an employee on the active payroll who, because of death in his immediate family, takes time off from work during his normal work schedule as such term is defined in Section 5.1 of this Agreement. Such pay shall be for eight (8) hours at his straight time base rate, including shift differential where applicable for each such day off; however, such pay will not be applicable if the employee receives pay for such days off under any other provision of this Agreement. Bereavement leave must be taken on consecutive workdays as selected by the employee within twenty (20) calendar days following the death (or evidence of belated notification of death). For the purposes of this Section 6.7(c) the "immediate family" is defined as follows: spouse, mother, father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, children, brother, sister, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, greatgrandparents, grandparents, grandchildren, stepmother, stepfather, stepchildren, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law and spouse's grandparents. In addition, an employee will be granted bereavement leave for a stillborn child if the employee provides a certificate of fetal death which has been certified by the attending physician.
Section 6.8	Garnishments.
In cases of dismissal or suspension of an employee because of writs of garnishment served upon the Company in litigation involving claims of third parties against such employee, such a dismissal or suspension will be treated as a dismissal or suspension and will be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 6.9	Paydays.
Paydays for employees under this Agreement on all shifts shall be on or before Friday of every second week at which time they will be paid, via direct deposit, through Friday of the preceding week, except when circumstances intervening beyond the Company's control make such practice impossible. When a holiday falls on Friday during the normal payday week, direct deposits will be made on the preceding Thursday.
Section 6.10	Report Time.
6.10(a) If an employee reports for work in accordance with instructions, he shall receive a minimum of four (4) hours pay at his straight time base rate, including shift differential where applicable. Report time will not apply in case of emergency shutdowns arising out of any condition beyond the Company's control. An employee who leaves work of his own volition, or because of incapacity (other than industrial injury or illness), or is discharged or suspended after beginning work, will be paid only for the number of hours actually worked during that day. An
20
employee who leaves work because of incapacity due to industrial injury or illness will be paid eight (8) hours pay at his straight time base rate, including shift differential where applicable.
6.10(b) In the event of an emergency such as fire, flood, power failure, snow, etc., beyond the control of the Company (lack of work cannot be construed as an emergency) or where the employee voluntarily quits, is laid off, or is discharged, the foregoing requirement shall not be applicable and the employee shall be paid for actual time worked.
6.10(c) In an emergency, prior to shift report time, the Employer will make an effort, by telephone or radio to notify the employees not to report for work and employees should call the Company status line and listen to the local media to find out whether to report to work.
Section 6.11	Overtime.
6.11(a) The normal working day shall consist of eight (8) hours, and the normal workweek shall consist of forty (40) hours.
6.11(b) All time worked in excess of eight (8) hours in one (1) day shall be paid at time and one-half for the first two (2) hours and then double time thereafter.
6.11(c) All time worked on Saturday shall be paid at time and one-half for the first eight (8) hours and double time thereafter, providing an employee has forty (40) straight time compensated hours in the current workweek unless such shortfall is due to Company actions.
6.11(d) All time worked on Sunday shall be paid at double time providing an employee has forty (40) straight time compensated hours in the current week plus eight (8) hours on Saturday. If an employee has no time worked on Saturday, anytime on Sunday shall be paid at time and one-half. However, if an employee has no time worked on Saturday due to Company action, overtime on Sunday will be paid at double time. All time worked on fixed holidays shall be paid at double time. The double time on holidays shall be in addition to the holiday pay specific in Article 7.
6.11(e) Each time any employee is called back to work after the close of his work shift, he shall be paid a minimum of three (3) hours, at applicable overtime rates.
21
6.11(f) The Company will attempt to meet its overtime requirements on a voluntary basis among the employees who perform the work on a straight time basis through the week; however, in cases of offering overtime, new hires or rehires may be excluded for the overtime for the first fifteen (15) calendar days of their employment. In the event there are insufficient qualified volunteers within the work group to meet the requirements, the supervisors may designate and require the necessary number of employees to work the overtime. Reasonable effort will be made by classification and shift to equalize overtime. An employee who has pre-approved vacation or PTO (not vacation being used in lieu of PTO) on a Friday preceding or a Monday following shall not be designated overtime on that weekend.
Employees shall not be required to work more than thirty-two (32) hours of voluntary or designated overtime in a calendar month. The Company will not assign designated overtime to an employee on more than two (2) consecutive weekends or two (2) weekends total in a calendar month. “Weekend” means Saturday or Saturday/Sunday. Employees shall not be required to work overtime on a contract holiday weekend. Any overtime in excess of these rules shall be on a voluntary basis. Overtime in excess of one hundred twenty-eight (128) hours in a calendar quarter shall be compensated at a double time rate, regardless of what the rate would otherwise have been for those hours.
The parties agree that based on Triumph’s Ceridian Payroll Calendar, payroll quarters will begin as follows:
Payroll Quarters	Payroll Quarter Beginning	Payroll Quarter Ending
2nd - 2010 3rd - 2010 4th - 2010	March 22, 2010 June 14, 2010 September 20, 2010	June 13, 2010 September 19, 2010 December 26, 2010

The Company will provide notification of designated weekend overtime no later than the first rest break on Friday. When emergency situations arise following first rest break, notification of such overtime will be provided as soon as possible.

Employees shall be paid for time worked in fifteen (15) minute increments, rounded off on the basis of seven and one-half (7.5) minute increments.
Section 6.13	New Assignments.

Section 6.14	Temporary Assignments.
A temporary assignment will remain in effect for a period of not more than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days (or for ninety (90) consecutive calendar days if the assignment is a direct replacement for an employee on medical leave of absence, travel assignment, or temporary supervisory assignment) or for such longer period as may be designated by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. The Business Representative shall be provided with notification of temporary assignments that are estimated to be in effect for sixty (60) or more days prior to or coincident with the effective date of such assignments. The foregoing time period limitation will not apply in instances where an employee is on travel assignment. Repetitive temporary assignments shall not be used to fill a permanent job opening.

ARTICLE 8
VACATION PLAN
Section 8.1	General.
Reasonable time away from the job is conducive to good health and well being and is considered in the best interest of the employee and the Company. Each employee should have the opportunity to schedule and take vacation each year and thereby use their vacation credits, allowing adequate staffing for Company operations.
Section 8.2	Accumulation of Vacation.
8.2(a) Vacation credits are accrued on a per-compensated hour basis excluding overtime and awarded every pay period with credits increasing on the basis of established increments as follows:
25
Company Service Annual Vacation
1 thru 2 years	40 hours
3 thru 4 years	80 hours
5 thru 9 years	96 hours
10 and 11 years	120 hours
12 and 13 years	128 hours
14 and 15 years	136 hours
16 and 17 years	144 hours
18 years or more	160 hours
Company service date will be used to determine the credits to be awarded. Vacation credits may accumulate to a maximum of forty (40) additional hours above Annual Vacation credit (as determined from above schedule). No additional vacation credits will be accrued until the number of credits in the account drops below the maximum.
Vacation credits will not be accrued in excess of ninety (90) calendar days on a leave of absence.
Section 8.3	Use of Vacation Credits.
8.3(a) Subject to management approval based on Company work schedule requirements, previously awarded vacation credits may be used by the employee without limit. Management will encourage employee use of vacation for time off within the period credits are available. Use of vacation at times convenient to the employee will be arranged to the extent permitted by Company work schedule requirements, provided the employee provides the Company with twenty-four (24) hours advance notice. Once a vacation request has been submitted, the Company will respond promptly, no later than seven (7) calendar days, absent agreement to some other response time. If an employee asks for vacation within twenty-four (24) hours, the Company will answer that request before the end of the shift.
8.3(b) Vacations are to be taken as time off. Unused vacation credits, in excess of the maximum limit, will be paid in lieu at the employee's base rate, including shift differential where applicable if the nonuse of vacation was due to the fault of the Company.
8.3(c) Subject to 8.3(a), vacation credits may be used in two (2) hour increments.
26
8.3(d) Holidays occurring while an employee is on vacation are not deducted from vacation credits.
8.3(e) Payment for vacations will be made at the employee's base rate in effect at the time vacation is taken, including shift differential.
8.3(f) An employee on leave of absence shall be required to use one-half of these vacation credits at the time of the leave consistent with Articles 9 and 15, subject to the provisions of Section 8.3(c). This provision does not apply in the case of industrial illness or injury.
Section 8.4 Vacation Payment on Termination.
An employee who terminates for any reason will be paid for all unused credits in his or her vacation account through the last day worked.
ARTICLE 9
PAID TIME OFF (PTO)
Section 9.1.
On the first pay period of each calendar year, eligible employees will be credited forty (40) paid time off (“PTO”) hours.
PTO is to be scheduled, whenever possible, in advance (end of shift prior day). This PTO program is not intended to allow a pattern of abuse of unscheduled PTO use by employees, and such activities may be subject to the attendance policy.
Unused PTO will be cashed out no later than the second pay period of each calendar year, for the previous year.
1.	If all PTO use in prior year was scheduled, 125% of unused balance will be cashed out.
2.	If no PTO used at all, 150% of unused PTO balance will be cashed out.
27
Pre-shift call in for sickness in an eight (8) hour increment will count as a scheduled PTO. PTO use after shift has started is considered unscheduled.
Employees can use PTO in minimum of one (1) hour increments.
To be eligible for the annual forty (40) hours PTO, employees must have actually worked some part of the calendar year prior to December 31 of the year in question (forty (40) hours annual credit reduced pro-rata if employee is absent for any reason longer than ninety (90) days in prior calendar year).
PTO credit will be pro-rated for new hires, following their probationary period:
For example:
1.	If hired July 01, 2010 and employee gains seniority on October 01, 2010, then he earns twenty (20) hours immediately on October 1, and forty (40) more hours on January 01 of the next year.

Section 13.6	Misassignment Grievances.

Applicants and employees will be furnished a copy of the Health Care Provider's report and/or medical recommendation upon their request. If an employee is found to be incapable of performing the work functions of the job title because of a medical recommendation, the Company will attempt to place such employee in available work which, in the opinion of the Company, he is medically capable of performing. In the event that reassignment to a lower labor grade, denial of promotion, denial of return to active employment, involuntary separation from the payroll or other adverse action results from the Company's finding of medical disqualification, the Union may take such finding through the regular grievance channels; and such grievance, in order to be processed, (a) must be supported by medical testimony which is contradictory to the Company's findings and (b) must be filed by the Business Representative with the designated representative of the Company within seven (7) workdays after the date of such reassignment to a lower labor grade, such denial of promotion, such denial of return to active employment, such involuntary separation from the payroll or such other adverse action.
17.5	(a) The Company will maintain emergency first aid service at other locations unless such service is available from military or other sources.
47
17.5	(b) When an employee at work requires immediate medical attention by a private medical practitioner or at a hospital due to an industrial injury/illness or exposure to hazardous agents in the work environment, and the employee is not able to provide his own transportation, the Company will provide the transportation to and from the employee's normal work location. If such an employee is returned to his work location too late to use his normal transportation home, the Company will provide that transportation.
Section 17.6	Medical Recommendations.
17.6(a) A medical recommendation is a description of an employee's functional capabilities (i.e. physical or cognitive abilities) which are limited due to a medical condition. Medical recommendations are issued by the Company based on a review of relevant information, including information from the employee's community Health Care Provider when available.
17.6(b) An employee who may need a new medical recommendation or the removal of a current medical recommendation, shall have the responsibility to report to the Company designated location and provide the following information, as applicable:
17.6(b)(1) Upon the employee's return to work, the employee's community Health Care Provider's statement including the date the employee is released to return to work, and the employee's functional capabilities;
17.6(b)(2) To report for re-evaluation when the period of a time-limited medical recommendation has elapsed, with a statement from the employee's community Health Care Provider regarding the functional capabilities if available;
17.6(b)(3) A statement by the employee's community Health Care Provider pertaining to his medical condition, or change to such condition, including a statement of the employee's functional capacities.
If the Company agrees that the medical condition of the employee warrants the initiation, removal or modification of a medical recommendation, such action will be taken. A medical recommendation placed in an employee's folder will be removed when the medical recommendation expires, or is discontinued by the Company.
48
Section 17.7	Employees with Injuries or Illnesses.
The parties agree to follow the Company's Return to Work Policy for employees who are unable to perform any functions of their job because of injury or illness. Such policy will be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union.
Section 17.8	Employee Assistance.
The parties will cooperate in expanding employee assistance programs in order to promote the health and well-being of the workforce. These programs include the following:
17.	8(a) Wellness Programs. The Company will emphasize programs to improve the health and wellness of the workforce. Examples would include health monitoring, exercise, hypertension classes, weight loss programs and stop-smoking classes.
17.	8(b) Joint Company-Union Alcohol and Drug Dependency Program. The parties recognize that drug and alcohol usage can adversely affect an employee's job performance and the maintenance of a safe and productive work environment and can undermine public trust and confidence in the Company's products. Accordingly, they agree to cooperate in substance abuse awareness and education.
ARTICLE 18
STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS
The Union agrees that during the term of this Agreement, and regardless of whether an unfair labor practice is alleged (a) there will be no strike, sit-down, slow down, picketing, walk-out or any other interruption of work and (b) the Union will not directly or indirectly authorize, encourage or approve any refusal on the part of employees to proceed to the location of normal work assignment where no rare or unusual physical hazard is involved in proceeding to such location. Any employee who violates this clause shall be subject to discipline. The Company agrees that during the term of this Agreement there will be no lockout of employees covered by this Agreement. Any claim by either party that the other party has violated this Article 18 shall not be subject to the grievance procedure or arbitration provisions of this Agreement, and either party shall have the right to submit such claim to the court.
49
ARTICLE 19
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Should differences arise between the Company and its employees (either individually or collectively) as to the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agreement or should differences arise about matters not specifically mentioned in this Agreement having to do with wages, hours, or conditions of employment, an earnest effort shall be made to settle any such differences at the earliest possible time by use of the following procedure:
STEP 1: The aggrieved employee shall present his grievance to his Supervisor with a Steward present, and the grievance shall be answered by the Supervisor before the end of the second working day following the day on which the grievance was presented to the Supervisor. The grievance must be presented within ten (10) working days of the event resulting in the grievance or within ten (10) working days after the subject of the grievance is known to the employee, or shall not be considered.
STEP 2: If the grievance is not adjusted satisfactorily in Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure, it shall be reduced to writing, signed by the employee and/or Steward, and presented to the Senior Manager or his designee. Said Management shall meet with the Steward at a time mutually agreed upon, but in no event later than five (5) working days after receipt of such written grievance. The Management's written answer shall be given within two (2) working days following the meeting in which the limit may be extended by mutual agreement between the parties. Both the Company and the Union may have additional parties participate in meetings at this step of the Grievance Procedure, and it is understood that such persons shall have reasonable access to the plant for the purpose of discussing the grievance.
STEP 3: If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled, the Union may move the grievance to Step 3 within ten (10) days of receipt of the Company’s written Step 2 answer. The HR Director or his designee agrees to meet with the Union Business Agent and Steward for the purpose of resolving any outstanding grievances. The Company will provide a written response to the Union within five (5) days of the Step 3 meeting.
50
STEP 4: Grievances not satisfactorily settled in Step 3 may be appealed to an impartial arbitrator. If the Union or the Company desires to arbitrate a grievance, they shall notify the other party in writing to that effect within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the Company’s written Step 3 response. The parties will attempt to agree on an arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator, the grieving party will request a list of seven (7) arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list until one (1) name remains; this shall be the arbitrator to hear the grievance. The parties will flip a coin to determine who strikes first. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties to this Agreement. Each party shall bear the expense of its own presentation. The arbitrator shall be paid equally between the Company and the Union. The arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to those matters concerning interpretation of this Agreement.
In the event an employee shall be suspended or discharged from employment for any reason, such discharge shall constitute a grievance matter to be handled in accordance with the procedure set forth herein, including arbitration. The time limitations set forth herein for presenting and deciding grievances may be extended by mutual consent of the parties; except that the Company agrees that in matters of discharge the Union shall, upon request, be granted an extension of time not to exceed five (5) working days in which to present discharge grievance. A grievance concerning a suspension or discharge may begin at Step 2 of the grievance procedure and must be filed within ten (10) working days of the suspension or termination.
ARTICLE 20 MISCELLANEOUS
Section 20.1	Inventions.
20.1	(a) Employees shall be permitted to retain ownership of an invention conceived or developed by them if the invention (a) was developed entirely on the employee's own time and the invention is one for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information of the Company was used; and (b) does not (i) relate directly to the business of the Company or to the Company's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) result from any work performed by the employees for the Company. All other inventions shall be the
51
property of the Company, and employees shall assist the Company in the protection of such inventions as directed by the Company.
20.1	(b) No employee shall be required, as a condition of employment or continued employment, to sign an invention agreement which contravenes the provisions of this Section.
Section 20.2	Sabotage.
The Union agrees to report to the Company when it has knowledge of any acts of sabotage or damage to or the unauthorized or unlawful taking of Company, government, customer or any other person's or employee's property. The Union further agrees, if any such acts occur, to use its best efforts in assisting to identify and apprehend the guilty person or persons.
Section 20.3	Nondiscrimination.
All terms and conditions of employment included in this Agreement shall be administered and applied without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, status as a disabled or Vietnam era veteran, age, gender, sexual orientation or the presence of a disability, except in those instances where age, gender, or the absence of a disability may constitute a bona fide occupational qualification. If administration and application of the contract is not in contravention of federal or state law such administration or application shall not be considered discrimination under this Section 20.3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 20.3 or of this Agreement, a grievance alleging a violation of this Section 20.3 shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration of provisions of this Agreement only if it is filed on behalf of and pertains to a single employee. Class grievances based on alleged violation of this Section 20.3 shall not be subject to the grievance procedure and arbitration procedures of this Agreement.
Section 20.4	Masculine - Feminine References.
In construing and interpreting the language of this Agreement, reference to the masculine, such as "he", "him", and "his", shall include reference to the feminine.
Section 20.5	Security Interviews.
Each employee has the right, during an investigation which the employee reasonably believes may result in discipline, to request the presence of his shop steward, if the shop steward is available. If his shop steward is not available, such employee may request the presence of another immediately available shop steward. If a shop steward, pursuant to the employee's request, is present during such an interview, the shop steward, in
52
addition to acting as an observer, may, after the investigator has completed his questioning of the employee, ask additional questions of the employee in an effort to provide information which is as complete and accurate as possible. The shop steward shall not obstruct or interfere with the interview.
Section 20.6	Subcontracting.
Both parties recognize the need to subcontract to create operational efficiencies and the potential to grow the business by acquiring new work. To that extent, the Company will discuss subcontracting plans and new work decisions at the management-stewards meetings every other week (Section 3.1(b). It is not the intent of the Employer to subcontract work customarily and currently performed by the Employer in the Spokane plant by its own employees, during a reduction in force, or which would as a consequence result in a reduction in force.
Section 20.7	Successorship.
In the event of a sale of Company assets is being considered, the Company will give one hundred eighty (180) days minimum notice to the Union, if possible in light of the proposed structure of the sale and confidentiality considerations, and a minimum of sixty (60) days notice regardless, in order to facilitate discussions of the impact of such sale on bargaining unit employees.
The Company will likewise make any potential buyer fully aware of the current IAM labor agreement.
The Company will comply with all state and federal laws with respect to employee rights in connection with the sale of the business. There will be expedited bargaining on all issues related to the sale and its effects on employees.
It is likewise recognized that in the normal situation of a transfer of operations/assets structured as a stock sale, the labor contract and all employee rights thereunder will continue unchanged and be binding on the purchaser.
ARTICLE 21
LAYOFF, RECLASSIFICATION AND RECALL RIGHTS
Section 21.1
Upon layoff, employees have the right to return to the job classification held prior to layoff for a period equal to length of service up to a maximum of six (6) years from the date of layoff.
53
Section 21.2
It is the intent of the Company and the Union to layoff and recall from layoff using the principal of seniority as called for in Sections 14.1 and 21.1 of this Agreement. The following will establish the procedure used.
The Company shall determine layoffs by Job Classifications. Layoffs shall be on a voluntary basis first. Should there be an insufficient number of volunteers, layoffs shall then be in reverse seniority order within the Job Classification. Should there be too many volunteers, then the most senior of the volunteers shall be laid off. Employees identified for layoff shall have the right to bump:
1)	Less senior employees in the same Job Classification (i.e., Mechanic A to Mechanic B);
2)	Less senior employees in any Job Classification in which the employee has worked one
hundred (100) or more consecutive calendar days in the previous seven (7) years.
It is further the intent to recall laid off employees in seniority order to the Job Classification held prior to layoff or any other Job Classification the employee has held for ninety (90) or more consecutive calendar days in the previous six (6) years. It is understood an employee who does not exercise their bumping rights give up their recall rights to that Job Classification.
ARTICLE 22
PROMOTIONAL PROCEDURES
A.	Classification "A's" will be selected by seniority within the job classification.
B.	Promotions shall be by seniority and will be subject to a ninety (90)-day evaluation
period, during which time they will be coded as a temporary classification per Section 6.14. Employees who fail to qualify will be returned to their former job classification.
1.	A promotion is a job which has a higher rate of pay.
2.	The Employer shall select the senior qualified employee applying. Such
selection shall be subject to Article 19.
54
3.	“Qualifications” shall mean the minimal qualifications for the classification as determined by management, which shall be put in writing and posted. These minimum qualifications shall not be subject to Article 19.
ARTICLE 23
DURATION
This Agreement shall become effective as of the beginning of first shift on June 04, 2010 (which date is the date as of which this Agreement was executed, sometimes referred to as the "effective date of this Agreement") and shall remain in full force and effect until midnight at the close of May 10, 2013, and shall automatically be renewed for consecutive periods of one (1) year thereafter, unless either party shall notify the other in writing, at least sixty (60) days but not more than ninety (90) days prior to May 10 of any calendar year, beginning with 2013, of its desire to terminate the Agreement, in which event this Agreement shall terminate at midnight at the close of such May 10, unless renewed or extended by mutual written agreement. In the case of such notice the parties agree to meet immediately thereafter for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement or a written renewal of this Agreement.

Subject: Layoff Protection/Work Transfers
From June 04, 2010 through May 10, 2013, the Company will not lay off any current employee (on the seniority list dated June 01, 2010) due to work unavailability. Exception: When such unavailability is caused by a Boeing strike, act of God such as a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other major unforeseeable event beyond the Company’s control. This is a onetime, non-precedent work preservation agreement based on the unique facts of the current TCS business projections, which will no longer apply on and after May 11, 2013.
Dated this 4th day of June, 2010.
