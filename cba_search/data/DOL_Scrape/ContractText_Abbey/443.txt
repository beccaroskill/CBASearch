The Company shall also, at the request of such employee, provide taxi or equivalent transportation to and from such accommodation at no cost to the employee.
15
Section 7.7(c) Corn’d
Because this Section 7.7 (c) is motivated by safety considerations, the parties agree that a regular or daily hire employee may not be entitled to such hotel accommodations or transportation, depending upon how far in distance an employee resides from the location at the end of an employee’s tour. The parties agree to act reasonably in the application of this provision recognizing hotel or transportation accommodations are not automatic for a regulator local daily hire employee, even if there are fewer than eight (8) hours from the end of such employee’s tour until the commencement of said employee’s next tour.
(d)	In the event the Company provides a hotel room or equivalent accommodation for a local remote within an office of the Company which would not normally require an overnight stay, or for other contingencies, (c.g., weather, special reports), affected employees shall receive one Section 7.7(a) per diem payment for each night the employee is assigned to remain overnight in such accommodations.

ARTICLE XIV DISCHARGES
Section 14.1
(a)	The Company may discharge an employee for just cause. Notice of the discharge will be given to the Local President of the Union, or another officer of the Union if the Local President is unavailable. If the discharge is not agreed to, the Company shall have the right to remove such employee from the payroll upon the issuance of an award of an Impartial Umpire or Arbitrator sustaining the discharge, or two (2) weeks after the date of the notice to the Union provided above, whichever is earlier; or
(b)	Alternatively to the rights stated in subparagraph (a) above, the Company may elect in its sole discretion to utilize the provisions of this subparagraph (b)in a discharge for “unsatisfactory performance”. For purposes of Section 14.1(b), “unsatisfactory performance” shall be deemed to include the inability or unwillingness to perform the particular work required by the Company. “Unsatisfactory performance” shall also include excessive absenteeism and lateness. The following terms and conditions shall apply:
(1)	Prior to the effectuation of any discharge under this subparagraph (b), an employee shall be so notified in writing and a copy of said notice sent to the Local Union President or his or her designee. The failure of management to have previously notified a dischargee that his or her performance has not been consistently satisfactory may not form the
39
Section 14,1 ftHU Confd
basis for any contention by the Union, or for any finding by an Arbitrator, that the Company’s determination hereunder is arbitrary or capricious. The employee, thereafter, will be afforded an eight (8) week minimum period of time to establish and maintain a satisfactory level of performance. Such notice to the employee that is provided shall be in writing and state that it constitutes notice under Section 14.1(b), but such notice shall not preclude the Company from imposing discipline on such employee under Section 14.1(a). If, for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months following such notice the employee’s overall performance is satisfactory, an employee shall no longer be subject to that particular notice of discharge.
(2)	If, after the employee’s having been given this opportunity to establish and maintain a satisfactory level of performance, the Company determines that a discharge under this Section 14.1(b) is appropriate, the Company may discharge the employee and notice of the discharge will be provided to the Union in the same manner as required for discharges under 14.1(a). Should the Union determine to arbitrate the discharge, the procedures to be followed are provided for in Section 14,2.
In determining the appropriateness of the discharge, the “just cause” standard of Section 14.1(a) shall not apply and instead the Company's determination shall be sustained by the arbitrator unless he finds that the discharge is arbitrary or capricious,
(3)	In the event that the discharge determination under Section 14.1(b) is sustained by the arbitrator, Section IS. I shall be inapplicable and the Company shall have no obligation to provide a severance payment of any kind.
(4)	If the Union determines not to arbitrate a Section 14.1(b) termination,
and the termination shall therefore be deemed accepted, the employee shall be entitled to receive a severance payment in the amount equal to three (3) weeks per year for each full year of service with a cap of eighteen (18) months of pay at the employee's minimum weekly wage scale set forth in the Master Agreement, provided that the employee executes a general release satisfactory to the Company, and the Union agrees in writing not to pursue the discharge of this employee in this or any other legal proceeding. If this genera! release and Union agreement is not executed, no severance will be due.
40
SwtronM.1 fbKS)
(5)	Neither the acceptance of any terminations nor any arbitration awards arising out of terminations made under Section 14.1(b) may be cited by either party in any other discipline arbitration.
(c)	If at any time the Company determines that the particular nature of the “unsatisfactory performance" by itself or in combination with other conduct warrants proceeding instead under the “just cause” provisions of Section 14.1(a), it may elect to do so.
(d)	The Company shall have no obligation to transfer, reassign or train any employee to perform any other bargaining unit job function prior to a discharge for just cause or unsatisfactory performance.
(See Sideletter ER.)
Section 14.2
If the Union believes that the discharge was not warranted, it may, within one (1) week of the date thereof, refer the matter to the Impartial Umpire for the office involved. It will be the obligation of the Umpire to hear the matter as expeditiously as possible and he or she may interrupt any other non-discrplrnary case between the parties that he or she is then hearing in order to schedule a hearing on the discharge. If the Impartial Umpire for the office involved cannot hear the matter within three (3) working days of the reference to the Umpire by the Union, the matter may be referred to any one of the other Impartial Umpires listed in Section 20.10. The Impartial Umpire who hears the case will render a decision within two (2) working days from the date of hearing. If requested by either the Company or Union at the conclusion of the hearing, the Impartial Umpire shall, within fourteen (14) days of the conclusion of the hearing, follow up the decision with any further discussion or opinion on the case that the Umpire deems appropriate. If the Impartial Umpire decides that the discharge was not proper, but that suspension or other disciplinary action is warranted, the Impartial Umpire may so provide in his or her Award.
(Sec Sideletter DZ.)
Section 14.3
(a)	The Company may for just cause impose a disciplinary suspension without pay. Notice of such suspension shall be given to the Local President of the Union, or another officer of the Union if the Local President is unavailable, as soon as practicable after the imposition of the suspension.

ARTICLE XXI SAFETY COMMITTEE
Section 21.1
The Company agrees to the appointment of a NABET-CWA-representative and alternate on existing Safety Committees where established and to the creation of Safety Committees with a NABET-CWA-representative and alternate to be appointed thereto at each office of the Company where no Safety Committee currently exists. Meetings will be held every other month at each office, unless the exigencies of the situation require a meeting of the Safety Committee to take place at other times.
Section 21.2
In the event the Union wishes to retain safety consultants to advise it on matters of occupational health and safety, the Company agrees to designate a representative to meet with such consultants at times and places mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Union. Such consultants may also, at the Union’s request and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company, attend meetings of the Safety Committees provided for tn Section 21.1 above.
Section 213
During the course of their 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the matter of the safety of employees assigned to ENG pickups in the field. The parties fully recognize that news gathering assignments in the field by their very nature have historically presented safety issues not normally present in other aspects of the broadcasting industry. In the course of these discussions, the parties recognized that the safety of ENG personnel assigned to these pickups has been and continues to be a matter of prime importance.
The parties acknowledge that an ENG field assignment is “hazardous" only if its performance (or continued performance) necessarily entails an immediate and significant risk of a serious physical injury to the employee(s) assigned. Moreover, it is expressly understood and agreed that while the right of assignment belongs exclusively with the Company, as in the past an etnployee(s) at the pickup location of a news story who has assessed the particular situation need not commence a hazardous assignment or, if the assignment has already begun but has become hazardous, may withdraw to a position of safety at or near the site of the pickup. In either case, such employee shall use his or her best efforts to fulfill the assignment.
65
Section 21.3 ConCd
As the parties have recognized in the past, any decision not to begin or continue to perform a hazardous assignment must be made in good faith, be reasonable under all of the circumstances, and whenever possible with prior consultation with an appropriate assignment editor or management personnel. If, under the circumstances, such prior consultation is not possible, the decision not to begin or continue to perform a hazardous assignment must be communicated as soon as possible to the appropriate assignment editor or management personnel. In the event of any conflict between an employee’s decision and an order to perform given by an assignment editor or a manager, the employee(s) shall not be regarded as insubordinate provided that his or her decision is in accordance with the foregoing provisions.	•
In view of this, the parties are in agreement that at each Company operating unit where ENG personnel are employed, a special comminee, consisting of representative employees from the ENG unit and local management whose presence may be conducive to a discussion of safety shall periodically meet as mutually agreed upon to discuss issues of safety relating to ENG field assignments. At each Company television station these meetings shall be attended by the News Director and other senior station officials. At each network ENG location the Network News Bureau Chief and a senior BO&E official, along with other appropriate management officials will attend such meeting(s). An agreed upon number of ENG field personnel shall attend such meetings as operational requirements permit in order to provide information or make suggestions on the basis of their own news gathering experience. These meetings shall be held no less than once every six (6) months.

Except as provided for in the preceding sentence, the parties recognize that lighting for the poo) can be assigned to the engineering employees assigned to the crew in accordance with this Section A2.2(e).
In addition to the foregoing, if two (2) or more of the companies arc covering a Presidential trip with equipment of the type covered by this Section A2.2(e), within the Continental United Slates (but outside Washington, D.C., or its immediate vicinity), such companies may similarly pool whatever lighting work is necessary. The companies will rotate these Presidential trip assignments where lighting is pooled on a basis that will assure that ABC's engineering employees will handle a fair proportion of such overall Presidential trips. The company which has the pool responsibility under the terms of this Subparagraph will assign an additional engineering employee to the crew(s) to perform whatever pool or unilateral lighting work may be required by the pool participants as well as other work that may be required to assist the other crew members, such as moving or transporting equipment. It is understood that on Presidential trips, some lighting functions may be performed by non-Company personnel in connection with “lighting the President", as heretofore.
The foregoing Subparagraphs are only applicable to pickups of the type described in Subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (v) where camera coverage is handled on a unilateral basis by each company and it is therefore understood that technical work unrelated to lighting will not be affected by this Agreement.
A record will be kept by the Company of pool assignments made hereunder and will show which companies’ employees were assigned to do the lighting work. The purpose is to assure an equitable distribution of the work performed hereunder. Such record shall be available to the Union.

Section A2.2te~i4 (viji)
(viii)	This Paragraph 4 is limited to the situations described above. It is not intended to imply either the same or a different treatment in other situations. It will not be precedent for any assignments of work on any pickups except those specified herein, and neither this Paragraph 4 nor any practice under it on any pickup covered by it, nor any practice preceding this Paragraph 4 if it had been in effect on that date, will be cited "■ in any case covering a different type of pickup. Specifically, no not to be cited in any such case, is the use of the lighting “pool” arrangement hereunder for pooling only part of the technical work involved in a particular pickup.
(ix)	It is the intent of the foregoing provisions of this Section A2.2(e)4 that when two (2) or more of the four (4) companies are covering a news pickup with equipment of the type described herein, the lighting will be performed by the engineering employees of one (1) of such companies. However, it is recognized that situations may develop when organizations other than ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC are already present at the site of the pickup which may make it impracticable for any of the companies to set up lights although their gear and engineering personnel are available at the site. If such situations are not kept to a minimum, ABC and NABET-CWA will consult with each other in order to develop procedures, together with other companies and unions, if possible, to solve such problems
(x)	On news pickups in the field, not covered by (i) through (ix) above, engineering employees assigned to the event in accordance with this Section A2.2(e) shall perform any lighting functions that are performed unless the lighting is to be performed in a location where another union has contracted “house jurisdiction" over lighting functions which does not exclude electronic news pickups. Further, when lights have already been set up by other film or tape crews at a place where the news story is to be covered, the pickup may be made without employees hereunder setting up lights if such other lights are sufficient for the pickup. (It is the intent of the Company that the engineering crew and their gear will normally be assigned to the site in such a manner that they will have time and equipment to do the lighting just as though no one else had done it.)

1.	Terminated radio engineers on a special leave of absence with pay pursuant to paragraph (i) of Sideletter CA-2 shall continue to accrue seniority for all purposes while on such paid leave. For example, a radio engineer whose total service would not qualify him or her for the maximum allowable special payment and who commences his or her special paid leave of absence with 8 years and 8 months of total Company seniority shall, after the expiration of the six-month special leave of absence, and after the execution of a General Release in a form satisfactory to the Company, receive a special payment, pursuant to the termination formula, based upon nine years and two months of total Company seniority as the result of the engineer^ accrual of an additional six months of total Company seniority while on the special leave of absence.
2.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that any period of time spent working in television following the termination from radio described above shall not be used to enhance the calculation of the special payment (should he or she be under the three year maximum) at the time of the employee’s termination from the Company if hc/shc does not remain in television. Should a terminated radio employee elect to interrupt his/her special leave of absence to accept a position in television, hc/she shall continue to receive full credit for up to the six-month period of such leave while working in television. In no event, however, can a combination of leave and/or television work provide an employee who is under the maximum with more than six month’s additional accrual of service for purposes of the special payment. (In the example given above in paragraph (I), if the employee began a period of television service two months following the commencement of his/her special paid leave of absence and was terminated seven (7) months thereafter, the amount of the special payment would still be based on nine years and two months of service; (i.e,, the remaining four months of special leave of absence that had not yet been taken at the commencement of the television service would run concurrently with the first four months of the sevenmonth period of television service),
3,	It is understood and agreed that no radio engineer on paid leave of absence status shall have or accrue any seniority for any other purpose during any period of employment in television, unless such employment results in a regular position in television at the end of the six to eight month trial period.
If an employee is terminated at the conclusion of a six to eight month trial period in television, he shall not be entitled by virtue of his television service to any notice of termination or severance pay for the period of service in television.

As an exception to the foregoing sentence, however, April 1, contractual increases and individual escalator step increases shall not count towards enhancing the amount of the special payment due an employee if either, or both, take place on a date subsequent to the date a person’s six month paid leave of absence ended, or would have ended, absent any employment in television.
5.	Any radio engineer who is on a paid leave of absence pursuant to Sideletter CA-2 and who is offered a regular NABET-CWA-represented position in television, may, for a period of forty-five (45) calendar days after starting the new position in television, elect to resign his employment and still be eligible to receive the special payment and special tuition reimbursement, after the execution of a General Release in a form satisfactory to the Company, pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in Sideletter CA-2 in the same total amount he would have been eligible to receive, prior to commencing his employment in television. Any radio engineer who elects to resign from a regular NABET-CWA-represented position in television after this forty-five (45) day period shall not be entitled any longer to receive, and shall forfeit, the special payment and special tuition reimbursement pursuant to Sidelctter CA-2, any severance pay pursuant to Article XV of the ABC-NABET-CWA Master Agreement or any other payment. It is specifically understood that any radio engineer who accepts a regular NABET-CWA-represented position in television and thereafter resigns either before or after the initial 45-day period shall not, under any circumstances, be entitled to return to or commence a paid leave of absence pursuant to Sideletter CA-2.

In the event that any one or more of the three (3) named engineers referenced in subparagraph 1(a) above dies, resigns, is discharged for cause, retires, voluntarily transfers to another NABET-CWA or non-NABET-CWA-represented position in or outside of WABC-AM or WPLJ-FM, is ill, is on short or long term disability or other leave of absence or is unable to report for work for any reason, NABET-CWA acknowledges that under the Master Agreement the Company is not required to replace such an engineer with another NABET-CWA-represented employee and can, if it so elects, employ a non-NABET-CWA-represented employee to perform this same work.
3.	Although both parties recognize that it is not contractually required to do so, it is the intention of the Company to continue utilizing a NABET-CWA-represented per diem employee for the one shift on either Saturday and/or Sunday at WABC-AM that is not presently assigned (as the result of the Company’s desire to accommodate its engineers) to one of the three (3) NABET-CWA-represented regular engineers listed in subparagraph 1(a).

5.	A NABET-CWA-represented engineer may continue to schedule other NABET-CWA-represented employees at WABC-AM and WPLJ-FM. The Company and the Union agree that this assignment shall not, under any circumstances, constitute an expansion of existing jurisdiction pursuant to any provisions of the Master Agreement, nor shall the performance of this assignment by employees hereunder entitle any such employees to continue to be given such assignment made pursuant to this provision, or the failure to make such an assignment, shall be subject to arbitration. Both the Company and the Union reserve the right to terminate this practice upon thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.
6.	Since the parties are in agreement that the Company is not required under the new contract to assign a NABET-CWA-represented employee to perform any work at any broadcast originating from outside the studios, the panics specifically recognize that no NABET-CWA-represented employee is required to be assigned to Devils, or any other remotes to be broadcast by WABC-AM or WPLJ-FM. The Company agrees that in future years it will consider the feasibility of assigning a NABET-CWA-represented engineer to pickups.

establishing opportunities for Editorial Assistants to obtain training in duties ordinarily performed by Newswriters. This may include the rotation of assignments to different units of operations. It is understood, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to promote Editorial Assistants to regular Newswriter positions, except as may be required by the upgrading provisions set forth below.

In preparing the text of the 1985-1989 NABET-ABC Master Agreement for printing, it was agreed by the Company and the Union that an attempt should be made to standardize punctuation, capitalization and spelling throughout the Agreement, as well as to cure obvious grammatical and typographical errors which have found their way into the text during past years and which have been inadvertently preserved each time the Agreement has been reprinted.
The following “conventions,” have been used in standardizing the text of the 1985-1989 and successor Master Agreements;
No Capitalization:

'employee”
‘staff newswriters'
Initial Capitalization:
‘initiation Fee” “Network”

Capitalization required by dictionary
Money numbers (“One Hundred Dollars”) “Unit,” “Unit Seniority” and “Bargaining Unit” Specific sections, paragraphs, subparagraphs
Titles of positions
“ENG" and other acronyms “Local”
“A.M.” and “P.M."

Words:
“videotape” should be “video tape," except when used as a verb
“re-create," “re-classily” and "re-record," should be "recreate,” “reclassify," and “rerecord'* a “News Writer” should be “Newswriter" “re-engage” should be “reengage" "pay check" should be “paycheck” “sub-contract" should be “subcontract” “push to talk" should be “push-to-talk”
‘'work load," “work day" and “work week" should be “workload,” “workday” and "workweek” “pick-up” should be “pickup”
“lay-off" should be “layoff"
“make-up” should be “makeup” gender neutralize all pronouns
Other Conventions:
repeat all numbers (not just dollar amounts), but not “once" use semicolons in sentences with (i) and (ii), etc.
numbers of Stipulations always in parenthesis
In addition, questions of grammar and punctuation were resolved in accordance with the rules set forth in A Dictionary of Modem English Usage (2d. edition) by H. W. Fowler and The Elements of Style by William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White.
None of the changes made in preparing the text of the Master Agreement for printing is intended to have any substantive effect whatsoever. In the unlikely event a dispute arises because either party believes that any such change has inadvertently altered the substantive meaning of a provision of the 1985-1989 NABET-ABC Master Agreement, it is agreed that in the resolution of such dispute, whether by arbitration or by other means, the grammar and punctuation in the predecessor 1981-1985 Master Agreement shall be deemed controlling.

Telecommunications
After extensive discussions during the course of the 1989 negotiations with respect to the ordering of transmission facilities for television network news material by non-NABET-CWA-represented satellite desk coordinators assigned to the satellite desk (hereinafter called the News Traffic Desk), it was determined that it would be in the best interests of both the Company and the Union if, in the future, persons assigned to such News Traffic Desk were covered by the terms of the Traffic and Communications (“B") Agreement for the purpose of enabling them to order such transmission facilities. Consequently, it was agreed that;
1.	As soon as practicable after the effective date of the new Agreement, the position of satellite desk coordinator on the News Traffic Desk shall be eliminated and shall be replaced by thc.position Traffic Coordinator covered by the terms of the “B’* Agreement.
2.	The Company will consider the application of any Traffic Coordinator with a Unit Seniority date of July 20, 1989 or earlier who requests to be assigned to the News Traffic Desk, but the decision whether or not to grant such request shall rest solely with the Company.
3.	Traffic Coordinators assigned to the News Traffic Desk shall constitute a separate seniority group from Traffic Coordinators assigned to all other traffic operations for purposes of layoff, rehiring and other provisions where Unit Seniority is applicable.
However, any Traffic Coordinator with a Unit Seniority date of July 20, 1989 or earlier, whether assigned to the News Traffic Desk or any other traffic operation, shall be placed in a Master Traffic Seniority Group, while the News Traffic Desk Seniority Group shall consist of regular Traffic Coordinators hired after July 20, 1989 to work on the news Traffic Desk, and the Network Traffic Seniority Group shall consist of regular Traffic Coordinators hired after July 20, 1989 to work in all other traffic operations. When layoffs of regular Traffic Coordinators in the New York office of the Company are to be made, the following shall apply:
(a)	If the number of Coordinators to be laid off from either the News Seniority Group or the Network Seniority Group is equal to or less than the number of Coordinators in the News or Network Seniority Group, whichever is applicable, the Coordinators in such group will be laid off in inverse order of seniority.
27-d
Sideletter DE Com'd
(b)	If the number of Coordinators to be laid off from either Group exceeds the number of Coordinators in the News or the Network Seniority Group, whichever is applicable, after first laying off all Coordinators in the applicable group, the excess shall be laid off in inverse order of seniority from the Coordinators in the other group. If after all Coordinators in both the News and the Network Seniority Groups have been laid off, the number of Coordinators to be laid off still has not been reached!, employees in the Master Traffic Seniority Group will then be laid off in inverse order of seniority.
In addition, no Coordinator may be compelled to accept a transfer from one separate seniority group to another. In the event a Coordinator, with his or her consent, elects to accept a transfer all Unit Seniority accrued prior to the transfer shall be retained and his or her Total Company Seniority and Pay Seniority will remain unaffected by such transfer. Nothing herein shall prohibit the Company from temporarily assigning Coordinators to perform work in a seniority group other than the one in which they accrue Unit Seniority.
4.	With respect to duties previously performed by satellite desk coordinators assigned to the News Traffic Desk, which duties are not encompassed by the provisions of the “B” Agreement (e.g., ABSAT satellite access coordination, international pool satellite coordination, surveys, etc.), it is specifically understood and agreed that any performance of such duties in the future by Traffic Coordinators assigned to such Desk shall not, under any circumstances, constitute an expansion of existing jurisdiction pursuant to any provision of the Master Agreement, nor shall the performance of such assignments by Coordinators hereunder entitle any such employees to continue to be given such assignments. It is agreed that no claim or dispute involving an assignment made pursuant to this Paragraph, or the failure to make such an assignment, shall be subject to arbitration.
5.	Notwithstanding any arbitration awards, letter agreements, grievance settlements or provisions of the Master Agreement or any other agreements to the contrary, with respect to television network news coverage of fastbreaking news stories, when, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, time is of the essence in order to secure the facilities necessary for the origination of the story, news managers not covered by this Agreement may institute the preliminary steps of the ordering process including commitment to initial transmission facilities (but excluding transponders and downlinks, except when packaged with uplink services). It is understood that the continuation and finalization of this ordering process and the coordination of any such transmission facilities, as well as the ordering of additional facilities required

Digital Cameras and Related Equipment
During the course of the negotiations leading to the 2003 Master Agreement the parries discussed technological advances relating to ENG camera equipment. The Company recognizes and values the unique contributions made by its NABET-CWA-represented ENG crews in the past and is committed to continuing to use them in the future as its primary workforce for such work. However, the parties recognize that due to the technological advances, it may be desirable in certain situations for the Company to have individuals other than NABET-CWA-represented employees gather news material (including sports news material) on assignments in the field in the following cases.
Therefore, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Master Agreement, arbitration awards, grievance resolutions or practices to the contrary, it is agreed as follows:
Any person(s) described below may operate digital camera equipment (e.g., DVX 1000, Sony PD 150, TRV 1000, miniature, or other camera equipment generally marketed as “Consumer” or “Professional Consumer” equipment) and including video phones (or similar devices) in the following situations in the field:
I.	As long as camera operation is not such person’s overall primary job function, such persons (except interns) may operate such camera equipment on assignments when its use is combined (whether or not simultaneous) with other work or functions such person(s) normally performs (i.e., reporting, producing, news writing, directing) in relation to the particular material, story or program.
2.	In addition to the foregoing, any person (except interns) may operate such camera equipment on any occasion where one or more of the following may be applicable:

During the course of the 1993 Negotiations, the parties discussed the feasibility of a four (4) day workweek in certain areas of the Company’s operations. The parties recognized, however, that instituting such a program even on a partial basis presents serious operating difficulties and constraints and for this reason is not possible on a broad basis at this time. While the Company expressed an interest in pursuing discussions concerning a four-day workweek, it was agreed that issues
284
Sideletter DS Cont’d
regarding the selection of those employees on such a schedule, and matters relating to the actual scheduling of a four or five day workweek required more discussion and consideration on an operational level at each location which could potentially utilize such a four-day workweek.
To that end, the parties agreed, notwithstanding the absence of a four-day workweek provision in the Master Agreement, that in the event there is mutual interest in a four-day workweek in a particular operation of the Company in any location, that the parties will meet and attempt to work out the mechanics of such a four-day workweek on a local level. It is understood, however, that the decision regarding the institution of a four-day workweek for any particular employee or group of employees in any location or operation is a complicated subject requiring modification of a number of contractual provisions. Therefore discussions concerning the possible implementation of any four-day workweek system requires, in addition to local union officials and local operating management, the participation of officials of the Union as well as appropriate representatives of the Company’s Labor Relations Department. Any decision to implement such a program following these discussions must be mutually agreed to, and any such decision on the pan of the Company not to agree will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.

The amount of the individual offset shall be the same as the cost to the Company for providing the additional benefits or making such contribution. In the event the amount of the offset is not precisely calculable, the amount to be offset to provide such coverage shall be determined jointly by the Company^ Vice President, Labor Relations and the International President of the Union, or their designees.

Many of such current and future changes are represented by the language negotiated by the parties in Sideletter DK.
The Union has expressed its concern that in light of the anticipated operational changes, NABET-CWA-represented employees covered by the Engineering Agreement be given opportunities to continue to participate in Company operations, and the Company recognizes the value of providing such.employees these opportunities. To that end, the parties have agreed as follows:

operate such non-linear computer editing systems, the parties agree that the Company will provide training in the operation of computer systems covered by Sideletter DK to NABET-CWA-represented employees who are currently assigned to perform the work for which such systems will be utilized in order to afford them opportunities to participate in these new technologies. Other employees who are not currently assigned to perform the work for which such systems will be utilized may request the training opportunities described in this Paragraph 1. The Company will give good faith consideration to such requests.
2.	At the Network in the New York office of the Company, persons whose full-time exclusive duty is to create sophisticated electronic graphic art utilizing a device covered by Sideletter DK will be employed under the Engineering Agreement.
3.	The Company will not lake the position that a particular device is covered by Sideletter DK solely because the device incorporates a microprocessor.
4.	The Company shall not assign pursuant to Sideletter DK persons not covered by the Master Agreement to perform any of the following functions heretofore performed exclusively by NABET-CWA-represented employees, except that nothing in this Side letter DV shall be construed to amend or limit the Company’s rights in Sidetetter GD (i.e., New Technology and Consolidation):

Training
The Company recognizes the value of a well-trained work force. The technologies utilized in the Company’s operations are undergoing vast change. These changes will, in many cases, require employees to improve and upgrade their skills. The Company and NABET-CWA encourage employees under the Engineering Agreement to improve their skills and knowledge by applying their initiative and using all available training resources as described in this Sideletter.

Persons employed by the Company who arc assigned to operate such nonlinear computer editing systems solely to "edit” material covered by the Master Agreement, but who at no time are responsible for the editorial content of the materia) which they are “editing” (hereinafter “editorial responsibility”), shall be covered by the Engineering Agreement. It is understood that dubbing (including digitizing, copying, cloning and transfers), screening and/or other non-editing functions are not covered by the above, but nothing herein precludes NABET-CWA-represented engineers from being assigned such functions or given some editorial responsibility.
Editorial responsibility is the duty to make a decision(s) and/or a judgment(s) (which decision(s) and/or judgment(s) may include elements of an artistic or creative nature) with respect to the content of material during the process of assembling or producing a program, or any segment thereof, or other material covered by the Master Agreement.

Sideletter EX Retiree Medical Benefits
In the 1989 negotiations for a new Master Agreement, the parties recognized that because of the rapidly escalating costs of retiree medical coverage, contractual changes needed to be made reflecting the changes that the Company had made generally in retiree medical coverage for all of its employees. The parties agreed at that time that NABET-CWA-represented employees would thereafter receive retiree medical benefits on the same basis as the non-represented employees of the Company and that only those employees who met the eligibility requirements then applicable to non-represented employees would thereafter be eligible to participate. Section 22.4 thereupon became part of the Master Agreement.
During negotiations for the 1997-2003 NABET-CWA-ABC Master Agreement, as well as the renegotiation of the 2003-2007 Master Agreement, the parties again discussed the subject of retiree medical coverage. As a result of those discussions the parties are in agreement that Section 22.4 of the 1993-1997 Master Agreement shall be continued.
1.	Certain NABET-CWA-represented employees employed by the Company as of March 31, 1989, who had reached age 55 and attained at least ten (10) years of service by such date, shall continue to be eligible to receive, upon retirement, medical coverage under the terms of the “ABC Comprehensive Medical Expense Plan” in effect on March 31, 1989, (with Medicare offset). The Company agrees that such coverage for these employees shall continue to apply during the term of the 2003-2007 Master Agreement, notwithstanding any provision or Sideletter to the contrary in the Master Agreement or in any existing, new or modified Company plan, program or policy, except changes required by law.

The terms of the retiree medical coverage applicable to this group of employees will continue to be the same as that provided for the non-represented employees of the Company who are eligible to participate.
The Company agrees to continue retiree medical coverage for this specific group of NABET-CWA-represented employees who achieved age 45, or whose age and service equaled at least 55 as of March 31, 1989, during the term of the 20032007 Master Agreement, notwithstanding any provision or Sideletter to the contrary tn the Master Agreement, or in any existing, new or modified Company plan, program or policy.
It is understood, however, that the Company may, in its sole discretion, without any obligation to bargain with NABET-CWA, continue to make whatever modifications it deems necessary in the retiree medical coverage provided for in this Paragraph 2. Such possible modifications may include, but not be limited to, deductibles, co-payments and benefits coverage, but may not include any modifying of the age or service eligibility requirements or any termination of retiree medical coverage itself, except as required by law. Any modifications made for NABET-CWA-represented individuals in this retiree medical coverage can only be made on the same basis as for the non-represented individuals eligible for such coverage.
3.	Except for the two groups of NABET-CWA-represented employees referred to in paragraphs I and 2 above who are eligible for this coverage, all other NABET-CWA-represented employees shall continue to be ineligible for any form of Company provided medical coverage upon retirement from the Company.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any arbitration awards, grievance settlements, practices, or provisions in Article A-IV or elsewhere in the General Articles, Sideletters, Stipulations or any of the Individual Articles in the Master Agreement, the following shall apply where the Company utilizes computer equipment covered by Side letters DK or CX (e.g,, Parkervision) to restructure television control room functions and responsibilities so that directorial duties and technical production duties (e.g., production control switching, graphics, camera operations and audio functions, etc.) are or may be combined:
A.	Any person(s) may be assigned to perform the new combined duties described in 1. above.
B.	The Company’s collective batgaining agreements as of May 12,2003 with the Director’s Guild of America covering its local television Station operations in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, permit the assignment of Directors and Associate Directors to “Parkervision”-type production switching duties referred to in 1. above.
C.	Where the Company does not assign a Technical Director to perform the combined duties described in I. above, and another person(s) is assigned pursuant to I. A. above, (e.g., Director or Associate Director), no Technical Director need be present or assigned for any reason to the program or production concerned, including, bur not limited to, set up, knock down, giving work instructions or assignments to NABET-CWA or other union-represented employees working on the production, etc. Further, such person(s) will have all of the operational authority and rights of a Technical Director to the same degree as if a Technical Director had been assigned. Nor shall any engineer need to be upgraded for any reason relating to the absence of a Technical Director for such program or production.
II.	The Company recognizes the high degree of skills, ability and experience of its production Technical Directors and the important role they have played in our operations. For that reason, the Company is committed to attempt to find ways to include Technical Directors in the opportunities to perform such new combined directorial and production switching duties utilizing Sideletter DK or CX technology in the “Parkervision"-type operations described herein.

III.	Since at the Company Is network and station operations covered by the Master Agreement the Directors Guild of America has exclusive jurisdiction over the exercise of directorial judgment, control and duties, any such “Parkervision” type combined assignments to a Technical Director at the network or stations will necessarily require that person to perform duties partially within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Director's Guild of America. Such a hyphenated arrangement raises difficult and complicated issues concerning membership, rates of pay, scheduling, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment since the Technical Director would be working simultaneously under two different collective bargaining agreements. Such issues need to be addressed before assignments to Technical Directors can be made under such a hyphenated arrangement.
IV In an effort to resolve the challenges presented so that the Company's Technical Directors can be offered these opportunities, in addition io Directors and Associate Directors, it is agreed as follows:
%
A.	The parties agree to establish a Production Control Automation Committee consisting of an equal number of representatives from both NABET-CWA and the Company.
B.	Within 90 days following the ratification of the successor to the 1997-2003 Master Agreement the Company will use its good offices to facilitate a meeting with the Director’s Guild of America. The Company's goal in that meeting shall be to obtain agreement among the DGA, NABET-CWA and the Company on a single set of terms and conditions of employment (i.e., minimum scale, scheduling rules, vacation pay, benefits, seniority, union security, etc.) that would afford Technical Directors the opportunity on those occasions when assigned by the Company to perform “Parkcrvision’-type duties.
C.	If all issues are not resolved in a single meeting, the Company agrees

grievance involving more than one (1) office of the Company. The arbitration shall commence no later than October 10, 2006 or as soon thereafter as the Impartial Umpire is available. The Impartial Umpire for purposes of this Dispute Resolution Procedure shall be a Neutral Actuary selected by the mutual agreement of an actuary designated by the Company and an actuary designated by the Union, who shall serve as duly designated Impartial Umpire under the Master Agreement. If there is no agreement on a Neutral Actuary, then the Impartial Umpire under Section 20.6 of the Master Agreement for grievances involving more than one office shall hear the dispute.
