AGREEMENT entered into by and between
NEW YORK ELECTRICAL
CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION, INC.
ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS, INC.
hereinafter called the "Employer”, and
LOCAL UNION NO. 3 of the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, AFL-CIO
hereinafter called the "Union”.
The terms herein shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. The term “Employer” shall mean each employer who is a member of the New York Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., the Association of Electrical Contractors, Inc. and each independent electrical contractor who signs a copy of this Agreement and the term “Union” shall mean Local Union No. 3, I.B.E.W. The term “Employer” shall also mean an individual who has been recognized by an assent to this agreement. The parties hereto are desirous of preserving the harmonious and stabilized working conditions in the Electrical Contracting Industry do hereby enter into this Agreement as set forth below:
This Agreement is to cover the jurisdiction of Local Union No. 3 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, AFL-CIO in New York City. This Agreement covers inside work.
WITNESSETH:
PREAMBLE
Section 1.	The intent and purpose of this Agreement is to effectuate the spirit and policies of industrial stability, and to endeavor to raise the general level of the industry consistent with the trends of a more equitable relationship between the employer and the employee.
1
Section 2.	The vital interest of the public, the employer and the employee in an industry are inseparably bound together. All will benefit by a continuous peaceful operation of the industrial process and the dedication to the means of production for the common good.
Section 3.	It is recognized and agreed that Union electricians are on the average better trained and qualified to perform electrical work. It is further agreed that due to the efficiency of the members of the Union, they are all entitled to receive the recognized legal prevailing rate of wages, which has been established in New York City, plus all benefits established in this Collective Bargaining Agreement, and are entitled to such compensation as if employed steadily for the entire year, which may not be the case. The necessity of education, the years of apprenticeship and vocational school attendance and the additional necessary study and training to keep abreast of the continual changes, developments and innovations in the many varied branches of the electrical trade plus the hazardous nature of the work which is at all times a threat to life, limb, health and safety, impel the Employers to agree with the Union’s contention that Union electrical workers should be employed by all electrical firms licensed to perform electrical work and also on every electrical job in New York City at the prevailing rate of wages.
The Industry, however, is a highly competitive one and has for many years suffered the consequences of substandard competition fostered by employers who have failed to negotiate collective bargaining agreements with their employees. For this and other reasons it is recognized that on certain types of work it is necessary for the members of the Union to agree to a secondary rate of pay. The Employers agree not to take advantage of this situation and further agree that at such time as an impartial study of competitive conditions in the electrical contracting industry indicates that a secondary wage scale is no longer necessary they will wholeheartedly cooperate in the Union's efforts and desires to have every electrical worker in New York City receive the recognized legal prevailing wage scale.
Section 4.	It is recognized and agreed that the electrical industry's comprehensive non-discriminatory Apprenticeship Program and the Union's Training Program to promote minority training in the electrical industry and its comprehensive organizational program, whereby the Union has organized and continues to organize without discrimination all employees of non-union electrical contractors, have
2
provided ample and sufficient training for persons desiring to become electricians. The Union and the Contractors agree to the continuing development and improvement of an affirmative action program to preclude discriminatory practices by any parties to this Agreement against race, religion, color, sex, age, marital status, national origin, sexual preference, or against persons with physical or mental handicaps who may be qualified for employment under this Agreement. It is further recognized and agreed that never before has the Electrical Industry faced a more critical challenge than it does today. Productivity must be increased to meet the threat of economic and inflationary pressures that can destroy our industry. Every member of Local Union No. 3 and the Electrical Contractors shall seek and encourage the greatest possible productivity through:
1.	New and improved methods of electrical installation.
2.	The use of modem efficient tools and equipment.
3.	The elimination of non-productive time wasting practices.
4.	The close supervision of starting and quitting times and lunch periods.
5.	The development of a positive attitude and a cooperative spirit towards a "TEAM EFFORT”.
The cooperation and support we must receive from these efforts will in large measure contribute to the progress of our industry, the success of our contractors and the security of our electricians.
Section 5.	There shall be no unlawful discrimination as to race, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status or citizenship status in all employment decisions, including but not limited to recruitment, hiring, compensation, training, apprenticeship, promotion, demotion, downgrading, transfer, layoff and termination, and all other terms and conditions of employment.
ARTICLE I
Section 1.	The terms of this Agreement or any modifications thereof shall be binding, until its termination as defined in Section 2 of
3

Any masculine references used in this Agreement, for convenience only, shall refer to both male and female employees. Any reference to electricians shall mean journeymen, joumeywomen, joumeyperson and apprentices.
Section 2.	(a) This Agreement including the working rules
contained in Article III hereof, which are a part of this Agreement, shall become effective on May 10,2001, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, and shall remain in effect until May 13, 2004, and from year to year thereafter, provided, however, any party hereto may terminate this Agreement on May 13,2004, and any time thereafter by giving the other party at least ninety (90) days notice in writing of modification or termination prior to May 13th of such year.
(b)	The Union agrees that if, during the life of this Agreement, it grants to any other Employer in the Electrical Contracting Industry on work covered by this Agreement, any better terms or conditions than those set forth in this Agreement, such better terms or conditions shall be made available to the Employer under this Agreement and the Union shall immediately notify the Employer of any such concession.
(c)	Pursuant to Rule XIV of the Rules and Regulations of the Joint Industry Board, there shall be submitted to arbitration any question or controversy or dispute between parties to this Agreement. If the Joint Industry Board fails to reach a decision or an appeal is taken from its decision, the Council on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Industry may be selected as the arbitration agency. Any decision made by the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute.
(d)	Should any party to this Agreement desire to modify or amend any article in this Agreement, notice in writing specifying the article desired changed must be given to the other parties. Such changes shall be made by mutual consent of all parties, provided same are in writing and signed by all parties.
(e)	The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall therefore have no restrictions, except those
4
specifically provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement in planning, directing, and controlling the operation of all his work, in deciding the number and kind of employees to properly perform the work, in hiring and laying off employees, in transferring employees from job to job within the local Union’s geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as foreman, in requiring all employees to observe the Employer’s and/or owner's rules and regulations not inconsistent with this Agreement, in requiring all employees to observe all safety regulations, and in discharging employees for proper cause.
(f)	All employees employed by the Employer, shall, as a condition of employment, be or become members of the Union on the 11th day following the beginning of their employment.

Within ten days after the execution of this Agreement, the parties shall notify each other in writing of the names of their representatives to this Joint Industry Board.
Section 2.	The Joint Industry Board shall establish rules and regulations under which it will operate and shall have the power to modify or amend such rules and regulations and will seek to promote harmony between the Employers and the Employees in the industry, and will study and institute a program which will make it possible for the industry to be of greater assistance to those purchasing services, the potential purchasers and the general public.

The individual Employer hereby accepts, and agrees to be bound by, the Restated Employees Benefit Agreement and Trust.
An individual Employer who fails to remit as provided above shall be additionally subject to having this Agreement terminated upon seventy-two (72) hours' notice in writing being served by the Union, provided the individual Employer fails to show satisfactory proof that the required payments have been paid to the appropriate local collection agent.
The failure of an individual Employer to comply with the applicable provisions of the Restated Employees Benefit Agreement and Trust shall also constitute a breach of this labor Agreement.
ARTICLE VII Supportive Union Action
There shall be no general stoppage of work either by strike or lockout.
However, this Agreement does not deny the right of the Union or its representatives to render assistance to other labor organizations by removal of its members from jobs when necessary and when the Union or its proper representatives decide to do so, but no removal shall take place until notice is first given to the Employer involved.
In the event that a General Strike is called to protest the national level of unemployment, the members of this bargaining unit shall not be precluded from joining the strike.
ARTICLE VIII Separability
Should any provision of this Agreement be declared illegal by any court of competent jurisdiction such provision shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of the Agreement in full
