A "grievance" shall mean an allegation by a teacher resulting in a dispute or disagreement between the teacher employee and the School Board as to the interpretation or application of terms and conditions of employment, insofar as such matters are contained in this agreement.

5-2-2 The Grievant

In the event the Federation chooses not to process a grievance at any level, the grievant shall not be limited from proceeding independently or with representation other than the Federation. The grievant shall be present at all steps of the procedure that the grievant elects to pursue. In the case of a group grievance where more than one teacher is involved, the group shall choose three or fewer teachers to act as grievants.

5-5 Time Limits
Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance within the specified time limits shall permit the aggrieved teacher to proceed to the next step. Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a grievance to the next step within the specified time limit shall be deemed to be acceptance of the decision rendered at that step.
5-6 Computation of Time
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by procedures herein, the date of the act, event or default for which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be counted, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday or a school holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a school holiday.
5-7 Filing and Postmark
The filing or service of any notice or document herein shall be timely if it bears a postmark of the United States mail within the time period.	...
5-8 Adjustment of Grievances
All effort shall be made to resolve any conflict by the teacher involved, with the supervisor or administrator directly involved. Any grievance must be filed within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) school days from the date of the occurrence alleged to be a grievance and every effort shall be made to keep the grievance from carrying over into another fiscal year. Grievances of a teacher, during the course of the teacher's employment, shall be presented and adjusted in the following manner:
5-8-1 First Level
The statement of the grievance shall be in writing and the proceedings informal. It shall be submitted on the prescribed form to the first- level administrator who possesses the authority to adjust the grievance. A copy shall be submitted to the Federation and the Executive Director of Human Resources.
The written grievance shall state the facts upon which it is based, the provisions in the agreement allegedly violated and the relief requested. Within ten (10) school days after receipt of said written grievance, the supervisor or administrator shall discuss the allegation with the teacher in order to seek a satisfactory settlement of the grievance. The supervisor or administrator shall submit a decision in writing to the teacher, to the superintendent and to the
11
Federation. If a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached within ten (10) school days, the second level may be initiated within five (5) school days thereafter.
5-8-2 Second Level
Any teacher who has not received satisfactory settlement as outlined in the first level shall submit the grievance in writing with a letter of transmittal to the superintendent of schools. Within fifteen (15) school days of receipt of the grievance, the superintendent, or the superintendent's designate, shall meet with the aggrieved, the supervisor or administrator directly involved in an effort to reach a satisfactory settlement. The superintendent, or the superintendent's designate, shall render the superintendent's decision in writing to the parties involved, including the Federation. If a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached within fifteen (15) school days after the superintendent's hearing, the third level may be initiated within five (5) school days thereafter.
5-8-3 Third Level
If a satisfactory settlement is not reached at the second level, either party may voluntarily request mediation through the Bureau of Mediation Services. The School Board will receive notice the grievance has reached the third level. Both parties must agree to use this step; otherwise, the unresolved grievance will proceed to the fourth level. If no agreement is reached within twenty (20) days, the unresolved grievance will proceed to the fourth level.
5-8-4 Fourth Level
Within said five (5) days, either party may request arbitration. The parties shall, within ten (10) days after the request to arbitrate, attempt to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator. If no agreement on an arbitrator is reached, either party may request the Bureau of Mediation Services to submit a list of five arbitrators, providing such request is made within twenty (20) days after request for arbitration. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list of five until only one name remains that shall be the agreed-upon arbitrator. Failure to request a list of arbitrators from the Bureau of Mediation Services within the time periods provided herein shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
5-9 Hearing
A single arbitrator shall hear the grievance and both parties may be represented by such person or persons as they may choose provided the selection is consistent with 5-2-2. The parties shall have the right to a hearing at which time both parties will have the opportunity to submit evidence, offer testimony and make oral or written arguments relating to the issues before the arbitrator. The proceeding before the arbitrator shall be a hearing de nova. The arbitrator shall swear all witnesses upon oath.
5-10 Decision
The decision by the arbitrator shall be rendered within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing. Decisions by the arbitrator in cases properly before the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties, subject, however, to the limitations to arbitration decisions as provided by in the Bureau of Mediation Services, as amended. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision and order including findings of fact that should be based upon substantial and competent evidence presented at the hearing.
5-11 Expense

23
7-5 Extended Contracts
At the end of the 1995-96 school year all Lifework Coordinators were placed on unrequested leave and recalled to a standard teacher contract. Since that time, a pool of days has been established annually by the District for each of the high school lifework departments to be used by the individual lifework coordinators. The pool of days for the high school will be equitably distributed using a formula that incorporates the number of students registered for each lifework coordinator's program as compared to the total number of students enrolled in all of the lifework programs in that building. The student count to be used is the number of students officially registered for the program as of March 1 prior to the school year. (For example: if a lifework coordinator has 25% of all the students enrolled in all the lifework programs enrolled in his/her.program, he/she will receive 25% of the days allocated to that building for the next school year. Modification to the formula may be made by the Executive Director for Teaching and Learning due to student programming needs.

Requests must be submitted before the first day of May in order to be considered for the following school year. Such exchange of positions will normally remain in effect for the entire school year. At the end of the school year, the teachers may agree to a permanent exchange of positions subject to approval of both the school principals and the Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning, and subject to other limitations set forth in this agreement.
8-2-4 Exclusion from Voluntary Transfer
A teacher who is on a performance improvement plan may not seek a voluntary transfer without mutual consent of the teacher, the building principal, and human resources.
8-3 Involuntary Transfers
8-3-1 Involuntary Transfers Which Are Not Administrative Transfers
Except for administrative transfers described in 8-3-2, involuntary transfers shall be made based on district-wide seniority and area of licensure.
8-3-2 Administrative Transfers
These are transfers that are initiated by the administration. Administrative transfers may be made for three reasons:
1.	Changes in school enrollment which differ from, projections made by the administration prior to the operation of the transfer pools (included in this category are changes in class enrollments which result from actual student registrations);
2.	Unsatisfactory work on the part of the teacher;
3.	Programmatic needs of the district.
8-3-2-1 Administrative Transfers Due to Changes in School/Class Enrollments
When transfers between schools are initiated based on changes in school enrollments, or changes in projected secondary class enrollments, the teacher to be transferred shall be that person in the building who possesses the least district-wide seniority by area of licensure, or a teacher in the building who voluntarily agrees to the transfer.
At the elementary schools where this procedure would necessitate bumping in the building, the administration may choose to transfer.the least senior teacher assigned to the grade level in which a position is to be eliminated rather than the least senior teacher in the building. The least senior teacher, as elsewhere in this agreement, refers to the teacher possessing the least amount of district-wide seniority.
25
Transfers due to changes in school/class enrollments shall be initiated by the administration in the following manner:
Secondary transfers shall be initiated on or before the tenth (10th) student school day of each semester. Elementary transfers shall be initiated on or before the tenth (10th) student school day after the following natural breaks: a. The beginning of the school year for students;
b.	Parent/teacher conference day in the fall;
c.	The end of the winter recess.
8-3-2-2 Administrative Transfers Due to Unsatisfactory Work on the Part of a Teacher
Normally, when transfers are initiated based on unsatisfactory work, the following steps will be taken:
Step 1: When a teacher's work performance is unsatisfactory, the principal shall notify the teacher in writing, stating the reasons for the principal's dissatisfaction with the teacher's performance. The teacher shall have ten (10) teaching days in which to respond in writing to the principal's notice. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning and the Executive Director of Human Resources who may offer, in writing, further corrective steps to be taken by the teacher after consultation with the teacher and the principal.
Step 2: After notice has been given to the teacher, and after corrective steps have been attempted, if the teacher's work does not improve to the satisfaction of the principal and appropriate administrator, and if in the judgment of the appropriate administrator a change in placement and assignment indicates a possibility for satisfactory work, a transfer to another building may be made before the end of the school year, normally to become effective at the beginning of the next school year.
Step 3: The receiving principal shall be informed within a reasonable time in advance of the teacher's transfer and shall be informed of the steps taken or to be taken in attempting to assist the teacher to make a satisfactory adjustment.
8-3-2-3 Administrative Transfers Due to Programmatic Needs of the District
Transfers may be initiated based on programmatic needs when:
1.	The Minnesota Department of Education rules and/or regulations requires the course offering;
2.	The course offering is an elective and the offering is retained by the administration in the building curriculum;
3.	There exists a serious imbalance in the ratio of male/female teachers in physical education within a particular school so student locker-room supervision cannot be provided by a teacher of the same sex based on current staffing.
4.	Dual licensure is required for a position.
Transfers will be implemented by district-wide seniority and licensure.
26
8-4 Special Assignment
A teacher on special assignment is a teacher who holds a bargaining unit position for which the School Board requires special qualifications beyond those required by the Minnesota Board of Teaching or the Minnesota Department of Education. The specific job duties for the teacher on special assignment shall be defined by the school district. Lead teachers in special education are considered to be on special assignment.
By notifying the Human Resources Office prior to February 1, a teacher on special assignment may return to a position in the bargaining unit similar to the one the teacher held prior to accepting the special assignment. Transfers from special assignment positions to other bargaining unit positions must conform to the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding Minnesota Statute 122A.40, a teacher on special assignment shall not be bumped from such a position due to the placement of a more senior teacher in the same licensure area on unrequested leave of absence.
8-5 Staffing Process
The District and the RFT shall agree to a timeline for the staffing process for the following school year by February 1.
8-5-1 Internal Building Staffing
Internal building staffing occurs after the district determines its district-wide staffing needs by licensure area and before positions are posted in Transfer Pool 1 and between the first and second posting of Pool 1. Internal building staffing may occur again after the transfer pools are closed.
Assignments within a building and/or department shall be made by the building principal following consultation with the RFT'chief building representative and the parties involved before any vacancies are openly declared. The principal has the final authority to determine placement within the building. The dates for internal building staffing are set by the School Board, based upon concurrence with the Federation President and the Human Resources office.
A full-time teacher assigned to more than one building is considered assigned to that building which is the larger or largest portion of his/her total assignment. If the larger of the two (or the largest of more than two) portions are equal, between or among buildings, the teacher must designate which of his/her buildings is to be the assigned building for the school year by October 1 of the school year. This does not apply to part-time teachers, even if the teacher possesses the right to retain a full-time position as outlined in 6-14.
8-5-2 Displacement of Teachers from Buildings
After internal staffing occurs, it may be necessary to displace some teachers from one or more buildings. If this occurs, the teacher or teachers with the least district-wide seniority shall be displaced from the buildings by area of licensure and their names placed in Transfer Pool 1.
8-5-2-1 Building Closing
In the event of a building being closed teachers with continuing contract rights shall participate in a similar pool process prior to the district transfer pools described in 8-5-4-1 and 8-5-4-2.

Teachers wishing to voluntarily transfer for the ensuing school year may participate in Transfer Pool 1 and Transfer Pool 2. Teachers involved in an involuntary transfer shall have their names placed in Transfer Pool 1, and if a position is not secured during Transfer Pool 1, shall have their names placed in Transfer Pool 2.
8-5-4-1 Transfer Pool 1
Transfer Pool 1 will include the following eligible teachers:
a.	Teachers involuntarily displaced as described in 8-5-2.
b.	Teachers returning from leave of absence.

Transfer Pool 2 will contain the names of the following:
a.	Teachers whose names were contained in Transfer Pool 1 who did not obtain a position for the ensuing school year.
b.	Teachers voluntarily seeking a transfer effective for the ensuing school year.
A teacher who voluntarily joins Transfer Pool 2 must notify Executive Director of Human Resources, in writing. A teacher who chooses to participate in Transfer Pool 2 places his/her position and building assignment in the pool. Assignments for teachers whose names are in Transfer Pool 2 are determined based on seniority and area of licensure.
After selection of position from pool 2, the teacher shall contact the building principal/program director to discuss job expectations and building procedures related to the assignment.
*Pool 2 listings may also have building/program expectations and job descriptions attached by supervisor to better inform the candidate on the assignment.
8-5-4-3 Closing of Pools
Transfer Pool 2 shall begin shortly after the completion of Transfer Pool 1.
Transfer Pool 2 will last until all teachers are contacted and make their selection.
8-5-4-4 Assignments That Occur After the Close of Transfer Pool 2
Teachers whose names are in Transfer Pool 2 and who did not select a position by the close of Transfer Pool 2 will be assigned to an existing vacancy by the Executive Director of Human Resources.

Memorandum of Understanding
Compensation Rate for Middle School Activities
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into between Independent School District 281 (hereinafter "School District") and the Robbinsdale Federation of Teachers (hereinafter "RFT").
Whereas the RFT is the exclusive representative of teacher compensation in the collective bargaining agreement and
Whereas the parties wish to modify the compensation rate for middle school activities listed in Article 3-1 and 3-2 with the exception of Environmental Camps and Intramural.
Whereas the new duty time model for all activities stated will result in a reduction of time to 62.7% of the previous duty time for scheduled activities and the practices associated with them.
