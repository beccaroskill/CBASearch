ARTICLE 20 - LAYOFF
20.1	Layoff Defined
	A layoff is an involuntary separation from service or an involuntary reduction in an employee’s hours or work year as defined herein based upon a lack of work or lack of funds. A layoff also includes any reduction in hours or work year or assignment to a classification lower than that which the employee has permanence, voluntarily consented to by the employee, in order to avoid interruption of employment by layoff. Temporary and substitute employees may be separated at the completion of their assignment without regard to the procedures in this Article.
20.2	Probationary Work Year Defined For purposes of this Article 20 (Layoff) only, all members of the bargaining unit shall be assigned to a work year, as defined herein, depending upon the number of days per school year they work. An employee working from 179 to 181 days shall be assigned a nine (9) month work year. An employee working from 182 to 208 days shall be assigned a ten (10) month work year. An employee working from 209 to 241 days shall be assigned an eleven (11) month work year. An employee working more than 241 days shall be assigned a twelve (12) month work year.
20.3	Layoff Seniority For purposes of Article 20 (Layoff), seniority is established by the employee’s date of hire as a regular probationary or permanent employee of the District in the classification (this calculation does not include any substitute or temporary time served by the unit member unless this time was used to compute the completion of the employee’s probationary work year under Section 14.3.1) plus any service in higher classes (i.e., those with higher pay ranges) with deductions for any unpaid time as outlined below. Except for reinstatement within thirty nine (39) months or reemployment as a probationary employee within the same class within one year of
- 123 -
	resignation, a break in employment and subsequent reemployment shall create a new hire date. If two or more employees subject to layoff have equal seniority as defined herein, then the employee with the most recent hire date in the District shall be laid off first. If date of hire in the District does not break the tie then the tie shall be broken by random drawing.
20.3.1	Service Credit for Certain Unpaid Leaves The District shall grant seniority credit for time spent on unpaid leaves in the following areas: Military Leave, Illness Leave, Maternity Leave, Industrial Accident/Illness Leave, family care leave (see section 12.12.6) and any other unpaid leaves permitted by the Education Code under Section 45308.
20.3.2	No Service Credit for Other Unpaid Leaves In the event that an employee returns to work following an unpaid leave not listed above, the employee shall not receive accrued seniority for the time not worked.
20.3.3	The Superintendent or designee shall maintain a current determination of each employee’s seniority.
20.4	Order of Layoff The employee who has been employed the shortest time in the classification, hours, and work year to be eliminated or for which the hours will be reduced shall be laid off first.
20.5	District and Union Rights The District reserves, retains, and is vested with the sole and exclusive right to layoff employees for any reason allowed by law. In the exercise of this exclusive right, the District makes the sole determination as the hours and the positions to be eliminated. The Union retains the right to negotiate the impacts and effects of the layoff of unit members.
- 124-
20.6
Layoff Procedure
	Positions to be eliminated or for which hours will be reduced shall be identified by the District by classification, hours1.
20.6.1	First Step: Administrative Transfer The employee(s) in the position(s) to be eliminated or for which the hours will be reduced by the District shall be administratively transferred to a vacant position, if any, in the same classification, hours, and work year. If there is more than one vacancy in the classification, hours, and work year the employee shall be allowed to select a vacancy. If there is one or more employees in the same classification, hours and work year in the position to be eliminated or for which the hours will be reduced, the most senior employee shall be administratively transferred first. Employees being transferred under this section shall receive at least ten (10) working days notice of their new assignment.
20.6.2	Second Step: Layoff If there are no vacancies in the classification, hours, and work year of the position to be eliminated or for which the hours will be reduced the District shall engage in a layoff.
20.6.3	Third Step: Bumping Rights Within a Classification An employee whose position is being eliminated or for which the hours will be reduced may displace the employee within his/her classification, hours, and work year who has the least seniority.
20.6.4	Fourth Step: Bumping Rights to Another Classification The employee having the least seniority within his/her classification, hours, and work year who is to be laid off, and who has seniority in a different classification, hours, and work year (with an equal or lower maximum salary range) greater than that of an incumbent, shall be placed in a vacancy, if any. If no vacancy exists then the employee shall have the right to displace the
For layoff purposes only, assignments with fractional hours shall be rounded up or
down as follows: 0 - 1.99 = 1; 2 - 2.99 = 2; 3 - 3.99 = 3; 4- 4.99 = 4; 5- 5.99 = 5;
6 - 6.99 = 6; 7- 7.99 = 7; and 8 = 8.
- 125 -
	incumbent with the least seniority in that classification, hours, and work year.
20.6.4.1	Bumping Rules An employee who has been displaced by bumping shall have the same bumping rights as if his/her position had been eliminated. Employees in positions for which the District is reducing the assigned time shall have bumping rights as if the position was being eliminated. An employee shall not bump into a higher classification (i.e., one that has a higher salary range), more hours, or a longer work year. If an employee waives bumping rights, he/she shall be placed on a thirty nine (39) month reemployment list.
20.6.5	Layoff Notice Employees subject to layoff shall receive notice of the layoff 30 days before the effective date. They shall be informed of their reemployment rights and bumping rights, if any.
20.7	Voluntary Demotions/Reductions Upon mutual agreement with the District, employees may elect to take a voluntary demotion (i.e., a change to a classification for which they are qualified with a lower maximum salary rate) or a voluntary reduction in assigned time (either hours per day or work year as defined herein) in lieu of layoff or to remain in their present position rather than be reclassified or reassigned. Employees who do so shall be granted the same rights as persons laid off.
20.8	Reemployment Rights Classified employees laid off because of lack of work or lack of funds are eligible for reemployment for a period of 39 months and shall be reemployed in preference of new applicants. Persons so laid off also have the right to apply and establish their qualification for vacant promotional positions within the District during the 39 month period.
20.8.1	Employees who take voluntary demotions or voluntary reductions in assigned time in lieu of layoff or to remain in their present position rather than be reclassified or reassigned, shall be granted
- 126-
	the same rights as person laid off and shall retain eligibility to be considered for reemployment for an additional period of 24 months; provided, that the same tests of fitness under which they qualified for appointment to the class shall still apply. Employees who take voluntary reductions in assigned time in lieu of layoff or to remain in their present position rather than be reclassified or reassigned shall be hired into positions within their class with greater hours, up to the hours of their position before taking a voluntary reduction in assigned time, in preference of new applicants.
20.8.2	Upon rejecting two (2) offers of reemployment, the employee’s name shall be removed from the reemployment list and he/she shall forfeit all rights to which he/she would otherwise be entitled. If an employee on the 39 month reemployment list is hired by the District to a different classification than that which the employee was laid off from, he/she shall remain on the 39 month reemployment list.

APPENDIX A
RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SALARY SCHEDULE
1	Placement on the Schedule An employee shall be placed on the first step of the appropriate salary range except for a maintenance employee who is paid on a flat hourly or month rate.
1.1	Experience Credit The director, Classified Personnel Services, may grant (1) step for each year of related or allied experience if necessary to recruit highly qualified candidates; provided that no initial placement shall be higher than the median step of the range except by approval of the Board.
1.2	Reemployment Rights A permanent employee who resigns from the District and is subsequently reemployed as a probationary employee in the same classification within six (6) months of their resignation from service shall be reemployed with the same level of benefits under the contract he/she had when he/she resigned (e.g., step, longevity, seniority, professional growth, etc.). Any such reemployed person shall not be considered to have a break in service provided, however, that the employee shall have his/her seniority date reflect the period of his/her absence.
2	Earned Increments A regular employee, except a maintenance employee who is paid on a flat hourly or monthly rate, shall be advanced to the next higher step of the salary range on the first day of the month following the completion of one (1) year of employment until the maximum salary for the range is reached; provided the employee receives compensation for seventy-five percent (75%) of the required workdays. The services of an employee who starts on the first working day of a month shall be considered as dating from the first calendar day of such month for the purposes of this section.
3	Method of Payment
3.1	Twelve-Month Workyear A full-time, twelve (12) month employee shall be compensated at the appropriate monthly amount shown on the salary schedule. Part-time, twelve-month (12) employees shall receive a pro rata amount of the monthly amount based on his/her percent of time.

Nine, Ten and Eleven-Month Workyear
Employees shall have their salary computed using the appropriate hourly amount shown on the salary schedule.
Salary Rate on Reassignment to Class with Higher Salary Range
The following stipulations shall govern salary schedule placement:
If eligible, the employee first shall be granted an earned increment on his/her previous range.
If the previous salary, including increment adjustment, is below the first step in the new range, the employee shall be placed on the step which most closely approximates a five percent (5%) salary increase.
If the previous salary, including increment adjustment, is found on the new range, the employee shall be placed one (1) step higher.
If the previous salary, including increment adjustments, is in between steps on the range, he/she shall be placed two (2) steps higher.
Salary Rate on Reassignment to Class with Lower Salary Range
The following stipulations shall govern the salary schedule placement of an employee who is reassigned to a class with a lower salary maximum as a result of a voluntary demotion or because of a reduction in force:
If eligible, the employee first shall be granted an earned increment on his/her previous range.
If the previous salary, including increment adjustment, is found on the new range, the employee shall be placed on that step.
If the previous salary, including increment adjustment, is between steps on the new range, step placement in the new range shall be the next higher dollar amount.
If the previous salary, including increment adjustment, is above the maximum step in the new range, the new salary will be set at the maximum step.
When an employee is involuntarily reassigned to a classification with a lower salary maximum for reasons other than disciplinary action or reduction in force, or if his/her position is reallocated to a lower salary range, he/she shall suffer no loss in salary. If the previous salary, including increment adjustment, is higher than the maximum of the new class, he/she shall be “Y” rated.
5.3	When an employee is reassigned to a class with a lower salary maximum as a disciplinary action, step placement shall reflect total years of experience in both the class from which the employee is demoted and the class to which he/she is reassigned.
6	Reallocation of Class to a Higher Salary Range Whenever a class or position(s) within a class is reallocated to a higher salary range, all incumbent employees affected shall be placed on the same step in the new range as they occupied on the previous one.
7	Hourly Pay Calculations Hourly pay rates shall be determined by dividing the monthly rate by 173.33. (This division is a constant which represents the average number of working hours in a work month.)

Family Medical Leave act/Californla Family Rights act
Family Medical Leave Act/California Family Rights Act
Introduction:
The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA) parallel each other in all but a few areas. The FMLA specifically provides that any state law which provides greater employee rights will supersede the FMLA. In other words, where the CFRA creates rights and obligations which are absent from the FMLA, those rights and obligations may be enforced pursuant to the CFRA so long as the difference amounts to greater rights to the employee. In all cases except leave associated with pregnancy disability, however, rights and obligations pursuant to the FMLA and the CFRA shall run concurrently, 12 weeks of leave during a 12-month period count towards statutory maximums with regard to both the FMLA and the CFRA.
The following is a summary of the rights and obligations created under the FMLA and the CFRA. A distinction has be made between the two in areas where the two differ. The FMLA and CFRA may contain additional rights and obligations and both Acts should be referred to directly before attempting to exercise or assess the rights or obligations addressed in the following summary.
Definitions:
Child:
Means a biological, adopted, of foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis (in place of a parent) who is either under 18 years of age or is 18 years of age or older and incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability.
Parent:
A biological, foster or adoptive parent, step-parent, or someone who stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child.
Spouse:
Means a partner in marriage as defined in Family Code §300.
Serious Health Condition:
Is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition which involves inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential care facility, or continuing treatment or continuing supervision by
a health care provider.
Health Care Provider:
Is defined as a doctor of medicine or osteopathy authorized to practice medicine or surgery by the state in which the doctor practices, or any other person determined by the United States Secretary of Labor to be capable of providing health-care services.
EligibleJElmplfiyfies:
Any employee with more than 12 months of service with the Sacramento City Unified School District and who has worked for the District a minimum of 1250 hours during the preceding 12 month period is entitled to family and medical leave, childbirth, or related medical conditions.
Duration of Allowable Leave:
All eligible district employees are entitled to family care leave up to a total of 12 workweeks per 12 month period. Time periods and eligible leave for purposes of the CFRA shall run concurrently with time periods and eligible leave for purposes of the FMLA, except for any leave under the FMLA for disability on account of pregnancy.
Entitlement to Leave:
An eligible employee is entitled to take family care leave for one or more of the following reasons:
(1)	Birth of a child of the employee.
(2)	Placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care.
(3)	Serious health condition of the employee’s child, spouse or parent.
(4)	Serious health condition of the employee.
Unlike the FMLA, pregnancy, childbirth and related medical conditions are excluded from the definition of serious health conditions under the CFRA. Therefore, under the CFRA, any leave for pregnancy disability pursuant to Government Code section 12945 is in addition to family and medical leave.
RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON LEAVE
Expiration of Entitlement:
Entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of a child shall expire 12 months after the birth or placement of the child.
Intermittent or Reduced Leave:
Leave taken pursuant to CFRA may be taken in one or more periods.
Leave pursuant to FMLA for the birth or placement of a child shall not be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the District and the employee agree otherwise.
Entitlement to leave for a serious health condition of an employee or an employee’s child, spouse or parent, when necessary for medical reasons, may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule. Whether or not leave is taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the total amount of leave to which the employee is entitled shall not be reduced beyond the amount of leave actually taken.
The District may require an employee, requesting intermittent or reduced leave as a result of planned medical treatment, to transfer temporarily to an alternate position which:
a)	has equivalent pay and benefits; and
b)	accommodates recurring periods of leave better than employee’s regular position.
Unpaid Leave:
Leave granted pursuant to either Act may be unpaid.
Relationship to Paid Leave:
The District may require or an employee may elect to substitute any available paid leave which the District would normally provide for any part of the 12-week period of leave taken pursuant to either Act. However, under CFRA, an employee may not use sick leave for the birth of a child or to care for a family member unless it is mutually agreed upon between the District and the employee.
Under FMLA, an employee may elect, or an employer may require, substitution of paid sick or medical leave for leave to care for a sick family member, except that nothing in the FMLA requires an employer to provide paid sick or paid medical leave in any situation which such employer would not normally provide such paid leave.
Paid leave should be charged concurrently with FMLA and CFRA leave.
Foreseeable Leave:
In instances of the birth or placement of a child, if the necessity for leave is foreseeable, the employee shall give the District a minimum of 30 day’s notice of his/her intent to take leave, unless there is a need for leave to begin in less than 30 days, in which case notice shall be given as soon as practicable.
In instances of serious health conditions, if the necessity for leave is foreseeable, the employee shall:
1)	attempt to schedule the treatment based on approval of the health care provider at a time which provides the least disruption to the District; and
2)	shall give the District a minimum of 30 day’s notice of his/her intent to take leave, unless there is a need for leave to begin in less than 30 days, in which case notice shall be given as soon as practicable.
Spouses Employed by the Same Employer:
The CFRA and the FMLA differ with regard to the amount of leave allowed where a husband and wife are employed by the same employer. The CFRA limits leave for spouses employed by the same employer to an aggregate of 12 weeks where leave is for the birth or placement of a child. The FMLA also has this restriction, but places the same limits on leave for spouses employed by the same employer to care for a parent with a serious health condition.
CERTIFICATION
The District may require that employees taking leave for reasons constituting a serious health condition of either the employee or the employee’s family shall provide certification by the relevant health care provider supporting the request for leave.
Certification shall contain the following:
1)	date on which serious health condition commenced.
2)	probable duration of the condition.
3)	either a statement that the employee is needed to care for the child, spouse or parent and an estimate of the time needed or a statement that
the employee is unable to perform his/her job for intermittent or reduced leave certification and duration of the treatment or necessity and the expected duration and schedule of the leave.1
Second Opinion:
If the District questions the certification provided by the employee regarding the employee’s own serious health condition, the District may require the employee to obtain a second opinion at District expense. The second health care provider must be designated or approved by the District, but shall not be employed by the District, and the second opinion may deal with any of the certification requirements.
Conflicting Opinions:
If the first and second opinions differ regarding an employee’s own serious health condition, the District may require that a third opinion be obtained at District expense. The third health care provider must be approved or designated jointly by the District and the employee. The third opinion shall be binding on the District and the employee.
Subsequent Recertification:
The District may require the employee provide subsequent recertifications on a reasonable basis.
RESTORATION OF POSITION
Employment and Benefits Protection:
Any employee that takes leave shall be entitled, upon return from leave, to the same position or an equivalent position with equal benefits, pay terms and condition.
Leave taken pursuant to this Act shall not result in the loss of any employment benefits which accrued prior to the employee’s leave. For example, if the employee has qualified for 3 days of personal leave each year, the employee may not be reinstated at a rate of 2 days of personal leave each year unless the reduction is unrelated to use of family leave. Employment benefits, however, may be exhausted in that the employer may require the employee to use accumulated paid leave during the period of leave provided under the Act.
The FMLA also requires a statement of the diagnosis of the condition. California law does not allow an employer to request information regarding the serious health condition involved.
An employee returning from leave is not entitled to any right, benefit or position which the employee would not have already been entitled had he/she not taken leave. To deny reinstatement the District must prove that the position ceased to exist solely as a result of business reasons.
The District may require an employee on leave for a serious health condition to provide certification that he/she is able to return to work.
The District may require an employee on leave to report periodically on his/her expected return to work.
The District must provide an employee on leave with any “unconditional” pay granted during leave.
Exemption Concerning Certain Highly Compensated Employees:
Any salaried employee that is among the top 10% highest paid employees of the District may be denied restoration if:
1)	the denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the District;
2)	the District notifies the employee upon determining that such injury would occur; and
3)	in any case where leave has commenced, the employee elects not to return to employment after receiving such notice.
Maintenance of Health Benefits:
The District shall maintain coverage of an employee’s “group health plan” during the duration of the employee’s leave.
The District may recover premiums paid for maintaining an employee’s group health plan during leave if the employee fails to return to work after the expiration of his/her leave for reasons other than:
1)	the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition; or
2)	other uncontrollable circumstances.
If an employee’s failure to return to work is a result of the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition, the District may require the employee provide certification to the District.
The required certification shall be sufficient if it states that a serious health condition prevented employee from performing his/her job or that the employee is needed for the care of a child, spouse or parent on the date that the leave of the employee expired.
PROHIBITED ACTS
The District may not interfere with, restrain, deny the exercise of, or discriminate against any individual attempting to exercise any right or opposing any unlawfill practice under these Acts.
No person may discriminate against or discharge any individual acting in any proceeding instituted under these Acts.

SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
AND
SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 790
195-Day Rule: Education Code Section 45103
A dispute has arisen, between the Sacramento City Unified School District, hereinafter the ‘District,” and the Service Employees International Union, (SEIU) Local 790, hereinafter ‘Union,” regarding the interpretation and application of Section 2.5, 2.8, 2.9, 14.3.1 of the contract and Education Code § 45103. The District and the Union have agreed to execute this Letter of Agreement regarding the future application of the above-referenced provisions (more commonly referred to as the “195-day Rule”).
The District and the Union agree to the application of the “195-day Rule” as follows:
1.	Any long-term temporary1, long-term substitute2, short-term temporary3, or shortterm substitute4 employee who works for the District, irrespective of the number of hours worked per day, for more than 194 working days, including holidays, sick leave, vacation and other paid leaves of absences, within one school year5, shall become a probationary classified employee of the District, as outlined herein. A break in service will not effect the calculation of number of working days for purposes of determining classified status.
2.	If a long-term temporary, long-term substitute, short-term temporary, or short-term
i
. Section 2.5 defines a long-term temporary employee as: “any person who is employed to perform a service for the District for a limited term of employment of not less than six (6) months nor more than 194 days, including legal holidays, board granted holidays, and earned vacation, and whose service is not anticipated to continue beyond this time.”
2
Section 2.8 defines a long-term substitute employee as: “a person who is employed to fill a regular, board-authorized position due to the absence of a regular employee for a period of not less than six (6) months nor more than 194 days, including holidays, board granted holidays, and earned vacation.”
3
Section 2.6 defines a short-term temporary employee as: “any person who is employed to perform a service for the District for a period of less than six (6) months, upon the completion of which, the service required or similar services will not be extended or needed on a continuing basis.”
4
Section 2.7 defines a short-term substitute employee as: “a person who is employed to fill a regular, Board-authorized position due to the absence of a regular employee for a period of less than six (6) months.”

substitute employee, whose service is performed at the same school or site with the same immediate supervisor, is appointed as a probationary employee to the same position, or to another position in the same class, the time served in the position shall be counted in computing the completion date of the probationary period6, provided there is no break in service.
3.	Any permanent classified employee who assumes the responsibilities of another position of a different classification or who is on a “limited term assignment”7 who works more than 194 days, including, but not limited to, holidays, board granted holidays, earned vacation and any paid leave of absence, shall, if all other conditions of the contract are met, be entitled to, among other contract rights, out-of-class pay in accordance with § 6.6 of the Contract. However, a permanent classified employee who assumes the responsibilities of another position in a different classification or who is on a “limited term assignment” for more than 194 days does not acquire any rights to that position nor any rights to such a position in that classification.
4.	Both parties agree that the above interpretation of the Contract and Education Code is consistent with the Contract and current practice of the District. Both parties desire to have this agreement establish precedent and be binding against each party.
Application of the 195-Day Rule
A number of issues have arisen regarding the application of the “195-Day Rule” as outlined above. The following hypothetical is intended to clarify those issues and outline the mutual understanding and agreement between the parties regarding the application of the 195-Day Rule. Following the hypothetical are the issues raised therein and the mutually agreed upon resolution and rules relied upon in arriving at the resolution. The hypothetical is for example only and is not intended to limit the applicability of the rules outlined herein to the facts stated therein.
Hypothetical Situation
On October 1, 1997, the District hired employee “A” as a short-term temporary employee8 to assist the payroll technicians in the District administrative office. Employee “A” is paid as a temporary employee and does not accrue vacation or sick leave credits. In addition, employee “A” is excluded
6
Section 14.3.1 defines the probationary period for classified employees to be one (1) year from date of hire as a probationary employee.
7
Section 2.9 defines a limited term assignment to mean: “a permanent or probationary employee who is transferred to aposition of limited duration or replaces another employee on leave of absence, the employee retains his/her basic employment classification during the course of such assignment.”
8
Section 2.6 of the Contract defines a “short-term temporary employee” as “any person who is employed to perform a services for the District for a period of less than six (6) months, upon the completion of which, the service required or similar services will not be extended or needed on a continuing basis.”
Side Letter of Agreement
195-Day Rule: Education Code section 45103
Page 2 of 6
from the Office-technical bargaining unit (see exclusion under Section 1.3.5.2.1). Employee “A” works (at the same site and under the same supervisor) beyond the six (6) months for which he/she was hired and continues to work more than seventy-five (75%) percent of the 1997-98 school year (i.e., more than 194 working days) thereby becoming a probationary classified employee of the District (see Section [1] above).
Resolution
The above hypothetical raises the following issues, which the parties agree shall be resolved utilizing the following rules:
A.	Does employee “A” become a permanent employee of the District upon completion of 195 working days of service?	.
Answer: No. Employee “A, ”, upon working more than seventy-five (75%) percent of the school year defined (defined as 195 working days, including holidays, sick leave, vacation and other leaves of absences, irrespective of the number of hours worked per day—Education Code Section 45103) becomes part of the classified service as a probationary employee. (See Letter of Agreement dated August 5, 1997 attached to the Master Contract as Attachment E). Employee “A” shall become a permanent employee only after completing the probationary period. (See Section 14.3.1 of the Contract).
B.	What classification and hours will employee “A” be assigned upon becoming a probationary employee of the District?
Answer: Employee “A” shall become a probationary employee of the District, as outlined above, in the classification and with the hours and work vacation group that the employee is assigned (excluding overtime and extra assignment work) on the 195th day of service, provided that the employee worked in the same classification, hours and work vacation group during the entire 195 days and there exists a vacancy in this classification, hours, and work vacation group. If there is more than one vacancy, the employee shall be allowed to select the vacancy he/she would like to fill.
If the employee has worked in different assignments during the course of his/her 195 days of service, then the employee shall be placed in the classification, hours and work vacation group for which the employee had the greatest length of service (working days only—not hours) during his/her 195 days of service, assuming there is a vacancy in this classification, hours and work vacation group. If there is more than one vacancy then the employee shall be allowed to select which vacancy he/she would like to fill.
In either of the above two scenarios, if there is no vacancy in the classification, hours and work vacation group to which the employee has rights, then the employee shall be subject to layoff. The employee shall be allowed to exercise any “bumping rights” he/she may have under Contract or board policy. Nothing contained herein shall interfere with the District’s right to discipline or release a probationary employee.
Side Letter of Agreement
195-Day Rule: Education Code section 45103
Page 3 of 6
C.	What if employee “A” had been hired to worked as a short-term or long-term substitute employee in an “encumbered” position (i.e., a regular employee of the District has return rights to the position) and work more than seventy-five (75%) percent of the school year?
Answer: Employee “A” would become a probationary classified employee in an encumbered position (an “encumbered” position is a position for which a probationary or permanent employee of the District has return rights), upon completing 195 working days within one school year. Upon return of the employee with rights to the position, Employee “A” shall first be assigned to regular vacancies in the classification, hours and work vacation group to which he/she has become a probationary employee. If no vacancy exists, then the employee shall be subject to layoff. Nothing contained herein shall interfere with the District’s right to discipline or release a probationary employee.
D.	If employee “A” completes the probationary period in accordance with Section 14.3.1 of the Contract and becomes a permanent employee, is he/she entitled to sick leave and vacation accrual for his/her probationary period?
Answer: Yes. Employee “A” will be credited with vacation and sick leave credits for the time spent in the position as a probationary classified employee. In the situation where the employee has served in multiple positions before working more than seventy-five (75%) percent of the school year, after the employee received a probationary classified employee assignment (as determined in Section [2] above) he/she will be credited with vacation and sick leave for that portion of the school year that will be credited toward permanency under 14.3.1. (see Section 14.3.1).
E.	What other benefits and/or obligations would employee “A” be entitled to under the Contract?
Answer: Employee “A, ” upon working more than seventy-five (75%) percent of the school year will become a probationary classified employee also becomes a member of the bargaining unit and is subject to Union dues. Employee “A ” will be required to contribute back dues for his/her probationary period.
In addition, if the employee’s position qualifies, the employee shall be entitled to PERS contributions. If the employee chooses to make up the PERS contributions, the District will also make the appropriate contribution for the employee’s probationary period provided that employee shall also be required to pay his/her share of the contribution to PERS for his/her probationary period.
Any employee Union dues and/or PERS contributions due shall be deducted from the employee’s check(s) in accordance with Section 6.12 (which shall be redrafted by mutual agreement of the parties—If 6.12 is not redrafted by agreement of the parties the employee shall pay both dues or PERS contributions out of the next six (6) regularly scheduled pay rolls).
If the position to which the employee becomes a probationary employee (see Section [B]
Side Letter of Agreement
195-Day Rule: Education Code section 45103
Page 4 of 6
above) is a “benefittedposition ” under the Contract, then the employee shall be entitled to health benefits effective the first day of the month following the month in which the employee completed his/her 195th day of service within the school year.
F.	Will employee “A” be credited with the time he/she worked as a temporary employee before becoming a probationary employee for purposes of District seniority?
Answer: Yes. Any time that is credited to the employee under Section 14.3.1 for purposes of calculating the completion of the employee’s probationary one year period will also be counted toward the employee’s district seniority. Therefore, if an employee served in multiple positions before working more than seventy-five (75%) percent of the school year (i.e., more than 194 working days) he/she shall only be credited for purposes of permanency and seniority with the time spent in the position for which the employee became a probationary classified employee, assuming there was no break in service.9 (See Section [B] above).
G.	What evaluation is employee “A” entitled to under Article 14?
Answer: If an employee becomes a permanent classified employee of the District as described herein, the employee by definition will have missed his/her first probationary evaluation. The parties recognize this and expressly waive Section 14.3 et. seq. requiring a pre-evaluation conference and a first probationary evaluation by the end of the employee’s first ninety (90) days of employment. Moreover, the parties agree that the second and final probationary evaluation for probationary employees as described herein shall be completed no later than sixty (60) days after the end of the employee’s probationary period. Furthermore, the parties recognize that the District’s failure to evaluate a probationary employee shall in no way impair the District’s right to discipline, dismiss, or release a classified employee.
H.	What date will the District use for purposes of calculating continuous years of service for such benefits as retiree health benefits?
Answer: For purposes of calculating continuous years of service for such benefits as retiree benefits, the District will use the same date it is using for purposes of determining completion of the probationary period (i.e., the period of time that is credited toward completion of the probationary year under 14.3.1). Assuming the employee worked at the same site and under the same supervisor and had no break in service before becoming a default probationary employee, the District will use the employee’s first date of service to
9
Under Section 2.20 of the Contract “district seniority” is defined to mean “the total time of service with the District including all job classifications commencing with the employee’s date of hire into a probationary or permanent position, as provided in Article 14, Section 3.2 of [the Contract] including all time spent in paid status (vacation, holidays, sick leave, etc.) authorized unpaid leaves of less than thirty (30) days, and time spent on unpaid leaves for union business, excluding any service which ended in termination if the employee was not rehired within one (1) year after termination. ”
Side Letter of Agreement
195-Day Rule: Education Code section 45103	Page 5 of 6
calculate both, completion of the probationary period and to determine whether the employee has had a given number of continuous years of service. If the employee has worked at different sites and/or under different supervisors and/or had a break in service before becoming a default probationary employee, then the District will use the day the employee started working in the classification to which he/she became a default probationary employee, assuming the employee continued to work at the same it under the same supervisor and without a break in service.
