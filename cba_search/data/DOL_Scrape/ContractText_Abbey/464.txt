If at the end of this first six months an employee has not worked within a given section and/or location for a period of at least three months as a result of requesting and receiving a transfer or a promotion, the employee's trial period will be extended to nine months. Employees not receiving a transfer or a promotion will not have their trial period extended beyond six months. During this trial period, such employees must show an aptitude for the work in which they are engaged. During this probationary period, Management may, at its option, transfer, lay off, or dismiss such employees without being required to state the reasons for the action. Upon completion of the trial period, the employee shall be immediately credited with the seniority which accumulated during the trial period.
5.	Management shall have the right to assign to sections covered by this Agreement Student Engineers and Coop Students as a part of a training period.

BENEFITS
13(a). New regular full-time employees in classifications covered by this Agreement, who have been continuously employed full time since their last employment date, shall be entitled to their first vacation after they have actually worked 130 regularly scheduled work days. Included in days worked are holidays, days served on jury duty, and days served as subpoenaed witness. After the first vacation, all regular full-time monthly salaried employees in classifications covered by this Agreement who, on December 31, of any calendar year, have completed one year or more of continuous service with the Company shall be granted a vacation with pay during the following calendar year, provided they have actually worked 1,560 hours (to include overtime) during the previous calendar year. Included in hours worked are holidays and vacation days, days served on jury duty, days served as subpoenaed witness, time lost due to on-the-job injury not to exceed 60 days, and up to 10 paid sick days in excess of the first 20 paid sick days during the previous calendar year.
The length of vacation shall be determined by years of service indicated below:
two weeks after one year of continuous service. An employee will be eligible to take one week of the initial two-weeks vacation after completing 130 continuous workdays.
three weeks during the calendar year in which the employee completes seven or more years of accumulated service.
four weeks during the calendar year in which the employee completes 15 or more years of accumulated service.
5
five weeks during the calendar year in which the employee completes 25 or more years of accumulated service.
Time off for vacation will be paid at an employee’s straight-time, hourly rate. A vacation may not be waived by an employee and extra pay received for work during the vacation period except by mutual consent of the employee and Management. An employee who is eligible for a vacation may, with Management approval, carry over up to 40 hours of vacation into the next calendar year.
Should an employee covered by this Agreement be recalled for emergency duty while on vacation, the employee shall receive vacation pay, and in addition thereto, the employee shall be paid at 1% times regular straight time rates for the time actually worked during such vacation period, or, at the employee's option, the employee will be granted additional vacation time in lieu of the vacation time lost as a result of such recall. In the event of such recall, the Company will pay all reasonable expenses which the employee may incur as a result of the recall.
An employee who is eligible for a vacation under the above conditions, who has not had a vacation during the current calendar year, and who is laid off due to lack of work before the employee's scheduled vacation begins shall be entitled to vacation pay. In the event such an employee is recalled to work, the employee shall be eligible for a vacation in the year in which the employee is recalled, provided the employee had worked 1,560 hours during the previous calendar year and provided the employee had not received vacation pay in the calendar year in which the employee is recalled.
Employees recalled from lay off, returned from sick leave (including long-term disability), Workers’ Compensation leave and leave of absence (including returned from holding Union office) who did not receive pay for vacation and are not eligible for vacation in the year of their return shall be eligible to take one week of vacation after they have actually worked 130 regularly scheduled work days. Included in days worked are holidays, days served on jury duty, and days served as subpoenaed witness. If such employees do not work 1,560 hours in the calendar year of their return, they shall be eligible
6
to take another week of vacation after they actually work an additional 130 regularly scheduled work days.
If one of the days observed as a holiday specified in Paragraph 13(c) of this Agreement occurs while the employee is on vacation, the employee shall be granted an additional day off at some mutually convenient time within 60 days, or at Management's option, the employee shall be granted an additional day's pay in lieu of such holiday. Shift employees shall be allowed to take their vacations in periods of one week (seven days, Saturday through Friday), two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks if eligible. However, the selection of vacation periods must be made during the time the vacation schedule is posted for such purpose or the vacation periods will be assigned. While every effort will be made to accommodate the desires of the employees, vacations will be scheduled by the department heads during any of the 52 weeks in the calendar year. However, the number of employees scheduled to be off on vacation at any one time may be limited so as to interfere as little as possible with the service. For vacation selection, only accumulated service with Georgia Power Company will be used. Selection is based on the employee's classification and latest employment date. Employees whose permanent job location or classification is changed for any reason before their scheduled vacation begins, shall have their vacation period or periods assigned by supervision at the new location or in the new classification. However, consideration will be given to the employees’ desire insofar as the vacation schedule will permit.
13(b). In the case of a personal illness or non-occupational injury where the employee is unable to report for duty, the employee shall be paid one working day for each day of accrued sick leave during such absences. Accrual of sick days will be as follows:
1.	No days for the first six months of continuous employment
2.	Five days upon completion of six months of continuous employment
3.	Five additional days on the anniversary date of the first year of continuous employment for a maximum of 10 days for the first year of continuous employment

Unused sick leave may be accrued at the rate of 10 days per calendar year to a total of 140 working days. Employees who are away from work due to personal illness or non-occupational injury shall not be entitled to use their accrued sick leave once they have been away from work the number of days required to satisfy the waiting period for the Company’s Long Term Disability Plan, Employees who return from long-term disability with accrued sick days shall be given credit for these days. Under no conditions shall an employee be entitled to more than 140 days' allowance, including allowance for the current year except when an employee with over five years' service with the Company exhausts all accumulated sick leave. An employee may be considered for additional pay for time not worked due to sickness or non-occupational injury if the employee's past attendance record is satisfactory.
Up to five days (or 40 hours) per calendar year of an employee’s accrued sick leave can be used for the medically necessary care of an immediate family member. Immediate family members are defined as the employee’s spouse, children, and parents (not in-laws).
Sick report shall be made promptly in the event of absence from work due to personal illness or non-occupational injury. The employee or member of the employee’s immediate family shall advise the employee’s immediate supervisor of such inability to report for work before the start of the employee's work schedule or shift. Failure to do so shall forfeit the employee’s right to sick leave with pay unless it can be shown that it was impossible for the employee to give or cause such notice to be given to supervision. In the event of absence due to personal illness or non-occupational injury, Management may make such reasonable investigation necessary, and Management shall have the right at its option to require certification by a legally licensed physician as to an employee's illness if an employee is away from work due to illness or non-occupational injury for more than three consecutive days.
8
Failure to supply a doctor’s certificate as required shall forfeit all rights to sick leave with pay during absence from work.
An employee who leaves the job due to personal illness after starting work at the employee's regularly scheduled starting hour will have sick leave charged in increments of not less than one hour. An employee may be docked for such time not worked or have the option of substituting sick leave to offset dock time. In no case shall an employee be paid more than eight hours of sick leave per day.
Employees desiring to use sick leave for doctor's appointments (including routine physical examinations, dental appointments, or eye examinations) must give reasonable notice to supervision.
The Union will cooperate with Management to prevent or eliminate abuses of sick leave and care of an immediate family member privileges. Any employee abusing sick leave, care of an immediate family member or non-occupational injury privileges shall be subject to discipline by Management.
A full-time active employee on the payroll as of July 1, 1977, shall be entitled to receive credit for up to 10 days per calendar year for each of the last five years as accumulated sick leave. Such accumulated sick leave shall be reduced by each day of sick leave for which an employee was paid up to a maximum of 10 days per calendar year.
The Company will continue its established practice on occupational injury leave and funeral leave.
13	(c) New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. Birthday, Good Friday, National Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Friday after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day shall be specified observed holidays for all regular full-time monthly salaried employees under this Agreement. Employees shall be entitled to pay for such holiday in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, provided they work their last scheduled work day before and their first scheduled work day after the day observed as such holiday, unless previously excused by their supervisor. Except for shift employees, whenever any of these holidays shall fall on Sunday, the following Monday shall be observed as the holiday,
9
and whenever any of these holidays shall fall on Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be observed as the holiday. When consecutive holidays fall on Friday and Saturday or on Saturday and Sunday, the holidays will be observed on Friday and Monday. When consecutive holidays fall on Sunday and Monday, the holidays will be observed on Monday and Tuesday. For shift employees, the day to be observed as the holiday will be the calendar day on which the holiday falls.
Should the day observed as a holiday fall on an employee's scheduled work day, the employee shall receive regular pay (not to exceed eight hours at straight time rate). Should the employee be required to work on such holiday, the employee shall receive, in addition to regular pay, pay for the time actually worked, or at the employee's option, the employee will be granted additional time off, on some mutually agreeable date, within 60 days in lieu of the time actually worked on such holiday. Payment for time worked on such holiday for all employees covered by this Agreement, will be at r/z times regular straight time rates.
Should the day observed as a holiday fall on the employee's scheduled off day, the employee shall be granted another day off in lieu of the holiday, or if within 10 days Management concludes that it will not be able to grant time off in lieu of such holiday, the employee shall be notified that payment will be received for the holiday (not to exceed eight hours) at regular straight time rates. Should the employee be required to work on such holiday, in addition, the employee shall receive pay for the actual hours worked at the rate specified in Article X, or at the employee's option, the employee will be granted additional time off on some mutually agreeable date within 60 days in lieu of the time actually worked on such holiday.

(4)	Employees may have two lateral transfers per calendar year.
(5)	Employees may turn down two job awards per calendar year. After an employee turns down a second job, any subsequent job the employee bids on, where the employee is (or becomes) the senior qualified bidder, is awarded automatically.
(6)	Jobs are awarded and bids are voided based on the information provided by the employee. For example, if an employee is to be offered a job at 11:00 a.m. on Friday and the employee is not actively at work at that time, the employee’s bid will be voided if the employee has not left signed written notice with supervision (preferably on a bid form).
(7)	When a job is offered, it must be either accepted o rejected at the time it is offered. If an employer declines to communicate a decision, the employer shall be charged with one turndown.

16
submitted to Management within 10 calendar days from the closing date of the bid. Transfers in such cases will be considered temporary for the first 31 days after the Union and the employees bidding on the vacancy have been notified by letter in order that the Union may have the opportunity to take up with duly accredited officers the reasons why such transfer was made. Mutual consent of the Union will not be required for cross-section and cross-division transfers when no one in the section in the division in which the vacancy exists bids on the vacancy. Such vacancy shall be awarded to the employee with the most bargaining unit time in the classifications covered by this Agreement, provided said employee has met or will meet the current pre-employ ment test requirement for the section and division into which this employee desires to transfer prior to bidding. An employee currently in the same route of progression as the desired job will not be required to retest. An employee employed before January 1, 1976, shall be exempt from the pretest requirement. When a cross-section transfer is made, the employee so transferred shall retain the seniority accumulated from the former section and division at the time of such transfer. Seniority retained in a former section may not be used in an employee’s present section for any purpose; however, in case of layoff due to lack of work in an employee's present section, such retained seniority may be used in the former section as the employee's protection against layoff except as qualified in 19(b)(3). Upon returning to the former section by means of another cross-section transfer, or layoff due to lack of work in the employee's present section, the retained seniority may, thereafter, be used in that section for any and all purposes provided for in this Agreement. An employee shall be limited to one cross-section and/or division transfer, initiated at the employee’s request, per calendar year, beginning January 1, not including any such transfer resulting from layoff due to lack of work. Sections and divisions, as referred to in this paragraph, are as listed in Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 18.
22(a). When a promotion is made, or a vacancy is filled by transfer, within any of the classifications covered by this Agreement, Management will notify the Union within 30 days and will give the Union the name of the person selected for such promotion or transfer. If the senior employee bidding on a promotion or transfer is not awarded the job, the senior employee will be told, if practicable before the job is filled, the
17
reason or reasons why and such conversation confirmed by letter to the employee with a copy to the Union. Promotions or lateral transfers not made according to seniority of those bidding for such vacancy within their own section and division before the expiration of the posting period will be considered temporary for the first 31 days after the Union and the employee have been notified by letter in order that the Union may have the opportunity to take up with Management the reasons why the promotion or transfer was not made according to seniority.
22(b). Management will notify Local Union #84, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, as promptly as possible in the event any job is to be discontinued.
23. Any employee temporarily relieving or substituting for another employee in a higher classification covered by this Agreement shall be paid on the schedule of the rate of such higher classification for the time the employee actually works in the higher classification, provided the employee works in the higher classification for one hour or more at any given time. In the event an employee is paid at a higher rate for relieving in a higher classification the last scheduled work day before and the first scheduled work day after a holiday, this employee shall receive pay for the holiday at the higher rate. When an employee temporarily relieves or substitutes for an employee in a lower classification, the rate of pay for the employee who temporarily relieves or substitutes shall not change.
The application of the provisions of Paragraph 23 will be in accordance with Exhibits "A" & "I" of this Memorandum of Agreement. Temporary promotion to the position of Foreman shall be handled under the terms of Exhibit "A" and will require two hours of work in the Foreman's position to qualify for higher pay-
25.	Relief Operators whose regular duties and assignments are to relieve in more than one classification shall receive the rate of pay of the higher classification. Fifth-shift employees, or relief employees, shall select these jobs by seniority, competency being sufficient.
26(a). In case of a layoff or demotion due to lack of work, such layoff or demotion shall be based upon seniority, where the competency of the senior employee is sufficient in the respective section and division, except as provided in
18
Paragraphs 20 and 21. When an increase in employees is necessary in any section of a division, regular employees who have been previously laid off in such sections with more than five years of continuous service will be given preference for vacancies within the same section and division from which they were laid off during the first two years of such layoff, and regular employees with from one to five years of continuous service will be given preference for vacancies within the same section and division from which they were laid off during the first year of such layoff, provided they are available for work, competent to fill the job that is open and pass the physical examination required by the Company’s employment policy. Such employees who are re-employed in the sections and divisions from which they were laid off shall not lose any seniority under this Agreement.
26(b).
(1)	If an employee with recall rights as provided herein has received notice of layoff due to lack of work and subsequently transfers to another section either before or after the actual layoff occurs, such employee will retain seniority accumulated while in the former section for purpose of recall. Such employee accepting a promotion in either a new section or another cross-section transfer will forfeit recall rights to the former section.
(2)	An employee with recall rights as provided herein who is laid off due to lack of work may request a cross-section and/or cross-division transfer and will receive the same consideration as a full-time employee. Such request must be in writing and renewed every 90 days to remain valid during the period in which recall rights are in effect. An employee accepting a promotion in the new section or another cross-section transfer will forfeit recall rights to the former section.
27(a). When a demotion is made on account of incompetency due to physical disability, the employee shall be demoted to the classification in which the physical disability will permit the employee to safely perform the required duties. However, the employee will continue to accrue seniority in the classification from which the employee was demoted for e
19
period of time not to exceed 24 months. When such employee becomes competent to work in the classification from which the employee was demoted, the employee may reclaim the old job in the same manner as an employee who has been absent from work due to illness or injury. When a demotion is made on account of incompetency for reasons other than physical disability, the employee demoted shall go to the bottom of the list of seniority for the particular job from which the employee is demoted, but the employee retains all other seniority rights.
27(b). Any employee who is absent from work due to an on-or off-the-job injury or illness shall continue to accrue seniority for a period of 24 months in the classification, section and division in which this person was employed. Upon expiration of such 24 month period of absence, an employee will discontinue accruing seniority and shall retain only the seniority accrued up to the expiration date of the 24-month period.
When such employee becomes competent to work in the classification from which this employee was absent, this employee may reclaim the old job. If this results in an employee being displaced, the displaced employee will exercise seniority.
27(c). Employees demoted for incompetency shall not be demoted below the classification from which last promoted, competency being sufficient, except as provided in Paragraph 21.
27(d). In case of a demotion due to loss of driver's license, the employee will be demoted to a job that can be performed without a requirement of driving, provided this person is sufficiently competent and based on seniority. If the lost license can be recovered within 12 months, the employee can reclaim the old job, provided this employee has seniority over the employee who occupies the old job. The old job will be posted as a job subject to be reclaimed within the next 12 months. If the employee is unable to recover the lost license in 12 months, rights to the old job will be forfeited. An employee can exercise this right one time due to losing a driver's license. For the first 12 months that an employee is demoted due to loss of a driver's license, the employee will continue to accrue seniority in the former classification; similar to demotion due to physical disability.
20
28.	Other conditions under which an employee shall lose seniority are;
(a)	Voluntary resignation
(b)	Discharge for sufficient and reasonable cause
(c)	Transfer to a classification not covered by the Agreement, except as qualified in Paragraphs 31 and 32.

Such notification shall be given to the employee by either of the following methods:
a.	In person
b.	Certified mail. Mailed to the employee at the employee’s last known address, per Paragraph 46.
Proof of certification with the Post Office or other carrier will fulfil) the notification requirements of this paragraph.

In case the employee is not given 36 hours advance notice of such rescheduling, the employee shall be paid in accordance with provisions of Paragraph 52(d). Such notice shall not be required when change in schedule is made necessary by the absence of an employee. However, if such rescheduling because of the absence of an employee results in an employee working more than eight hours in the first 24 hour period beginning at the time of day the employee began the last regular scheduled work period, the employee will be paid tn accordance with provisions of Paragraph 52(e). Except for shift operations, work on Saturdays, Sundays, nights and holidays shall be kept at such a minimum as is consistent with the proper operation and maintenance and construction of the Company's facilities in efficiently and economically providing continuous and satisfactory service to the public. Non-shift employees who are rescheduled to work on Sunday shall not be required to take time off to offset such Sunday work. When an employee's work week is rescheduled in accordance with this paragraph, the employee shall be told the new work periods and corresponding off days, and the resulting off days shall not be considered to be days laid off to offset overtime. Except in emergencies, employees shall not be rescheduled to work 16 continuous hours.
37(b). "Shift Employees" are those employees permanently or temporarily assigned to jobs which are now or

Management will consider the circumstances of each request.
40.	Shift employees as defined in Paragraph 37(b) and employees working on jobs permanently staffed two shifts per day at least five days per week may by majority vote, in secret ballot, through an election conducted by the Union, determine whether rotating or fixed shifts, chosen by seniority, shall be practiced at their particular location. Shift employees who work on jobs that are staffed three shifts per day shall be the only employees allowed to vote on selection of type shifts for these jobs. Employees on jobs staffed two shifts per day will be allowed to hold separate elections for selections of type shifts to apply only to their jobs.
Even though the majority may vote for fixed shifts chosen by seniority, there may be instances where some employees may not at that time be competent to operate the shift they might choose, and until they are (in the opinion of Management) competent to operate such shift, Management reserves the right to assign such employees to some other shift.
During the life of this Agreement, elections to determine the type of shift at any location shall be held in the month of October. A shift selection will be completed by October 31 to become effective in January. Any associated selections will be
24
complete by December 15. Elections to determine the type o shift at newly established locations shall be held at the time the shift assignments are to be made. The following schedules are to be used for the above shift selections:

2)	the staffing per shift changes (employees are moved from one shift to another),
3)	an employee is expected to be unavailable for shift for more than 3 months, or
4)	an employee returns from absence of more than 3 months.
At each generating plant, Operating and multi-shift Fossil Fuel employees will be allowed to select on the basis of classification seniority, the shift they desire and the "column" that determines their work schedule (regular scheduled days and off days). Management will assign personnel to specific generating units at the employees' bid location.
If a sixth shift (miscellaneous/vacation relief) for Operating personnel at the Company's generating plants proves (in Management's opinion) to be necessary, it shall be exhausted for shift relief purposes prior to any fifth shift Operating personnel being assigned for relief.
25
42. Upon approval of Management, the Company will pay for expenses in a reasonable amount for meals under the conditions listed below, provided it is necessary that such meals be eaten away from home.

(1)	When employees who are assigned to a plant are required to stay away from such plant overnight, the Company will pay for reasonable board, including the first meal away from such plant and, where necessary, for reasonably satisfactory lodging. Except in emergency situations, employees who have been designated to share motel accommodations will be provided separate lodging when abnormal, exceptional, or unique circumstances exist. Abnormal, exceptional, or unique circumstances will be based on the subjective determination of management on a case-by-case basis.
(7)	The following provisions apply to all employees covered by this agreement
An employee who works 1 1/2 hours beyond his scheduled, rescheduled, or prearranged work day or who works 12 1/2 continuous hours, will qualify for a meal allowance and an additional allowance every six hours thereafter until released from duty. To be considered as prearranged overtime work, employees should be notified before the time they leave their plant to report for work outside their regular work period at some time after midnight of that same day or if they have left the plant, a minimum of 12 hours advance notice is required.
Any employee who is called out will qualify for a meal allowance after six hours of continuous work and an additional allowance every six hours thereafter until released from duty.
It is understood that employees will be allowed time for meals during extended overtime assignments. If t employees continue to work during this meal time, they will be paid for the time spent eating.
26

The Company will pay these employees at their regular straight time rates for the time lost from their regular work, not to exceed a maximum of eight hours in any day, when attending such meetings, and such hours shall be counted as "hours worked." Brief absences without pay for the transaction of Union business may be permitted provided the employees arrange for such absence with their immediate supervisors sometime in advance of the date of such absence, and such absences will not be considered in calculating the days absent during a calendar year to determine eligibility for vacations. It is understood, however, that, except for the foregoing, nothing shall be done which will interfere with the regular work of any company employee.
27
With respect to the wage and contract negotiating committee, the Company shall not be obligated to pay for more than 16 employees representing Local 84.
As part of the orientation program for new employees, the Union designated shop steward will be allowed up to one hour to meet with newly hired covered employees on company time.
45.	Employees unable to report for work shall, where possible, notify their supervisors as soon as the fact is known or at least before the starting time of their shift of such inability to report for work; also, employees should notify their supervisors when they are able to return to work. Employees are expected to work their regular work schedules unless they have a reasonable excuse for not working.
46.	All employees covered by this Agreement shall keep their plant informed at all times of their correct home or living quarters address so that they may be reached promptly in the event of an emergency requiring their services.
It is agreed that the employees may choose their places of residence, without hindrance by Management, but the parties hereto recognize that, because of the nature of the service rendered, employees should be available and accessible in times of emergency. Jobs subject to this provision will carry such notation in the advertisements for bids on vacancies.
Local availability agreements (subject to approval of 90% vote of the affected employees at the location) may be established. Prior to implementation, local agreements must be reduced to writing and endorsed by Management and the Union Business Manager (or designee). Local availability agreements will last for one calendar year or the remainder of a year and can be discontinued by mutual consent at any time or with 30 days written notice by Management or the Union. Otherwise, the other provisions of this paragraph shall prevail.
Should a local availability agreement be turned down by either party, it shall be reviewed by the Vice President (or designee) and the Business Manager of Local 84 (or designee) and the reasons for non-approval will be communicated in writing to both local management and the Shop Steward at the affected location.
28
47.	Raincoats or rainsuits, and rain hats or hard hats, shall be made available for those employees who are required to work outside in the rain. Rubber boots, four-buckle overshoes, or regular overshoes shall be made available for those employees required to work in water. Employees in certain sections and classifications will be issued two pair of work gloves. When those gloves are worn out, employees can receive substitutes by turning in their worn gloves. Such equipment shall remain the property of the Company, shall not be diverted to personal use, and shall be turned in or kept on plant site when not actually required on the job.
48.	When Management requires any employee to have a telephone, it shall notify such employee in writing of this requirement. In such case, the Company shall pay the telephone bill (except personal long distance charges) of such employee until the requirement is canceled in writing.
49.	So far as may be practicable and consistent with the efficient performance of work to be done, Management will distribute overtime work equitably among the employees covered by this Agreement within a given classification, section and location. Upon mutual agreement between Management and the Union, generating plants may create separate overtime equalization sections by sub-dividing the plant into two or more equalization sections. Upon 30 days' written notice, either party may terminate the agreement creating the separate overtime equalization sections. When generating plant employees work as a mixed crew/team (for example: operators working with mechanics) and it becomes necessary to have someone work on this job on overtime, each plant is encouraged to find the appropriate way to determine who will work the overtime. Elements that need to be considered are qualifications, cost, and fairness.
No employee will be required to work overtime if there are other qualified employees in such classification, section, and location who desire the overtime work. In the event no employees desire the overtime work, it shall be assigned to the employee, or employees, who have the least overtime hours on the overtime equalization records. Good faith consideration will be given to valid reasons advanced by each individual employee requesting to be excused from working overtime.
29
In the event the employee with the least overtime cannot be contacted, Management will make a "good faith" effort to contact the employee with the next least overtime, repeating this procedure until sufficient employees are contacted. In determining overtime hours worked, the actual hours of overtime that have been worked shall be used.
The Overtime Preference List shall be used to make overtime assignments. Monday through Thursday of each week, employees shall be given the opportunity to indicate in writing on an Overtime Preference Form provided by the Company their desire not to work overtime on any day or days of the following week. Employees not signing the list will be considered as being willing to work overtime.
Management and the Union may agree to other arrangements for posting the overtime preference list and selection periods (days/shifts). These local agreements must be reduced to writing and endorsed by Management and the Union Business Manager (or designees). Local agreements will last for one calendar year or the remainder of a calendar year and can be discontinued by mutual consent at any time or with 30 days written notice by management or the Union. Otherwise, the other provisions of this paragraph shall prevail.
The application of the provisions of Paragraph 49 will be in accordance with Exhibit "F" of this Memorandum of Agreement.
The foregoing provisions pertaining to the selection of smployees for overtime work shall not apply when there is an smergency condition that did or could result in loss of service, adequate generating capacity, danger to life or loss of property, during such conditions, all employees that are required will be expected to work. Management and the Union agree that each jarty will use "good faith" in administering the provisions of this paragraph.

GENERAL
56.	The classification of all employees is determined by the length of service, the ability of the employees, and by the nature of the work to be done. Employees may be working in lower classifications who are competent to handle work in higher classifications; however, the number of jobs in each classification is limited by the amount and nature of the work to be done, and promotions to higher classifications can only be made when vacancies occur or when additional employees are required in the higher classifications due to expansion of work.

ROVING MAINTENANCE CREWS
Scope:
The purpose of this Agreement is to supplement the sasic Memorandum of Agreement so as to provide for Roving Maintenance Crews in generating plants. All provisions of the aasic Memorandum of Agreement shall remain effective except o the extent clearly modified by the specific provisions herein.
It is intended to establish Roving Maintenance Crews within generating plants primarily to handle major maintenance work coincidental with major equipment inspection and emergency repairs throughout the Georgia Power Company ystem. In the event a Roving Maintenance Crew is not being tilized as a unit, members of the crew may be assigned duties ndividually in the same manner as members of the regular plant naintenance crews.
There will be two six-person crews (six Mechanics), one t Plant Bowen and one at Plant Branch, each with a supervisor n charge. At management's option, up to four additional Roving Maintenance Crews may be established at Bowen, Branch, or ther plant locations. The initial staffing of these crews will be ccomplished by the bidding process. Employees who are in he two existing Roving Maintenance Crews on the date of this Agreement will not be displaced in the filling of these initial jobs, nless they bid on such jobs. While it is expected that this ize crew will be satisfactory, experience may show that it eeds to be modified. If in the future it is determined that here is a necessity for more than six such crews, flanagement agrees to meet, discuss, and reach an greement with the Union for such additions prior to the stablishment of more crews.
Roving maintenance crews within generating plants will e established in accordance with the following provisions:
York Schedule:
(a)	The regular work schedule for Roving Maintenance Crews, except in emergencies and except as provided
64
in paragraph 37 of the Memorandum of Agreement, shall be the scheduled and posted working days of eight continuous hours, plus time out for meals between the hours of 6:00 a,m. and 6:00 p.m., or 40 hours per work week, Mondays to Fridays, inclusive.
(b)	When working at their regular plant, not on a crewassignment basis, the Roving Maintenance Crews personnel will not be used for overtime work excep when no member of the regular plant maintenance crew is available for such overtime work.
When working on a crew assignment (such as turbine inspections), the Roving Maintenance Crews' schedule will be established to meet the required job time and will be independent of the schedule of the regular plant maintenance crew.
Regular maintenance personnel may be used to supper the Roving Maintenance Crews if necessary. Operating personnel may be used to assist the Roving Maintenance Crews if necessary, in the same manner as they are used tc assist regular maintenance crews.
When operating personnel are used to assist the Rovinc Maintenance Crews, their work schedule will not be in excess o the regular plant maintenance crew schedule.
Assignment:
Roving maintenance crews will be assigned temporan location by Management of generating plants as needed.
Competency and Seniority:
The filling of classifications in the Roving Maintenanc Crews shall be in accordance with the normal bidding procedur as outlined in the Memorandum of Agreement. The filling o initial and subsequent vacancies in the Roving Maintenanc Crews shall be based upon seniority subject to demonstrate ability to perform all duties assigned to Roving Maintenance Crews. In evaluating the demonstrated ability of employee bidding on these jobs, actual testing of an employee's skills ma be necessary. The skills to be tested are those that must b performed by Mechanics in the Electric Generating Plan
65
Maintenance Crews of generating plants. In the event a ourneyman is required with special skill, such as welding or igging, the notice of vacancy will specify this requirement and he successful bidder must possess the required skills.
Employees in these crews will continue to be in Section V of Exhibit "A," but a separate seniority list will be established. Employees who are awarded jobs in the Roving Maintenance Crews will be restricted from bidding on vacancies outside the Moving Maintenance Crews' seniority unit for a period of 24 months. After 24 months in the Roving Maintenance Crews, the accumulated seniority in Section IV shall be the employee's seniority in the former line of progression plus seniority accumulated in the Roving Maintenance Crews.
Compensation:
=lan I
When an employee in a Roving Maintenance Crew is equired to report to an established temporary location or to work away from regular plant and has to travel 50 road miles or more from home, the Company will pay an expense allowance or lodging, meal, and incidental expenses incurred while raveling away from home in the amount of $70 per day. To qualify for this per diem, an employee must substantiate that overnight lodging expenses were incurred at or near the emporary location and that the employee traveled a minimum af 50 road miles from home to the temporary job site.
Dlan II
Employees who do not qualify for the overnight lodging expense per diem allowance will be paid a meal and incidental allowance in the amount of $26 for each day worked. Under current federal tax law, such amounts will be treated as additional compensation, subject to withholding and amployment taxes.
66
GENERAL:
Employees working in a Roving Maintenance Crew sha receive a $35 per month differential above the regular month! rate of pay for Mechanics on a permanent basis.
Work time will start and stop at the established location Employees not eligible for compensation for meals and lodgin on a per diem basis as provided herein will be eligible for meal at company expense when working under conditions set forth i paragraph 42(7) of the Memorandum of Agreement.
When members of a Roving Maintenance Crew ar utilized on an individual basis, they will be reimbursed fo expenses in the same manner as regular Plant Maintenanc Crews (i.e., actual expenses).
Vacations:
The Roving Maintenance Crew members shall schedul their vacations between the period June 1 to September 1 o each year. They will be allowed to schedule one week of thei vacations outside this period if desired. Additional vacatio time outside this period may be scheduled based o business requirements.

GENERAL GUIDELINES TO BE FOLLOWED FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF OVERTIME
In an effort to establish guidelines to determine who hould work overtime, the following factors should be onsidered:
(1)	The qualified volunteer with the least overtime should be contacted. In contacting the qualified volunteer, good faith and a reasonable effort will be exerted.
(2)	If the volunteers with the least amount of overtime make a reasonable request not to work and other volunteers are available and desire to work, the overtime should be assigned to those who desire the overtime.
(3)	After a reasonable attempt to contact the qualified volunteer or the number of qualified volunteers needed has been made and after determining that the volunteers contacted have made reasonable requests not to work, the volunteers with the least amount of overtime will be required to work absent a valid reason.
The low volunteers who do not have a valid reason for not working will have the option of finding qualified employees to work in their places provided the qualified employees notify their supervisors that they will replace the low volunteers assigned the overtime work.
In this situation, it will not be considered a violation of the Agreement if substitute employees are not the low employees on the overtime list. In this instance, the employees being excused and the substitutes will be charged with the amount of overtime worked by the substitutes. After being notified of the substitutions' by the qualified employees, the supervisor will excuse the low volunteers from the assigned overtime. Until notified of the release, the low volunteers are
68
responsible for working the assigned overtime. The provisions of this paragraph will only apply to a specific situation where the low volunteers do not have a valid reason for not working.
(4)	An employee who volunteers for overtime will be considered as a volunteer for a full shift (eight hours).
(5)	If there are no volunteers, the low non-volunteer will be assigned the overtime absent a valid reason for not being able to work.
The low non-volunteers who do not have a valid reason for not working will have the option of finding qualified employees to work In their places provided the qualified employees notify their supervisors that they will replace the low non-volunteers assigned the overtime work.
In this situation, it will not be considered a violation of the Agreement If substitute employees are not the low employees on the overtime list. In this instance, the employees being excused and the substitutes will be charged with the amount of overtime worked by the substitutes. After being notified of the substitutions by the qualified employees, the supervisor will excuse the low non-volunteers from the assigned overtime. Until notified of the release, the low non-volunteers are responsible for working the assigned overtime. The provisions of this paragraph will only apply to a specific situation where the low non-volunteers do not have a valid reason for not working.
(6)	Each supervisor should be reasonably aware of all employees’ total overtime and the list used to equalize overtime should be updated at least every two weeks and posted. The list will be updated and posted weekly consistent with the
69
implementation of the Southern Time and Attendance Reporting System (STARS).
(7)	If an employee changes classification, changes section, or transfers to a new location, the employee should be assigned a number of hours on the overtime list which represents the average overtime worked during the current year by employees in the same classification and section at that location.
(8)	If a member of supervision, while making a good faith effort to assign overtime in accordance with these provisions, erroneously assigns the work to an employee who is not low, an equal amount of overtime work will be made available at a mutually agreeable time for the employee who was overlooked. This procedure will return the employee to the rightful place on the overtime list.
(9)	Consistent with the Memorandum of Agreement, it is Management's and the Union’s desire that a good faith effort should be made to assign the overtime to those employees who desire to work it.

REVISED GUIDELINES FOR TAKING VACATION ELECTRIC GENERATING PLANTS DIVISION
1.	Employees shall schedule their vacation, one week at a time (full weeks may be scheduled consecutively) during the time normally set aside for vacation selection with the exceptior that one week may remain unscheduled. Vacations may be scheduled during any of the 52 weeks in the calendar year For the week beginning in one year and ending in the next, i is agreed that the week will be treated as if the entire wee was in the same year as the first day (Saturday). Thi ■ practice will not be considered as carrying vacation over tc the next year.
2.	During the year, employees can take a portion of thei vacation for periods of less than one week by initiall borrowing from any of the full weeks. Thereafter, employee can only borrow from one week at a time and cannot borrow from another week until this week is exhausted. Employee will be limited to two weeks (10 days) vacation that can b scheduled day-at-a-time.
3.	Employees desiring a vacation for a time period of less tha one week shall specify from which week they are borrowin the day or days.
4.	Employees who borrow days from a scheduled vacatio week must take off the remaining scheduled days at the lim they were scheduled or designate the remaining days t unscheduled if available. The maximum number of days t be unscheduled at any time is five days (40 hours). Day-a a-time vacation can only be used at a date before th scheduled date.
Example: An employee has three weeks vacation. Durin vacation selection, the employee schedules the weeks of Marc 14-20, July 11-17, and December 5-11. The employee request and is granted permission to be off on February 2 and 3. Th employee specifies the two days being borrowed from the wee scheduled in July. The employee must also specify which day are being moved. The employee later requests and is grante permission to be off for one day on March 27. The employe borrows this one day from the week scheduled in July an
71
specifies which day is being moved. In March, the employee must take a scheduled full week. In July, the employee must ake the remaining two days already scheduled or change the days to unscheduled, and in December, the employee must ake a scheduled full week.
5.	An employee requesting to be off for periods of time less than a week should follow the procedures outlined below:
. A. Requests should be made in writing at least three days prior to the day desired off for Maintenance and (non multi-shift) Fossil Fuel personnel. Operating and Fossil Fuel (multi-shift) personnel must give at least seven days' notice. It is recommended that Operating and Fossil Fuel (multi-shift) personnel requests be made prior to preparation of the weekly work schedule for the time desired. This procedure will facilitate schedule preparation, reduce the number of employees whose work schedule has to be changed after it has been posted, and maximize the opportunity to grant the requests.
B.	Management will consider each request, and if the work requirements can be met without additional cost to the Company, permission will be granted for the individual to be off on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Management will determine if:
1.	the employee can be excused and a replacement is not required or
2.	there is another employee on the same shift who can fill in for the vacationing employee or
3.	a miscellaneous relief person can be rescheduled to fill in for the vacationing employee.
n any case, work requirements must be met.
Management shall continue to establish the maximum number of employees allowed to be off at any one time and shall make the determination when work requirements prohibit allowing anyone off on certain days. There may be occasions when an employee has been given permission to
72
be off and work requirements cause the vacation day(s) to be canceled.
7.	Management will continue its policy of granting vacations for unforeseen situations that may arise. It is understood that the request notification time periods may not be met under these circumstances.
8.	In the event this system creates an administrative or economic burden, Management reserves the right to revert to the contract language.

GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR TEMPORARY PROMOTIONS
Temporary promotion (blueslipping) is defined as elieving, substituting, or working in a higher classification. It is esirable that all eligible employees have blueslipping xperience in order that they may be prepared for permanent romotion to a higher classification covered by the Memorandum of Agreement. No employee should request to e excused from temporarily working in a higher classification ar trivial or frivolous reasons. Blueslipping is an important and ecessary phase of the work. There may be temporary jstification for excusing an employee from blueslipping, and iere also may be cases where, for various serious personal easons, an employee requests to be excused from any lueslipping for relatively long periods of time. Opportunities for lueslipping will be available on a seniority basis among eligible ualified employees at each location. While every effort will be lade to tender blueslipping opportunities to the senior mployee, it is recognized that this may not always be practical every instance.
The policy to be followed concerning blueslipping is now ummarized as follows:
1.	Employees will be expected to blueslip when directed by supervision. If they have compelling and sufficient reasons, they may be excused by supervision from this temporary duty. It is intended that each tender of opportunity for blueslipping and subsequent excuse be considered as a separate individual incident and not prejudice or preclude consideration for blueslipping opportunities in the future. If there is no qualified employee who desires to be blueslipped, the junior qualified employee will be required to blueslip, absent a valid reason. A valid reason may be defined as an unexpected or personal need that would cause serious personal or financial harm to the individual if not attended to immediately.
2.	Employees may have valid personal reasons for not working in a higher classification. They may feel not qualified to work in a higher classification or might fear the greater responsibility. An employee having these or
74
similar feelings may, upon request, be excused from consideration for blueslipping for a definite period o time. Employees may withdraw their request at any time.
3.	Employees who are called out between paid blueslip assignments will be paid the blueslip rate for the call out.
NOTE: Provisions of this understanding supersede Side Letters 6, 7, 11, and 12 on this subject These Side Letters are a part of the "Side Letter Book" in effect on July 1, 1993, consisting of 34 letters.

SENIORITY PROVISIONS FOR
PREVIOUS NUCLEAR PLANT ELECTRICIANS AND MECHANICS
Seniority accumulated in the classification of Nuclear Plant Electrician or Mechanic by employees who promoted or transferred into the classification from within the section will be considered as seniority accumulated in the classification of Mechanic or Electrician with the following exceptions:
1.	Employees who are awarded nuclear plant jobs and who gain seniority because they meet the special "three-year experience requirement" must return to their former fossil plant seniority list position when competing for jobs outside the nuclear plant.
2.	Employees who transfer or promote into the Nuclear Plant Electrician or Nuclear Plant Mechanic classification from outside the maintenance section or are newly employed in the classification as a result of the special "three-year experience requirement" will start accumulating classification seniority to be used as fossil plant Journeyman seniority at the time an employee with less Fossil and Hydro Electric Generating Plants Division seniority is promoted to Journeyman in the same route of progression.
tote: This exhibit remains in the Memorandum of Agreement to track the seniority of Fossil and Hydro Electricians and Mechanics who accumulated seniority in the classifications of Nuclear Plant Electrician or Mechanic, respectively, ' prior to the effective date of this Memorandum of Agreement. Otherwise, this provision (formerly Paragraph 19(a)(14)) was discontinued on July 13, 1999.
