T]
SECTION 1.	CLASSIFICATION OF ASSIGNMENTS
(a)	Work for Operators in passenger service shall be designated as regular assignments, extra assignments, biddable trippers and special events assignments.
(b)	Regular Operators will not be required to work trippers in addition to their regular assignments unless they request such work. Except as provided in Article 4, Section 7(b), this does not apply to Extra Operators assigned to a regular assignment by board mark-up. The request by a Regular Operator to work trippers will be made on a prescribed form and filed at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to 12:01 A.M. on the day the Operator wishes it to become effective. This request to work may be canceled by the Regular Operator and such cancellation must be filed at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to 12:01 A.M. of the day the Operator wishes to cancel said request to work. These requests must be renewed when Division Shake-ups become effective.
Regular Operators may be required to work before or after their regular assignments in the event of necessary relays, vehicle changes, or emergencies (which includes the missout of the Operator who was to relieve the Regular Operator). Regular Operators may also be required to work additional assignments signing on between 8:00 P.M. and 11:59 P.M. The Regular Operator so used will be paid on the basis of continuous time. It is understood that the Regular Operator will not be used in these instances if there is an Extra Operator available to perform this work.
(c)	Extra Operators on duty, held for duty, or on the property in uniform on a regular work day and whose use will not result in violation of hours of service or driving time regulations, will perform such assignments as conditions of work require and as directed by supervisorial employees subject to published instructions as to qualifications. It is understood that an Extra Operator not on duty, or held for duty, will not be used if there is an Extra Operator on duty, or being held for duty.
SECTION 2.	ESTABLISHMENT OF REGULAR ASSIGNMENTS
J	(a) All passenger service work (including preparatory time, pull-in time, deadhead
allowance and/or travel time in connection therewith) assigned from each established |	Division point,	except as provided in Article 4, Section 2(d), that can be combined to

It is understood that known work of this type that is not assigned to the Extra Board will be posted for choice at Divisions and that it may be bid by Regular Operators. It is also understood that work will not be assigned in such a way that will interfere with the assignment of an Operator on the following day.
Should an Operator working a special event assignment sign-off too late to perform his/her report, the next day will be governed by the provisions of Sections 11 and 12 of this Article.
SECTION 9.	RELEASE PERIODS IN ASSIGNMENTS AFTER 8:00 P.M.
(a)	No period of release of less than eight (8) hours between assignments, or portions thereof, which occur between 8:00 P.M. and 5:00 A.M., shall be deducted from time of Operator working such assignments. This time shall be subject to the overtime rule. This rule will not apply to Extra Operators when start of split between assignments commences before 8:00 P.M. and extends beyond 8:00 P.M. It is further understood that regular work runs starting after Midnight and before 5:00 A.M. will be straight work runs.

This provision does not apply to the period between a regular work run and a biddable tripper, nor does it apply to the work of an Extra Operator.
SECTION 10.	RELEASE PERIOD IN WORK RUNS OR ASSIGNMENTS
Deadheading time and/or travel time is part of the work assignments in the computation of interval of release. Interval of release periods are governed entirely by time actually released from duty, regardless of any minimum allowances provided under this Contract.

The spread of hours for the purpose of computing spread overtime commences at the time he/she first reports and continues until he/she complete his/her assignment in any given day with the exception that turn-in time is not included within the spread of hours.
(b)	If, in the mark-up of an Extra Board, the Division Dispatcher errs and does not grant an Operator eight (8) or more hours release from duty before starting his/her new day, and does not notify the Operator before he/she reports for his/her new assignment, the Authority shall pay that Operator continuous time, at straight time rate of pay, from the time of his/her sign-off to the time of his/her sign-on the following day. If the Authority notified the Operator of the error in Board mark-up at least four (4) hours prior to the Operator's sign-on time the following day, the Operator will be given a new sign-on time and be paid a separate allowance of four (4) hours in addition to all other earnings that day.
(c)	This rule only governs the determination of spread hours during whiph period a day's work is performed and which may include release periods for which Operators are not compensated under applicable rules.
(d)	An Operator who works a night or owl run or special event assignment that commences prior to Midnight and continues into the following day, computes his/her spread from the time he/she first commences work until his/her completion of work on

(b)	At least eighty-five percent (85%) of all weekday regular straight runs (except owl runs) will have scheduled in them at least one recovery time period, of a minimum	|
of fifteen (15) minutes. At least fifty percent (50%) of the regular straight runs on	’
Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays and owl runs will have scheduled a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes recovery time period. These percentages will be computed on a | system-wide basis.	'
(c)	If there are instances where these recovery times are scheduled, yet not	I
generally realized (i.e., more than sixty percent (60%) of the time), the UTU may invoke	*
a corrective procedure, as follows:	(
The Operator or the Union will provide a written account of the specific problem, including the number of recovery times shorter than the schedule minimums during a	.
two (2) week period, and the specific trips and drivers involved to respective Division	I
Management. Division Management will, upon review, forward the specific information to the Scheduling Department for action. The Scheduling Department will then verify	.
the account with independent time checks. It will notify the UTU and Division	|
Management of its findings. If corrective action is warranted, the notification will specify when the correction will go into effect.	।
If a schedule correction can be made through a minor schedule change, it will be made in three (3) weeks or less. If a major schedule change is required, the correction	.
will be implemented within sixty (60) days unless the Authority is required to have Los	j
Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Board approval and public hearings to adopt such major change(s).	j
A minor change is a schedule change that does not require workruns to be rebid.
It is understood that Management's decision will not be subject to the provisions of	i
Article 26.	I
SECTION 15. MEAL AND REST PERIODS	j
The recovery time set forth in Section 14, above, and the non-work time on non-	1

(2)	One-half (1Z») of the weekday base headway of the line when travel on the line is necessary. In the event an Operator must use two or more lines while traveling, he/she will receive one-half (1/z) of the weekday base headway of the first line and the full weekday base headway on the additional lines used. It is understood that this computation will be made either on the going or return travel movement whichever is greater, and such allowance used on movements in both directions. If the total of the base headway results in an excess of one-half (1/z) minute or more, the allowance will be the next higher minute, if the excess is less than one-half (%)■ minute it will be dropped.
(3)	Scheduled weekdays base running time.
(4)	On Saturdays, the Saturday base running times and one-half (H) or full Saturday base headway will be used, and on Sundays, the Sunday base running times and one-half (Yz) or full Sunday base headway will be used when applicable.

missout and will be entitled to pick up his/her run and will be paid the hours of his/her	I
assignment.
However, it will be the responsibility of the Operator involved to reasonably I substantiate the fact of the delay by securing, subsequently, a written statement from the Operator operating the delayed bus. This is applicable only when the headway on	I

ARTICLE 27
DISCIPLINE RULE
This Labor Contract between the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the United Transportation Union is based upon a spirit of cooperation between the employees and the Authority to provide a fair and equitable basis for the parties to handle discipline matters which may be brought before them.
The parties do recognize the responsibility of each to provide fair treatment to both parties.
In order that this preamble may be effectuated to its fullest, the procedures for handling discipline matters in an amicable manner are generally outlined on the following pages.
SECTION 1.	HEARING BEFORE DISCHARGE OR DISQUALIFICATION
(a)	Before an employee covered by this Contract is discharged or disqualified from any type of service, a hearing shall be held at which time the employee may present his/her case. The employee and the Union shall be notified in writing of the specific charge, time and place of hearing sufficiently in advance to afford the employee the opportunity to arrange representation and/or witnesses, if desired, with the understanding that the Authority will not compensate any such witnesses for time spent at hearing. The first level hearing will be conducted by the Transportation Manager, or in his/her absence from the Division, by his/her representative.
(b)	If any employee fails to attend his/her hearing, he/she may be discharged or disqualified, whichever is applicable, unless satisfactory explanation is furnished for his/her failure to attend.
(c)	The hearing shall be convened as promptly as circumstances will reasonably permit, but in no event later than five (5) days from the date when the Operator is charged with the offense or held from service whichever is earlier.
(d)	It is agreed that either party may have a transcript made of the hearing at its own expense and by providing its own transcript stenographer.
(e)	If, after review of a suspension, discharge or disqualification, it is mutually agreed that an employee who was suspended, discharged or disqualified, was completely blameless of charges regarding the offense, he/she shall be reinstated to his/her former position without loss of seniority and will be paid wages lost as though he/she had not been suspended or discharged.
93
It is mutually agreed that no entry shall be made on the employee's record of such suspension, discharge or disqualification, if by mutual agreement the employee was found to be completely blameless.
If, however, after such a review, it is found that the employee in question was not completely blameless, then the parties may mutually agree upon a reduction of the penalty and upon what, if any, portion of the wages he/she would have earned should be restored to him/her.
(f)	At any hearing or investigation, at any level of the grievance procedure, the employee and/or Union representative will be allowed to get whatever information is desired from the employee's personnel record file. There shall be forwarded to the General Chairman's office a copy of all Police reports which are forwarded to the Service Sector General Manager, upon which charges are to be filed by the Authority against an Operator. The reports referred to herein are to be forwarded to the General Chairman at the same time the Service Sector General Manager forwards them to the Transportation Manager, for preparation of the charges.
SECTION 2.	TYPES OF DISCIPLINE
(a)	Major infractions of the Authority's rules are running ahead of schedule, operating off-route, ADA violations, excessive absenteeism, gross misconduct, insubordination, not properly accounting for passenger fares, the use of intoxicants or the odor of intoxicants, the use of or possession of narcotics or drugs and failure to submit to a chemical test immediately, accidents, Missouts, Absent Without Permission (AWOP), railroad crossing violations, falsification of sick reports, employees who verbally threaten or physically harms an Authority employee who is carrying out his/her duties and will subject the employee to suspension or discharge.
Running ahead of schedule, operating off-route, ADA and safety violations will, in most cases, subject employees to the following discipline for repeated violations of the same type:
First Violation in a floating six (6) month period: Counseling/training.
Second Violation in a floating six (6) month period: Counseling and written warning.
Third Violation in a floating six (6) month period or a second violation within six (6) months of receiving a written warning: Two (2) day suspension.
Fourth Violation in a floating six (6) month period or another violation within six (6) months of receiving a two (2) day suspension: Subject to Formal Hearing.
94
Employees with multiple major infractions of a serious nature may subject employees to a Formal Hearing.
In dealing with the above discipline schedule, the Transportation Manager may, if he/she so desires, lessen the discipline.
(b)	A merit system of discipline will apply for other infractions of Authority rules not covered by Subsection (a) above. This will be administered as shown in Section 8 of this Article. Entries on a employee’s service record, other than those on accidents or N.A.P. cases, of one (1) year’s standing or more, will not be considered in disciplinary or discharge cases.

Demerits will be assessed in multiples of five (5) for subsequent violations. Not more than thirty (30) demerits will be assessed for any one violation.
Any period of six (6) months without a violation will result in the employee being assessed a caution if he/she again violates a minor rule.
(b)	If the discipline is based upon an "Employee's Personnel Record Memorandum" a copy will be sent to the employee on the first violation with "caution" indicated thereon. Unless the employee contacts the Transportation Manager or designee within seven (7) days, the caution will be assessed on his/her record.
If the Operator again violates a minor rule, before the six (6) month period has elapsed, the Operator will be sent an "Interview Notice" which will indicate the nature of the subject to be discussed and the time and place of the alleged violations, when known. If after the interview, the Transportation Manager or designee finds the employee guilty of the charge, he/she will advise the employee of the number of demerits that will be assessed.
