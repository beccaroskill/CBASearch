EXPLANATION OF CONTRACTOR DEDUCTIONS FOR VACATION PAY
To assist you in determining the proper manner in which Vacation Pay is computed and deducted from each Employee’s pay check the following example is offered as a guide:
John Doe worked 40 hours at $25.12 per hour
which would amount to $1,004.80
Thus: Gross Earnings......................$1,004.80
Vacation Pay $4.17 (based on hours paid).....................$ 166.80
These two items are added in order that the Vacation Pay might be taxed......$ 1,171.60
Assuming that F.I.C.A. is $72.64 and Medicare is $16.99 and Federal Income Tax is $236.00 and State Income Tax is $49.21, thus the combined total of taxes is $374.84. Therefore, $374.84 must be
deducted for tax purposes ................ -374.84
Now that taxes have been paid on the
Vacation Pay, you must subtract the amount of Vacation Pay in order to send it in to be funded................... -166.80
Net amount of Pay Check ..................$	629.96
Forms for making these payments may be obtained from the Iron Workers’ Local 25 Fringe Benefit Fund Office, P.O. Box 8006, Novi, Ml 48376-8006. Telephone: (248) 347-3100.
PLEASE NOTE:
The tax deductions listed above are fictitious amounts. Please be sure to use your tax tables when calculating the amount to be deducted.
