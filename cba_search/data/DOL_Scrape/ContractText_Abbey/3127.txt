PREAMBLE
This AGREEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the Agreement, entered into by the COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO, hereinafter referred to as the County, and SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALLIANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the Association, has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious labor relations between the County and the Association; establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment.
The term 'Agreement" as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3505.1 of the Government Code.
JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
a. In order to encourage open communication, promote harmonious labor relations, and resolve matters of mutual concern, the parties agree to create a joint labormanagement committee. The committee will be governed by the following principles:
(1)	The committee will meet every other month or more often if mutually agreed to by the parties.
(2)	The agenda for each meeting will be decided five (5) working days in advance of the meeting, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties.
(3)	The County will release a reasonable number of officially designated association stewards or representatives for attendance as needed at the meetings. The number of stewards in attendance will be mutually agreed upon before each meeting.
(4)	This section is not grievable within the meaning of the grievance procedure as defined in Article V of this Agreement.
i
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION AND COVERAGE
1.1	RECOGNITION
a.	The County recognizes the Association as the exclusive negotiating agent for all employees in the Miscellaneous Law Enforcement Unit and the Supervising Law Enforcement Miscellaneous Unit.
b.	The Association recognizes the County Executive or his designee as the negotiating representative for the County and shall negotiate exclusively with him or his designee, except as otherwise specifically spelled out in this Agreement.
1.2	COVERAGE OF EMPLOYEES
a.	The Miscellaneous Law Enforcement Unit and the Supervisory Law Enforcement Miscellaneous Units consist of all employees as stated in the listing of classes set forth in Exhibit "A" of this Agreement.
b.	This Agreement applies only to employees in the above-described representation unit.
ARTICLE 2 ASSOCIATION RIGHTS
2.1	ASSOCIATION SECURITY
a.	It is the intent of this article to provide for payroll deductions of the Association members to be deducted from their warrants insofar as permitted by law. The County agrees to deduct and transmit to the Association all authorized deductions from all Association members in the Unit who have signed an approved authorization card or cards for such deductions in a form agreed upon by the County and the Association. In the event the County misses one (1) or more dues deductions in a payroll period, due to no fault on the part of the Association, the County will correct the error in the next biweekly pay period if notified by the Association in writing within five (5) workdays of the initial transmittal to the Association.
b.	(1) The written authorization for Association dues deductions shall remain in full force and effect, during the life of this Agreement between the County and the Association, unless cancelled in writing.
(2)	The written authorization for approved insurance and benefit programs and the amount of dues deducted from Association members' warrants shall be changed by the County upon written request of the Association.
2
(3)	The Association agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the County harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the County arising from its checkoff for the dues, insurance or benefit programs of the Association.
c.	'Approved insurance and benefit programs" are those which the County has approved as being non-competitive or non-duplicative of County-offered programs. The County reserves the right to disapprove any insurance program, in advance, if competitive or duplicative; and, to cancel all Association insurance and benefit program payroll deductions where they are established without prior County approval. It is understood that life insurance, except for accidental death and dismemberment, is competitive and duplicative of County-offered programs.
d.	Solicitation and/or servicing of Association insurance and benefit programs shall not interrupt on-duty employees nor be conducted in County facilities without prior approval of the County.
2.2	ASSOCIATION NOTICES AND MEETINGS
a.	The Association may use County conference rooms and similar building facilities for meetings with employees in the unit it represents and may visit work locations to confer with its members regarding grievances or other business within the scope of representation or otherwise provided for within this Agreement. The Association shall be entitled to reasonable use of bulletin boards provided to serve employees in the unit it represents at all offices and work locations where they are established or where they may be reasonably necessary.
b.	Use of County meeting facilities requires reasonable advance notice to the appropriate County official and is subject to County use of such facilities; provided, however, that once scheduled, such Association meetings may not be cancelled by the County except under emergency situations. The County may establish reasonable regulations governing the use of County facilities as provided by this section.
c.	Duly authorized representatives of the Association shall be permitted, at all times that employees in the unit it represents are working, to enter offices to transact business within the scope of representation, and to observe conditions under which employees are employed and carry out their responsibilities; provided however, that the Association representative shall, upon arrival at the facility, notify the person in charge of the areas he or she wishes to visit. Access shall not be unreasonably denied. If denied, the reason or reasons for denial must be stated.
d.	The Association may transmit reasonable amounts of written materials through the County's departmental inter-office mail system and fax machines.
3
2.3	ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATION
a.	The County recognizes and agrees to deal with designated stewards and representatives of the Association on all matters relating to grievances and the interpretation, application, or enforcement of the express terms of this Agreement.
b.	A written list of the officers of the Association and the stewards serving the representation unit, broken down by department, shall be furnished the County immediately after their designation, and the Association shall notify the County promptly of any changes of such officers or stewards. Those officers or stewards shall not be recognized by the County until such lists or changes thereto are received.
c.	The number of stewards shall be a total of nine (9).
d.	Upon the request of the aggrieved employee, a steward or officer of the
Association may investigate the specified grievance provided it is in his or her assigned area of responsibility and assist in its presentation. He or she shall be allowed a reasonable time for this purpose during working hours without loss of pay, subject to prior notification and approval by his or her immediate supervisor. Such notification shall be in writing on a form prescribed by the County, which form will state the amount of time spent for the purpose. The assignment of more than one (1) steward or officer who is an employee to handle a grievance shall be subject to prior approval of the County Executive or his representative and approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. Representatives of the Association other than officers will be permitted time off without loss of pay only if they are full-time County employees.
e.	Association designated representatives shall have the right to contact the County management regarding employee job training concerns.
2.4	AGENCY SHOP
a.	It is recognized that the Association owes the same responsibilities to all employees in the Law Enforcement Miscellaneous Unit and has a duty to provide fair and equal representation to all employees in all classes in the Unit whether or not they are members of the Association.
b.	All employees in the Law Enforcement Miscellaneous Unit on or after the effective date of this article shall, as a condition of continued employment, beginning with the second full pay period after such effective date and until the termination of the Agreement, either:
(1)	Become a member of the Association; or
(2)	Pay to the Association a fair share fee for services rendered by the Association in an amount equal to the monthly periodic dues of the regular membership, less costs which are not related to the administration of this Agreement and the representation of nonmember employees, but in no event to exceed 90% of the regular
4
membership dues; provided, however, that each employee will have available to him/her membership in the Association on the same terms and conditions as are available to every other member of the Association; or
(3)	(a) Execute a written declaration that the employee is a member
of a bona fide religion, body, or sect which holds a conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting any public employee organization as a condition of employment; and
(b) Pay a sum equal to the agency fee described in Subsection b. (2) to a non-religious, non-labor charitable fund chosen by the employee from those charities listed within United Way or CHAD. The employee shall furnish written proof to the County and the Association that this contribution has been made.
2.5	SEPARATION FROM UNIT EXCEPTION

The term separation includes transfers out of the Unit, layoff, and leaves of absence with a duration of more than two (2) full pay periods. The condition of employment specified above shall not apply to newly hired employees until the beginning of the second full pay period of employment.

(2)	Expenditures for contract administration, (for example, meetings and discussions with management concerning grievances under the contract, meetings with employees as part of grievance resolution, and costs of representatives for arbitration, shorthand reporters, or attorneys in enforcing the Agreement and staff support including research and preparation).

(d)	The dispute described in the challenge petition shall be heard by the Association within thirty (30) calendar days after filing.

(e)	The arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration Association.
(f)	The costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the Association.
2.9	FAILURE TO POST FAIR SHARE FEE EXPLANATION AND NOTICE OF RIGHT TO CHALLENGE

(1)	The Association shall notify the employee (a copy to the appointing authority) of non-compliance by certified mail, return receipt requested. Said notice shall detail the non-compliance by explaining that the employee is delinquent in not tendering a fair share service fee, specifying the amount of the delinquency, and warning the employee that unless such fees are tendered within thirty (30) calendar days, the Association will request that the employee be terminated as provided in this article.
(2)	If the employee fails to comply, the Association shall file with the appointing authority, in writing, proof of compliance with Subsection a.(1), the specific charges, and a demand that the employee be terminated. The charges shall include:
(a)	A statement that it is proposed that the employee be discharged from employment;
(b)	A statement of the cause of the proposed discharge of the employee;
(c)	A statement in ordinary and concise language of all specified facts or omissions upon which the cause is based;
(d)	A copy of all Association documents relevant to the proposed action or a statement advising the employee and his/her
8
appointing authority of the time and place where they may have access to such documents.
(3)	The County shall serve a copy of the written charges upon the employee either personally or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The appointing authority shall give written notice to the Association and the employee of the scheduled date of a hearing by the appointing authority.
(4)	The parties to the hearing shall be the Association, the employee, and the County.
(5)	The appointing authority shall determine whether the Association has established cause to terminate the employee because of the violation of this article. If the appointing authority determines that there is cause for termination of the employee, the appointing authority shall terminate said employee within ten (10) days after making such determination. An employee with permanent civil service status may appeal the order of termination as provided under Article 17 of this Agreement.
(6)	The Association shall bear all costs of terminating the employee, including all costs of the County in defending any appeal of an employee from the County's termination of such employee for failure to pay a fair share service fee. Such reimbursed costs shall not include payment of the attorney selected by the County to prosecute and defend the termination action.

The authorization for payroll deductions described in this section shall specifically require the employee to agree to hold the County harmless from all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that may arise against the County for or on account of any deduction made from the wages of such employee.
2.16	PRECONDITIONS TO IMPLEMENTATION OF FAIR SHARE/AGENCY SHOP PROVISIONS

20
subsection does not in any way change or impact the time and one-half overtime employees receive under the Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1.
(1)	For employees who do not receive time and one-half overtime pay, the workweek will remain from 12:00 a.m. on Sunday to 12:00 a.m. the following Sunday, a period of seven (7) consecutive twenty-four hour periods.
(2)	For these employees, the 9/80 work schedule is a schedule which during one (1) week of the biweekly pay period the employee is scheduled to work four (4) nine-hour workshifts for a total of thirty-six (36) hours, and during the other week of the pay period, is scheduled to work four (4) nine-hour workshifts and one (1) eight-hour workshift.

For employees who do receive time and one-half overtime pay, the individual employee's workweek must be redesignated by the County so that it commences in the middle of the eight-hour workshift as described in Subsection b.(2) above.

This must be completed and approved prior to the employee working the 9/80 schedule, and be filed in the employee's personnel file. This redesignated workweek must be changed prior to the employee altering the day of the week or time of day that the eight-hour workshift occurs; the redesignated workweek must always commence during the middle of the eight-hour workshift. This redesignated workweek must also be changed back to the standard Sunday through Saturday workweek upon the employee moving off of the 9/80 work schedule.
(1)	For these employees, the 9/80 work schedule is a schedule in which during each redesignated workweek the employee works four (4) nine-hour workshifts and one (1) four-hour workshift. The two (2) four-hour workshifts are worked consecutively in a manner to constitute one (1) eight-hour work period, similar to the eight-hour workshift provided in Subsection b.(2) above.
(2)	For these employees overtime shall be earned when the employee is required to work in excess of nine (9) hours when normally
21
scheduled to work the nine-hour workshift, and in excess of forty (40) hours during the redesignated workweek. Additionally, overtime will be earned when the employee is required to work more than four (4) hours when normally scheduled to work either of the four-hour workshifts.

If the holiday falls on the scheduled nine-hour workshift, the remaining hour must be taken off as leave first from accumulated compensating time off or holiday in lieu, and second from accumulated vacation time; and, if there are no leave balances, then leave without pay. If the holiday falls when the employee is scheduled to work the two (2) four-hour workshifts, then both four-hour workshifts shall be deemed to be the holiday. If a holiday falls on an employee's scheduled day off, the employee shall accrue eight (8) hours compensating time off.
f.	Full shift absences on vacation, sick leave, compensating time off, or holiday in lieu taken by employees on a scheduled nine-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of nine (9) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances. Full shift absences on the eight-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of eight (8) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances. Full shift absences from either four-hour workshift shall result in the deduction of four (4) hours from the employee's accrued leave balances.
g.	Employees may return to the standard five-day, forty-hour workweek upon the approval of their appointing authority.

A Y-rate means a salary rate, for an individual employee, which is greater than the established range for the class.
j.	Y-Rate Salary Increase. An employee for whom a Y-rate is established shall not receive any increase in salary until such time as his or her rate of compensation is within the established range for the class, at which time the employee shall receive the highest step of the range. The employee shall receive a proportionate decrease in salary whenever a lower range is established for the class in this Agreement.
k.	Granting of Status.

I.	Class Salary Range Changes. When the salary range for a class is changed in the Agreement, employees in the class shall change to the new range but shall remain at the same step. When changes in an employee's class or salary, or both, occur simultaneously with salary range adjustments in the Agreement, the employee changes shall precede the Agreement adjustments in application.
m.	Entry Step Adjustments. When the entry step for a class is adjusted to above Step "5" in the Agreement, the salary step for each employee in the class shall be increased in proportion to the change in entry step; provided, however, that no employee shall advance beyond Step "9".
n.	Biweekly Salaries. The pay period for all employees shall cover fourteen (14) calendar days, starting on a Sunday and ending with the second Saturday thereafter. Salaries shall be paid on the Friday following the end of the pay period; except that if Friday falls on a holiday, salaries shall be paid on Thursday. Salaries shall be computed as provided in this Agreement.

e.	Upon promotion, an employee shall receive a new step increase date when the salary increase is 9.5% or higher.
f.	An employee in Step "9" shall have no step increase date, and service in Step "9" shall not be considered as eligible service for future step increases.
g.	Continuous extra-help employment up to twenty-six (26) biweekly pay periods of full-time service, or the equivalent, shall be considered as eligible service for a step increase for an employee who is appointed to a regular position without a break in service. Such extra-help employment shall be subject to all other provisions of this section governing step increases.
h.	Overtime work shall not be considered as eligible service.
i.	A step increase may be denied only for just cause.
26
7.5	PAYROLL ERRORS
a.	This provision applies when the Director of Personnel Services determines that an error has been made in relation to the base salary, overtime cash payment, or paid leave accruals, balances, or usage. In such cases the County shall, for purposes of future compensation, adjust such compensation to the correct amount. The Department of Personnel Services also shall give written notice to the employee.
b.	As used in this section:
(1)	"Base Salary" means the biweekly rate of pay including special pay allowances and differentials but excluding overtime cash payment.
(2)	"Overtime cash payment" means authorized pay for working in excess of a prescribed number of hours, usually eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week.
(3)	"Paid leave" means vacation, sick leave, compensating time off and all other types of authorized leave with pay.
(4)	"Overpayment" means any cash or leave (balance, usage or accruals) that has been overpaid or overcredited to an employee regardless of the reason, including but not limited to, administrative, clerical or system errors.
(5)	"Underpayment" means any cash or leave (balance, usage or accruals) that has been underpaid or undercredited to an employee regardless of the reason, including but not limited to, administrative, clerical or system errors.
c.	If the error has resulted in an overpayment or underpayment, reimbursement shall be made to the County if the error was an overpayment, or by the County if the error was an underpayment, in the amount which has occurred within one (1) year prior to the date of the Department of Personnel Services’ initial written notice to the employee.
(1)	In the case of salary overpayment, reimbursement of the overpayment shall be made through one (1) or a combination of the following methods:
(a)	In cash payment(s) mutually agreed to by the employee and the Department of Personnel Services;
(b)	A one time only leave adjustment to CTO or vacation equivalent to the dollar amount of overpayment (sick leave may not be used unless the overpayment involved the use of sick leave);
27
(c)	Installments through payroll deduction to cover the same number of pay periods over which the error occurred. If the installments exceed 10% of the employee's base salary (including incentives, et cetera), lower deductions may be made providing the lower deduction is at least 10% of the employee's base salary including incentives, et cetera.
(2)	In the case of an underpayment the County will expedite reimbursement to the employee via an in lieu warrant, a gross pay adjustment or a leave balance adjustment, whichever applies and is most appropriate.
(3)	An employee whose employment terminated prior to full reimbursement of an overpayment shall have withheld from any salary owing the employee upon termination an amount sufficient to provide full reimbursement. If that amount is not sufficient to provide full reimbursement, the County shall have the right to exercise other legal means to recover the additional amount owed.
(4)	Any amount of overpayment or underpayment for any period earlier than one (1) year prior to the date of the Department of Personnel Services initial written notice to the employee, shall be deemed waived and not reimbursable.
d.	The provisions of this section do not apply to grievance disputes which contend that the County has underpaid by misapplying or incorrectly interpreting the terms of this or any previous agreement. The time limits for the filing and processing of any grievance shall not be deemed to be excused, extended or otherwise modified by the provisions of this section. Nor shall the relief available through the grievance procedure be enlarged by or as a result of the provisions of this section.
e.	The provisions of this section apply only to errors involving base salary or overtime cash payment and paid leave accruals, balances, or usage. No provision of this Agreement shall preclude the correction or recovery by the County of past overpayments or other losses which result from errors involving other matters, such as insurance, retirement, social security and court-ordered payments.
7.6	ACCELERATED SALARY STEP INCREASES
a.	At the request of the appointing authority, the County Executive or designee may approve acceleration of a salary step increase to any higher step in the salary range for that class at any time based upon exceptional performance or for retention purposes.
b.	Such salary step acceleration under this provision shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
28
c.	Receipt of an accelerated salary step increase shall not have any effect on the employee’s date of eligibility for other salary step increases as described in the Section 7.4 for Salary Step Increases.
7.7	SUPERVISING CRIMINALIST, SALARY EQUITY ADJUSTMENT

(2)	2.5%	effective the	pay period	starting on	June 18, 2000.
(3)	2.5%	effective the	pay period	starting on	June 17, 2001.
7.9	SALARY COMPACTION - SUPERVISING IDENTIFICATION TECHNICIAN
The parties agree that the class of Supervising Identification Technician shall be a minimum of 10% greater than that of the subordinate class through June 30, 2006. This shall be determined by dividing the top step of the monthly base salary of the Supervising Identification Technician by the top step of the monthly base salary of the subordinate class. (Example: The salary difference on April 7, 2003, was determined using the top step monthly salary of the supervisor of $4,409.16 and the top step monthly salary of the subordinate class of $3,977.64. Therefore, the salary of the supervisor is 10.84864% greater than that of the subordinate class on April 7, 2003.)

(3)	For family purposes, a regular employee may use leave credits for:
(a)	Attendance upon an eligible family member who is incapacitated because of illness or injury and definitely requires personal care. The length of such absence shall be limited by the appointing authority to the time reasonably required to either provide care or to make other arrangements for such care. For the purposes of this Subsection (3), an eligible family member is the employee's spouse, child, parent, or grandparent, domestic partner (as defined by Section 297 of the California Family Code), or domestic partner’s child. Additionally, under this subsection, an eligible family member is any other close relative or child who resides with the employee.

(1)	During any period of disability for which payment is not provided under Worker's Compensation Insurance, the employee shall be placed on disability leave with pay to the extent of any leave with pay which he has accrued. Such disability leave with pay shall be charged against the employee's accrued leave with pay.
(2)	During any period of disability for which payment is provided under Worker's Compensation Insurance, the employee may elect to receive disability leave with pay to the extent of any leave with pay which he has accrued, providing the Worker's Compensation Benefits received by the employee are endorsed to the County. Under such circumstances, his accrued leave with pay shall be reduced by one-half day for each full day of absence for which temporary Worker's Compensation Benefits are endorsed to the County.
36

9.13	PARENTAL LEAVE
a.	Each regular County employee with at least one (1) year of continuous service shall be entitled to schedule paid parental leave upon the birth of the employee's child or during the process of an adoption of a minor child by an employee. In the case of an adoption, the entitlement shall arise upon both: (1) the placement of the child in the employee’s home and (2) the employee initiating or having completed an adoptive home study for the adoption of the child. The purposes of parental leave are to facilitate parental bonding, family adjustment, and child care, and such leave shall be used consistent with these purposes.
37
b.	Parental leave shall be approved by the employee's appointing authority, except where the granting of the parental leave request would unduly interfere with or cause severe hardship upon department operations. Wherever possible, departments shall make reasonable accommodations to permit parental leave, either on a full-time or part-time basis.
c.	The maximum paid parental leave for full-time regular employees shall be one-hundred and sixty (160) hours. Parental leave shall be prorated for part-time regular employees. Parental leave shall not extend beyond four (4) months from either: (1) the date of birth of the employee's child, or (2) in the case of adoption, the initial date of residence of such child with the employee. The maximum one-hundred and sixty (160) hours shall apply to each birth or adoption, regardless of the number of children bom (twins, triplets, et cetera) or adopted.
d.	Parental leave is separate and distinct from the use of sick leave for pregnancy, since it is not based upon disability. Parental leave is available to be scheduled at the conclusion of the use of sick leave for pregnancy.
e.	Employees must make a written request to use parental leave. The written request shall be made at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the anticipated start of the parental leave, except in cases of an unanticipated early childbirth or adoption, in which case the employee shall make the written request with as much advance notice as possible. The written request shall also provide such information or substantiation as may be required by the Director of Personnel Services.
f.	An employee who while on parental leave is incapacitated for one (1) or more days due to personal illness or injury may charge such days to sick leave. In such event, the employee promptly shall notify their department, and shall submit substantiation of the need for and use of sick leave.
g.	Use of parental leave does not reduce or adversely affect the maximum one-year unpaid leave of absence that an employee may request for child care or family reasons following the birth or adoption of a child.

c.	Any regular County employee who qualifies and is approved for the County Employees as Volunteer Poll Workers Program will receive his/her regular pay while on paid leave from County employment for one regularly scheduled work day that falls on the day of the election and for such leave time prior to the election as is necessary, including travel, to attend the required Poll Worker Training during the employee’s work hours.

An employee shall not be enrolled in catastrophic only coverage by the County under this subsection.
h.	If all the recognized employee organizations of the County advise the County in writing that they are in agreement with a three-tier insurance premium rate structure, the County shall implement the three-tier premium rate structure on the effective date of the following insurance enrollment.
i.	Each medical insurance or health plan provides for coordination with Medicare coverage. An employee who participates in a plan is subject to the requirements of that plan, including provisions relating to Medicare. The County is not responsible for the replacement of benefits which may be reduced, eliminated, or made more expensive as a result of coordination with Medicare. County contributions are not payable toward contributions an employee is required to make to the Federal Government for Medicare coverage.
j.	Employees hired prior to November 21, 1999, with medical insurance or health plan coverage whose premium rate is less than the County contribution shall
40
receive a cash payment not to exceed $535 per month minus the cost of the premium rate. For such employees who are covered by social security (FICA), this cash payment will not exceed $535 per month minus the cost of the premium rate for the employee’s medical insurance or health plan coverage, minus a percentage equal to the County’s social security contribution rate on FICA taxable wages, and minus any County costs (excluding FICA) which are applicable to such cash payment, if any. For such employees who are not covered by social security, the cash payment will be calculated in exactly the same manner, except there will be no deduction of the percentage equal to the County’s social security contribution rate on FICA taxable wages. Employees hired on or after November 21, 1999, shall not receive this cash payment. Current employees who receive cash-back benefits shall be grandfathered for the duration of their continuous employment history with the County of Sacramento. Such cash-back benefit shall be a vested right.
k.	Employees hired on or after November 21, 1999, shall show evidence of group health insurance at the time of insurance enrollment with the County when selecting catastrophic health insurance coverage. Effective January 1,2004, such employees who select catastrophic health insurance coverage shall receive a $150 per month plan selection incentive.
I.	The Association agrees with the Consultant’s recommendations in the 2000-01 Health and Welfare Review to increase the County-sponsored HMO’s to match the PERS 2002 HMO office visit and prescription drugs co-payments effective January 1, 2003. The Association further agrees that the County shall have the right to implement all or portions of the Consultant’s recommendations on the Health Plan Restructuring as proposed in the 2002 Health and Welfare Review.
m.	The County shall have the right to further increase the HMO office visit and prescription drug co-payments by no more than $5 effective January 1, 2005, based on the accumulative percentage increase of premium increases for employees with dependent coverage for the Kaiser Foundation health Plan for the period January 1,2002 to January 1, 2005. (For example, if the accumulated percent increase on the Kaiser premium for the three-year period were 30% ($500 January 1,2002 to $650 January 1, 2005), a $10 co-payment could be increased by $3 ($10 X 30%) to $13.)
10.2	DENTAL PLAN
a. The County shall provide at its expense to each full-time regular employee the following dental benefits for the employee and the employee's eligible dependents*:
(1)	A deductible of $25 per patient per calendar year. When three (3) members of a family have each met a $25 per patient deductible, no deductible shall be required of other family members during that
41
calendar year. The deductible shall not apply to two (2) prophylaxes and one (1) dental examination per patient in any calendar year.
(2)	There shall be no deductible for any calendar year following two (2) consecutive years during which such person is continuously eligible and in each of such years has utilized the prophylaxes benefits twice each calendar year.
(3)	Each calendar year thereafter, no deductible will be required for persons who qualified under Subsection a.(2) above, provided they continue to satisfy the preventive dental prescribed maintenance care of two (2) prophylaxes each calendar year.
(4)	Persons will be ineligible for the preventive dental no deductible if they fail to have the prescribed maintenance care in any calendar year and must repeat the requirements as set forth in Subsection a.(2) to again have the preventive dental no deductible.
(5)	The dental benefits payable are to be computed at 100% of the Table of Allowances. The Table of Allowances will be based on actual claims history of the previous period October 1 to and including September 30, and will represent approximately 80% of the overall average dental charges to persons covered under the County's dental program for that twelve-month period.
*(NOTE: Dependents eligible for benefits are: 1) Lawful spouse; 2) Unmarried children (including stepchildren, adopted children and foster children provided such children are dependent on the employee for support and maintenance) to their 19th birthday, or their 24th birthday if they are enrolled at an accredited institution of learning; 3) An unmarried child who has reached his 19th birthday but is incapable of self-support because of physical or mental incapacity that commenced prior to his 19th birthday, provided a physician's certificate of such incapacity is submitted to the County Insurance Administrator within six (6) months following his 19th birthday or the employee's date of eligibility in the County Dental Plan; 4) If both spouses are eligible employees, they must each be enrolled as employees, and their children must be enrolled under the parent whose birthday (excluding year of birth) occurs earlier in the calendar year; 5) Dependents in military service are not eligible.)
(a)	In order to preserve the 80% concept, the Table of Allowances will be reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, on an annual basis. Reviews will cover the annual period October 1 to and including September 30, and revisions will be effective the first of each calendar year thereafter.
(b)	The County may make necessary and appropriate
42
adjustments to individual allowances for each procedure in order to preserve the 80% concept, except adjustments shall not be permitted below the first-year base.
(c)	If it is determined, after an annual review, that the County's dental plan paid less than 79% of the overall average dental charges to persons utilizing the Sacramento County Dental Plan, the revised Table of Allowances shall contain a penalty factor which would increase the Table of Allowances to reflect the same percentage points over 80% in direct proportion to the percentage points under 80% rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the plan paid 74% for the period October 1 to and including September 30, the penalty factor would increase the revised Table of Allowances, effective January 1 of the following calendar year, to 86%. In the event the revised Table of Allowances did not reflect an 86% benefit as determined by the next annual review, the penalty factor would be adjusted in the next Table of Allowances to reflect the miscalculation, rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the next annual review indicated the plan paid 83% rather than 86%, the next Table of Allowances would continue the penalty factor of 3% so that the plan would be designed to pay 83%. The penalty factor would continue in this manner until it is within 1% of the 80% concept. In no event will the penalty factor be used to reduce the Table of Allowances below 80%.
(6)	Additional dental benefits under the County's dental plan shall include the following:
(a)	The County will pay 50% of the total and actual costs of orthodontic care but not to exceed a County payment of $750 per-patient lifetime maximum.
(b)	Dental accidents paid at 100% of actual charges, without application of deductible and is not subject to the $1,500 maximum.
(c)	The plan contains a per-patient calendar year maximum of $1,500, except for the $750 per-patient orthodontic lifetime maximum and for the accident benefit.
(d)	Effective November 21,1999, the per-patient calendar year maximum shall be $1,750, and the orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $875. Effective January 1, 2000, the perpatient calendar year maximum shall be $2,000, and the perpatient orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $1,000.
43
(7)	The plan document was designed after the Valley Clerks Trust Dental Care Program.
(8)	Upon request, the County will make available to recognized employee organizations for inspection the actual dental claims experience used in the annual review or other pertinent periodic tabulations.
(9)	Dental benefits will be coordinated with dental benefits provided by any other plan under which the patient is insured, in accordance with the usual established rules covering coordination of benefits as outlined by the California State Insurance Commissioner.
(10)	It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that this section is a continuation of the pre-existing Dental Plan and that under the said pre-existing Dental Plan a penalty factor of 0% was in effect for the calendar year 1983. It is the intent of this Agreement to continue to make annual penalty factor adjustments, as may be necessary so as to preserve the intent of the original plan.
(11)	The County agrees to provide dental plan pamphlets including the revised Table of Allowances, to the Association and all employees covered by the Dental Plan on an annual basis.
10.3	LIFE INSURANCE
a.	The County shall provide at its expense, $15,000 life insurance to each fulltime regular employee. In addition, employees shall have the first option of purchasing supplemental coverage to equal annual salary (minus the initial $15,000 at County expense) rounded to the next even $1,000 up to a maximum of $50,000 life insurance.
b.	The County shall provide a second option to permit employees to elect a second additional amount equal to annual salary so that the total amount of provided and purchased life insurance will equal twice the total first option. Premium rates for the second option shall be determined by the County based on the quotation from the insurance carrier selected by the County to provide the life insurance.
c.	If the employee selects the first option, $5,000 life insurance is provided for each dependent ($200 from age fourteen [14] days to six [6] months) in addition to the amount of insurance applying to the employee at no additional cost.
d.	The County may adjust insurance premiums and amount of insurance on a single date each year for all employees, rather than throughout the year as changes occur in age and salary.
e.	The County shall agree with the life insurance carrier that the waiver of premiums for life insurance coverage of disabled insured persons, who otherwise
44
maintain eligibility, shall be continued for one (1) year following the determination by the insurance carrier that the insured is totally disabled and entitled to such a waiver.
f.	The insured may convert such life insurance coverage from group coverage to private coverage at the end of the one-year period.
g.	The County may modify the life insurance premium rate schedule from the existing 26 annual premium payments to a 24 annual premium payment schedule. In such case, the premiums shall be paid from the first two (2) pay warrants issued each month. Should the 24 annual payment schedule be implemented, the Association shall be notified.
h.	If the $50,000 limit in Subsection a. is raised, it shall also be raised for employees covered by this Agreement. In such case the Association shall be notified and provided a copy of the expanded table.
i.	Effective November 21, 1999, the life insurance benefit will include a “living benefit” option. To be eligible for this “living benefit”, the claimant must be under the age of seventy (70); be diagnosed terminally ill (with life expectancy of twelve [12] months or less); not have assigned his or her employee life benefits; and not have a court order to force which affects the payment of life insurance benefits.
j.	The life insurance benefit will pay a benefit of up to 50% of the combined basic and any supplemental life amounts. The maximum amount of the living benefit is $50,000, and the minimum is $7,500. Should the employee recover, the amount paid under this provision would be subtracted from the face amount of his/her full benefit at the time of death.
10.4	FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNT
a.	County will expand the flexible spending account, which currently provides employees with the options of premium reduction and dependent care assistance, to include unreimbursed medical expenses; with a calendar year maximum of $2,400, effective January 1,2003.
b.	Effective January 1, 2003, the amount of unreimbursed medical expenses in Subsection 10.4-a. above will be increased to a calendar year maximum of $2,400. 10.5 HEALTH & WELFARE REOPENER
a.	The County of Sacramento and the Sacramento County Alliance of Law Enforcement (SCALE) agree to reopen Article 10 of the1999-2002 Law Enforcement Miscellaneous Unit and the Supervisory Law Enforcement Miscellaneous Unit Agreement to review the health and welfare benefit program for the purpose of reaching mutually acceptable changes to the program. Article 10 shall remain unchanged without agreement of the parties.
b.	Any agreed-upon changes may be effective during the term of the existing agreement or may become effective on the date of the successor agreement in the Law
45

b.	The employee shall be solely responsible for any additional cost of such coverage of the domestic partner and shall be required to provide certification of domestic partner registration. In no event will the County’s monthly health and welfare contribution be used to pay for the cost of the domestic partner’s coverage. The following shall determine employee cost for a domestic partner.
(1)	The dental coverage shall be $39.78 per month for Fiscal Year 2002-03. The cost in subsequent fiscal years shall be determined at the discretion of the County.
(2)	An employee with “employee only” medical plan coverage who adds a domestic partner to that plan will pay the cost difference between the medical plan premium for the “employee only” and “dependent” coverage.
(3)	There will be no further cost if an employee adds a domestic partner to his/her medical plan where the employee has and continues to have “dependent” coverage. In such event, the employee shall have taxable imputed income based on the “employee only” medical plan premium.
c.	The employee will be responsible for any tax consequences resulting from the inclusion of a domestic partner under the medical insurance and dental plans offered pursuant to this Agreement.
ARTICLE 11 RETIREMENT PLAN
11.1	STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE
46
a.	The County shall maintain State Disability Insurance, at employee cost, for employees in the Units subject to withdrawal procedures outlined by the State Employment Development Department.
b.	Eligible employees will use State Disability Insurance on an integrated basis with County leave benefits providing for sick leave, vacation, compensating time off and holiday time in that order. The integration of SDI with available leave balances will be so as to provide a combined biweekly adjusted net income equivalent to 100% of regular net income, which is gross income less required deductions, such as taxes, retirement and insurance premiums, and other mandatory deductions, as long as such eligible disability qualifies and available leave balances permit. Other employee authorized deductions shall be deducted from the resultant net pay. This provision is an exception to the current County policy which otherwise requires exhaustion of all accrued leave balances before a request for a leave of absence without pay can be considered. The County will provide the Association with a copy of the standardized County policies and procedures regarding the use and integration of State Disability Insurance.
c.	In the event the County determines that legislative, administrative or judicial determinations cause changes which in any way restrict, reduce or prohibit this program operation, it shall immediately and automatically terminate.

ARTICLE 15 SENIORITY, LAYOFFS AND REEMPLOYMENT
DIVISION A
APPLICATION-PURPOSES-RIGHTS
15.1	PURPOSE
This article establishes layoff procedures and reemployment rights. The decision to reduce the number of positions in a class in a department and the reasons for any such reduction shall be within the sole and exclusive discretion of the County. However, the order of layoff and the identity of those employees to be laid off shall be governed by the provisions of this article. This article also establishes reemployment rights and the order of reemployment of employees who are laid off and provides for the resolution of any dispute which might arise respecting the order of layoff or reemployment of those employees who are laid off.
15.2	DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS
58
a. Words and terms used in this article shall have the same meaning as applies to their use in Chapter 2.78, Sacramento County Code, unless otherwise defined below:
(1)	CETA Employee: A CETA employee is a person appointed under the provisions of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act into an authorized CETA position. Such positions are federally funded and are established as separate classes so as to be distinct from the regular County classes which bear the same class title.
(2)	Demotion: A change between classes where the maximum salary of the class to which the employee is changed is any amount less than the maximum salary of the class from which the employee is changed. The change is between classes in which the employee holds permanent status.
(3)	Former class: A class in which an employee previously has held permanent status. An employee may have one (1) or more former classes. However, only those classes in which the employee has held permanent status during the current period of continuous service are eligible former classes in respect to a right to demote.
(4)	Layoff: The involuntary termination from a class of a permanent or probationary employee without fault on the part of the employee, because of lack of work, lack of funds, or in the interest of economy.
(5)	Limited-Term Employee: A person who accepts a limited-term appointment as defined in Section 7.7(f) of the Civil Service Commission Rules. A limited-term employee is a temporary employee for purposes of this article. However, a permanent employee appointed to a limited-term position shall have return rights, within the same department, from the limited-term position to the permanent position.
(6)	Separation: Release from employment of a temporary employee or the return of a regular employee from a temporary upgrade the immediate former class in which the employee held permanent status. Separation does not constitute a layoff.
(7)	Status: The employee's current appointment, such as permanent, temporary, provisional, or probationary. Temporary includes intermittent and limited-term.
(8)	Temporary Employee: A person who has been appointed from a list of eligibles, or provisionally in the absence of a list, to a position which is other than a permanent position.
59
15.	3 LAYOFF
a.	When it becomes necessary due to lack of work, lack of funds, or in the interest of economy, to reduce the number of employees in a department, the order in which employees will be laid off within each class which is affected by the layoff shall be based on seniority as provided in Section 15.5.
b.	Temporary and provisional employees in the class involved in the layoff shall be separated prior to the layoff of any probationary or permanent employees.
c.	Prior to the layoff of any probationary or permanent employee, any permanent employee who currently is serving in a temporary position in that class shall be separated and returned to the class in which the person holds permanent status in that department.
d.	Probationary and permanent employees shall be laid off in the inverse order of their seniority.
15.	4 RIGHT TO DEMOTE
a.	Any employee who is scheduled for layoff shall have a right to demote within the department in which layoff will occur to a class in which the employee formerly held permanent status. If there is no authorized position in the department in the class to which the employee would otherwise have a right to demote, then this subsection shall not apply. The right to demote within the department to which the employee is assigned, shall be implemented as follows:
(1)	If there is only one (1) other lower salaried class within the
department in which the employee formerly held permanent status, the employee shall be demoted to that class. If there is no vacancy in that class and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the demoting employee shall be laid off from that class and from employment.
(2)	If there are two (2) or more lower salaried classes within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status the employee shall be demoted to that class in which the employee formerly held permanent status which has the highest salary. If there is no vacancy in that class, and the demoting employee has less seniority than all other employees within the department in that class, the above process shall continue until the demoting employee either reaches a class within the department in which the employee formerly held permanent status in which there is a vacancy or in which the employee is not the least senior employee within the
60
department in that class, or the employee is laid off from employment.
(3)	An employee who is least senior in a class in which there is no vacancy and to which an employee demotes from a higher class within the department shall be laid off from that class, and shall have the same right to demote as does any other employee who is laid off.
(4)	An employee demoted under this procedure shall be deemed to have exercised the employee's right to demote and to have accepted each demotion, subject to the employee's right to resign from employment.
(5)	An employee who is demoted from a class in which the employee holds permanent status shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid off from each class from which the employee subsequently demotes or is displaced, including classes which the employee passes through because of the absence of a vacancy and insufficient seniority to occupy a position.
b.	An employee who is scheduled for layoff, shall be entitled to request a demotion to another class in which the employee formerly held permanent status which is currently authorized in another department. Except as provided in (3) below, the right to request demotion to another department applies to any class in which the employee formerly held permanent status which has a lower salary than the class from which the employee was laid off, which is authorized in any department other than the department to which the employee was assigned prior to layoff.
(1)	The appointing authority of the department to which the employee requests transfer may, in the appointing authority's discretion, grant a request to demote if there is (a) a vacancy in the class within the department or (b) the requesting employee would not be the least senior employee in the new department within the class to which the request is made.
(2)	An employee whose request to demote to another department is granted, shall be deemed for all purposes to have been laid off from the class from which the employee demotes.
(3)	Such right to request demotion shall not apply to a class to which an employee is demoted within the same department. The purpose of the right to request a demotion to another department is to avoid layoff from employment.
15.	5 SENIORITY
a.	Seniority shall be determined by the date of original appointment to the class. For purposes of this article, the "date of original appointment to the class" is
61
defined as the date the employee first was appointed to the class, on or after the most recent date of entry into County service, regardless of type of appointment, including, but not limited to, provisional, limited-term, temporary and exempt.
b.	A seniority list shall be prepared for each class for purposes of layoff and shall include all probationary and permanent employees in that class. Where seniority dates in the class are the same, ties shall be broken in the following sequence:
(1)	Employees with the earliest date of entry into continuous County service.
(2)	Employees with the highest standing on the eligible list from which the appointments to the applicable class were made.
c.	The seniority date for employees who terminate and subsequently return to County service in accordance with the military leave provisions of Section 2.78.785 of the Sacramento County Code shall be the date of original appointment to the class, prior to the military separation.
d.	If an employee's position is reallocated to a different class, and the former class is no longer authorized in the employee's department, the employee's date of appointment to the former class shall be the seniority date in the class to which the position was reallocated. In such cases the right to demote shall apply to the new class.
e.	If an employee is in a class which is retitled, the seniority date in the retitled class shall be the date of appointment to the original class which has been retitled.
f.	If an employee returns to a former class in which the employee previously held permanent status, the employee's seniority date in the former class shall be the date of original appointment to the former class.
15.	6 JURISDICTION
a.	If an employee in a class covered by this article is laid off from that class and demotes to a class which is not covered by this article, then this article no longer applies in respect to the determination of the employee's seniority within the class to which demotion occurs. In such cases, the determination of seniority within the class to which the employee is demoted, shall be based on the agreement of the new representation unit or the Sacramento County Code, whichever applies.
b.	Employees employed under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) shall be laid off or separated in compliance with, and their right to demote within the department and to request demotion to another department shall be subject to, all requirements by Congressional enactments, Federal Regulations and Orders, and grant terms and conditions as they exist and apply on the effective date of layoff.
62

The last known address shall be deemed to be that address which is within the personnel file of the employee within the department to which he is assigned.

DIVISION C REEMPLOYMENT
15.2	1 ENTITLEMENT
a. With respect to classes covered by this article, reemployment entitlements shall be as follows:
(1)	A person who held permanent status in the class from which the person was laid off, who remains employed by the County, shall during the three-year period following the effective date of layoff be entitled to be appointed from a departmental reemployment list to a vacancy authorized to be filled in that class within the department from which the person was laid off, pursuant and subject to the provision set forth in this division. A person who held permanent status in the class from which the person was laid off is no longer employed by the County shall not be eligible for or entitled to appointment from a departmental reemployment list beyond two (2) years from the date of original layoff.
(2)	A person who held permanent status in the class from which he or she was laid off, who remains employed by the County, shall also, during the three-year period following the effective date of layoff, be entitled to certification from a County-wide reemployment list for a vacancy in the class from which the person was laid off, which is authorized to be filled, pursuant and subject to the provisions set forth in this division. A person who held permanent status in the class from which he or she was laid off who is no longer employed by the County shall not be eligible for or entitled to certification from a County-wide reemployment list beyond two (2) years from the date of original layoff.
15.2	2 TYPE OF POSITION
The entitlement to appointment or certification applies whether the position in which the vacancy occurs is regular, temporary or limited-term.
15.2	3 LIMITED-TERM AND CETA PERSONNEL
a.	Personnel serving under limited-term appointments shall not be entitled to reemployment rights or to placement on either a departmental or County-wide
68
reemployment list, whether or not they held permanent status as limited-term appointees in the class from which they were separated.
b.	The right of personnel employed under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) to reemployment lists, their order of such lists, and their priority of appointment from such lists shall be subject to and in compliance with all requirements established by Congressional enactments, Federal Regulations and Orders, and grant terms and conditions as such enactments, regulations, orders, terms and conditions may change and apply from time to time during the term of the article.
15.2	4 DEPARTMENTAL REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	The County shall prepare a departmental reemployment list for each class in each department in which an employee with permanent status in that class is laid off. As personnel are separated from a class in which they hold permanent status, their names shall be added to the list for the class and department in which the layoff occurs in the inverse order in which they are separated from service in that class.
b.	Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, the order of names on departmental reemployment lists shall be derived from (by inverting) the order of layoff prescribed by layoff lists, as the order of layoff may be modified by agreement between the parties or award under grievance arbitration proceedings commenced pursuant to layoff under Division B. The purpose of this provision is to insure that disputes concerning the order of layoff and of departmental reemployment lists are raised and settled at or near the time of layoff, and not at the time reemployment is sought.
15.2	5 COUNTY-WIDE REEMPLOYMENT LISTS
a.	The County shall prepare County-wide reemployment lists for each class from which personnel with permanent status in the class were laid off. Each list shall constitute a merger of persons who were laid off from the class and who held permanent status therein.

15.2	6 APPOINTMENT AND CERTIFICATION PRIORITIES
a. The following priorities shall apply in relation to vacancies in classes to which the entitlement to appointment or certification is applicable.
(1)	A vacancy in a class shall be filled first from the Medical Center transfer eligible lists prescribed in Section 7.7(d) of the Civil Service Rules, as that section existed prior to August 15, 1974. If the vacancy is not filled by appointment from the Medical Center transfer eligible list, then;
69
(2)	The vacancy shall be filled from that departmental reemployment list for the class in which the vacancy exists and for the department in which the vacancy exists. Persons shall be appointed to vacancies in the order of the list.
(a)	One (1) person shall be offered an appointment for each vacancy in accordance with the order of the list. If that person declines appointment, the next person in order shall be offered appointment.
(b)	A person to whom an appointment is intended to be offered may be contacted personally and may accept appointment orally. A person shall not be deemed to have declined appointment unless the person has done so in writing, or unless written notice of the offer of appointment has been transmitted by certified mail to the person's last known address, and the person has failed to accept the appointment in writing within five (5) calendar days following the date of mailing of the notice.
(3)	No persons shall be certified for appointment from a County-wide reemployment list to a vacancy in a class until there are no longer any names on that departmental reemployment list for the class within the department in which the vacancy exists or all persons on that departmental reemployment list have declined appointment to that vacancy.

f.	The mediation procedure shall be entirely informal in nature. However, copies of exhibits upon which either party bases its case shall be shared with the other party.

g.	The primary effort of the mediator shall be to assist the parties in settling the stated appeal in a mutually satisfactory fashion. In attempting to achieve a settlement, the mediator is free to use all of the techniques customarily associated with the mediation process, including private conferences with only one party. If settlement is not possible, the mediator shall provide the parties with an immediate bench opinion, as to how the appeal would be decided if it went to arbitration. That opinion would not be final or binding, but would be advisory. It would be delivered orally and would be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the mediator's opinion. The advisory opinion may be used as the basis for further settlement discussions or for withdrawal or granting of the appeal. If the appeal is not settled, granted or withdrawn, the parties are free to arbitrate. If they
82
do, the mediator shall not serve as arbitrator, and no offers or concessions made by the parties or the mediator during mediation can be used against a party during arbitration.
h.	Neither attorneys nor court reporters or any other type of note-taker shall be allowed to be present at the proceedings; however, the Association’s Business Representative, who may be an attorney, may be present.
i.	If the parties agree to be bound by a mediator’s recommendation, the subsequent agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties.
j.	If the issue is not resolved during mediation, and in accordance with established timeliness the appeal shall move to arbitration.

Either party shall have the right to declare an arbitrator as unavailable if the arbitrator cannot conduct the hearing within ninety (90) calendar days of being contacted by the parties.

d.	Sacramento County Alliance of Law Enforcement shall have the right to attend the hearing if Sacramento County Alliance of Law Enforcement is not chosen by the employee as his/her representative.
e.	The appointing authority may also be represented by counsel.
f.	At the hearing, the appointing authority shall have the burden of going
forward first with evidence in support of the allegations contained in the order of disciplinary action and shall have the burden of establishing the facts by a preponderance of the evidence. The arbitrator may administer oaths and take official notice of facts as authorized by law.
g.	Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation.
h.	A court reporter shall take a transcript of the hearing.
86
i.	The arbitrator may consider the records or any relevant prior disciplinary actions against the employee which are final, and any records contained in the employee's personnel files if such records were introduced at the arbitration hearing.
j.	Each party shall have these rights: To call and examine witnesses; to introduce exhibits; to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness; and to rebut evidence. The appellant may be called and examined as if under cross-examination.
k.	The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The rules of privilege shall be effective to the extent that they are otherwise required by statute to be recognized at the hearing, and irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
17.14	SUBPOENAS
Before the hearing has commenced, or during the hearing, the arbitrator shall have the power to issue subpoenas in accordance with Section 1282.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
17.15	DECISION
a.	Following the hearing, the arbitrator shall promptly prepare and submit to the parties to the hearing a decision in the case within thirty (30) calendar days. The decision shall contain and be limited to specific factual findings relating to the facts alleged in the disciplinary order and any facts asserted by the appellant for purposes of defense or mitigation; a determination of legal issues, if any; a determination of whether the facts found constitute good cause for discipline; and an order that affirms, modifies or sets aside the order of disciplinary action imposed by the appointing authority.
b.	In determining whether there is cause for discipline, the arbitrator shall independently review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the charges. If good cause for the disciplinary action is found under this independent review standard, the arbitrator shall not modify or reduce the penalty imposed by the appointing authority unless the arbitrator issues written findings demonstrating that there is clear and convincing evidence that the level of such discipline is improper.
17.16	FINALITY OF DECISION
The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding.
87
17.17	COSTS
The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the court reporter, and the transcript, if any, shall be shared equally by Sacramento County Alliance of Law Enforcement and the County. If an individual employee not represented by Sacramento County Alliance of Law Enforcement files an appeal of discipline and he/she retains independent counsel, he/she shall be responsible for all costs of retaining said counsel and shall be responsible for sharing equally with the County the costs of the arbitrator, court reporter and transcript or any related costs for arbitration.
17.18	WITNESSES
The County agrees that employees shall not suffer loss of compensation for time spent as a witness at an arbitration hearing held pursuant to this article. The employee and Sacramento County Alliance of Law Enforcement agree that the number of witnesses requested to attend and their scheduling shall be reasonable.

The parties hereby agree to revise Section 7.2 to read as follows:

For the Agenda of: April 13, 1999
TO:	BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
FROM:	OFFICE OF LABOR RELATIONS
SUBJECT: AMENDMENT TO THE 1998-2000 AGREEMENT WITH AFSCME, LOCAL 146 (Financial Impact on Retirement System: None)
Contact for additional information: Steve Lakich 874-7095
RECOMMENDATION
Approve the attached Addendum #1 to the Agreement between the County of Sacramento and AFSCME, Local 146, AFL/CIO, allowing a 7/12 work schedule for employees in the Correctional Health Division in the Department of Medical Systems.
DISCUSSION
A tentative agreement has been reached with AFSCME regarding an addendum that permits a 7/12 work schedule for Licensed Vocational Nurses, D/CF, in the correctional facilities.
Implementation of a 7/12 work schedule would decrease health care costs by using staff hours more efficiently; regular five-day, 8-hour schedules create a situation of overlapping schedules and difficulties with weekend coverage.
Respectfully submitted,	APPROVAL RECOMMENDED:

Director of Labor Relations	Acting County Executive
