BETWEEN THE STATE OF OHIO AND
DISTRICT 1199,
THE HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICE UNION, SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, AFL-CIO
This Agreement is hereby entered into by and between the State of Ohio, Office of Collective Bargaining, (hereinafter referred to as the "Employer"), and District 1199, The Health Care and Social Service Union, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, (hereinafter referred to as the "Union").
ARTICLE 1	- PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE AGREEMENT
It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide for the wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment of the employees covered by this Agreement; and to provide an orderly, prompt, peaceful and equitable procedure for the resolution of differences between employees and the Employer. Upon ratification, the provisions of this Agreement shall automatically modify or supersede: (1) conflicting rules, regulations and interpretive letters of the Department of Administrative Services pertaining to wages, hours and conditions of employment; and (2) conflicting rules, regulations, practices, policies and agreements of or within departments/agencies pertaining to terms and conditions of employment; and (3) conflicting sections of the Ohio Revised Code except those incorporated in Chapter 4117 or referred to therein.
This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement between the Employer and the Union. No verbal statement shall supersede any provisions of this Agreement.
Fringe benefits and other rights granted by the Ohio Revised Code which were in effect on the effective date of this Agreement and which are not specifically provided for or abridged by this Agreement, will be determined by the Ohio Revised Code.
The Employer will satisfy its collective bargaining obligation before changing a matter which is a mandatory subject of bargaining.
Mid-Term Contractual Changes
The Employer and the Union have the power and authority to enter into amendments of this Agreement during its term constituting an addition, deletion, substitution or modification of this Agreement. Any amendment providing for an addition, deletion, substitution or modification of this Agreement must be in writing and executed by the President of the Union or designee and the Director of the Department of Administrative Services or designee. Upon its execution, such amendment shall supersede any existing provision of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and shall continue in full force and effect for the duration of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement not affected by the amendment shall continue in full force and effect for the term of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 2	- UNION RECOGNITION
The Employer hereby recognizes District 1199, The Health Care and Social Service Union, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of collective bargaining on all matters pertaining to wages, hours, terms and other conditions of employment for employees in the bargaining units. The bargaining units for which this recognition is accorded are defined in the Certification issued by the State Employment Relations Board on October 10, 1985 (Case No. 85-RC-04-3295) and November 22, 1985 (Case No. 85-RC-04-3713).
This Agreement includes all employees employed in the classifications and positions listed in Appendix A of this Agreement. The Employer shall notify the Union of any changes in the classification plan sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of the change or as soon as the changes become known to the Employer, whichever occurs first.
In the event of a dispute between the parties as to future inclusions or exclusions from the units resulting from the establishment of new or changed classifications or titles, either party to this Agreement may apply to the State Employment Relations Board for resolution of the dispute.
The Employer recognizes the integrity of the bargaining units and will not take action for the sole purpose of eroding the bargaining units.
1
ARTICLE 3	- UNION RIGHTS
3.0	1 Delegates and Organizers
The right of the Union to appoint a reasonable number of delegates is recognized. The delegates appointed shall have completed their initial probationary period. Delegates are Union stewards as that term is generally used.
In addition to their regular work duties, the duties of the delegates during work time shall be limited to the investigation and presentation of bargaining unit employees' grievances and representing said employees in meetings with the agency.
Delegates/organizers may receive and discuss complaints and grievances of employees on the premises and time of the agency provided it does not interfere with the necessary operation of the facility. Delegates may use a reasonable amount of time to perform delegate duties. Delegates shall notify their supervisors when working on authorized union business. The notification shall be given as far in advance as is practical, according to the circumstances.
Any disputes between the agency and the Union as to whether any organizer or delegate is spending an unreasonable amount of time in any work site conducting authorized union business shall be resolved by the Union and the agency appointing authority or designee. If the question cannot be resolved at this level, it shall be submitted to the Deputy Director of the Office of Collective Bargaining for resolution.
Employees having a legitimate need for the services of their delegates/organizers shall notify their supervisor. Delegates/organizers will, upon entering any work area other than their own and prior to engaging in any representative duties, report to the supervisor involved.
The Union will provide written notification to the agency of the appointment of all delegates/organizers. No appointment will be recognized until such notification is received by the agency.
When it is necessary for delegates to conduct authorized union business in a work site or shift other than their own, they shall notify the designated agency representative of that work site or shift of their presence and the nature of their business.
Delegates/organizers of the Union shall be allowed reasonable contact with employees of the bargaining unit during normal working hours. The organizer shall notify the designated agency representative before conducting union business on the agency's premises and shall adhere to the agency's reasonable policy regarding access.
Each year of the contract, Union delegates will be allowed a maximum of eight (8) hours of time off with pay at his/her straight time rate to participate in contract administration training conducted by the Union. The time for the delegate training will be at a time mutually agreeable to the Union and the agency. The Union’s vice-president shall be given ten (10) days administrative leave with pay to attend to his/her duties as an officer.
Employees elected to the Executive Board of the Union may be allowed time off without pay or may use their personal leave or vacation to attend necessary meetings. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.
The Union shall designate no more than twenty (20) bargaining unit members to serve on the negotiating team. Members of the Union negotiating team shall be paid by the Employer for the time spent in negotiations with the Employer as well as for the time spent enroute to and from such negotiations, provided that no Union negotiating team member shall receive more than eight (8) hours pay for any single day. At the request of the Union, Union negotiating team members will also be paid for up to three (3) days of negotiations p reparations.
It is understood that the Union is in exclusive control of the composition of its committee and may select those state employees, up to twenty (20) who will participate in negotiations. The Union may, on a limited basis, replace or substitute individual committee members as it perceives the need.
3.0	2 Union Requests for Time Off
All requests for any form of time off from work pursuant to this Article must be made by completing a form or log provided by the Employer. No employee will be granted any time off pursuant to this Article, without completing the form or log prior to the utilization of such time, and securing of permission to utilize such time. The employee shall enter on the form the time the leave commences, and upon returning the employee shall enter the return time. Employees who do not return to their worksite prior to the end of the employees’ workday shall complete the form at the beginning of the employees’ next workday. Employees who normally work out of the office, will work out an acceptable alternative union leave request procedure with their supervisor. In the absence of a mutually agreed to form the employee shall use state leave forms.
2
3.03 Other Union Deductions
The Employer, for the term of this Agreement, shall withhold other Union deductions from the pay received monthly, quarterly, or annually from those employees who have voluntarily and individually authorized such deduction by executing and submitting a written authorization form (payroll deduction form) in a timely manner. All funds so deducted shall be remitted to the Union regularly.
3.04 Credit Union Deductions
The Employer agrees to honor Credit Union deduction requests for members who have properly signed and executed the payroll deduction form. Such deduction shall remain in effect until the Employer is properly notified in writing by the employee of any change.
3.05 Bulletin Boards
The agency shall provide a suitable space for the use of the Union at each facility for the purpose of posting bulletins, notices and other materials affecting the employees in the bargaining units except for those situations where the agency does not lease or own office space. In institutional agencies, bulletin boards shall be glass enclosed and lockable. The appropriate Union representative shall have the key. The posting of any Union materials shall be restricted to such bulletin board space. Any material posted will be signed and dated by the appropriate Union representative prior to such posting. The Union agrees not to post any material which is profane, obscene or defamatory to the Employer, its representatives, or any individual, or which constitutes campaign material between competing employee organizations, or partisan campaign literature. The union representative shall remove any materials in violation of this section.
The unresolved posting of any material at a facility may be referred to the Union and the Office of Collective Bargaining for resolution.
3.06 Meeting Room Space
Space for meetings or conferences with employees may be provided upon request, when available. The Employer agrees to provide office space in institutions where space is currently provided to other labor organizations to be used for conducting union business.
3.07 Union Orientation
Where the Employer has a structured employee orientation program, the Union shall be permitted to make a presentation not to exceed thirty minutes in duration regarding the Union. The Employer shall notify the Union of newly hired employees at reasonable intervals, but no later than before a scheduled orientation.
ARTICLE 4	- UNION SECURITY
The Employer shall deduct monthly membership dues and, if appropriate, initiation fees payable to the Union, upon receipt of a voluntary written individual authorization from any bargaining unit employee on a form provided by the Employer.
When an employee transfers from one appointing authority to another within the bargaining unit, the dues deduction card, if one has been submitted, will be transferred to the new appointing authority.
When the exclusive representative provides the Employer with a written statement indicating that a majority of the bargaining unit employees are in favor of enacting a fair share fee, all employees in the bargaining unit pursuant to Section 4117.09 (C) of the Ohio Revised Code who do not become, or do not remain, members in the Union shall, during any such period of non-membership, be required as a condition of employment to pay to the Union a fair share fee of an amount equal to the dues uniformly required of its members. The deduction of the fair share fee from the payroll checks of bargaining unit employees shall be automatic and does not require authorization by the non-member employee.
Each employee covered by this Agreement who fails voluntarily to acquire or maintain membership in the Union shall be required to pay to the Union a fair share fee as a condition of employment.
Employees covered by this Agreement who, for bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a church or religious body, are forbidden from joining a Union shall contribute an amount equal to the fair share fee to a non-religious charity pursuant to the provisions of Section 4117.09 (C) of the Ohio Revised Code. The Employer is limited to deducting only Union dues or fair share fees for the exclusive representation of the bargaining unit unless otherwise stated in this Agreement.
The Employer will terminate dues deductions for the following reasons:
A.	Bargaining unit employee signs cancellation notification on the form provided by the Union;
B.	Bargaining unit employee resigns, is discharged, or severs employment with the Employer for any other reason;
C.	Bargaining unit employee is laid off.
3
The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Employer harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders or judgments brought or issued against the Employer as a result of any action taken or not taken as a result of a request of the Union under the provisions of this article including fair share fees, deductions and remittances.
ARTICLE 5	- MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Except to the extent modified by this Agreement, the Employer reserves, exclusively, all of the inherent rights and authority to manage and operate its facilities and programs. The exclusive rights and authority of management include specifically, but are not limited to, the rights expressed in Section 4117.08 (C)(1)-(9) of the Ohio Revised Code, and the determination of the location and number of facilities; the determination and management of its facilities, equipment, operations, programs and services; the determination and promulgation of the standards of quality and work performance to be maintained; the determination of the management organization, including selection, retention and promotion to positions not within the scope of this Agreement; the determination of the need and use of contractual services; and the ability to take all necessary and specific actions during emergency operational situations. Management will not discriminate against any employee in the exercise of these rights or for the purpose of invalidating any contract provision.
ARTICLE 6	- NON-DISCRIMINATION
6.0	1 Non Discrimination
Neither the Employer nor the Union shall unlawfully discriminate against any employee of the bargaining units on the basis of race, sex, creed, color, religion, age, national origin, political affiliation, union affiliation and activity, handicap or sexual orientation, or discriminate in the application or interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement, except those positions which are necessarily exempted by bona fide occupational qualifications due to the uniqueness of the job, and in compliance with the existing laws of the United States or the State of Ohio. In addition, the Employer shall comply with all the requirements of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act and the regulations promulgated under that Act.
The Employer and Union hereby state a mutual commitment to equal employment opportunity, in regards to job opportunities within the agencies covered by this Agreement.
6.0	2 Agreement Rights
No employee shall be discriminated against, intimidated, restrained, harassed, or coerced in the exercise of rights granted by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 7 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
7.01 Purpose
The Employer and the Union recognize that in the interest of harmonious relations, a procedure is necessary whereby employees can be assured of prompt, impartial and fair processing of their grievance. Such procedure shall be available to all bargaining unit employees and no reprisals of any kind shall be taken against any employee initiating or participating in the grievance procedure. The State Personnel Board of Review shall have no jurisdiction to receive and determine any appeals relating to matters that are the subject of this grievance procedure.
7.02 Definitions
A.	Grievance as used in this Agreement refers to an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of specific article(s) or section(s) of the Agreement.
B.	Disciplinary grievance refers to a grievance involving a suspension, a fine, a discharge, or a reduction in pay or position. Probationary employees shall not have access to the disciplinary grievance procedure.
C.	Day as used in this Article means a calendar day, and times shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except when the last day falls on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, the act may be done on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday.
7.03 Specific Provision
The grievant shall cite on the grievance form the specific article, section, or combination thereof that he/she alleges to have been violated and the specific resolution requested. If the grievant fails to cite provision(s) and requested resolution, the supervisor shall return the grievance form to the grievant.
7.04 Grievant
A grievance under this procedure may be brought by any bargaining unit member who believes himself/herself to be aggrieved by a specific violation of this Agreement. When a group of bargaining unit employees desires to file a grievance involving an alleged violation that affects more than one (1) employee in the same way, the grievance may be filed by the Union. A grievance so initiated shall be called a Class
4
Grievance. Class Grievances shall be filed by the Union within fifteen (15) days of the date on which the grievant(s) knew or reasonably could have known of the event giving rise to the Class Grievance. Class Grievances shall be initiated directly at Step Two (2) of the grievance procedure if the entire class is under the jurisdiction of the Step Two (2) management representative, or at Step Three (3) of the grievance procedure if the class is under the jurisdiction of more than one (1) Step Two (2) management representative. The Union shall identify the class involved, including the names if necessary, if requested by the agency head or designee.
Union representatives, officers or bargaining unit members shall not attempt to process as grievances matters which do not constitute an alleged violation of this Agreement.
7.05 Termination of the Issue
When a decision has been accepted by the Employer and the Union at any step of this grievance procedure, or the Employer has granted the grievance, it shall be final and no further use of this grievance procedure in regard to that issue shall take place. It is understood that settlements below Step Three (3) are not precedent setting.
Settlement agreements that require payment or other compensation shall be initiated for payment within two payroll periods following the date the settlement agreement is fully executed. If payment is not received within three (3) pay periods, interest at the rate of one percent (1%) shall accrue commencing the first day after the payment was due, and on the same date of subsequent months.
7.06 Grievance Steps
The parties intend that every effort shall be made to share all relevant and pertinent records, papers, data and names of witnesses to facilitate the resolution of grievances at the lowest possible level to the extent that the Health Insurance Portability and Privacy Act (“HIPPA”) allows. By mutual agreement, the Union and the agency may waive Steps 1, 2, or 3 of this procedure. The following are the implementation steps and procedures for handling a member's grievance:
Preliminary/Step 1
A member having a complaint is encouraged to first attempt to resolve it informally with his/her immediate supervisor at the time the incident giving rise to the complaint occurs or as soon thereafter as is convenient.
At this meeting there may be a delegate present. If the member is not satisfied with the result of the informal meeting, if any, the member may pursue the formal steps which follow:
Step 2 - Local or Agency Designee
In the event the complaint is not resolved at the Preliminary/Step 1 of this procedure, or if it is the employee’s decision not to discuss the complaint at the Preliminary/Step 1, the grievance shall be reduced to writing and presented to the local or agency designee within fifteen (15) days of the date on which the grievant knew or reasonably should have had knowledge of the event.
Grievances submitted beyond the fifteen (15) day limit will not be honored. The grievance at this step shall be submitted to the designee on the grievance form. The designee shall indicate the date and time of receipt of the form. Within seven (7) days of the receipt of the form the designee shall hold a meeting with the grievant to discuss the grievance. At such meeting, the grievant may bring with him/her the appropriate delegate. The designee shall respond to this grievance by writing the answer on the form or attaching it thereto, and by returning a copy to the grievant and delegate within seven (7) days of the meeting. The answer shall be consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Once the grievance has been submitted at Step Two (2) of the grievance procedure, the grievance form may not be altered except by mutual written agreement of the parties . Meetings will ordinarily be held at the work site in as far as practical. Written reprimands may be grieved. The agency designee’s decision shall be final. Verbal reprimands shall not be grievable. Employees shall sign indicating receipt of a verbal reprimand and the verbal reprimand shall be placed in the personnel file.
Suspension, Fine, Discharge and Other Advance-Step Grievances
Certain issues which by their nature cannot be settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure or which would become moot due to the length of time necessary to exhaust the grievance steps may, by mutual agreement, be filed at the appropriate advance step where the action giving rise to the grievance was initiated. A grievance involving a suspension, a fine, a reduction in pay and/or position or a discharge shall be initiated at Step Three (3) of the grievance procedure within fifteen (15) days of the notification of such action. Grievances filed as a result of non-selection for promotions must be filed directly at Step Three (3) with the agency where the vacancy was posted.
Discharge Grievances
The Agency shall forward a copy of the discharge grievance with the grievance number to the Office of Collective Bargaining at the time the grievance is filed at Step Three (3). The Agency shall conduct a meeting
5
and respond within sixty (60) days of the date the grievance was filed at Step Three (3). If the grievance is not resolved at Step Three (3) the parties shall conduct a mediation within sixty (60) days of the due date of the Step Three (3) response. Nothing in this section precludes either party from waiving mediation and proceeding directly to arbitration. The Union may request arbitration of the grievance within sixty (60) days of the date of mediation, but no more than one hundred eighty (180) days of the filing of the grievance. The parties shall conduct an arbitration within sixty (60) days of the date of the arbitration request. The parties agree that there shall be no more than one (1) thirty (30) day continuance requested for arbitration. If a cancellation is initiated by an arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted within thirty (30) days of the cancellation. However, grievances involving criminal charges of on-duty actions of the employee, grievants unable to attend due to a disability, or grievances involving an unfair labor practice charge may exceed the time limits prescribed herein.
Step 3 - Agency Head or Agency Designee
Should the grievant not be satisfied with the written answer received in Step Two (2), within seven (7) days after the receipt thereof, the grievance shall be filed with the agency head or designee. When different work locations are involved, transmittal of grievance appeals and responses shall be by U.S. Mail. The mailing of the grievance appeal form shall constitute a timely appeal, if it is postmarked within the appeal period. Likewise, the mailing of the answer shall constitute a timely response, if it is postmarked within the answer period. Upon receipt of the grievance, the agency head or designee shall hold a meeting within thirty (30) days after the receipt of the grievance. At the Step Three (3) meeting the grievance may be granted, settled or withdrawn, or a response shall be prepared and issued by the Agency head or designee, within fourteen (14) days of the meeting. Any grievances resolved at Step Three (3) or at an earlier step of the grievance procedure shall not be precedent setting at other institutions or agencies unless otherwise specifically agreed to in the settlement. The grievant may be accompanied at this meeting by a delegate and/or an organizer. The inability of a delegate or organizer to be present at such meeting after reasonable attempts to schedule will permit the agency head or designee to render a decision based on documents only. Step 4 - Arbitration/Mediation/Office of Collective Bargaining
If the Agency is untimely with its response to the grievance at Step Three (3), absent any mutually agreed to time extension, the Union may appeal the grievance to the Office of Collective Bargaining by filing a written appeal and a legible copy of the grievance form to the Deputy Director of the Office of Collective Bargaining requesting that a Step Three (3) meeting be held. The appeal shall be filed within fifteen (15) days of the due date of such answer. If the grievance is not resolved at Step Three (3) or not answered timely the Union may demand arbitration by serving written notice of its desire to do so by U.S. Mail, presented to the Deputy Director of the Office of Collective Bargaining with a copy to the agency head or designee, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the decision at Step Three (3) or date such answer was due. OCB shall have sole management authority to grant, modify or deny the grievance.
When the Union demands arbitration such notice shall also serve as a request for mediation unless otherwise designated by the Union. A meeting between the Union and the Office of Collective Bargaining will be held within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the arbitration demand for the purpose of scheduling mediation.
If the Union appeals, at its option, a grievance that is a result of a failure to meet time limits by the agency, OCB shall schedule a meeting with the delegate and/or the organizer within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the grievance appeal in an attempt to resolve the grievance unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. Within twenty-five (25) days of the OCB meeting, OCB shall provide a written response which may grant, modify, or deny the remedy being sought by the Union. The response will include the rationale upon which the decision is rendered and will be forwarded to the grievant, the Union's Step Three (3) representative(s) who attend the meeting and the Union central office. If the Union is not satisfied with this response, the Union may appeal the grievance to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions previously set forth in this Article, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
Either the Office of Collective Bargaining or the Union may advance a grievance directly from Step Three (3) to arbitration if that party believes that mediation would not be useful in resolving the dispute.
The parties shall mutually agree to a panel of arbitrators as set forth in Section 7.07(A). No mediator/arbitrator shall hear a case at both mediation and arbitration unless mutually agreed otherwise. The fees and expenses of the mediator shall be shared equally by the parties.
The mediators may employ all of the techniques commonly associated with mediation, including private caucuses with the parties. The taking of oaths and the examination of witnesses shall not be permitted and no verbatim record of the proceeding shall be taken. The purpose of the mediation is to reach a mutually
6
agreeable resolution of the dispute where possible and therefore representatives of the Agency and the Union will come to the mediation with signature authority for settlement and/or withdrawal. There will be no procedural constraints regarding the review of facts and arguments. Written material presented to the mediator will be returned to the party at the conclusion of the mediation meeting. The comments and opinions of the mediator, and any settlement offers put forth by either party shall not be admissible in subsequent arbitration of the grievance nor be introduced in any future arbitration proceedings.
If a grievance remains unresolved at the end of the mediation meeting, the mediator will provide an oral statement regarding how he/she would rule in the case based on the facts presented to him/her.
The disposition of grievances discussed during the mediation meeting will be listed by the representative from the Office of Collective Bargaining on a form mutually agreed to by the parties. A copy of the summary shall be provided to the Union within five (5) days.
A Union organizer, grievant and a delegate designated by the Union may be present at the mediation of a grievance. No more than two (2) of the Union representatives present may be on paid leave by the Employer. Each party may have no more than three (3) representatives present at the mediation of a grievance.
7.07 Arbitration
A.	Arbitration Panel
Within thirty (30) days after this Agreement becomes effective, the Employer and the Union shall select a panel of four (4) arbitrators. The panel shall be assigned cases in rotation order designated by the parties. Each arbitrator/mediator shall serve for the duration of this Agreement unless the arbitrator/mediator's services are terminated earlier by written notice from either party to the other. The arbitrator/mediator shall be notified of such termination by a joint letter from the parties. The arbitrator /mediator shall conclude his/her services by deciding any grievance(s) previously heard. A successor arbitrator/ mediator shall be selected by the parties.
The method of selection and all other questions regarding this section shall be jointly agreed to by the parties.
Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Agreement, the parties will mutually agree on a set of rules of arbitration. Insofar as is practical the rules will be based on the Voluntary Rules of the AAA.
B.	Witnesses
The agency agrees to allow a reasonable number of necessary witnesses requested by the Union time off with pay at regular rate to attend the arbitration hearing.
C.	Expenses
All other fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties, except as expressly provided in this Article.
If one (1) party desires a transcript of the proceedings, the total cost for such transcription shall be paid by the party desiring the transcript. If the other party desires a copy, then the cost for the copy shall be borne by the requesting party. The parties agree that normally transcripts will not be requested.
D.	Arbitration Decisions
The arbitrator shall render the decision as quickly as possible, but in any event, no later than forty-five (45) days after the conclusion of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise. (Disciplinary arbitration decisions shall be submitted on the expedited schedule listed in that section.) The arbitrator shall submit an accounting for the fees and expenses of arbitration to both parties. The arbitrator's decision shall be submitted in writing and shall set forth the findings and conclusions with respect to the issues submitted to arbitration.
E.	Arbitrator Limitations
1.	Only disputes involving the interpretation, application or alleged violation of a provision of this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement, nor shall he/she impose on either party a limitation or obligation not specifically required by the express language of this Agreement. Questions of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator. Once a determination is made that a matter is arbitrable, or if such preliminary determination cannot be reasonably made, the arbitrator shall then proceed to determine the merits of the dispute.
2.	The arbitrator shall have authority to subpoena witnesses pursuant to Section 2711.06, of the Ohio Revised Code. Upon receiving a request to issue a subpoena(s) the arbitrator shall contact the other party and hear and consider objections to the issuance of said subpoena(s). If the arbitrator sustains the objection
7
to the issuance of the subpoena, the arbitrator shall inform the parties at least five (5) days prior to the hearing. The arbitrator shall not subpoena persons to offer repetitive testimony.
3.	When the arbitrator determines that so many employees from the same facility have been subpoenaed that would impede the ability of the agency to carry out its mission or inhibit the agency's ability to conduct an efficient operation, he/she shall make alternate arrangements to hear the testimony.
F.	Binding Decisions
Arbitrators' decisions under this Agreement shall be final and binding.
G.	Issues
Prior to the start of an arbitration hearing under this Agreement, the Employer and the Union shall attempt to reduce to writing the issue or issues to be placed before the arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision shall address itself solely to the issue or issues presented and shall not impose upon either party any restriction or obligation pertaining to any matter raised in the dispute which is not specifically related to the submitted issue or issues.
7.08 Non-Traditional Arbitration
The parties agree to utilize a variety of non-traditional arbitration mechanisms. Such mechanisms may include but not be limited to, presentation of argument based on factual stipulations, presentation of argument without factual stipulations, and presentation of more than one case on a given day with bench decisions being orally rendered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall issue a written decision to the parties by the end of the hearing day. Decisions issued pursuant to this procedure shall have precedence for individual progressivity purposes only, unless mutually agreed otherwise by the parties.
Where the parties mutually agree, grievances may be identified as being ripe for resolution through such arbitration mechanisms and may be scheduled accordingly. Since the vehicle for resolution is non-traditional in nature and the traditional notions of proof may not apply, the Union shall present to the Employer a signed waiver by each grievant in disciplinary grievances of more than five (5) day fines or suspension whereby the grievant agrees to be bound by the decision. Except for patient/client related cases, in disciplinary grievances of five (5) day fines or suspension or less, non-traditional arbitration is mandatory, unless mutually agreed otherwise. In disciplinary grievances adjudicated in this forum, there shall be no mediation unless mutually agreed. The Employer and the Union are limited to one (1) witness each in this forum. The grievant, chapter representative and staff representative are all parties to the proceeding; however, testimony will be limited to either the grievant or the union witness. The arbitrator may ask questions of the witness or the grievant.
The Union and Office of Collective Bargaining may jointly decide to take issue grievances to non-traditional arbitration.
7.09 Representation
In each step of the grievance procedure outlined in this Article, certain specific Union representatives are given approval to attend the meetings therein prescribed. It is expected that, in the usual grievance, these plus the appropriate employer representatives will be the only representatives in attendance at such meeting; however, necessary witnesses may attend on paid time.
7.10	Miscellaneous
A.	Extensions and Mutual Agreement
By mutual consent, the Employer and the Union may alter any of the procedures set forth in the Article.
The grievant or the Union representative and representatives of the Employer may mutually agree at any point in the procedure to a time extension.
Approved leave with pay shall constitute an automatic time extension to the grievant with respect to such days. In the absence of such mutual extensions the grievant or the Union may, at any step where a response is not forthcoming within the specified time limits, move the grievance along to the next step in the procedure and proceed therein as though the answer at the prior step had been given and was unsatisfactory. Failure of the grievant to appeal a grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure within the time constraints specified in this Agreement, shall be considered an acceptance of the last answer given. In the event of an emergency situation which precludes the grievant from attending a scheduled meeting or authorizing a delegate to appear in his/her behalf, the grievant shall notify the agency as soon as possible and the meeting will be rescheduled.
Within Steps One (1) and Two (2), if the agency fails to respond to the grievance within the specified time limits, the grievance shall proceed to the next step in the procedure as though the answer at the prior step had been given and was unsatisfactory.
8
B.	Hearing Waiver
By mutual consent the Employer and the Union may waive a hearing and submit the issue solely on written materials.
7.11	Grievance Forms
Grievance forms mutually agreed to by the Employer and the Union may be obtained from a designated source at each facility and/or the union delegate.
ARTICLE 8 - DISCIPLINE
8.0	1 Standar d
Disciplinary action may be imposed upon an employee only for just cause.
8.0	2 Progressive Discipline
The principles of progressive discipline shall be followed. These principles usually include:
A.	Verbal Reprimand
B.	Written Reprimand
C.	A fine in an amount not to exceed five (5) days pay
D.	Suspension
E.	Removal
The application of these steps is contingent upon the type and occurrence of various disciplinary offenses.
The employee's authorization shall not be required for the deduction of a disciplinary fine from the employee's paycheck.
If a bargaining unit employee receives discipline, which includes lost wages or fine, the Employer may offer the following forms of corrective action:
1)	Actually having the employee serve the designated number of days suspended without pay; or receive only a working suspension, i.e., a suspension on paper without time off; or pay the designated fine or;
2)	Having the employee deplete his/her accrued personal leave, vacation, or compensatory leave banks of hours, or a combination of any of these banks under such terms as may be mutually agreed to between the Employer, employee, and the Union.
The employee is not required to accept the Employer’s option to issue a working suspension or leave depletion set forth in items 1 and 2 above.
8.03 Pre-Discipline
Prior to the imposition of a suspension or fine of more than three (3) days, or a termination, the employee shall be afforded an opportunity to be confronted with the charges against him/her and to offer his/her side of the story. This opportunity shall be offered in accordance with the "Loudermill Decision" or any subsequent court decisions that shall impact on pre-discipline due process requirements.
ARTICLE 9 - PROBATIONARY PERIODS
9.01 Initial Probationary Period
All newly hired employees shall serve a probationary period of one hundred eighty (180) days, except where the Union agrees to classification specifications which indicate a probationary period of more than one hundred eighty (180) days.
A probationary period for any classification may be extended if mutually agreed to by the Employer and the Union. Dismissal during an initial probationary period shall not be grievable.
The probationary period for all employees in the Departments of Rehabilitation and Correction and Youth Services will commence when the employee completes the initial period of training at the Correction Training Academy or the Department of Youth Services Training Academy. Periods worked by such employees prior to attending such training shall be credited toward the probationary period.
9.02 Promotion, Demotion, and Lateral Transfer Probationary Period
A.	Promotions and Lateral Transfer to a Different Classification
Any employee awarded a promotion or lateral transfer to a different classification as defined in Article 30 will serve a probationary period of one hundred eighty (180) days. During a lateral transfer to a different classification or promotional probationary period, the Employer maintains the right to place the employee back in the classification that the employee held previously if the employee fails to perform the job requirements of the new position. The agency's decision to return an employee whose performance is unsatisfactory to the position in the classification held immediately prior to promotion shall be grievable. The appointing authority shall, upon the employee's request, return the employee to a position in the
9
classification held immediately prior to the promotion if there is a position available within the facility or when such a position becomes available. Such request must be made during the probationary period. If an employee is returned to a position in the classification title held prior to the promotion, the employee shall receive the same salary received prior to the promotion except for changes in pay rate that may have occurred or any step increase to which the employee would have been entitled in the lower classification title.
B.	Lateral Transfer within the Same Classification or Demotion
Where a single classification involves work which varies substantially among different positions within the classification or where an employee is demoted as defined in Article 30, the Employer may require employees who are laterally transferred in the same classification or demoted to serve a trial period equal to one-half of the regular probationary period for the classification. During a lateral transfer or demotion trial period, the employee may elect to return to his/her previous position or, if the employee fails to perform the job requirements of the new position to the Employer’s satisfaction, the Employer may place the employee back in the position the employee previously held.
C.	Inter-Agency Transfer
Employees who accept an inter-agency transfer pursuant to Article 30, shall serve an initial probationary period. If the employee fails to perform the job requirements of the new position to the Employer’s satisfaction, the Employer may remove the employee. The employee has the right to grieve such decision. The employee, at his or her option, may transfer leave balances except for compensatory time.
D.	Cross-Collective Bargaining Agreement Rights
Employees who are in a classification outside of those covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement and who accept a position in a classification covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement shall serve an initial probationary period. If the employee fails to perform the job requirements of the new position to the Employer’s satisfaction, the Employer may remove the employee. The employee may not challenge such removal.
9.03 Extension of Trial or Probationary Period
A longer trial or probationary period may be served by the employee if mutually agreed to by the agency and the Union.
Where an employee is on any type of leave for a period of two weeks or longer, an employee’s trial or probationary period may be extended for the duration of the absence. For example, disability leave, adoption/childbirth, or any other leaves of fourteen (14) consecutive days or longer shall not be counted toward the employee's initial or promotional trial or probationary period.
ARTICLE 10	- VACATION ALLOWANCE
10.01 Rate of Accrual
Permanent full-time employees shall be granted vacation leave with pay at regular rate as follows, except that those employees who have less than 80 hours in an active pay status in a pay period shall be credited with
a prorated amount of leave according to the following schedule		
Length of	Accrual Rate	Annual
State Service	Hours earned per 80 hours in Active Pay Status per Pay Period	Amount per 2080 hours in Active Pay Status
less than 1 year	3.1 hours	80 hours (upon completion of one year service)

10 years or more	6.2 hours	160 hours
15 years or more	6.9 hours	180 hours
20 years or more	7.7 hours	200 hours
25 years or more	9.2 hours	240 hours
Only service with state agencies, i.e., agencies whose employees are paid by the Auditor of State, will be computed for purposes of determining the rate of accrual for new employees in the bargaining unit.
10
An employee who has retired in accordance with the provisions of any retirement plan offered by the State and who is employed by the State on or after July 1, 1994, shall not have his/her prior service with the State or any political subdivision of the State counted for the purpose of computing vacation leave. All employees currently receiving credit for service time prior to July 1, 1994 shall continue to receive service credit for such time. The accrual rate for any employee who is currently receiving a higher rate of vacation accrual will not be retroactively adjusted. All previously accrued vacation will remain to the employee's credit. The prospective accrual rate will be adjusted effective with the pay period that begins June 26, 1994.
10.02 Maximum Accrual
Vacation credit may be accumulated to a maximum that can be earned in four (4) years. Further accumulation will not continue when the maximum is reached. When an employee's vacation reaches the maximum level, and if the employee has been denied vacation during the twelve (12) months, the employee will be paid for the time denied but no more than eighty (80) hours in a pay period.
Annual Rate of Vacation 80 hours 120 hours 160 hours 180 hours 200 hours 240 hours	Accumulation Maxi mum 320 hours 480 hours 640 hours 720 hours 800 hours 960 hours
10.03 Scheduling
Vacation leave shall be taken only at times mutually agreed to by the appointing authority and employee. The appointing authority may establish maximum numbers of employees who can be absent from any given work site at one time. State seniority shall be the determining factor in granting vacation requests when requests are submitted thirty (30) days prior to the desired date or the posting of the work schedule (where applicable posting of the schedule exists) for the date(s) requested. Requests made later, if granted, shall be granted on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Requests for vacation leave cannot not be unreasonably denied.
Vacation requests shall be responded to within ten (10) working days.
When an emergency exists, in the sole and exclusive opinion of the Employer, all leaves including vacations may be canceled. If an employee is called to work from a scheduled vacation leave period, the employee will have the right to take the vacation leave at a later time and will be paid at time and one-half for the time the employee is in on-duty status. The employee shall also be reimbursed for any cost incurred as a result of canceling or returning from his/her vacation upon submission of appropriate evidence.
10.04 Charge of Vacation Leave
Vacation leave which is used by an employee shall be charged in minimum units of one-tenth (1/10) hour. 10.05 Conversion of Vacation Leave Credit upon Separation from Service
An employee shall be entitled, upon separation for any reason, to a cash conversion of all vacation leave up to four (4) years accrual. Employees separating from employment with less than six (6) months total service will not be paid for any accrued vacation.
10.06 Transfer of Vacation Leave
An employee who transfers from one state agency to another shall be credited with the unused balance of his/her vacation leave.
10.07 Death of an Employee
In case of death of an employee, any unused vacation leave shall be paid in accordance with Section 2113.04 of the Ohio Revised Code in effect on the date of the ratification of this Agreement; or to his/her estate.

When an employee attends a professional conference or seminar which is approved or sponsored by the agency, the employee shall receive his/her regular daily rate of pay for each day of attendance at such conference or seminar which falls on a regularly scheduled work day.
23.02 Tuition Reimbursement, Seminars and Conferences Fund
The Employer/agencies are committed to the upgrading and maintenance of the educational and skill levels of bargaining unit members. Where possible, the agencies will continue the practice of tuition reimbursement in effect on the date of the ratification of this Agreement.
The Employer will continue, through the administration by the Department of Administrative Services, the tuition reimbursement, seminar and conference fund. The fund will make available $400,000 in each fiscal year for fees and expenses for attendance at seminars, workshops, conferences and for tuition reimbursement. Subject to the limitations of the fund, each employee shall be eligible for an amount not to exceed one thousand five hundred ($1,500) dollars for tuition reimbursement and one thousand ($1000) dollars for seminars, workshops or conferences.
The parties shall discuss any changes in the fund at the State Professional Committee. These discussions shall include the usage of the fund to pay for necessary Continuing Education Units and Continuing Education Units leading to the renewal of certification and licensure.
Reimbursement for travel, food and lodging shall be consistent with Article 21 Travel of this Agreement.
Agencies may allocate additional funds within their agency for the purpose of providing reimbursement to their employees for approved attendance at seminars and conferences, or for tuition reimbursement. In agencies where such a fund exists agency employees must apply first for seminars, workshops and conferences and tuition reimbursement from that agency. When those funds are no longer available or do not exist, the employees may apply for reimbursement from the tuition reimbursement, seminar and conference fund established by the Employer.
The agency shall attempt to share information on seminars, workshops and conferences with interested employees, consistent with the local procedure for distribution of that type of material. However, the agency cannot be responsible for removal of notices from bulletin boards or failure of others to forward the information.
The Department of Mental Health will reimburse bargaining unit members for continuing education/seminars of benefit to both the employees and to the agency to a maximum of $50,000 in each fiscal year of the Agreement. Requests to attend seminars, workshops and conferences, or for tuition reimbursement shall not be unreasonably denied.
23.03 Educational Stipends
Full-time stipendiary arrangements, when an agency has funds available for this purpose, may be made for employees, at an approved educational institution. Such arrangements shall normally be made for periods of at least one (1) academic term or quarter but not more than two (2) academic years. The stipend shall not exceed regular salary plus tuition, books and related school expenses. Under a stipendiary program, the employee shall sign an agreement to work for a state agency for a period of time at least equal to the length of the stipend program. If he/she fails to perform this service, the amount of the stipend payment shall be repaid. Repayment may be waived by the appointing authority when warranted by exceptional circumstances. Use of this program shall be limited to fields of study in which the employee is working.
23.04 Time Off for Classes
An employee may be allowed time off from his/her position at regular rate for the purpose of taking job related educational courses or training, at an approved educational institution. The maximum time off under this arrangement may not exceed one tenth (1/10) of the employee's normally scheduled hours per week, unless otherwise agreed to by the Agency. Any time beyond this amount shall be without pay, unless specifically approved by the agency. If time off for classes is denied, the Employer shall provide a response
21
with the Employer’s reason for denial. Grievances on this issue shall only be advanced through the Non-Traditional Arbitration procedure.
23.05 Continuing Education Units
The Employer will attempt to provide CEU credits within the agency and at the work site where practical and feasible. It is the responsibility of the employee to maintain the appropriate CEU credits required for licensure.
23.06 Administrative Leave
Employee requests for Administrative Leave for conferences, workshops or seminars will be responded to within fourteen (14) days of proper submission of such requests. Reasonable attempts will be made to respond to such requests sooner. Exceptions may be mutually agreed to by the parties. If time off for classes is denied, the Employer shall provide a response with the Employer’s reason for denial. Grievances on this issue shall only be advanced through the Non-Traditional Arbitration procedure.
23.07 Computer Technology
Should SEIU/District 1199 develop and/or offer a computer discounted program, the parties mutually agree that within thirty (30) days of the program being offered a policy will be developed.
ARTICLE 24 - HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
24.01 Work Week
The standard work week for full-time employees shall be forty (40) hours exclusive of time allotted for unpaid meal periods.
24.02 Rate of Overtime Pay

65371	Psychiatrist
Compensatory time and overtime pay for physicians shall be addressed in Article 44 Physicians.
24.03 Overtime Assignment
A.	In institutional settings when the agency determines that overtime is necessary, overtime shall be offered on a rotating basis, to the qualified employees who usually work the shift where the opportunity occurs. If no qualified employees on the shift desire to work the overtime, it will be offered on a rotating basis first to the qualified employee with the most state seniority at the work site. When there are no volunteers to work the overtime as outlined above, and/or where an emergency exists, reasonable overtime hours may be required by the agency. Such overtime shall be assigned, on a rotating basis, first to the qualified employee with the least state seniority at the work site. This policy shall not apply to overtime work which is specific to a particular employee's claim load or specialized work assignment or when the incumbent is required to finish a work assignment.
B.	In non-institutional settings, the agency reserves the right to schedule and approve overtime. In emergency situations overtime may be approved after the fact. Required overtime that can be worked by more than one (1) employee at the work site (that which is not specific to the particular employee's case load or specialized work assignment) will be offered on a rotating, state seniority basis. If no qualified employee volunteers for the work, or where an emergency exists, then the qualified employee with the least state seniority at the work site will be assigned on a rotating basis.
C.	The parties recognize that in both institutional and non-institutional settings, that the Employer has the right to require mandatory overtime where necessary; however, the Employer will not abuse the utilization of mandatory overtime.
24.04 Overtime and Compensatory Time
Overtime work shall be compensated as follows:
A.	Hours in an active pay status in excess of forty (40) hours in any calendar week shall be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the total rate of pay, as defined by Section 43.01, for each hour of such time. Total rate of pay includes the base rate plus longevity, all applicable supplements, and shift differential where applicable.
B.	An employee may elect to take compensatory time off in lieu of cash overtime payment for hours in an active pay status more than forty (40) hours in any calendar week. Such compensatory time shall be granted on a time and one-half (1 1/2) basis.
22
C.	The maximum accrual of compensatory time shall be two hundred forty (240) hours and compensatory time must be taken within one (1) year of its being earned.
D.	When the maximum hours of compensatory time accrual is rendered, payment for overtime work shall be made in cash. Compensatory time not taken within one (1) year shall be paid in cash to a maximum of eighty (80) hours in any pay period.
E.	Upon termination of employment, an employee shall be paid for unused compensatory time at a rate which is the higher of:
1.	The final total rate received by the employee, or
2.	The average total rate received by the employee during the last three (3) years of employment.
For the purposes of this Article, active pay status is defined as the conditions under which an employee is eligible to receive pay, and includes, but is not limited to, vacation leave and personal leave. Sick leave shall not be considered as active pay status for purposes of this Article.
Compensatory time requests must be submitted in writing twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the anticipated time off, unless the need for time off is of an emergency nature.
24.05 Jury Duty
Employees shall receive pay at regular rate for regularly scheduled working hours when they are required to serve as a juror in a United States or Ohio court. Employees scheduled to work on afternoon shift shall not be required to report to work on days when they serve as jurors, but shall receive full jury duty pay. Employees scheduled to work on the midnight shift shall not be required to report to work on nights preceding reporting for jury duty, but shall receive full jury duty pay. Any fees in excess of fifteen dollars ($15) dollars per day received by the employee for such activity shall be remitted to the Employer.
24.06 Court Appearance
Any employee who has to appear in court or other official proceedings for the Employer for any reason shall be paid for such time at regular rate. If the court appearance is on the employee's regular day off, the employee shall receive pay or compensatory time at the rate of one and one half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay.
Employees subpoenaed to appear before any court, commission, board or other legally constituted body authorized by law to compel the attendance of witnesses shall be granted leave with pay at regular rate, where the employee is not a party to the action, which includes, but is not limited to, criminal or civil cases, traffic court, divorce proceedings, custody proceedings, or appearing as directed as parent or guardian of juveniles.
Employees subpoenaed to proceedings on behalf of an employer other than the State, who receive compensation for his/her testimony from the other employer shall not be eligible for paid leave as provided in this Article, but may elect to use available accrued leave. Employees using such accrued leave shall not be required to remit any fees received.
Second or third shift employees, during the course of scheduled work hours, shall be permitted an equivalent amount of time off from scheduled work on their preceding or succeeding shift for such appearance. Employees subpoenaed to witness duty shall submit any witness fees received in excess of fifteen dollars ($15), excluding travel and meal allowances, to the Agency. The employee shall notify the Agency designee immediately upon receiving a subpoena.
An employee appearing before a court or other legally constituted body in a matter in which the employee is a party may be granted the use of vacation or personal leave or leave of absence without pay. Such instances would include, but not be limited to, criminal or civil cases, traffic court, divorce proceedings, custody proceedings, or appearing as directed as parent or guardian of juveniles.
24.07 Meal Periods
Employees shall be granted an unpaid meal period of not less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than sixty (60) minutes near the midpoint of each shift, if feasible. If it is not feasible near the midpoint of the employee's shift, every attempt will be made to reschedule it at the earliest available time during that shift. If it is impossible to reschedule the meal period during the shift, the employee will be compensated according to the provisions of this Agreement. Employees who are required by the agency to remain in a duty status with no scheduled meal period shall receive compensation for time worked at their regular rate except when the employee is in an overtime status at which time the employee will be compensated at his/her overtime rate.
24.08 Breaks
A paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes shall be granted to each employee for every four (4) hours of regularly scheduled work performed, except during an unusual situation or emergency created beyond the control of the agency. At the request of the employee, the rest period(s) shall be scheduled with the meal
23
period unless operational needs preclude combining rest period(s) and lunch. The combination of the rest period(s) and lunch shall not exceed one (1) hour in length, and shall not be used to shorten the work day. If the rest period(s) and lunch are not combined, such rest periods shall be a time detached from the beginning and end of shifts, and although reasonably scheduled by the agency, shall be taken near the midpoint of each half-shift unless mutually agreed otherwise. Paid rest periods of ten (10) minutes each for every two (2) continuous hours of overtime worked shall be granted to employees.
24.0	9 Required Meeting Attendance
Employees required or authorized by their supervisors to attend meetings on off-duty hours will be compensated within the terms of this Agreement.
24.10	Flexible Work Schedules
The current practice of flex time shall be continued. Management reserves the right to change schedules, including flexible schedules, however, employees will not have their flex time schedules terminated in an arbitrary or capricious manner and such changes shall be made for a rational management purpose. The use of flexible work schedules shall be a subject for discussion in the Agency/Facility Professional Committees. Flexible work schedules can include adjusting the starting and quitting times of the work days and/or the number of hours worked per day and the number of days worked per week.
The Employer agrees to consider flexible work schedules for particular employees or classifications. The Employer agrees to consider such options as four (4) ten (10) hour days, twelve (12) hour shifts, and/or other creative scheduling patterns that may assist in the recruitment and/or retention of nurses and other employees. Subject to the Employer's right to schedule employees to satisfy its operational needs, such a schedule will be implemented upon the request of the union and affected employees.
Should recruitment difficulties become more severe in certain classifications, the Employer may explore and implement various arrangements to assist in recruiting such as shift differential, pay supplements, and variable weekend work plans.
In order to be able to implement some flexible work schedules, and where consistent with Federal Law, the Employer may allow a full-time employee(s) to work less than forty (40) hours in a week and more than forty (40) hours in the other week within the same pay period. An employee(s) permitted to shift his/her work hours shall be eligible for overtime pay or compensatory time only after eighty (80) hours in an active pay status in a pay period.
Flexible work schedules may, by mutual agreement, be used for pre-scheduled medical appointments. In addition, the trading of shifts may also be granted, by mutual agreement, for pre-scheduled medical appointments.
24.11	Place of Work
Those employees who have their homes designated as their work headquarters may continue to do so, and shall report to their field headquarters as directed by their supervisor. Requests from employees to work from their homes will be considered by the appointing authority.
24.12	Posting of Work Schedules
Where appropriate in institutional settings, a four-week schedule shall be posted two (2) weeks in advance. In the event the agency determines a change in an employee’s work schedule is necessary due to operational needs and when there are two (2) or more employees available and qualified to perform the duties of a specific assignment in the same classification, the Employer, to the extent possible under ordinary circumstances, will assign the least senior employee(s) to the modified schedule. The agency shall ask for volunteers prior to assigning employees to the modified schedule. An employee shall not be required to change his/her posted schedule solely to avoid the payment of overtime to such employee.
Employees may voluntarily switch work days with other employees with the prior approval of the supervisor.
In non-institutional settings where the work schedule is fixed, the agency shall not change an employee's schedule solely to avoid the payment of overtime.
24.13	Weekends
The present practice of weekend-off scheduling shall be continued until any proposed changes are discussed in the Agency or Facility Professional Committee meeting. At the Agency or Facility Professional Committee meeting, the discussion shall include operational need and the rationale for change.
24.14	Shifts
In the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, the agency may schedule nursing personnel on a rotational shift basis for a temporary period during the opening of new facilities. The agency shall not
24
schedule any employee to rotate more than two (2) different shifts in any four (4) week scheduling period. Exceptions may be mutually agreed to by the parties.
In the other agencies, shifts shall not be rotated unless mutually agreed to by the parties.
24.15	Job Sharing
The Employer and the Union recognize the value of job sharing in some situations. The parties agree to discuss in the professional committees the development of job sharing options in these agencies where such arrangements are feasible. Within ninety (90) days of the effective date of this Agreement, the parties shall develop guidelines for a Job Sharing Policy for consideration by the various agencies.
24.16	Shift and Assignment Openings
Shift and assignment openings shall be filled by the qualified employee within the classification at the worksite having the greatest state seniority who desires the opening.
24.17	Pulling or Movement of Personnel
An employee may be pulled or moved to meet operational needs. The agency shall designate the work area most able to provide the coverage. The qualified employee in the designated class having the greatest state seniority who desires to be pulled or moved shall be. If no employee volunteers to be pulled or moved, the qualified employee in the designated class with the least state seniority shall be pulled or moved first from the work area most able to provide the coverage as determined by management.
ARTICLE 25	- TEMPORARY WORKING LEVEL
The agency may temporarily assign an employee to duties of a position with a higher pay range. If the temporary assignment is for a continuous period in excess of four (4) days, the affected employee shall receive a pay adjustment which increases the employee's step rate of pay to the greater of: (a) classification salary base of the higher level position, or (b) a rate of pay of approximately four percent (4%) above his/her current step rate of compensation. The employee shall receive the pay adjustment for the duration of the temporary assignment.
The agency may place an employee in a temporary assignment more than once in any one (1) year period with prior approval of the Employer.
The agency shall not extend a temporary assignment beyond a ten (10) week period unless the Employer has given prior approval and the temporary assignment is being utilized to fill a position which is vacant as a result of an approved leave. The temporary assignment in such instance may be extended for the entire period of the vacancy which was the result of an approved leave.
Employees who are receiving temporary working level pay adjustments for positions excluded from these bargaining units shall be considered employees of the bargaining unit; however, they shall not answer grievances nor serve as delegates while temporarily working as supervisors.

An employee must request in writing all leaves of absence without pay. The request shall state reasons for taking leave of absence and the dates for which the leave is being requested.
If it is found that a leave is not actually being used for the purpose for which it was granted, the appointing authority shall cancel the leave and direct the employee to report for work.
26.05 Return to Service
When an employee returns from a leave of absence within two (2) years, the employee is to be returned to the same position including work site, assignment and shift held prior to the leave. The agency has the right to fill the position with an interim employee when the agency feels it necessary. When an employee returns from a leave of absence of longer than two (2) years, the employee is to be returned to the classification formerly occupied, or to a similar classification if the employee's former classification no longer exists. If the employee's former work site, assignment or shift no longer exists, every effort will be made to place the employee on a similar assignment and shift.
An employee who fails to return to duty or make arrangements to do so which are acceptable to the agency within three (3) working days of the completion of a valid cancellation of a leave of absence may be removed from service. An employee who fails to return to service from a leave of absence without pay and is subsequently removed from the service is deemed to have a termination date corresponding to the starting date of the leave of absence without pay.
26.06 Seniority While On Leave
Seniority shall accrue while on leave of absence.
26.07 Benefits While On Leave
The State will continue to pay the Employer's contribution to the Union Benefits Trust as well as the Employer’s share of health insurance premiums for an employee on unpaid FMLA leave granted pursuant to Article 26.10 provided the employee continues to contribute his/her share of the premium. Employees granted a non-FMLA leave of absence without pay for a period longer than thirty (30) days and who desire to continue their health and life insurance coverage, must pay the total premium (employee and Employer share). The State will continue to pay for dental and vision coverage as long as the employee continues paying the total health insurance premium.

The provisions of State and Federal Law shall prevail for all aspects of military leave, including request for and return from such leave.
26.10 Application of the Family Medical Leave Act

27.02 Part-Time
A part-time employee is an employee who regularly works less than forty (40) hours per week. The agency shall not use part-time employees to avoid full-time benefits.
27.03 Intermittent
An intermittent employee is an employee who works on an irregular schedule which is determined by the fluctuating demands of the work, is not predictable and is generally characterized as requiring one thousand (1,000) hours or less in a fiscal year.
Intermittents working more than one thousand (1,000) hours in a fiscal year shall be converted to part-time permanent status and shall be covered by the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement. The agency agrees not to abuse the designation of intermittent status and not to use intermittent employees for the purpose of avoiding filling permanent positions.
27.04 Interim
An interim employee is an employee who is hired to fill a vacancy created by an authorized leave of absence or disability leave. The interim employee may be hired in advance of the leave of absence or disability leave and be terminated after the return of the employee from the leave. The duration of interim positions shall not exceed (60) days plus the length of the leave of absence. Following the return of the employee from the leave of absence or disability leave, the interim employee shall be terminated with no right to grieve the termination. Where possible, reassignment will be made from current employees by moving the most senior qualified employee at the work site to the higher position on a temporary working level and then hiring the interim in the lower position.
27.05 Temporary

ARTICLE 28	- SENIORITY
28.01 Seniority Definition
A.	State Seniority
The total seniority credits accrued pursuant to the provisions of this Article.
27
B.	"Seniority Credit" - the total number of pay periods during which an employee held or had a right to return to a bargaining unit position, including periods of absence resulting from suspension, leaves of absence whether paid or unpaid, disability leave, leave for periods of workers' compensation (up to three years), and layoff (for as long as the employee remains on the recall list). Part-time employees experiencing similar periods of absence shall be credited with seniority at a rate determined by the average hours in active pay status during their last six (6) pay periods.
Except as provided under Section 28.02, continuous service will be interrupted only by resignation, discharge for just cause, disability separation, failure to return from a leave of absence or failure to respond to a recall from layoff, or expiration of rights to recall.
Each full-time employee shall be credited with one seniority credit for each pay period of continuous service. Part-time employees will be credited with .0125 seniority credit for each non-premium hour of compensation in each pay period not to exceed one (1) seniority credit in a pay period. Service credit shall be computed in years and days as is the past practice and shall be credited for all periods for which "seniority credits" are granted except for periods of unapproved unpaid leave.
The seniority of employees employed on or before June 12, 1986, shall be based on the previous guidelines used in determining State service. These guidelines provide that all service time with Ohio public agencies for which an employee contributes to an Ohio Public Employee Retirement plan counts as time toward seniority, not including time spent during a break in service. These guidelines shall also include the crediting of previous time after a break in service, if the employee was reinstated within one (1) year of the break in service. Employees hired after June 12, 1986 shall have seniority computed as follows: 1. Persons employed with the State of Ohio in a classification not covered by the 1199 Agreement, who prior to June 1, 2000, entered a classification in bargaining unit eleven (11) or bargaining unit twelve (12) are eligible to carry-over their previous seniority as that seniority was determined by the terms of the Agreement covering that previous classification.
2.	Effective June 1, 2000, persons employed with the State of Ohio in a classification not covered by the 1199 agreement, who enter a classification in bargaining unit eleven (11) or bargaining unit twelve (12) shall not carry-over any seniority.
Exceptions
A.	Return From Disability Separation/Disability Retirement
An employee who makes application for reinstatement within three years from the date of disability separation or five years from the date of disability retirement and is properly reinstated shall receive seniority credits and service credits for the period of disability separation/or disability retirement.
B.	Non-bargaining unit service
Except for classifications subsequently accreted to a bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, time spent in a position(s) exempt from collective bargaining subsequent to June 12, 1986, by employees who were not covered by this Agreement on July 1, 1992, shall not be included in the determination of seniority credits but shall be counted for service credits. For employees covered by the Agreement on July 1, 1992, time spent in a position exempt from collective bargaining, subsequent to July 1, 1992, other than classifications subsequently accreted to a bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, shall not be included in the determination of seniority credits but shall be counted for service credits.
Assignments to non-bargaining unit classifications for the period of a temporary working level or assignments to non-bargaining unit classifications for a period as an interim employee shall continue to earn both seniority credits and service credits.
28.02 Identical Hire Dates
Except as provided in Section 28.04:
A.	When two (2) or more employees have been hired or transferred into bargaining unit eleven (11) or bargaining unit twelve (12) during the same pay period the employee(s) with the earlier date of hire shall be the most senior;
B.	When two (2) or more employees have the same state hire date, transfer date or the same number of seniority credits, seniority shall be based on the last four (4) digits of the employee's social security number. The lowest number shall be considered the most senior.
28.03 Seniority Lists
The Employer shall prepare and maintain seniority lists of all employees and shall furnish said lists quarterly to the Union and to the appropriate State of Ohio agencies.
The seniority list will describe employees in descending order of state seniority credits and will contain the employee’s name, classification title, state seniority credits, and the last four digits of each employee's social
28
security number. Each employee's individual employee seniority credits will be displayed on the employee's earnings statement.
28.04 Conversion
The following principles and procedures shall apply to the conversion from a date-based seniority system to a system based upon seniority credits:
A.	Principles, methods or understandings used to determine seniority standing or to resolve disputes over relative seniority ranking under prior agreements will not be altered except as specified by the provisions of this Agreement. That is, if a seniority dispute has previously been raised and resolved, the prior resolution of that matter will stand.
B.	Seniority credits shall replace seniority dates as the basis for determining relative seniority standing or seniority rights under this Agreement.
C.	Adjustments or corrections in seniority dates or seniority credits pursuant to this Article shall not affect previous personnel actions based upon seniority. Such changes shall not alter personnel actions, layoffs or bumping rights which have taken place prior to the effective date of the conversion.
ARTICLE 29 - LAYOFF AND RECALL
29.0	1 Notice
When the agency determines that a layoff is necessary, the agency shall notify the Union and inform them of the classification(s), the number of employee(s) and the work site(s) affected. When the layoff involves a work site with more than one (1) employee in a classification series, the layoff shall be within the entire classification series. In the event the duties of a higher classification in the class series are no longer needed, employees in the higher classification may be laid off.
The agency will schedule a meeting with the Union to explain their reason for such action. The Union's comments and ideas given to avoid the layoff will be seriously considered before making a final decision.
If after this meeting the agency deems that the action is still necessary, the following procedure shall be adhered to.
Every effort will be made to place employees in comparable employment in the public or private sector. The agency shall notify all affected employees of the impending layoff at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of any layoff, if the reason is for lack of funds, and ninety (90) days prior notice shall be given to affected employees for any other reason.
29.0	2 Layoff Procedures
A.	In the event of a layoff within a higher classification(s) within a classification series, as a result of the elimination of duties:
1.	There shall be the opportunity for any employee in the affected classification series at the work site(s) to volunteer for layoff.
2.	Employees with the least state seniority within the classification(s) at the work site(s) affected shall be laid off first.
Those individuals in the classification(s) affected who have special qualifications or duties may be exempt from the layoff, and will not be displaced by individuals without those qualifications or the ability to perform those duties. A laid off employee shall have the right to displace a less senior employee in the same classification at another work site within the agency bumping jurisdiction, or the employee shall have the right to displace a less senior employee at their own worksite within their own classification series. No promotions shall result from this action.
B.	In the event any layoff is implemented within the bargaining unit in the classification(s) series affected other than as outlined in A above:
1.	There shall be the opportunity for any employee in the affected classification series at the worksite(s) to volunteer for layoff.
2.	Employees with the least state seniority within the classification series at the worksite(s) affected shall be laid off first.
Those individuals in the classification series affected who have special qualifications or duties may be exempt from the layoff, and will not be displaced by individuals without those qualifications or the ability to perform those duties. A laid off employee shall have the right to displace an employee of another work site within the classification series within the agency bumping jurisdiction who has less seniority. The employee who exercises his/her bumping privilege shall enter the pay range of the classification at the rate closest to his/her current rate of pay.
C.	The bumping procedure will be as follows:
29
1.	When an employee is given notice of layoff in accordance with Section 29.01 above, that employee and all other employees within the similar classification series within the agency bumping jurisdiction shall be given a list showing the name, work site and location, and state seniority of all agency employees within their agency bumping jurisdiction in the similar classification series.
2.	All employees with less seniority within the agency bumping jurisdiction within the affected similar classification series will be given a bumping selection form that identifies potential options. Such employee will select options available to them and will list them in the order of their priority. Employees will be given five (5) days to complete and return the forms. Copies of the forms will be sent by the Employer to the Union.
3.	The agency will take the top option selected by each employee in declining seniority to determine the bumping placement of that employee. This process will be completed within five (5) days. All employees will then be notified of their placement following this bumping procedure.
4.	At the conclusion of this process, any employees required to change jobs as a result of the bumping process will change jobs.
The jurisdictions for purposes of layoff are outlined in Appendix B.
The Employer shall establish a list of similar classification series which employees may use for displacement purposes in the event of a layoff. The Union will be consulted before the establishment of the list and kept apprised of its progress and the results before implementation.
29.03 Recall
When it is determined by the agency to fill a vacancy or to recall employees in a classification series where the layoff occurred, the following procedure shall be adhered to.
The most senior laid off employee with the most state seniority from the classification series shall be recalled first. Employees shall be recalled provided they are presently qualified to perform the work in the job classification to which they are recalled without further training or certification. No promotions shall result from recall. Employees shall have recall rights for a period of two (2) years. Notification of recall shall be by certified mail to the employee's last known address. Employees shall maintain a current address on file with the appointing authority. Recall rights shall be within the agency and within recall jurisdictions as outlined in Appendix B. If the employee fails to notify the agency of his/her intent to report to work within seven (7) days of receipt and return to work within thirty (30) days, he/she shall forfeit recall rights.
29.04 Appeals
Grievances resulting from Layoff and Recall procedures shall be grievable directly to Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.
29.05 No Reduction of Hours
If the work force is to be reduced, it shall be accomplished by layoff and not by any hours reduction. Only by agreement between the appropriate parties can the regular hours of employees be reduced.
29.06 Placement
Notwithstanding any other provisions of Article 30, the Union and the agency or agencies may agree, in writing, to place an employee to be laid off in an existing vacancy which may not be otherwise available. Such agreement shall take precedence over any other Section/Article of this Agreement. However, such placement shall not result in the promotion of the affected employee. All employees placed into existing vacancies under this Section shall retain recall rights pursuant to the provisions of this Article.
29.07 Alternate Procedures
Each agency, with the Office of Collective Bargaining’s approval, may negotiate with the Union to establish procedures for moving positions and personnel in lieu of the procedures in the Article.
ARTICLE 30 - VACANCIES
30.01 Job Vacancies
A vacancy is defined as an opening in a full-time permanent or part-time permanent position in the bargaining unit which the agency has determined is necessary to fill and does not include those positions identified through mutual agreement between the union and the agency as being subject to reorganization, changes in appointment category (type), or a movement that constitutes a demotion.
When a vacancy is created by an incumbent employee leaving the position, and that incumbent is above the entry level position in the classification series, the job shall be posted at the level in the classification series of the leaving employee, provided the duties and responsibilities remain the same. After the employees have had the opportunity to bid for lateral transfers or for promotions, the position can be reduced in the classification series.
30
When a vacancy will be created by an incumbent employee leaving a position, the agency may post the vacancy and interview and provisionally select a candidate anytime after receiving notice that the position will be vacated.
A job vacancy shall be posted for a minimum of seven (7) days on designated bulletin boards within the agency at the facility where the vacancy exists. Applicants will be notified of the final determination within thirty (30) days after the selection for a position.
Applications for posted positions may be filed electronically by using the DAS On-Line Employment Application Process (OLEAP).
Any employee who desires to be considered for a position(s) in another agency(s) shall submit an Ohio Civil Service Application (ADM-4268) to the appointing authority of the agency or institution where employment is sought. Such application shall specify the desired classification(s) and work site(s). These applications will be maintained on file for one (1) year from the date of receipt by the appointing authority. If a posted vacancy is not filled pursuant to steps A and B as outlined in Section 30.02 of this Article, any applicant meeting qualifications for this position shall be considered pursuant to Section 30.02, step C of this Article.
The Employer shall prepare and make available a booklet detailing the classifications available in various agencies, including a listing of the appointing authorities to which applications are to be sent.
Notice of newly-created classifications shall be provided to the Union's central office thirty (30) days prior to initial posting.
30.02 Awarding the Job (Transfers and Promotions and Demotions)
"Lateral transfer" is defined as employee requested movement to a posted vacancy which is in the same pay range as the classification the employee currently holds.
“Promotion” is the movement of an employee to a posted vacancy in a classification with a higher pay range. A higher pay range is defined as a pay range in which the first step or the last step has a higher pay rate than the first or last step of the pay range to which the employee is currently assigned.
“Demotion" is defined as the movement of an employee to a vacant position within a classification covered by the terms of this Agreement pursuant to the provisions set forth for the filling of a vacancy, to a lower pay range only within the employee’s current Agency. A lower pay range is defined as a pay range in which the first step has a lower rate of pay than the first step of the pay range to which the employee is currently assigned. Should the employee be selected for an inter-agency transfer to a position in a lower pay range than that currently held, the employee shall be placed in the step closest to but not to exceed the step currently held by the emp loyee.
“Inter-Agency Transfer” is defined as an employee-requested movement to a posted vacancy in a different agency. Should the employee be selected for an inter-agency transfer to a position with a higher pay range than that currently held by the employee, the employee shall be placed in the step to guarantee an increase of approximately four percent (4%). Should the employee be selected for an inter-agency transfer to a position in the same pay range currently held by the employee, the employee shall be placed in the same step of the pay range. If the agency has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding pay, it shall take precedence over this section.
Employees in classifications not covered by the terms of this Agreement may not be demoted into a classification covered by the terms of this Agreement without the agreement of the Union. This does not include employees in the unclassified service in classifications not covered by the terms this Agreement who may be placed into a position covered by the terms of the Agreement where such unclassified status is revoked consistent with civil service law.
Applications will be considered filed timely if they are received or postmarked no later than the closing date listed on the posting. Applicants must clearly demonstrate on the application how they possess the minimum qualifications for the position. Failure to do so will result in the application being screened out and rendered ineligible for further consideration. All eligible applications shall be reviewed considering the following criteria: qualifications, experience, education, and work record. Employment diversity may be a factor in the selection. The Employer maintains the right to administer a test or instrument to measure the listed criteria. Among those that are qualified the job shall be awarded to the applicant with the most state seniority unless a junior employee is significantly more qualified based on the listed criteria. The Union may challenge the validity of the test or instrument as part of a non-selection grievance.
The Employer and the Union agree, through each Agency Professional Committee to review and discuss the agency's EEO Strategic plan prior to submission to State EOD. Such plans shall include an employee diversity analysis .
31
Job vacancies shall be awarded in the following sequential manner:
A.	The job shall first be awarded to a bargaining unit applicant working at the facility where the vacancy exists in accordance with the above criteria.
B.	If no selection is made from A above, the job shall be awarded to a bargaining unit applicant working in the agency where the vacancy exists in accordance with the above criteria.
C.	If no selection is made from B above, the job shall be awarded to an applicant working in the bargaining unit in accordance with the above criteria.
D.	If no selection is made from C above, the job may be awarded by hiring a new employee.
Within non-institutional agencies and within the Adult Parole Authority, step A above shall not apply.

If it is determined that the grievant is performing duties not contained within his/her classification, the Deputy Director of the Office of Collective Bargaining shall direct the agency to immediately discontinue such assigned duties. The determination of a monetary award shall be in accordance with Section B above. D. If the Union is not satisfied with the decision of the Office of Collective Bargaining, the grievance may be appealed to arbitration, in writing, within fifteen (15) days of the Office of Collective Bargaining answer or date it was due.
1.	The parties shall schedule a hearing officer to determine if an employee was performing the duties contained in a classification other than the employee's current classification and for what period of time.
2.	Present at the hearing shall be a union representative and a management representative who will present their arguments to the hearing officer. The hearing officer will issue a binding bench decision at the conclusion of the hearing, which will identify if the employee was working out of classification and for what period of time.
3.	If the arbitrator determines the duties of the position to be of a lower classification, the arbitrator shall order the Employer to immediately discontinue such assigned duties. The arbitrator’s decision concerning a lower classification is restricted to determining whether duties are performed for a substantial portion of time. Only when the employee is performing duties inconsistent with the employee’s original classification assignment more than eighty percent (80%) of the employee’s time will a determination be made to instruct the Employer to discontinue the assigned duties.
4.	The parties mutually agree to reclassify the employee to a lower classification.
The expenses of the hearing officer shall be borne equally by the parties. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final and binding.
ARTICLE 39	- CLASSIFICATION CHANGES
The Employer may create classifications, change the pay range of classifications, authorize advance step hiring if needed for recruitment problems or other legitimate reasons, and issue or change specifications for each classification as needed. If any pay range is changed, then the Office of Collective Bargaining will negotiate the change with the Union. The Office of Collective Bargaining shall notify the Union at least thirty (30) days in advance of such action. The Union shall respond by the end of that thirty (30) days.
At the request of the union, but not more frequently than once each four (4) years per classification, the Department of Administrative Services shall review up to five (5) designated classifications in the first year of the contract for duties, responsibilities, education and/or experience, certification and/or licensure and working condition factors. In the second year of the contract the Union may request up to four (4) reviews, and in the third year of the contract the Union may request up to three (3) reviews. Such review shall be combined with salary survey data to determine appropriate salary range assignment. Absent mutual agreement, said data shall not be used to reduce a classification pay range assignment. Such reviews shall be based upon a position description questionnaire survey of all incumbents in the classification, and shall be completed within one hundred twenty (120) days of the initial request. The timelines in classifications exceeding three hundred (300) incumbents will be mutually set. Each employee shall complete his/her own PDQ. Those employees who do not complete an individual PDQ shall be assigned to the appropriate classification and pay range based on the supervisor’s review. Employees on disability will be given the option to complete a PDQ, or have their supervisor complete a PDQ.
Prior to the distribution of PDQ’s the Union and State shall conduct a joint training on how to complete PDQ’s. The content of the training shall be mutually agreed to by DAS and the Union. The scheduling and the training shall be mutually conducted by agency personnel and the Union. The training shall be no more than two (2) hours.
If an employee is found to have been improperly classified as determined from his/her PDQ, the employee shall be allocated to the appropriate classification in accordance with the finding of DAS. If the employee is performing duties of a lower classification, the employee shall be assigned into a lower classification and shall be placed in the step within the pay range that provides the employee with compensation that is equal to his/her current rate or that provides the least amount of increase, but no decrease in pay. Longevity supplements shall not decrease as a result of being placed in step X. If the employees base rate of pay exceeds the maximum rate of pay in the new pay range, the employee shall be placed in step X. If the employee is performing duties of a higher classification, the employee shall be placed in the higher classification at the step in the higher pay range which is approximately four percent
38
(4%) higher than the current step rate of the employee. The back pay award, if any, shall be effective on the effective date of the pay range determination in accordance with this Article. The employee, through the Union, has sixty (60) days from the date the Union receives the findings of DAS to appeal the classification assignment. An employee on disability may appeal a classification assignment under this process within two (2) weeks following reinstatement from the disability.
Classification allocation appeals shall be conducted by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall determine whether the employee is appropriately allocated to the new classification, and if not, determine the classification assignment that is appropriate. If it is found that the employee is serving in a class not subject to the classification review; the employee shall receive an adjustment effective the date the study was implemented. Employees who do not complete a PDQ shall have no right to appeal the DAS determination. This appeal process shall also apply to state initiated classification reviews.
Pay adjustments pursuant to the classification review shall not be made effective before the beginning of the next fiscal year unless mutually agreed otherwise. The Union shall have the right to appeal the pay range determination directly to Step Four (4) of Article 7 within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice of the Department of Administrative Services determination. An Arbitrator shall have no authority to award backpay for any period of time prior to the beginning of the fiscal year that begins after the grievance award.
ARTICLE 40	- (THIS ARTICLE RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE)
ARTICLE 41	- SUB-CONTRACTING
41.01 Contracting Out
The Employer intends to utilize bargaining unit employees to perform work which they normally perform. However, the Employer reserves the right to contract out any work it deems necessary or desirable because of greater efficiency, economy, or programmatic benefits or other related factors.
Changes in State policy or methodology for delivering services may result in the discontinuation of services or programs directly operated by the State.
Every reasonable effort will be made to avoid the layoff of an employee as a consequence of the exercise by the State of its right to contract out.
41.02 Facility Closings/Service Elimination
Should it become necessary to close a facility or eliminate a service, the following guidelines will be utilized:
A.	Where individual facilities are closed or services eliminated, the provisions of Article 29 Layoff and Recall would apply;
B.	Departments will seek to absorb all affected employees or help laid off workers obtain employment in other areas of the public sector;
C.	A concerted effort will be made to relocate laid off employees within the framework of any new delivery system. Management will seek to involve the Union and any newly-created structure in a positive program for the hiring and possible retraining of any displaced employee;
D.	In cooperation with the Union, the agencies will aggressively search for any available program assistance for the purpose of job training and/or placement. The joint efforts of the Union and Management will closely examine all possible avenues for human resource assistance both in the public and private sectors.
41.03 Supervisors/Managerial Employees
The State will make every effort to reach the goal of supervisors doing supervisory work and non-supervisory work done by bargaining unit employees. The Employer and the Union will discuss any concerns about the ratio of supervisors to bargaining unit members.
41.04 Volunteers
Every effort will be made to avoid the elimination of a position or displacement of an employee due to the use of volunteers.
41.05 Contracting-In
A.	The Union will be granted a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that bargaining unit employees can competitively perform work which has been previously contracted out, including access to available information regarding costs and performance audits. In considering, the granting, renewal or continuation of competitively bid contracts for work normally performed by bargaining unit employees, to the extent feasible the Employer will examine information provided by the Union regarding whether or not such work
39
can be performed with greater efficiency, economy, programmatic benefit or other related factors through the use of bargaining unit employees rather than through renewal or continuation of the contract or initial contracting out of work.
B.	Within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this Agreement the State will furnish to the Union the State agency web site addresses that identify requests for proposals (RFPS) and invitation to bids (ITBS) for work it expects to contract out. The Union will receive additional State web sites within thirty (30) days of when they come on line.
C.	Within twenty (20) days of this Agreement the parties will agree to the establishment of one (1) agency pilot program that will explore agency and contracting practices and develop strategies for alternatives to contracting out. Pilots will explore the factors that motivate subcontracting, discuss future plans and develop joint strategies that will permit state employees to perform the work by meeting the agency service delivery needs.
ARTICLE 42	- GENERAL PROVISIONS
42.01 Orientation and Training
The Employer will continue to provide initial orientation/training programs. Except for emergencies, employees will complete their initial orientation/training program. Changes and improvements in initial orientation/training programs will be discussed in appropriate professional committees.
During initial orientation, a union representative shall be allowed reasonable time to orient new bargaining unit employees to the Union.
42.02 Polygraph Tests
No employee shall be required to take a polygraph, voice stress or psychological stress examination as a condition of retaining employment, nor shall an employee be subject to discipline for the refusal to take such a test.
42.03 Compensation for Damaged Personal Property
If the clothing or other personal property normally worn by a member of the bargaining unit is damaged or destroyed as the result of actions arising out of the member's performance of work, the Employer will make reasonable compensation to the member for the property, or repair the property, or clean the property.
The Employer will make reasonable efforts to compensate the employee within thirty (30) days of the filing of the claim.
42.04 Nursing Duties
In order to provide the necessary time to perform properly the duties of their job classification, registered nurses will not routinely be asked to assume responsibilities outside their classification. Housekeeping duties, clerical duties, and other duties which can be and normally are performed by para-professional employees shall not be required of the registered nurse, other than in irregular or unusual circumstances.
ARTICLE 43	- WAGES
43.0	1 Definitions of Rates of Pay
Class base is the minimum hourly rate of the pay range for the classification to which the employee is assigned.
Step rate is the specific value within the pay range to which the employee is assigned.
Base rate is the employee's step rate plus longevity adjustments.
Regular rate is the base rate (which includes longevity) plus all applicable supplements.
Total rate is the regular rate plus shift differential, where applicable.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if these definitions lead to any reduction in pay, the previous application shall apply.
43.0	2 Schedule of Wage Increases
Effective the pay period including July 1, 2003, there shall be no non-probationary step movements, including any step movement provided for in agency specific agreements. Step movement shall resume on the pay period including July 1, 2005. No retroactive movement shall occur for the two (2) years that have been skipped. Freezing of step movements shall not affect the performance evaluation schedule.

An employee of the Department of Mental Health, the Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, the Ohio Veterans' Home, and Schools for the Deaf and Blind, Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, and the Department of Youth Services who suffers bodily injury inflicted by an inmate, patient, resident, client, youth, offender or student in or during the scope of employment for the above agencies shall be eligible for his/her total rate of pay during the period he/she is disabled as a result of such injury but in no case to exceed nine hundred sixty (960) hours. This form of compensation shall be in the lieu of Workers' Compensation. The employee shall apply for Workers' Compensation lost time benefits while he/she is receiving Occupational Injury Leave (OIL). Workers' Compensation lost time benefits may be received, if awarded, by the employee after the OIL is exhausted. Employees who have been approved for
61
OIL and are then approved for Workers' Compensation lost time benefits for a psychological illness as a continuation of the same claim for bodily injury, and who have not been paid 960 hours of OIL, shall be permitted to supplement the Workers' Compensation Benefits with OIL up to 100% of the employee's total rate of pay, not to exceed 60 hours of OIL and with the total limit of 960 hours of OIL.
2.	Pay made regarding this leave shall not be charged to the employee's accumulation of sick leave credit.
3.	Employees who think they are eligible for this type of leave may apply to their agency designee within sixty (60) days of the incident giving rise to the injury unless physically unable to do so.
4.	A statement of circumstances of the injury shall be filed with the Director of Administrative Services by the employee's appointing authority. This statement shall show conclusively that the injury was sustained in the line of duty and was inflicted by an inmate, patient, resident, client, youth, offender or student and did not result from accident or from misbehavior or negligence on the part of the employee. A statement by the injured employee recounting the circumstances of the injury shall accompany the appointing authority's statement.
5.	The appointing authority may also obtain and file with the Director of Administrative Services the report of a physician designated by the Director of Administrative Services as to the nature and extent of the employee's injury.
6.	The employee shall be obligated to submit documentation from the attending physician indicating extent of the disability to receive necessary medical treatment and to return to active work status at the earliest time permitted by his/her attending physician. Where a medical question is at issue, the Employer shall obtain a medical opinion conducted by a physician of the specialty for which the employee is receiving treatment (in any), mutually agreed to by the State and the employee’s attending physician. The independent physician shall render a medical opinion within thirty days of the selection and the decision of the independent physician shall be binding.
7.	An employee on Occupational Injury Leave shall accrue sick leave and personal leave but shall not accrue vacation leave.
8.	If an employee's injury or disability as covered by the above guidelines extends beyond nine hundred sixty (960) hours he/she shall immediately become subject to the sick leave provision of this contract.
9.	An employee is disqualified from receipt of benefits if the employee engages in any occupation for wages or profit as defined in the appropriate Workers' Compensation statute. If such an employee has already received the benefits, then he/she must reimburse the State in the amount of the benefits received. The employee may be subject to disciplinary action for violation of this Article.
APPENDIX D - DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE POLICY
Section 1.	Statement of Policy
A.	Both the State and the Union desire a workplace that is free from the adverse effects of alcohol and other drugs. As such, both parties acknowledge that substance abuse is a serious and complex, yet treatable, condition/disease that adversely affects the productive, personal and family lives of employees. The parties further acknowledge that substance abuse may lead to safety and health risks in the workplace, for the abusers, their co-workers, and the public-at-large. Accordingly, the State and the Union pledge to work collaboratively in programs designed to reduce and eradicate the abuse of alcohol and drugs.
B.	The Union recognizes the need to address problems associated with having on-duty employees under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The Union also recognizes the State's obligations under the Federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 and other Federal laws and regulations concerning the controlling of substance abuse in the workplace. At the same time, the State recognizes employees' rights to privacy and other constitutionally guaranteed rights, as well as the due process and just cause obligations of this Agreement. Both parties agree that the emphasis of any drug-free workplace programs shall be to prevent and rehabilitate employees and to abate risks created by employees who are on duty in an impaired condition.
C.	The State will periodically provide information and training programs concerning the impact of alcohol and other drug use on job performance, as well as information concerning the State's Employee Assistance Program and any other resources that an employee or his/her family may contact for assistance in overcoming an alcohol and/or other drug problem. All bargaining unit employees shall be furnished with a copy of the Employer's drug-free workplace policies within thirty (30) days of initial employment with a state agency. Additionally, each employee will similarly be provided with a written description of the Employer's drug testing policy, including the procedures under which a test may be ordered, procedures for obtaining samples for testing, how testing will be conducted and reported to the Employer and employees; and the potential consequences of refusing to submit to testing or of positive test results. In addition,
62
managers and supervisors shall be provided training about the Drug-Free Workplace Policy and alcohol and the drug-testing program in order to ensure that the policy and program are administered consistently, fairly, and within appropriate Constitutional parameters.
Training will be provided to all covered employees prior to implementation based upon agreement of the parties, joint training by the parties can be provided on an Agency basis. New employees who are covered will be provided notice and training prior to testing. Testing for new classifications listed in Article 49 and Section 7 of this article shall not be implemented until January 1, 2001.
D.	Any employees suffering from a substance abuse problem shall receive the same careful consideration and offer of treatment that is presently extended under the State's existing benefit plans to those employees having other mental health and substance abuse conditions, as well as under the Employee Assistance Plan established under Article 20 of this Agreement. The same benefits and insurance coverages that are provided for all other illnesses, diseases, and/or physical or psychological conditions, under the State's established health insurance benefit plan, shall be available for individuals who accept medically approved treatment of alcoholism or drug dependency.
E.	An employee's refusal to accept referral for diagnosis or to follow the prescribed treatment will be handled in accordance with other policies relating to job performance, subject to the contractual grievance/arbitration procedures and other provisions of this Agreement. No person with a substance abuse problem shall have his/her job security or promotional opportunities jeopardized by a request for diagnosis and/or treatment. Continued unacceptable job performance, attendance, and/or behavioral problems will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
F.	The confidential nature of the medical records of employees with substance abuse problems shall be maintained pursuant to both Ohio and Federal laws. Similarly, all records relating to drug tests and their results shall be maintained in accordance with Ohio and Federal laws.
G.	All Department heads, managers, and supervisors are responsible for adherence to, and implementation, enforcement, and monitoring of, this policy.
Section 2.	Drug-Testing Conditions
A.	State Testing
1.	Reasonable Suspicion
Employees covered by this Agreement may be required to submit a urine specimen for testing for the presence of drugs or a breath sample for the testing of the presence of alcohol:
Where there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee, when appearing for duty or on the job, is under the influence of, or his/her job performance, is impaired by alcohol or other drugs. Such reasonable suspicion must be based upon objective facts or specific circumstances found to exist that present a reasonable basis to believe that an employee is under the influence of, or is using or abusing, alcohol or drugs. Examples of reasonable suspicion shall include, but are not limited to, slurred speech, disorientation, abnormal conduct or behavior, or involvement in an on-the-job accident resulting in disabling personal injury requiring immediate hospitalization of any person or property damage in excess of $2,000, where the circumstances raise a reasonable suspicion concerning the existence of alcohol or other drug use or abuse by the employee. In addition, such reasonable suspicion must be documented in writing and supported by two witnesses, including the person having such suspicion. The immediate supervisor shall be contacted to confirm a test is warranted based upon the circumstances. Such written documentation must be presented to the employee and the department head, who shall maintain such report in the strictest confidence, except that a copy shall be released to any person designated by the affected employee.
2.	Random Testing
Employees who have direct contact with inmates, youths, or parolees in the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction and Department of Youth Services or others who are under the supervision or jurisdiction of these agencies shall be subject to random drug testing.
B.	Federal Testing
Employees who are required to be tested pursuant to Federal laws and/or Federal regulations shall be tested in accordance with those laws and regulations.
Section 3.	Testing Procedures and Guarantees
A.	State Testing

Travel
As a result of agency-specific negotiations between the Ohio Department of Health and District 1199, the State of Ohio and District 1199/SEIU, the parties agree to the following:
9.	With the exception of the substitution of the “30 minute/30 minute” standard for the “twenty mile” standard contained in Article 21, business travel of “non-frequent traveler” designated 1199 employees shall be governed by the existing language in Article 21. Travel time to the office shall not be work time and no mileage shall be paid. Travel to a work location other than the assigned office, will be considered work time except for the first and last 30 minutes. However, if the actual travel time to a work site or the normal travel time to the assigned office is less than 30 minutes, only the time spent in travel to the site or the normal travel time to the office, whichever is less, shall not count as work time, however, actual mileage shall be paid.
10.	All 1199 employees are designated as non-frequent travelers unless otherwise designated in writing by the appropriate management designee.
11.	A “frequent traveler” is an 1199 employee who on a regular, routine and predictable basis spends 80 percent or more of work hours per pay period in a travel status where an overnight stay would be reimbursable, if authorized.
12.	For those 1199 employees who have been designated a “frequent traveler,” the following shall apply: A.All mileage traveled in connection with official business shall be reimbursed.
B.	Frequent travelers shall have their residences designated as their headquarters for travel reimbursement purposes (for all other purposes, e.g. layoff, headquarters shall remain the office).
C.	Travel to any work location, including the assigned office, will be considered work time except for the first and last 30 minutes. However, if the actual travel time to a work site or the office is less than 30 minutes, only the time spent in travel to the site or the office shall not count as work time.
D.	When a frequent traveler is required to travel in state more than 65 miles one way from his/her residence, and is required to report at a worksite or vicinity work sites for two (2) or more consecutive days, they may be required to stay overnight and may receive the current contract rates for reimbursement of actual expenses. When such assignment requires the employee to stay overnight for three (3) or more consecutive nights, they may choose to commute from the worksite
68
to their residence one (1) time instead of staying over one of the three or more nights required by the assignment. This one commute trip shall be considered paid work time (less 30 minutes each way) and mileage shall be reimbursed consistent with this MOU. If the employee chooses to commute during assignments which require two (2) or less overnight stays, no travel time will be paid, however, actual mileage shall be reimbursed, but no more than $85 per round trip. Also, employees who choose to commute more than once during an assignment requiring three (3) or more consecutive overnight stays shall not be reimbursed for any additional time or mileage except the one round trip mentioned above.
13.	Designation of traveler status can be changed by management:
A.	From “frequent traveler” status to “non-frequent traveler” status with written notice issued at least one pay period (14 days) in advance of the effective date of change in status.
B.	From “non-frequent traveler” status to “frequent traveler” status with written notice to be effective the current or future pay periods.
C.	There will be no retroactive status change nor will the agency pay any back benefits expenses beyond the current pay period.

14.	Steps 2 and 3 will be combined and referred to as “Combined Step 2/3”.
15.	All grievances, including Step 1, shall be filed in writing with the Labor Relations Unit. The supervisor will then contact the employee and arrange to meet and discuss the grievance. The grievant has seven (7) days from the date of the supervisor’s response or the last date the supervisor should have responded at Step 1 to appeal to Combined Step 2/3.
16.	At combined Step 2/3, the Agency Designee will arrange to meet and discuss the grievance within fourteen (14) days of appeal of the Step 1 response. The Agency Designee will then respond in writing within fifteen (15) days of the meeting. This response will serve as the final response from the agency.
17.	It is agreed that all other provisions of Step 3, except time frame changes above, continue to apply.
Hours of Work and Overtime
Article 24 (Hours of Work and Overtime) shall be followed except for the following modification:
18.	In the Division of Quality Assurance, unscheduled assignments sometimes referred to as “two day complaints”(those requiring department action within two days), will be assigned as overtime opportunities as follows:
A.	The facility itself shall constitute the worksite. The assignment shall be offered to the qualified, most-senior employee(s) within a 50 mile radius of the worksite within the respective district involved. If no senior employee(s) accept(s) the assignment, the least senior surveyor(s) qualified may be required to perform the complaint survey. If no assignment can be made or completely satisfied with the above procedures, other district surveyors will be offered or ordered based on seniority of those qualified.
B.	The parties shall review this procedure as needed.
DEPARTMENT OF JOB AND FAMILY SERVICES
A.	Prior Service Credit
An employee who transfers directly from an Ohio County Department of Job and Family Services to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services will have his/her service time with that County Department of Job and Family Services credited for determining the rate of accrual of vacation leave.
An employee who was hired by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services after August 3, 1997, and who experienced a break in service of less than thirty (30) days from the date of termination of employment with an Ohio County Department of Job and Family Services, and then started employment with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, shall be credited with service from the County Department of Job and Family Services for the purpose of determining the rate of accrual of vacation leave. Such accrual shall not be retroactive.
For the purpose of this Agreement a County Department of Job and Family Services is defined to include the County Public Children Services Agency (PCSA) and County Child Support Enforcement Agency (CSEA) or any division of a county government which now or in the future provides the core services normally provided by PCSA or CSEA regardless of the actual title of that division. This definition applies whether or not such agencies are considered by the commissioners of a particular County to be part of that County’s Department of Job and Family Services.
69
The transferred employee must submit proof of prior service with the Ohio County Department of Job and Family Services to the agency designee no more than thirty (30) days after commencing employment with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.
Such service credit shall apply only to the computation of the rate of vacation accrual.
B.	Temporary And Permanent Relocations
Due to shifts and changes in operational need, scope and/or mission of the agency, the Employer retains the right to determine which vacancies to fill by either permanent transfer or promotion, lateral transfer, or demotion. The Employer has the right to move employees and positions through relocations pursuant to Article 24.18 and this Memorandum of Understanding. Changes in work assignments within the same program area are not relocations as defined by this Memorandum of Understanding.
The Employer maintains the right to temporarily relocate an employee(s) and his/her position to another location whether within the same headquarter county or another county using the provisions of Section 24.18; and to permanently relocate an employee(s) and his/her position in excess of nine (9) months, to another location whether within the same headquarter county or another county using the following method:
The Employer will identify the area(s) deemed to be in excess and need and/or any other circumstance that would cause a temporary or permanent relocation and will notify the Union as soon as practicable. In the notification the Employer will explain the rationale for the relocation, a tentative schedule for relocation of employees and job duties required in the area of need. A draft organizational plan will be provided at the time of the proposed relocation, if not complete at that time, it will be provided within thirty (30) days of the employee(s) being relocated. The Employer will schedule a meeting with the Union to discuss the reason(s) for such action. The Union’s comments and ideas will be seriously considered.
Where the permanent relocation would require that any or all employees be headquartered more than fifty (50) miles farther from their residence than their present headquarters, the Employer shall provide the information concerning the relocation at least one hundred-ten (110) days prior to the anticipated date of the relocation. The Employer will meet with the Union at least one hundred (100) days prior to the anticipated date of the relocation. The Union’s comments and ideas will be seriously considered. The Employer shall notify the affected employee(s) at least ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the relocation. Failure of the Union to meet and/or provide comments and ideas within the specified time frames shall not affect the effective date of the relocation. The determination of an excess/need is a management right per Article 5 and is non-grievable and shall not be used to dispute the rationale for job abolishments and/or layoffs in Article 29. However, the determination of excess and/or any other circumstance that would cause a temporary or permanent relocation may be grieved where no layoffs are proposed.
Permanent relocations shall function as follows:
1.	Where entire work units, sections, bureaus or offices are being relocated, notification is all that is required and no canvass will be done.
2.	Where not all employees of the same classification in work units, sections, bureaus or offices are being relocated, the Employer shall canvass the area(s) of excess for volunteers to move to the area of need. This canvass shall be accomplished by notification to the affected employees of four (4) agency working days or a time period mutually agreed upon by the Employer and the union.
3.	The Employer shall relocate the volunteer who is qualified for the position and has the most seniority.
4.	If there are no volunteers in the area(s) of excess, the Employer may relocate the employee with the least seniority who is qualified for the position to the area of need.
5.	In case of involuntary relocation, the employee has a preferential right to return to the previous job site from which he/she was relocated up to two (2) years, provided that there is a need for a posted vacancy in the same classification as the relocated employee.
The permanently relocated employee shall be relocated to perform duties appropriate to the same classification which he/she holds. Such relocation(s) do not constitute the creation and filing of a vacancy pursuant to Article 30, except that where an excess and/or any other circumstance that would cause a temporary or permanent relocation and has been determined as the result of the granting or settlement of a grievance, to have been arbitrary or capricious and solely for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of Article 30, an appropriate remedy may be the awarding of a promotion with the grievant(s) to be made whole
70
C.	Sub-Contracting Group
Pursuant to Article 41.05, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services agrees to be the referenced agency pilot program by utilizing the sub-contracting group. It will remain composed of six (6) individuals (three (3) each from union and management from which one (1) co-chair from each party shall be appointed). The sub-contracting group will explore agency and contracting practices and develop strategies for alternatives to contracting out. It will also explore the factors that motivate subcontracting, discuss future plans and develop joint strategies that will permit state employees to perform the work by meeting the agency service delivery needs. The sub-contracting group will periodically report their views to the APC.
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH
I.	C.S.N. Training
Training shall be developed on the local level. Each C.S.N. shall develop training that is designed to reflect the particular needs of that area. This will be developed with input from representatives of 1199. This may be done in conjunction with other unions.
It is the responsibility of the Employer to ensure that each employee has the opportunity to participate in the offered training.
Emp loyees who do not successfully complete offered training before the end of their probationary period or trial period (depending on which is applicable) they may be terminated from that program, either probationary removal or if applicable return to the hospital. In case of return to the hospital, a meeting will be held with the employee and union to discuss the return.
Successful completion is determined by the programmatic needs of the C.S.N. as established by the Employer with input regarding the process and criteria from the Union.
II.	Bumping Process In Mental Health
This Agency Specific Agreement supercedes Article 29.02C-Bumping Procedure. All other sections of Article 29 continue to apply unless specifically listed in this agreement.
For the purpose of this agreement for section 29.01, The Department shall only notify the employee(s) who will be initially laid off prior to the exercising of their bumping right(s) and the least senior employee who will be bumped at the site selected by the original laid off employee.
Bumping Process:
Once an employee has been notified that their position will be laid off per Article 29.01 and 29.02 A&B, the employee has four options available to them.
First, they may choose to accept the layoff.
Second, the employee may choose to bump or accept a vacant position either at the hospital site or the geographic bumping jurisdiction provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the position.
Third, they may choose to bump within the hospital site.
Fourth, they may choose to bump within the geographic bumping jurisdiction.
If the employee chooses to take the layoff, then that employee is placed on the recall list per Article 29.03.
If the employee chooses to bump into a vacant position in the hospital site or the geographic bumping jurisdiction, then they will have exhausted all of their rights to bump and there will be no further bumping or notification.
If the employee chooses to bump within the hospital site, then the employee must bump the least senior employee in their classification series using the same and similar roster.
If the employee chooses to bump in the geographic bumping jurisdiction, the employee shall choose one site for which they wish to bump. Once the site is selected, the employee shall bump the least senior employee in that classification series using the same and similar roster.
As stated above, only the employee who was initially laid off and the least senior at the site for which the original laid off person chooses, shall be notified of the layoff.
Within five days of receipt of the notice the laid off employee may give notice to bump in accordance with this Agreement. If the employee fails to notify his/her supervisor within that five day period he/she wishes to exercise his/her bumping rights, he/she shall have no further bumping rights.
An employee who has bumped in accordance with this Agreement, shall have the right, within five days, to bump the least senior employee according to the provisions of this Agreement. Should the employee fail to exercise his/her bumping rights within a five day period, he/she have no further bumping rights.
71
The entire bumping process shall be completed within the first 30 days of this ninety (90) day period. The parties may mutually agree to modify these timeframes.
After the laid off employee selects options 2-4 and the bumping is completed, the site will conduct a canvass to properly distribute the staff by seniority.
The geographical bumping jurisdiction is included in Appendix B
In the case of the closure of a C.S.N. program, the notice to employees shall be (30) thirty-days due to the lack of work and funds for the program.
III.	Bumping Into C.S.N.
Employees in the Department of Mental Health have the right to bump "within the hospital" in accordance with Article 29 of this agreement. However, if the employee chooses not to bump within the hospital or cannot bump another employee in the hospital, the following provisions apply and supersede any conflicting provision(s)/section(s) of Article 29 as well as past practices.
Section 1.
In the case of layoff(s), employees shall first have only the right to bump into vacant positions in either newly created C.S.N. program(s) or vacant position(s) in an existing C.S.N. program(s) as long as the position is in an equal or lower position in the same or similar related classification series per Article 29 and provided that the affected employee is qualified and proficient to perform the duties. In no case shall the bump be to a position in a higher classification or to higher pay or one that constitutes a promotion. If these vacancy bumping opportunities exist, employees shall make their bumping selection to such a position first, beginning with the most senior and progressing to the least senior. If the employee does not or fails to select a bump to such a vacancy, the employee will have exhausted all of their bumping rights under Article 29 of the contract and will be laid off.
In situations where the number of employees to be laid off exceed the number of C.S.N. positions created at the time of the layoff, then the most senior employee(s) targeted for layoff will have the right to choose between available vacant C.S.N. positions or bumping existing occupied C.S.N. positions who are less senior. The less senior of the targeted employees for layoff must bump into the vacant C.S.N. positions available or they have exhausted their bumping rights.
Employees retain the right to accept the proposed layoff.
Section 2.
In the case where the Department was unable to create C.S.N. positions:
Employees have the right to bump into existing C.S.N. program(s)/position(s) in the same manner as stated in Article 29, provided they have successfully passed and completed the C.S.N. training and meet and are proficient in the duties of the positions for which they wish to bump. As stated earlier, the Medical Director in conjunction with the C.S.N. Director may waive any or all of the training requirements on an individual basis.
IV	C.S.N. Holiday Observance
Those employees that work in the Community Support Network (C.S.N.) may have the observance of any one of the following holidays changed based on the observance by another Mental Health Board, Agency, or another entity. The holidays are:
1.	Presidents’ Day
2.	Columbus Day
3.	Veterans’ Day
These employees will still maintain the same number of holidays in the collective bargaining agreement, however they may be observed on alternative days. These alternatives dates shall be determined in advance and employees shall have prior notice. If another alternative holiday observance is requested, the local delegate will be notified as soon as possible. The observance of these alternative days shall be an appropriate topic for the hospital professional committee. Any additional alternative observances shall be by mutual agreement.
V.	C.S.N. Report-In/Work Location Closure
Due to numerous unforeseen as well as foreseen reasons, an individual C.S.N. program site may be closed. If that situation occurs, the following are options that both Management and the C.S.N. employee may jointly agree to use. These options shall be spelled out in advance so when the situation occurs, there will be some level of predictability. All of these options must have prior approval by the program supervisor.
Options
1.	The employee may take appropriate leave for the day.
72
2.	If appropriate to the program, the employee may reschedule the day for another day during that week only.
3.	The employee may report to an alternative site that is approved by their supervisor. They must call in and notify the supervisor of the alternative site option. They may then perform C.S.N. related work such as Contact Logs and phone contacts to clients. The employee may use a combination of work at an alternative site and leave time to fill the day schedule.
4.	The employee may report to an alternative site and perform duties that they are qualified to perform on a unit. This must also be approved in advance by the C.S.N. supervisor and the alternative site administrator.
5.	Any other arrangement that can be mutually agreed to locally as long as it does not violate the collective bargaining agreement, ODMH policy, and/or State or Federal law.
If any of these options are used, the goal is to facilitate the least disruption of the program as well as maintaining services to the client as prescribed by the individual C.S.N. program. Accountability must be built in to any one of the options that are utilized. If one of the options are approved but later becomes problematic, the C.S.N. supervisor shall notify the employee as soon as possible identifying that option as no longer available.
Each C.S.N. supervisor shall meet and discuss these options as soon as possible so that employees will understand the options available to them. Each C.S.N. program option(s) will be reduced to writing. Any problems will be taken to the agency C.S.N. problem solving group.
VI.	Memorandum Of Understanding
This Memorandum of Understanding shall supersede all conflicting Articles, sections and practices of the collective bargaining agreement.
1.	All employees entering a C.S.N. position from the hospital will serve a trial period of one-hundred and eighty (180) days. During the trial period, the employee may return to the same classification they held before the move to C.S.N. This return may be for any reason and shall only be at either the employee or the Employer’s request. In either case, the return to the previously held classification is not grievable. The requested return shall only be applicable during the 180-day trial period. The employee may appeal the Employer initiated return to the hospital, by making a request in writing to the CEO and a copy to the C.S.N. Director. A meeting shall then be held to discuss the reasons for the return to the hospital. In the case of an employee initiated return, the above mentioned parties shall also meet to discuss the reasons for a return to the hospital. Problems and issues shall be reviewed with the intent to resolve them prior to an employee returning from a C.S.N. during the trial period. If the employee so desires, a union delegate shall be present at the meeting.
There shall be no step or pay increase due an employee as a result of the employee completing the trial period.
After the trial period is over, the employee can only leave the C.S.N. position by Article 30, Vacancies, or Article 29, Layoffs, or as described in this Memorandum of Understanding.
2.	Prior to the recall of laid-off employees to C.S.N. positions, employees who are currently working in the hospital will have the right to the position first. All positions that the hospital intends to fill will be posted for internal fill first. If no current employee bids on the position, then only laid-off employees from the hospital who have had C.S.N. training have the right to recall.
3.	If C.S.N. positions are to be laid off, the affected employees have bumping rights to less senior employees in the following order:
a.) first within their present C.S.N. program;
b.) within other C.S.N. programs operated by that hospital;
c.) back within the hospital;
d.) to another hospital only within the bumping geographic jurisdiction.
4.	Any or all of these bumping rights may be changed by mutual agreement of the parties. The parties may mutually place employees into vacant positions that they would not normally have a right to fill in the case of a layoff, provided the employee is qualified for the position.
VII.	Overtime Process & Procedure
Procedure:
It is solely a Management Right to make the determination when overtime is necessary. Prior to making that determination, Management may use “established term irregular” or part time employees to fill in for staff while off work instead of declaring an overtime situation. Management may also determine that there is no need to add additional staff, based on a number of factors, when an employee is off work. The
73
following applies once Management has determined there is a need for overtime and is within the criteria established by Article 24.03.
STEP 1: Once a need for overtime has been determined, Management shall offer the opportunity to the qualified employees on duty on the current shift by seniority on a rotating basis. If an employee accepts the opportunity, a “red line” is drawn below that name so when the next opportunity arises, the next less senior person shall be offered the opportunity.
STEP 2: If no employee accepts the offer, then Management will canvass the voluntary overtime roster starting with the most senior employee and calling each less senior employee until they have either gotten a qualified employee to accept the offer or until the entire voluntary or alternative rosters have been exhausted. ***(Note that those employees in Step 2 need not be re-canvassed after they have already been asked or called in the above steps).
STEP 3: If no employee accepts the offer from Step 2, Management can mandate overtime and shall mandate the least senior qualified employee currently working on the shift that day. The least senior employee shall be mandated on a rotating basis. Once an employee is mandated, a “red line” is drawn at their name. When the next situation of mandated overtime occurs, the person next most senior to the last person mandated shall be mandated irrespective of the number of hours the previous person was mandated. No employee shall be mandated from home.*(There may be an exception in the case of Summit Child and Family Services or in the case of emergencies.) Management will make a good faith effort to avoid or reduce the necessity for mandated overtime.
Definitions:
1.	Work site - is each individual Campus and each individual C.S.N. program
2.	Rotating basis - The sequential movement either by the most senior or least senior employee to the next until the overtime opportunity is accepted or assigned. In the case of voluntary overtime the movement is from the most senior to the less senior volunteer. In the case of mandated overtime, the movement is from the least senior to the more senior. In both cases the rotation moves throughout the entire roster in an attempt to secure an employee to either accept the opportunity or mandate an employee.
Once an overtime opportunity is accepted or an employee is mandated, the employee’s name is “red lined” and the next opportunity or assignment goes to the next employee based on seniority. For voluntary overtime, the next opportunity will go to the next less senior employee after the “red line”. In the case of mandated overtime, the next person to be mandated will be the next more senior employee after the red line. Once an employee is mandated regardless of the number of hours worked, the next assignment goes up the roster to the next more senior qualified employee after the “red line”.
3.	Established Term Irregular Appointment Type (ETI) - This appointment type is eligible for voluntary and mandated overtime when the employee is assigned to replace a forty-hour (40) employee on extended leave such as disability, workers comp. O.I.L., or extended union leave. The ETI employee does not have seniority in this appointment type and thus is placed at the end of the overtime or alternative rosters based on the date of the full time assignment.
4.	Part Time Employees - may be required to work more hours than they are normally scheduled. They may volunteer to work more hours than scheduled up to forty hours (40). In order for a part time employee to work more than forty hours, the voluntary overtime roster must be called and exhausted.
5.	Pre-Scheduled Overtime - is an optional method to schedule overtime where the need is foreseeable. If pre-scheduling overtime is used at a particular location, the following guidelines shall apply:
•	Post opportunities in advance
•	Award the opportunity in the same procedure as identified in this agreement above
•	Employees interested in the opportunity must sign up during the posting period.
•	The posting period shall be decided locally.
•	Once an employee is awarded and has accepted an overtime opportunity, it is considered as if it is a regularly scheduled day. Failure to work the scheduled day may subject the employee to disciplinary action or deduction of personal or vacation leave in the amount of the overtime opportunity. Such deductions may be unilaterally deducted notwithstanding the provisions of Article 8.
6.	Overtime Cap - An employee may not work more than sixteen (16) hours in a day nor more than two (2) sixteen (16) hour days in a row.
7.	Qualified Employee - an employee who by virtue of their classification has the ability, skills, and license to perform the work on a regular basis and who can also perform the work when needed on an overtime basis.
74
Local Options:
All local agreements including the following options shall be reduced to writing and signed by both the Union and Management with a copy sent to the respective central offices.
Alternative list - is a list of additional employees who meet the qualified employee definition and may be used to work voluntary or mandated overtime. These may be classifications that have worked overtime based on practice or it may be other employees from other sister work sites such as Summit Behavioral and SBH Child and Family Services, or the Northfield and Cleveland campuses of NBHS.
C.S.N. Overtime - employees from different work sites may be eligible to work overtime in another site in the same Behavioral Healthcare Organization (BHO). For example, an employee in a C.S.N. program may work overtime at one of the BHO sites upon mutual agreement. Additionally the reverse may be true where an employee inside the hospital at a BHO may be eligible to work overtime at one of the C.S.N. sites or work overtime from one C.S.N. site to another.
Alternative schedules - if mutually agreed by the local union and management, employees may be eligible to work alternative hours and schedules if it is beneficial to the employee and the BHO. If there is agreement to work an alternative schedule or hours, the local site must discuss and develop a method of coverage for overtime when utilizing these types of schedules.
Shift/Day Trades - If agreed to locally by both labor and management, it is appropriate to permit shift/day trades between employees. If this is selected as an option at a particular BHO, the following conditions must be part of any program to trade:
•	The trade must be initiated by employees
•	Both employees must sign a shift/day trade form in advance
•	It must be approved by a nursing supervisor designated at the BHO
•	No trade may cause overtime for either employee unless specifically noted in advance and approved in advance
•	The trading employees must work the entire shift for which the trade is intended
•	Locally it must be decided how long in advance the request must be made
•	The trade may only be with and among qualified bargaining units members in the same union
•	Denial of a shift/day trade is not grievable. Issues and concerns regarding shift/day trades are appropriate topics for the local A.P.C’s.
General Provisions:
The parties will jointly develop a form to document and administer the overtime calling procedure. A uniform system for recording responses will be followed.
The parties agree to develop a form to be used when a BHO has agreed to use shift/day trades.
The parties agree to do a one-time joint labor and management training at each BHO campus on the overtime process and procedure.
Employees who are working an overtime shift on their day off may not be mandated.
Within 120 days of the effective date of the Agreement the parties agree to form a committee to formulate a policy to address working alone situations pursuant to Article 32.11.
VIII.	Vacation Approval Process
1.	Each ODMH facility will conduct a semi-annual canvass to determine the awarding of vacation requests for each calendar year.
2.	Requests for vacation scheduling will be distributed by January 2 and by July 1 of each year. Employees must return the requests on or before February 1 and August 1 respectively. Requests made in January will be considered for the six-month period beginning March 1 through August 31. Requests made in August will be considered for September 1 through February 28 of the following year.
3.	Vacations will be awarded based on state seniority by shift. Ties in state seniority shall be broken in ascending numeric order of the last four digits of the employee’s social security number, with the lowest number being the most senior.
4.	Available vacations opportunities will be determined by classification per shift. The number of available vacation opportunities will be posted.
5.	Employees may request a minimum of one (1) day up to a maximum of his/her annual accrual. For example, if an employee accrues four (4) weeks annually and requests and receives approval for all four weeks in the first canvass, that employee would not be eligible to submit a vacation request in the second (August) canvass. 6.
75
6.	Vacation can be requested at other times outside the canvass periods. Those requests will be approved based on a first come, first served basis per shift. More senior employees cannot bump a less senior employee’s approved vacation
7.	Employees off work due to a long term leave such as Workers’ Compensation, O.I.L. or Disabiity, or other approved long term leave, will make his/her selections for vacation in that canvass period upon their return to work.
8.	Once a vacation has been approved, a more senior employee cannot change his/her selection choice(s) and bump another less senior employee.
9.	Thirty (30) days prior to the approved vacation request, the employee will submit a Request for Leave Form (ADM 4258).
Employees must have the appropriate number of hours either already accrued or be able to accrue the number of hours requested prior to the date of the vacation. This applies to both the semi-annual canvass and to other vacation requests identified in #6 above.

If an individual believes they have been harmed by this process they have the right to grieve through Step 3. During the life of this agreement the Agency Professional Committee will investigate and make recommendations to expedite the bidding process.

It is the intent of RSC to actively recruit for VRCs. The VRAC will not be used to reduce the need for VRC’s. The VRAC will attend classes to earn the appropriate Masters degree so that at the completion of the Masters degree the individual can be assigned VRC duties.

The specific requirements for the various positions and reassignments are outlined throughout this Memorandum of Understanding. The date of reassignment is effective when the individual achieves the final requirement of those listed. If the final requirement is a graduate degree then the date of reassignment will be the date the degree is conferred.

With continued acceptable job performance, the VRAC will receive step increases per contractual provisions. During the probationary period, the VRAC will be expected to attend classes to obtain a Masters degree in an appropriate Masters Degree program. RSC will pay associated costs and provide release time up to ten (10)_hours per week for the VRAC to obtain the degree.
