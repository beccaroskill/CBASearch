relationship between the Union and the Employer, to promote efficiency and service, and to set forth herein the basic agreements covering rates of pay, hours of work, and conditions of employment.
ARTICLE II
UNION SECURITY
2.1	Coverage
The Union shall be the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees except Store Managers, meat department employees, and demonstrators in the stores of the Employer within Local 1059's jurisdiction, as well as the Counties of Champaign and Logan (Local 1099) in the State of Ohio.
This Agreement shall not apply to any stores outside of Franklin County that are opened after June 1, 1985, which are not replacement stores or a store opened within one (1) year after an existing store in that particular city has been closed and no other store exists in that city.
2.2	Union Shop
It shall be a condition of employment that all employees of the Employer covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the execution date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing, and those who are not members on the execution date of this Agreement shall, on the thirty- first (31st) day following the execution date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing in the Union. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its execution date shall, on the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.
For the purpose of this Article, the execution date of this Agreement shall be considered its effective date.
Upon written request by an authorized representative of the Union, the Employer agrees to separate from employment any employee within five (5) working days after notification by the Union that such employee has failed to comply with this Article II, Section 2.2, limited only by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended.
2.3	Checkoff
The Employer agrees to deduct union dues/service fees and initiation fees and uniform assessments from the wages of employees in the bargaining unit who provide the Employer with a voluntary, written authorization, which shall not be irrevocable

7/20/01
Kroger_Food_2000_html
Page 10 of 79
for a period of more than one (1) year, or beyond the termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs sooner. Such deductions will be made by the Employer from the weekly wages of employees, mutually agreed between the Employer and the Union, and transmitted to the Union by the tenth (10th) of the following month.
-1-
2.4	In the event no wages are then due the employee, or are insufficient to cover the required deduction, the deduction for such week shall, nevertheless, be made from the first wages of adequate amount next due the employee, and thereupon transmitted to the Union.
2.5	Active Ballot Club
The Employer agrees to transmit to the Local Union contribution deductions to the UFCW Active Ballot Club from employees who are Union members and who sign deduction authorization cards. The deductions shall be in the amount specified on the political contribution deduction authorization card and transmitted to the Union by the tenth (10th) of the following month.
2.6	Employee Information
The Employer shall provide the Union a list of new employees (including manager trainees) weekly showing employee's name, residence address, social security number, birth date, store number and date of employment. The Union will also be advised when an employee is transferred from one Local Union to another Local Union. The Employer also agrees to notify the Union of layoffs, leaves of absence, permanent transfers, promotions and terminations on a weekly basis.
2.7	The Store Manager shall notify the Union Steward of all new hires within forty-eight (48) hours of their starting time.
2.8	The Employer will also provide every three (3) months (January, April, July and October) in each store, with a copy to the Union, a list of all employees employed in the store with the job titles and seniority date. Such list shall be made available to the employees upon request.
2.9	Probationary Employees
The Employer may secure new employees from any source whatsoever. During the first sixty (60) days of employment, a new employee shall be on a trial basis and may be discharged at

Page 11 of 79
the discretion of the Employer.
2.10	Other Agreements
The Employer (any member of management) agrees not to enter into any agreement or contract with employees, individually or collectively, which in any way conflicts with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
2.11	Union Visitation

2.14	Shop Steward
The Union shall have the right to designate a shop steward and alternate Night Steward for each store. The shop steward shall act for the Union in signing up employees for Union membership and in explaining the functions of the Union to employees. The shop steward shall be the last employee to be laid off or reduced in hours in his classification in his store. The Union agrees to furnish the Employer a list of shop stewards and any necessary revisions of this list due to changes.
-2-
The Shop Steward shall receive one (1) day off each year, with pay by the Employer, to attend the Local Union Shop Seminar.
ARTICLE III
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The management of the business and the direction of the working forces, including the right to plan, direct and control store operations, hire, suspend, or discharge for proper cause, transfer

or relieve employees from duty because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons, the right to study or introduce new or improved production methods or facilities, and the right to establish and maintain rules and regulations covering the operation of the stores, a violation of which shall be among the causes for discharge, are vested in the Employer; provided, however, that this right shall be exercised with due regard for the rights of the employees, and provided further that it will not be used for the purpose of discrimination against any employee or for the purpose of invalidating any contract provision.
A current copy of store rules and regulations shall be submitted to the Union prior to implementation.
ARTICLE IV
DISPUTE PROCEDURE
4.1	Grievances must be taken up promptly and no grievance will be considered or discussed which is presented later than ten (10) calendar days after such has happened, except a grievance arising from an error in wage payment to the employee may be presented within two (2) years. A wage payment error is defined as an error in the employee’s basic hourly rate, overtime payments or any premium payment.
4.2	Handling Grievances
Should any differences, disputes or complaints arise over the interpretation or application of the contents of this Agreement, such disputes, disagreements or complaints shall be reduced to writing and there shall be an earnest effort on the part of both parties to settle promptly through the following steps:
Step 1. By a conference between the aggrieved employee and/or the shop steward and/or the authorized Union representative and the Manager of the Store. If this step does not settle the grievance and the employee and/or the Union wishes to take it to Step 2, it shall be referred within ten (10) calendar days to Step 2.
Step 2. By conference between the Union representative and the Zone Manager. Such conference shall take place within fourteen (14) calendar days. If this step does not settle the grievance and the Union wishes to take it to Step 3, it shall be referred within ten (10) calendar days to Step 3.
Step 3. By conference between an official or officials of the Union and the KMA President, a representative or representatives of the Employer delegated by the KMA President, or both. Such conference shall be scheduled within ten (10) calendar days of notification to the employer.
Step 4. In the event the last step fails to settle the grievance, the Union, if it desires to submit the grievance to arbitration, shall so notify the Employer within ten (10) calendar days after

7/20/01
Kroger_Food_2000_html
Page 13 of 79
completion of Step 3.
4.3	No grievance will be discussed unless the outlined procedure has been followed except that the parties, by mutual agreement, may waive a step or steps of the grievance procedure. Furthermore, the above time limits may be extended by the mutual agreement of the parties.
The parties agree that grievances may arise of a general nature affecting or tending to affect several employees, and that such grievances may be initiated at any of the above steps deemed appropriate by the parties.
When the Union Executive Board upholds a grievance in the union appeals process, the company shall consider such grievance timely under the grievance procedure provided it is within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the drop date.
4.4	Discussions between employees and representatives of the Union, including the Shop Steward, or among themselves concerning grievances, may take place during working hours, within reason, in order to settle grievances promptly.
4.5	Discharge
The Employer may, at any time, discharge any worker for proper cause. The Employer shall notify the Union of an employee's discharge in writing within five (5) calendar days after the discharge, giving the reasons thereof. The Union, if it wishes to contest the discharge, shall file a written complaint with the Employer within ten (10) calendar days following the postmarking date of the notice of discharge, asserting that the discharge was improper. Such complaint must be taken up promptly and if the Employer and the Union fail to agree within ten (10) calendar days, it shall be referred within four (4) calendar days to Arbitration. Should the Arbitrator determine that it was an unfair discharge, the Employer will reinstate the employee in accordance with the findings of the Arbitrator.
4.6	Arbitration
The parties to this Agreement shall request the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to furnish a panel of seven (7) arbitrators from which the Arbitrator shall be chosen, within fifteen (15) days from date of the receipt of the panel, by the alternate striking of names. The fifteen (15) days limit for the selection of the Arbitrator and/or the date of the hearing may be

extended and/or changed by mutual agreement of the two parties. The Employer and the Union shall decide who will strike first by flipping a coin. The Arbitrator shall not be vested with the power to change, modify or alter this Agreement but only to interpret the provisions of the Agreement. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be binding on both parties. The expenses of the Arbitrator shall be paid for jointly.
4.7	Constructive Advice Records
All constructive advice records shall be issued and signed by non-bargaining unit employees only. Disciplinary action causing lost time shall be at the direction of the non- bargaining unit employees or the person designated in charge of the store.
When a constructive advice record is to be discussed with an employee, the employee, upon request, shall have the Union Steward or the alternate steward present. If such representative is not available, the discussion will commence when such representation is available.
Constructive advice records used by the Employer shall not affect the employee's right to file a grievance.
Any such constructive advice record not received by the Union within eighteen (18) days of the consultation date shall be null and void. Any constructive advice record which does not involve a disciplinary suspension, after twelve (12) consecutive months have elapsed without a recurrence of the same nature, shall be null and void. Any constructive advice record which does involve a disciplinary suspension, after twenty-four (24) months have elapsed without a recurrence of the same nature, shall be null and void.
-4-
Constructive advice records shall be discussed with the employee no later than the employee's third working day following the manager's knowledge of the incident.
4.8	During any investigation which may lead to disciplinary action, the Employer will advise the employee of his right to union representation.
4.9	At any step in the Grievance procedure, the Chief Executive Officer of the Local Union shall have the final authority in respect to any aggrieved employee covered by this Agreement to decline to process a grievance, complaint, difficulty or dispute, or further, if in the judgement of the Chief Executive Officer, such grievance or dispute lacks merit or lacks justification under the

7/20/01

terms of this Agreement, or had been adjusted or justified under the terms of this Agreement to the satisfaction of the Union Executive Board.
4.10	It is understood and agreed that all employees within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement must exercise all their rights, privileges, or necessary procedures under this Agreement, International Constitution and Local Union Bylaws, in the settlement of any and all complaints or grievances filed by such employees before taking any action outside of the scope of this Agreement for the settlement of such grievances.
ARTICLE V
BARGAINING UNIT WORK
5.1	Outside Salesmen
The Employer may utilize any vendor services available to the trade except that traditional "non-vendor" merchandise will not be stocked to the shelf. Present employees will not have their hours reduced as a direct result of the implementation of this language. However the employer may utilize any vendor store assistance on General Merchandise products which are available to the trade without additional cost.
5.2	Management Work
In stores having both manager and co-manager(s), the Employer agrees that they will not perform work normally done by members of the bargaining unit. This does not preclude the manager and co- manager (s) from doing the above due to employees being absent where no one is available to do the work or circumstances beyond the control of the Employer. It is understood, however, that work incidental to handling customers’ request, inventorying product (s), general merchandise, fuel center and merchandise markdowns are not a violation of this Section.
5.3	Violations
In the event of a proven violation of this Article, the Employer will pay to the employee (s) filing the grievance the amount of time spent in such proven violation at time and one-half (114 x) their regular rate of pay.
5.4	Category Management
Due to category management considerations, certain items currently stocked by members of the clerk contract may transfer to the meat contract and vice versa. The Company and Union agree to discuss and resolve concerns prior to implementation.

NO STRIKE/NO LOCKOUT - PICKET LINE
6.1	No Strike/No Lockout
During the term hereof, the Union agrees that there shall be no strike or any other interference with or interruption of the normal conditions of the Employer's business by the Union or its members. The Employer agrees that there shall be no lockout.
-5-
6.2	Picket Line
No employee shall be required to cross a legal picket line which has been officially sanctioned by the Union. The Union will not officially sanction a picket line until it has discussed such action with the Employer.
ARTICLE VII
WAGES
7.1	Hourly Rates of Pay
Rates of pay and pay schedules as set forth below shall remain in effect for the life of this Agreement and shall constitute the basis for determination of wages for time worked.
7.2	All employees will progress through the brackets on the basis of weeks (or portions thereof) worked, i.e., twenty-six (26) weeks worked equals six (6) months.

p.m. Friday to claim any hours for which they may be eligible under the Available Hours Clause. Following such claiming, the employee and the Steward shall be advised. Employees not on the schedule at 3:00 p.m. Friday may call in to verify their schedules.
10.2	Daily/Weekly Guarantee
Employees sixteen (16) years of age or older who are instructed to report for work shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours work unless waived by mutual agreement. Such call-in guarantee shall not apply if the hours are not available due to the Available Hours Clause, Article X, Section 10.7.
A part-time employee sixteen (16) years of age or older who reports for work upon request shall receive a minimum of fifteen (15) hours pay during that week (including Sunday) at the appropriate rate provided he is available for such fifteen (15) hours work, except when called in at the end of the week and fifteen (15) hours work is not available.

seniority basis. Employees hired after 3/14/88, may be scheduled to work on Sundays and holidays as a normal day of work if they are qualified to perform the work, and shall be scheduled prior to the application of inverse seniority for employees hired prior to 3/14/88. All employees will be eligible to volunteer for Sunday and holiday work on a quarterly basis. Any employee during the quarter may elect, in writing, to drop off the Sunday and holiday list or sign on the list a maximum of once each. The first posting will be in April for May, June and July, and so forth. Each posting will stay up for fourteen (14) calendar days, and those employees who volunteer will regularly be scheduled each Sunday and holiday during the following three (3) months.
Employees hired prior to 3/14/88 may elect to work Sunday of any vacation week(s) provided they have fulfilled all provisions in 10.4 regarding volunteering for Sunday work.
For the purpose of rotation, an employee who is excused from work on a particular Sunday or holiday shall be considered to have worked as the rotation would normally have required.
The Employer will have thirty (30) days after the employee volunteers for Sunday and holiday work to train the employee to insure his ability to take his appropriate place on the rotation. For new employees this 30-day period will begin after completion of their probationary period.

If an employee is scheduled less than ten (10) hours between shifts and either shift is an eight (8) hour shift, then this will constitute a violation of this Article.

to perform the work assigned and the job classification within the individual store provided that this does not conflict with another provision of this Agreement, and provided further that the employee with seniority advises the Store Manager that he is available for a posted schedule of hours within twenty-four (24) hours after the store schedule is posted. Available hours may be exercised only for the five (5) highest hour days in the week (four (4) highest hour days in holiday weeks) excluding Sundays and holidays. For the purpose of this Section 10.7 full-time employees shall have seniority over part-time employees.
10.8	The Employer shall schedule full- time employees, excluding the hours and status of courtesy clerks, and demonstrators for the ratio of 50% of scheduled hours (including Sunday and holiday hours). For purposes of new store openings such ratio will go into effect after the first three (3) full periods following store opening.
10.8	(1)The hours of full-time employees will not be reduced to achieve the above ratios. The above ratios shall not limit full-time employees from exercising all their rights to claim hours as provided in Section 10.7. Transfers shall not be made from store to store to achieve individual store ratios as above, except where mutually agreeable to the Employer and employee, upon written notice to the Union office prior to the effective date of transfer.
-19-
10.8(	2)Once the ratios have been obtained, part-time employees shall have first choice for full-time jobs based on seniority and classification. After achieving the ratios, if the average ratio drops below those specified above for a four-consecutive-week period (to coincide with each Kroger accounting period), those full-time positions shall be posted by individual store, and such positions shall be filled by part- time employees within the individual store where such vacancy exists unless requests are being honored under 10.81 above and/or 14.10 (transfers).
10.8	(3) Schedules posted pursuant to Article 10.1 of this Agreement shall show the total hours, showing the percentages of full-time and part-time in compliance with this Article.
10.8	(4) The Employer guarantees that all present employees (hired on or before 3/14/88) shall maintain all rights to maximize their hours accorded to them under the expired agreement regardless of the changes in seniority provisions relating to new employees.

Food clerks on the payroll as of 11/10/79 may claim courtesy clerk hours up to the single highest average weekly straight-time hours as determined by one of the following three periods:
1.	Average weekly straight-time hours worked between 9/5/76 -10/2/76.
2.	Average weekly straight-time hours worked between 10/17/76 - 11/13/76, for employees hired on or after 9/5/76. (For employees hired between 10/17/76 and 11/13/76, their average shall be computed by dividing the number of weeks worked into their total straight-time hours worked.)
3.	Average weekly straight-time hours worked between 8/26/79 -10/20/79.
Such claiming of hours is subject to no provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement being violated.
10.10	Earlier Starting Times
Earlier starting times will be assigned to the more senior clerks within their department (i.e. Front End, Grocery, Produce, Deli/Bakery, General Merchandise, Pharmacy and Courtesy Clerk) where such scheduling does not conflict with other provisions of this Agreement. In the event an employee is scheduled in more than one department during a week, an employee may claim an earlier starting time only in the department in which an employee has the most hours for that day. If the hours for that day are split equally between two departments, then the employee’s department for that day will be the one in which the employee is working the majority of hours for the week. Earlier starting time shall be defined as the shift that starts on or after 4:00 a.m. This provision shall not apply during the first sixty (60) days of a new store opening. However, the Company reserves the right, on an as- needed basis, to schedule senior employees with less than twenty (20) years seniority one (1) night per week, provided that all less senior clerks are scheduled a minimum of one (1) night. A night shift, for the purpose of this paragraph, is a shift scheduled to end between 6:15 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. or a shift scheduled to begin prior to 4:00 a.m. (refer to Letter of Understanding for clarification)
Customer Service Coordinators and Assistant Customer Service Coordinators shall not be scheduled earlier starting times, out of seniority, for the purpose of doing cashier work.
Union and Company agree to maintain past practice of administering this Article (10.10) and apply that interpretation to former Local 31 jurisdiction.
In the event that it is necessary to schedule an adjoining part-time shift and full-time shift, the full-time shift shall be scheduled

earlier, provided that this does not conflict with the Available Hours clause and provided further that sufficient employees are available to fulfill both shifts.
Valid grievances involving earlier starting times shall be paid at straight-time rate of pay based on the differences between earlier starting time and the later (shift) starting time.
Starting times of department heads and assistant department heads shall be determined by the employer.
-20-
10.11	An employee may indicate to the Store Manager in writing (with a copy to the Union Steward) that the employee would like to be scheduled for "days/nights shifts" if available and seniority permits. It is understood that in making a personal preference known for "days" or "nights" the employee may be scheduled for fewer hours than seniority might normally entitle the employee under other pertinent contractual clauses. It is further understood that if shifts of the employee's preference are not available, the employee will be scheduled by seniority under the terms of the contract. Written notice of intent shall stand for thirty (30) days and then until revoked in writing by the employee with one (1) week's notice. It is further understood that this procedure does not permit an employee to limit the number of shifts employee may be scheduled.
10.12	Additional Hours
When additional hours need to be added to the schedule to replace calls-offs, (i.e. sickness, juiy duty, funeral leave, etc.) or because of increased business, the following procedure will be followed.
Step 1. Any or allof the vacated shift shall be replaced by seniority by the most senior employee already on the schedule having a work shift ending after 6:00 p.m. who would receive the same or greater number of hours. Calls will be made until the shift is filled.
Step 2. If the vacated shift ending after 6:00 p.m. is an eight (8) hour shift, it will be offered, by seniority, to an employee already on the schedule who would receive a greater number of hours. Calls will be made until this shift is filled.
Step 3. If this occurs, the newly vacated shift will be offered to the most senior employee not on the schedule that day as long as it does not create a violation of the contract or overtime pay.

Page 43 of 79
Step 4. If the shift vacated after 6:00 p.m. is not an eight (8) hour shift, the vacated shift will be offered to the most senior employee not on the schedule that day as long as it does not create a violation of the contract or overtime pay.
Step 5. If no employee is available for the original vacated shift by following the above procedure, it shall be offered to the most senior employee scheduled for a later shift.

VACATIONS
12.1	Eligibility
All employees will be entitled to vacations as outlined below.
Eligibility for an employee's first vacation (one week) and for increases in vacation (two, three, four, five and six weeks) will - be determined by the anniversary date of employment. "Service" means continuous employment with the Employer. The following schedule shall apply:
Years of Service Weeks of Vacation
One (1) year service One (1) week vacation
Three (3) years service Two (2) weeks vacation
Seven (7) years service Three (3) weeks vacation
Thirteen (13) years service Four (4) weeks vacation
Twenty (20) years service Five (5) weeks vacation
Twenty-five (25) years service Six (6) weeks vacation
After an employee has qualified for a vacation of one (1), two (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), or six (6) weeks, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the employee shall be eligible for future vacations as of January 1st of each year.
Employees will be paid their straight time earnings for their basic workweek. Vacation pay will be paid in advance.
Employees shall be advanced the approximate net amount of their vacation check in the event the check has not been issued to the store on the Friday prior to the start of their vacation week, except in cases where the employee requests a vacation less than two (2) weeks prior to the Friday before vacation begins.
12.2	Computation of Vacation Pay
Full-time employees who worked on a full-time (40 hour) basis in at least forty (40) weeks or who were not laid off for more than thirty (30) working days during the anniversary or calendar year in which their vacations were earned will be paid their current straight time hourly rate for their regularly scheduled workweek. In determining if an employee has worked forty (40) or more weeks on a full- time basis, count weeks not worked because of paid vacations, approved leaves

of absence (including sick leave), and weeks in which only thirty-two (32) hours were worked because of holidays, as weeks so worked.
The weekly pay of a full-time employee who worked on a full-time (40 hour) basis in fewer than forty (40) weeks, or who was laid off for more than thirty (30) working days in the year, will be computed at the employee's current straight time hourly rate for the average number of hours worked per week during the anniversary or calendar year in which the vacation was earned. To determine the average number of hours worked per week, divide the total hours worked during this anniversary or calendar year by the number of weeks in the year; exclude from this divisor the weeks off the job because of paid vacation, sick leave, other authorized leave of absence and weeks where one day was not worked because of a holiday.
12.3	A part-time employee who is entitled to a vacation shall be granted a part- time vacation under the same general rules as provided for full-time employees except that part-time vacation pay will be figured on the number of hours worked in the vacation qualifying year divided by fifty-two (52).
The qualifying date for all vacation purposes of any part- time employee who subsequently, and without a break in employment, qualifies as a full-time employee, the qualifying date shall be the date from which service has been counted for part-time vacation purposes rather than the date qualified as a full-time employee.
12.4	Scheduling Vacations
Vacations must be scheduled in the calendar year except where necessary, vacations which fall due in the last two calendar months of the year may be carried over to the first month of the next year. By mutual agreement, employees eligible for three (3) or more weeks of vacation, may voluntarily choose to work in lieu of time off, any weeks of vacation eligibility greater than two weeks and be paid for vacation in addition to hours worked.
If an employee qualifies for a one week vacation as of January 1st and is due to complete the service necessary for an additional week of vacation later in the year, the employee may take the first week early or wait and take both weeks together.
Choice of vacation dates will be available fifty-two (52) weeks per year and will be granted on the basis of seniority, except that the Employer reserves the right to grant vacations to any employee when the employee's absence will not adversely affect the operation. The fifty- two (52) weeks availability may not

apply in stores averaging less than $250,000.00 volume.
The Employer shall post the vacation schedule no later than January 15th and employees shall exercise their vacation preference, by seniority, no later than March 1st. The Employer shall post the actual schedule no later than March 15th. Those employees who so fail to notify the Employer by March 1st must select from the remaining open weeks.
Earned vacation may be taken in a continuous period if desired by the employee.
Employees with four (4) or more weeks of vacation may elect to schedule one (1) week of vacation a day at a time. Employees must notify the store manager of their desire to schedule this week of vacation in days at the time of vacation selection. The individual days will be scheduled, by mutual agreement, to be taken Monday through Friday by October 31st of each year. Unused days as of October 31st will be scheduled at the discretion of the employer which will be done by year end.
Vacation days and personal holidays are considered days of work when used in the calculation of overtime.
12.5	Vacation Pay in the Event of Termination
If an employee who has not taken the vacation, which has been earned by the employee's length of service, leaves (regardless of whether notice is given), goes into military service or is separated for any reason other than confessed or proven dishonesty, the employee shall receive
-24-
vacation pay at the time of leaving. Any employee who retires shall receive a pro- rata vacation for the year in which the employee retires, based upon the full months worked in that year. If an employee dies before receiving vacation, which has been earned, the employee's estate is entitled to the vacation pay.
12.6	Effect of Leaves of Absence on Vacation Pay
Leaves totaling 90 days or less in any calendar year shall not affect vacation earned in that year. Leaves totaling more than 90 days but not over 180 days shall reduce vacation and vacation pay by one-fourth. Leaves totaling more than 180 days but not over 270 days shall reduce vacation and vacation pay by one-half; leaves totaling more than 270 days shall disqualify for vacation.

ARTICLE XIII
SENIORITY
13.1	Determination
In layoffs, recalls and choice of vacation periods, the principle of seniority shall apply. Seniority shall be determined by the length of continuous service of the employee with the Employer, beginning with the employee's most recent date of employment or the date the employee transferred into the bargaining unit, whichever is later, with regard to experience and ability to perform the work. All circumstances being reasonably equal, length of service shall be the controlling factor. Seniority lists shall be established and maintained and such lists shall be furnished to the Union upon request.
The seniority date for all employees, both "full-time" and "part-time" will be their most recent date of hire unless:
A.	Transferred from one Union to another — seniority dates from date of transfer into new Union. However, all provisions within the contract excluding seniority provisions, shall be utilized using the employee's original hire date within the company.
B.	Transferred from one UFCW Union Local to another UFCW Union Local — seniority dates from date of transfer to the new Union Local. Employees transferred after 5/26/85 from the former Local 31 and the former Local 1059 jurisdiction (i.e. merger) shall be from date of hire.
C.	Employees covered under the Groceiy Agreement who are

promoted to the Meat Department shall have thirty (30) days to return to their former classification without loss of seniority.
-25-
Where two (2) or more employees have the same hire date, seniority will be decided by alphabet of the last name; when the last name is the same, it will revert to the first name. For employees hired after 11/10/79, the lowest combination of the last four (4) numbers of their social security number shall determine seniority among employees hired on the same date.
13.2	For the purpose of administration, Local area seniority refers to stores under each of the Local Union Nos. 1059 and 1099 separately. Seniority area refers to stores in the following areas:
Local No.1059 Local No.1099

number of hours worked in consecutive weeks qualifying period. This definition of a full-time employee shall apply only to this seniority clause unless other clauses specifically set forth that it is applicable to such clauses.
13.3	Transfers
In the matter of transfers from one store to the other, the Employer shall give due regard to seniority. This shall not preclude the Union from questioning through the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure whether the Employer has given due regard to seniority.
13.4	Promotions
The Employer shall base promotions to classified positions on seniority, previous work experience, and qualifications based on past performance criteria. The Union shall retain the right to question through the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure whether the Employer has given due regard to seniority.
In the matter of promotions to classified jobs, as provided in this Agreement, the Employer shall post a notice of job opening(s) in each store for seven (7) calendar days during which time interested employees may submit their names for such opening (s). Such position(s) shall be filled forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of the posting period. The Employer agrees to furnish the Union with copies of (1) the original job opening notice (s), (2) a list of people signing the notice (s) and (3) the name of successful candidate (s). The aforementioned posting shall be by seniority area as provided for in Section 13.2.
Where a Union member accepts a promotion to a supervisory job outside of the bargaining unit the employee may, upon written request to the Union by the employee or the Employer, be granted a leave of absence from the bargaining unit not to exceed six (6) months during which period the employee may return to the bargaining unit in the employee’s former classification without loss of seniority.
13.5	No employee shall be demoted from a department head or any higher paid position without just cause.
When a department head is reduced in classification, his service as a department head will be considered as service as a clerk for seniority purposes.
13.6	Termination of Seniority

13.7	’’Full-Time’’ and ’’Part-Time” Employees

Hours worked in replacement of call offs or other absences (including but not limited to vacations, holidays, leaves, etc.) will be excluded in computing the thirty- six (36) hour average or counted as part of the consecutive week qualifying period.
13.8	A high school student who works during the summers will not be reviewed for classification as a full-time employee until October 15th. If the employee is still working at that time, has met all requirements for classification as a full-time employee, and has averaged thirty- six (36) hours or more in the basic workweek during the four (4) weeks preceding October 15, the employee shall be classified as a full- time employee. The beginning date of continuous service shall be dated back in accordance with Section 13.7.
-27-
13.9	Time not worked because of a holiday shall be counted as time worked toward qualifications or continuity as a full-time employee, regardless of whether or not the employee is entitled to holiday pay.
13.10	For an employee who meets the aforesaid requirements, continuous service as a full-time employee shall be dated back to the first day worked in the first of the sixteen (16) qualifying weeks.
13.11	Sunday and Holiday hours will be used to qualify as a full-time employee.

C.	If employee is permanently laid off due to elimination of job;
D. Any request by a “full-time" employee for reduction to "part-time" status will be in writing and will result in that person going on the "part-time" seniority list immediately. Where a "full-time" employee requests "part-time" employment for a relatively short period of time, the employee may remain on the "full- time" seniority list by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union and such agreement shall be in writing.
E.	If, prior to completion of two (2) years of service as a full-time employee, employee has worked less than half-time (*/2) or has been laid off in ten (10) or more weeks in three (3) consecutive periods, including the last two (2) weeks of the most recent period;
F.	If, after completion of two (2) years of service as a full-time employee, employee has worked less than half-time (!4) or has been laid off in twenty (20) or more weeks in six (6) consecutive periods, including the last two (2) weeks of the most recent period.
Note:In determining if an employee has worked less than halftime (!6) for three (3) or six (6) periods (sub-paragraphs E and F) do not count those periods in which the employee was absent for two (2) or more weeks because of sickness or approved leave.
G. Effective 11/10/79, employees will revert to part-time status after they average less than twenty-eight (28) hours in a twelve (12) consecutive week period. This consecutive twelve (12) week period will be separate and distinct from any sixteen (16) consecutive week qualifying period. Those employees previously qualified or qualifying on 11/10/79, will qualify and disqualify as per Article XIII, Section 13.12, "E" and "F".
13.13	To protect continuity of full-time employment, full-time employees who seek to quit due to correctable health conditions or temporary personal need for time off should be advised of their privileges under the leave of absence policy.

The displaced employee shall take his appropriate seniority position on the "part-time" schedule in the store in which the employee was displaced, or shall have the right to displace the least senior "full- time" employee in employee's classification, first in seniority area then the Local area. In such a case, the change shall be effective at the beginning of the week next following the four (4) consecutive week period.
H.	A "full- time" employee who wishes to waive rights as specified in Paragraphs A through G may displace the least senior "full-time" employee in the city who is receiving a greater number of hours.

A "full-time*' employee involuntarily reduced to "part-time" or laid off who, at the time of this reduction had been offered a "full-time" job in the seniority area or Local area, but declined, will have the right to the first "full-time" opening within their classification only in the city where the employee had been working prior to his reduction.
14.5	A "full-time" employee involuntarily reduced to "part-time" or laid off who at the time of this reduction did not have seniority enough to displace another "full-time" employee will have the right to the first "full-time" opening within classification in the Local area. If employee declines this job, employee will have the right to the first "full- time" opening in the seniority area.

14.6	A "part-time" employee laid off involuntarily will have the right, in accordance with employee's position on the seniority list, for the first "part-time" opening within classification in the Local area.

A "full-time" employee working less than forty (40) hours and who is available for and desires to work forty (40) hours per week will make his desire known in writing to Store Manager with copies to the Zone Manager, Personnel Manager and the Union, specifying whether or not such desire is limited to the city in which employee is working or applies to the seniority area and Local Union. When the Employer has such an opening on other than a temporary basis, such employee will be considered for the opening, based on seniority in the seniority area and Local Union, provided that employee has the experience and ability necessary to perform the work.
14.9	Night Work to Day Work
If a full-time employee on the night crew desires day work in store, employee shall advise the Store Manager in writing with a copy to the Zone Manager, Personnel Manager and the Union, such employee shall be transferred to the day schedule on the second posted work schedule provided such employee is more senior than the junior full-time employee working thirty-two (32) hours on days. There will be not more than one such transfer per store per thirty (30) day period. An additional thirty (30) day lapse on the second or subsequent transfer (s) may be granted upon mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
14.10	Transfers
When the transfer of an employee to a different store becomes necessary due to slackening of business, the Employer shall make every effort to assign employees to a store where such transfer shall require lesser travel time from employee's home. Such transfers shall not be utilized as a device for creating hardship to the employee in order to provoke employee's resignation.
Employees who desire to transfer to a store closer to their residence (within the bargaining unit) shall notify the Personnel Department with a copy to the Union, in writing, of their desire and set forth the store number they desire to transfer to. The Employer agrees to transfer said employee over any new applicant within the employee's seniority classification. When such transfer then is exercised, that store will become the home store for that employee.
Any transfer of an employee to another town at the request of the Employer shall be agreeable to the employee and any expense of transfer to another town shall be borne by the Employer.

Employer, involving additional transportation cost, the employee will be reimbursed for miles traveled between city limits at the regular company mileage rate. If the Employer's mileage allowance is increased, the new mileage allowance shall apply to this paragraph.
14.11	Closed Stores
In the event of the closing of the only store in a city, employees of this store will have the right to exercise their seniority first in the seniority area, then in the Local area, for "full-time" or "part-time" jobs of the least senior employee in the classification and seniority status. Employees declining to so relocate will be considered to have relinquished their seniority.
In the event that one store closes and is replaced by another store, all non-classified clerks in the closed store will have the right to go to the new store provided that such openings are available.
A Department head or assistant department head displaced because of a closed store will bump within volume classification and displace the junior person in classification by date of job. In all stores outside Franklin County, the bump will be first in the city, then the seniority area, then the Local union area (within Franklin County, first within the management administrative zone, then the city, then the Local area). If they are the junior employee in that classification and volume, then employee will displace the junior person in the classification in the next lower volume as indicated above. The junior department head displaced will go to the top clerk rate in the store and will have the right to the first department head position by volume within the local. If an employee refuses a bump at any stage of the progression, employee forfeits all rights and goes immediately to top clerk rate and bumps accordingly, with no right to return to a department when it opens.
14.12	New Stores

This notice shall give the location and the approximate opening date of the new store. Employer shall also notify the Local Union of any new store opening three (3) months prior to the anticipated opening date with all specific data, i.e. name of store, square footage of store, and planned departments.
Those employees wishing to be considered for transfer and placement in that store shall make their wishes known by signing the form within seven (7) calendar days of posting and supplying

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Re: Earlier Starting Times (10.10)
It is the intent of this language to provide that anyone with twenty (20) years of service or more will not be forced to work a night shift past 6:15 p.m. or earlier than 4:00 a.m. outside of their seniority.
If an employee with more than twenty (20) years of service within seniority is forced to work a night shift, that night shift is defined as a shift to end between 6:15 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.
For employees with less than twenty (20) years of service, the night shift provision did not change. A night shift for the purpose of this paragraph, is a shift scheduled to end between 6:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. or a shift scheduled to begin prior to 4:00 a.m.
