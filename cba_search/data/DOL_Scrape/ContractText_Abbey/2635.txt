4.6	Work Year
4.6.1	. Management recognizes that over a two-year period the typical faculty load is 60 formula hours and the n on-credit faculty load is 90 formula hours. However, in order to meet department or scheduling problems, the District reserves the fight to make an assignment over that two-year period which could vary from 60-62 formula hours (credit) or 90-92 formula hours (non credit) as part of a unit member’s regular load- Faculty assigned in Instructional Mode 1.3 or 1.4 shall be maintained at 60 formula hours over the two-year period. At the end of the two-year period of load balancing, formula hours greater than 60 (4 FTE) in the Instructional Mode (by an amount equivalent to or greater than .67 FTE or one formula hour) shall be paid as overload (Schedule B). If the faculty member is below ' the 6C formula hours for load balancing, the faculty member may makeup the imbalance the following contract year by mutual agreement Otherwise, money is owed to the District and must be repaid.
In a given contract year, should the revenue per FTES for non credit classes change more than 10% in proportion to the change in the revenue per FTES for credit classes, then the ■ work load for non credit faculty will be adjusted. Job aiinouncements will clearly state the right of the District to make non-credit assignments.

Article 8	Performance Review
8.1	Introduction
The primary goal of faculty performance review is to improve the quality of the educational program. The process should promote professionalism, enhance performance, and be effective in yielding a genuinely useful and substantive assessment of performance. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to identify, recognize and nurture excellence; to identify standard performance, to indicate areas where improvement is necessary or desirable. While formal performance review as described in this article occurs on a cyclical basts, informal review by colleagues and supervisors occurs on a continuous basis, and, as such, communication should also be continuous.
8.2	Authorization
Ed. Code sections 87660 et seq. set forth the requirements for the evaluation of faculty. The legislative intent, as. stated in AB 1725, provides that a faculty member s students, administraters and peers should all contribute to his or her performance review, but the faculty should play a central role in the performance review process and, together with appropriate administrators, assume principal responsibility for the effectiveness of the process.

Article 26 Educational Technology
26.1	Intent
A key strategy in the Los Rios Community College Districts vision of a restructured higher education system is to expand the System^ learning opportunities on and off campus by using multiple technologies.
The purpose of this Article is to establish a series of contractual understanding? between the LRCFT and the LRCCD Board of Trustees regarding the use of instructional technology.
26.2	Definitions
Distance Education extends the process of teaching and learning from the campus to one or more locations including classrooms on other campuses, work sites, community centers, and homes. It includes instruction, instructional support such as libraries, computer centers, and student services, such as registration, counseling and student activities that are provided to those other locations.
Distance instruction broadly defines a condition of learning where instructor and student are physically separate for most, if nc* alt, of the experience. Interaction is mediated by some form of technology —currently audio, video, and computer technologies—that allows for students and instructor to engage in the process of education.
Distance Education in asynchronous mode is where instructional audio, text, and/or video is prerecorded and delivered to students on any media mtfhdmg but not limited to disks, tapes, and Internet web pages.
Instructional technology material includes video and audio recordings motion pictures, film strips, photographic and other similar visual materials, live video and audio transmissions, computer programs, computer assisted instructional coursework, programmed instructional materials, three dimensional materials and exhibits, and combinations of the above materials, which are prepared or produced in whole of in part by an employee, and which are used to assist or enhance instruction.

Salary and Benefits Appendix A	2002-2003
A. 1 Funding Sources
The bargaining unit shall receive its proportionate share of eighty percent (80#) of certain new or increased unrestricted revenue which is above an established base amount. The bargaining unit’s proportionate share of such revenues is based upon:
1)	the unit’s, total salary and benefit cost, including the cost of District contribution towards health coverage for all authorized/filled positions associated with the LRCFT unit;
2)	which is compared to the total District salary benefit and contribution costs for authorized/filled positions of all District employee groups.
3)	Authorized/filled positions which are funded from special programs/categorical fluids are excluded from both LRCFT unit’s cost and other employee group costs.
4)	The related salary and benefit costs associated with District contract managers are also excluded.
The determination as to whether such defined revenues are "continuing" or "one-time-only" is defined below but may be modified during the term of Uns contract due to new State r egulations. Such revenues and related base amounts are defined as follows:
A.LI	Program Based Funding (P8F) Revenue The base amount for 2002-03 is the revenue
level recognized in the 2001-02 fiscal year that was used for retroactive salary improvement calculations for that year which includes any 2001-02 Growth Funds and any Program Improvement Funds, and is reduced by any State deficit, which may be applied retroactively. Typically, the amount received in the preceding year per Program Based Funding (PBF) provisions is the revenue level recognized for that year if no statewide deficit is projected.
Program Based Funding revenues are generally considered "continuous" funds and shall be used to fund continuing salary and benefit costs applicable to LRCFT unit members. Mew or increased Program Based Funding revenues above the base amount are generally derived from two sources: 1) Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA); and 2) Growth Funds* The d^termi nation, availability, and distribution of the bargaining units proportionate share of new or increased Program Based Funding revenues due to the COLA factor is dependent upon ths final adoption of the State Budget and the reliability of receiving such entitlements* Typically, an initial salary schedule improvement is implemented for the fiscal year based upon COLA funds authorized in the State budget for community colleges provided that such COLA revenues are reliable {no projected State funding deficit)*
After providing for specified District costs associated with student growth. Available Growth funds as described in Attachment 1 which are attributed to Program Based Funding provisions are considered "continuous’’ funds and are proportionally allocated to unit members.

A. 1,2	State. Program improvement Fandt (PIF) Any unrestricted Program Improvement
funds received shall be proportionately allocated to the bargaining unit. Such revenues are genera fly considered ‘tontiouous” funds and shall be used to fund the costs described in Section A. 2, Typically, PIF funds require the hiring of additional faculty ■ members in order to improve the District’s full-tune/part-time staffing ratio (Title V).
■ Such requirements and the related funding for additional faculty are restrictive as to use of PIF funds. The base amount of PIF revenue used in the determination of new or increased revenue is sera
A, 1.3	Basic Skills Growth Revenue Any District revenues realized for basic skills courses is
subject to growth and maintenance of effort levels. Up io 1994-95, such funds had been distributed proportionately to the bargaining unit on a one-time-only basis and were allocated in accordance with growth provisions defined per previous contract provisions; In 1995 96. Basic Skills revenue for Los Rios was guaranteed by the State at $814,467 and such revenues (80%) were distributed proportionally as continuing revenues to unit members in 1995-96.
A. 13,1	Revenue increases in 2002-03 above the defined revenue base of $814,467
shah be considered one-time-only since entitlement to such revenues is ' subject to maintenance of effort provisions for full-time equivalent students (PTES) levels as determined by the State Chancellor’s Office. The proportionate distribution of eighty percent of such one-time-only funds to the bargaining unit shall be determined in accordance with growth provisions defined in Section A.4 and Attachment 1.
■ AT .4 Lottery Revenue The base amount for Lottery revenue is established at $3.3M. Lottery revenue is considered one-time-only revenue and the proportionate amount of eighty percent of such funds distributed to LRCFT unit members is provided on a one-time-only basis. Effective July 1,2000P fifty percent (50%) of Lottery revenues above 1997'	98 revenues are restricted per the conditions set forth in Proposition 20. Such restricted
amounts may not be used for salaries and benefits and therefore are excluded from the pro visions of this section.	■	.
A. 1.5 State Adjunct Medical Premium reimbursements Tril996, the State established requirements and funding for a Part-time Faculty Medical Program for districts participating in this program. This program provides up to fifty percent (50%) - reimbursement'to districts who are'joint employers of an adjunct faculty member who maintains a combined Workload at both di stricts of sixty percent (.60 FFE) or more of a iull-tiine faculty member. Additional requirements are stated in Article 3, Section 33.5. A Memorandum of Understanding dated April 15,1998 between Los Rios Community ■	College District and the Sierra Joint Community College District further specifies the
terms of participation iii the program and follows the guidelines and requirements prescribed by the State Chancellor’s Office (EC 87860 through 87869 - AB 3099).
A;L5.1 Each fiscal year the Los Rios District, shall file the appropriate claim for reimbursement with the State for medical premium costs incurred by both districts.
A.-1.5.2	Amounts received by the district shall 1) reimburse Siena for their share of
■	• costs incurred for adjunct premiums (up to 50%) and as specified in the
Memorandum of Understanding with Sierra; and 2} remaining amounts shall be used to support the cost of this Adjunct Medical Premium program.
LRCFT Contract; 2002-05
Page 130
A. 1.53	Such reimbursements are considered a funding source available to LRCFT
■	for'related medical premium costs (A. 2.,?) in the year such monies are paid
by the State and received by the djstricL <..: .

B ,1.1 Program Based Funding (PBF) Revenue
The base amount is the amount recognized or received in the previous year per Program Based Funding (PBF) provisions, which includes any Growth Funds, Program Improvement Funds, and any other revenues which are computed as Base Revenue per PBF provisions by the State of California, Chancellor's Office. Such PBF base revenues may also be reduced by any retroactively applied State deficit.

B.l.3.2 Should the guaranteed revenue level be increased above the current $814,467 level, such increased funds shall be considered continuing revenue and will be allocated proportionately to LRCFT.
B. 1.3.3 Should the guaranteed level be reduced below $814,467, the amount of reduction in Basic Skills continuing revenue shall reduce the available continuing funds in 2003-04 or 2004-05. The B asic Skill s re venue base or guaranteed level shall be revised to the new State guaranteed level and revenues received in 2003-04 or 2004-05 above this level shall be considered one-time-only funds.

If PFE is not transferred to the base in either 2002-03 or 2003-04 and the program does not receive a COLA or the COLA is not sufficient to fund the increased salary and benefit costs of the Committed costs of the program, then the costs directly attributable to LRCFT unit members or programs will become part of the iihit’s proportionate share calculation effective July 1, 2003. The District will reduce operational expenditures from PFE funds in order to support the transfer of the costs. The determination of the amount to be transferred will be as follows; 2003-04 total PFE allocation multiplied by 80%, LRCFT’s proportionate share of committed costs funded by PFE multiplied by 80%. However, if the total amount of committed costs for all units is at 80%, the factor shall be increased by a maximum of the COLA for 2003-04 or 2% whichever is greater.
