The County Legislature may then authorize recruitment at a higher step of the salary scale for such position.
2.	TEMPORARY OR PROVISIONAL APPOINTEES: An employee who has been continuously employed under temporary or provisional appointment shall, upon appointment on a permanent basis to a position with the same class title, be credited with the length of time as a provisional or temporary employee in determining the salary of his position.
3.	PROMOTIONS AND VOLUNTARY DEMOTIONS: When an employee is promoted to a position in a higher grade, he shall be placed on that step of the new grade which is closest to the sum of his former rate plus the average increment step in the new grade. When an employee elects a voluntary demotion to a position in a lower grade, he shall be placed on the same increment step in the new grade as he was on in the former grade.
4.	REASSIGNMENTS: There shall be no immediate change in the salary rate of an employee reassigned to a new position unless his salary is below the approved minimum of the new position. If any employee is reassigned to a position having a higher salary range than the class from which he was reassigned, such change shall be deemed to be a promotion and the legal provisions governing promotions will apply.
5.	REALLOCATION: When an employee's position is reallocated or reclassified downward, the employee shall continue at tbe same grade and step, receiving increments and longevities as though no reallocation took place. New employees hired to this position shall be hired at the new and lower grade.

72
former position and had the unit head awarded the increments in accordance with the annual review.
7.	PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT: AH rates prescribed in the scales of pay are the standard rates of pay authorized for full-time employment. When employment is on a part-time basis, only the proportionate part of the rate for the .time actually employed shall be; paid.
