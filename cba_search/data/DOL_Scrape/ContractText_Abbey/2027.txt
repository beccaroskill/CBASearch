scheduled overtime hours." Scheduled overtime is generally voluntary; however, if there are no volunteers, scheduled overtime is assigned by reverse seniority.

Unscheduled overtime:
236.	A list of eligible employees, by seniority, shall be generated each fiscal year. Unscheduled overtime shall be initially offered by going down the seniority list. A refusal of unscheduled overtime counts as “accrued unscheduled overtime hours” for the purpose of unscheduled overtime distribution.

Unscheduled overtime is generally voluntary; however, if there are no volunteers, unscheduled overtime is assigned by reverse seniority.

If the holiday overtime assignment is not covered, the employee responsible to cover the assignment is penalized by losing the opportunity to work the next two (2) holiday overtime assignments. Holiday overtime hours do not count as "accrued hours" for the purposes of determining offers of overtime.

The designation of such days off shall be by mutual agreement of the employee and the appropriate supervisor with the approval of the appointing officer.

4.4 Equipment Maintenance Attendance Policy
Purpose
Attendance is an important standard of performance. Each employee is required to work the hours normally scheduled for his or her position. There is not a single job that is not vital to overall operations. When employees fail to take this fact seriously, time consuming rearrangements and reshuffling hampers our ability to meet our obligations to the public.
This policy provides definitions of the different types of absences and describes the disciplinary actions that can and should be taken when attendance becomes a problem.
DEFINITIONS
All Shops and work locations within Equipment Maintenance shall define the attendance policy in these terms:
Absence:	This is the failure of an employee to report to
work during the hours he or she is normally scheduled to work.
Extended Absence: This is a leave of absence for any reason other than suspension, vacation, and/or compensation time for more than five (5) consecutive work days.
Unexcused Absence: An employee will be considered Absent without Official Leave (AWOL) if he or she:
•	fails to notify the immediate supervisor of absence prior to the normally scheduled work period.
•	decides to be absent even though supervisory permission was not granted.
•	fails to produce sufficient proof or documentation to justify absence when required.
•	is absent from his or her designated work station during the course of the normal work period without supervisory permission.

Page 2 of 11
Bulletin 4.4
Tardiness: This is the failure to be on the job, ready to perform duties at the time work is normally scheduled to begin. Tardiness will be considered excused or unexcused by the immediate supervisor based on the reason, length of time, whether or not the employee notified the supervisor, and number of occurrences.
Excessive Absenteeism: This is more than one day off per month over a period of time for other than scheduled vacations or a pattern of absenteeism such as every Friday or every day prior to a holiday.
Requesting and Receiving Authorization for Absence
It is the employee’s responsibility to request supervisory permission to be absent at any time during the normal work day in a timely manner. Request for leave for extended periods must be submitted to the supervisor on a properly completed CSC 7-20 Request for Leave Form (see Attachment 1). Except for involuntary and medical leave, employees should submit a request at least 30 days in advance to allow time for the supervisor to make arrangements for work coverage. Involuntary and medical leave requests should be submitted as soon as possible.
In cases of unforeseen absence, the employee will call before the start of the work shift and report the absence to the supervisor or designated contact. Each supervisor will inform all his or her employees in writing of the time, telephone number, and name(s) of contact(s) to call when unable to report for work (see Attachment 2). The point of contact should be reliable and consistent for each work station and shift.
Rare exceptions are permitted in cases where employee notification does not occur. There is no substitute for common sense when determining whether or not extenuating circumstances were such that it prevented the employee from notifying his/her supervisor.
If and when required, written documentation should be submitted to justify absence,. Although not all absences require written justification, there are certain types of leave that should not be granted without proper documentation. Employees must present these documents when requesting leave. For example:
•	Military orders are required in requesting military leave.
•	A physician must complete Items 12-17 on the leave form when requesting an extended period of Medical Leave.

CBA BETWEEN THE SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY OF SAN FRANCISCO
AND THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 6
78
Page 3 of 11
Bulletin 4.4
•	A court issued notification of selection for jury duty is required in requesting Jury Duty Leave.
•	A physician’s written verification is required for any absence due to illness if the employee is on sick leave restriction. It must be submitted when the employee returns to work.
Once an employee has requested leave, the supervisor must respond. In some cases, supervisors cannot disapprove the leave if properly requested and written justification is provided. In particular, maternity, jury duty, and military leave must be granted.
On the other hand, approval of the use of compensation time, vacation, floating holidays and lieu days is at the discretion of the supervisor. However, floating holidays and lieu days must be taken before the expiration of the current fiscal year and take priority over workload demands if employees are in jeopardy of forfeiting earned time off.
Finally, all requests should be given to the appropriate divisional personnel officer (DPO) for processing. The DPO will forward the forms to the section manager for review and approval. A copy will then be filed within Equipment Maintenance and the original forwarded to the PUC Bureau of Personnel and Training (BPT).
Disciplinary Action
To correct attendance problems, progressive disciplinary measures will be taken.
Tardiness:	Excused tardiness will result in loss of pay,
with no disciplinary action taken. When necessary, the supervisor may allow employee to make up time not to exceed an eight-hour shift or a forty-hour wee4k. Each occurrence of tardiness must be documented on a timecard or sign in log.
Unexcused tardiness will result in loss of pay. A verbal warning will be given on the first occurrence. The second occurrence within a three month period may be cause for written instruction or written warning. A third occurrence within the same three month period may be cause for suspension.

AND THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 6
79
Page 4 of 11
Bulletin 4.4
Unexcused Absence: The supervisor will endeavor to discuss the reason for an unexcused absence with the employee. If there are clearly extenuating circumstances which can be justified, such as proven emergencies, no further disciplinary action will be taken. In the absence of justifiable circumstances, the employee will be considered AWOL. This will result in both loss of pay and disciplinary action in accordance with the PUC Disciplinary Guide.
Each occurrence must be documented with a D-1 discipline form, as either a written instruction or a written warning. A second occurrence of being AWOL within a six-month period may result in suspension. A third occurrence within the same sixmonth period may result in a Recommendation for Dismissal or Termination.
Being AWOL for five (5) consecutive days will constitute “abandonment of position”, and may result in dismissal for being AWOL. Supervisors are required to make reasonable efforts to contact the employee. In particular, the supervisor will call the employee’s home and emergency telephone numbers during the first three (3) days. If the employee cannot be reached, the supervisor will report it to the appropriate DPO. The DPO will then:
•	Send a letter via certified mail (see Attachment 3) to the employee’s last known address.
•	Continue to call the employee up to the fifth day.
•	Report verbally to BPT on the fifth day.
•	Send a formal memo to the Director of BPT requesting dismissal for being AWOL. The memo should state specific efforts taken within Equipment Maintenance to contact or locate the employee. (See Attachment 4 for a sample.)
Excessive Absenteeism: If the number of absences for other than schedu7led vacations exceeds one day per month over a period of time or if a pattern of absenteeism indicates possible abuse of leave, the supervisor will endeavor to determine the cause. If a medical, physical, or personal problem is identified as a factor, the supervisor will refer the employee to the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) and to the appropriate personnel officer for counseling and assistance. If there are no extenuating circumstances, disciplinary action will be taken.

Page 5 of 11
Bulletin 4.4
Prior to taking disciplinary action, the supervisor will place the employee on sick leave restriction (see Attachment 5), which requires the employee to submit “proof of incapacitation”. The burden of proof is on the employee; if he or she fails to submit “proof of incapacitation”, as stipulated on the attached form, he or she will be considered AWOL. To place an employee on sick leave restriction, the supervisor must specify an effective date that is at least five working days after the employee received the restriction notice. The length of restriction may vary from one to six months. This may be extended if the employee has a history of excessive absenteeism and/or other justifiable reasons.
ATTENDANCE EVALUATION
Each employee’s attendance will be evaluated on an annual basis when performance appraisals are conducted. Supervisors shall, uniformly throughout Equipment Maintenance, use the twelve-month attendance chart (see Attachment 6) to evaluate each employee’s attendance. The official timeroll sheets should be used in completing the chart to ensure accuracy. The Attendance Review Chart is designed to provide an at-a-glance analysis of either an individual employee’s attendance up to twelve months or a group of employees on a monthly basis. This chart should be filled out according to timeroll reports submitted to payroll. In analyzing the chart, scheduled absences for vacation, legal and floating holidays, and other similar planned leaves are not to be used when determining an employee’s absenteeism.
