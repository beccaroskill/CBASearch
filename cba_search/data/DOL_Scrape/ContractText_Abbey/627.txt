a.	One dollar and twenty-nine cents ($1.29) per straight-time hour for the first twelve months following the contribution effective date for Clerks (‘‘Pharmacy Clerks and Pharmacy Technicians”), and one dollar and ninety Cents ($1.90) per straight-time hour for the first twelve months following the contribution effective date for Meat Cutters

In other words the employer payments in excess of the negotiated contributions will create future contribution suspensions that will be taken as soon as possible as long as the minimum funding concerns outlined above are met.

13.6 APPLICATION FOR EXTENDED AMORTIZATION EXTENSIONS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 412(e)
The Trustees shall cause the Trust Fund to apply for an amortization extension under Internal Revenue Code § 412(e).
In the event that the application under Internal Revenue Code § 412(e) is approved by the reviewing Government agency, the Trustees will adopt the following long term funding policy. In addition, the Trust Fund shall follow the recent guidance on how submit an application for amortization extensions under Internal Revenue Code § 412(e) including future changes that the Board of Trustees will have to consider (specifically future contribution increases as negotiated from time to time, future benefit reductions or some combination of the two).
"UFCIV- Northern California Employers Joint Pension Trust Fund Long Term Funding Policy
The co-consultants will produce with the annual actuarial valuations a seven-year actuarial projection with the goal of identifying future funding deficiencies (defined as where the negotiated contributions are not enough to satisfy the minimum required contributions under Internal Revenue Code Section 412). These annual projections will be based on the following:
•	Projections will take into account only negotiated contributions
•	Using the assumptions and actuarial methods in the then current annual actuarial valuation as jointly agreed to by the Fund's coconsultants
•	No unanticipated actuarial gains or losses during the projection time period
If the annual projection indicates any future funding deficiencies during the seven-year projection, the Board of Trustees is authorized and directed to amend future benefit accruals (or any other non-protected benefits), effective immediately, in order to eliminate the projected future funding deficiencies.
In the event that the contributing Employers are required to make any additional contributions above the negotiated contribution rates in order to avoid funding deficiencies, the contributing Employers will receive a dollar for dollar credit for additional contributions. When the Board of Trustees reduces benefits to eliminate the future funding deficiencies it shall take into account that these contribution credits will be taken as reductions in the negotiated contributions in the next plan year. In other words the employer payments in excess of the negotiated contributions will create future contribution suspensions that will be taken as soon as possible and the Co-Consultants will reflect this with the annual seven-year projections.
13
In the event that the application under Internal Revenue Code 412(e) is denied by the reviewing government agency, the Trustees shall not be required to adopt the above long term funding.
Any deadlocked Trustee motion relating to a reduction in benefits required under the long term funding policy shall be arbitrated on an expedited basis with the arbitration to take place no later than sixty (60) days following the Trust meeting in which the deadlock occurs."

b.	The Board of Trustees will instruct the co-consultants to look at situations such as, but not limited to if an Employer attempts to decrease their contribution rate after a period of contribution suspension. Such review and approval shall include a consideration of whether the contribution rate is sufficient to support the benefits promised, as well as any subsidy or equity issues, all as may be identified by the Go-Consultants to the Fund.

SECTION 18.	ADJUSTMENT AND ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES
18.1	For the purpose of this Agreement, a grievance is a dispute, difference of opinion, between the parties, and grievances of employees involving or arising out of the meaning, interpretation, application or alleged violation of this Agreement, including the arbitrability of all such matters. All grievances as defined are to be processed in accordance with the terms of the section.
The parties will share all factual details regarding a grievance (or pre-grievance issue) as early as possible in the dispute resolution process. All disputes that are resolved at store level shall be considered settled on a non-precedent setting basis, unless otherwise expressly stated in writing.
18.2	DISCIPLINARY GRIEVANCES: Pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement, any employee who feels he has been unjustly discharged or suspended shall file a grievance with the Union and thereafter within ten (10) business days of notice of the disciplinary action, the Union, if it desires to proceed with the grievance, shall notify the Employer or its Representative that an Adjustment Board shall be convened to hear the grievance. Within twenty (20) business days (Monday - Friday, holidays excluded) thereafter, the Union and the Employer shall meet as a Board of Adjustment, consisting of two (2) representatives of the Employer and two (2) representatives of the Union in an effort to settle the matter. The convening of the Adjustment Board may be waived or this time limit may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. If the Employer fails to meet with the Union within the time limits herein specified, the grievance will be deemed substantiated and the employee shall be made whole. If the Union fails to comply with the time limits herein specified, such failure shall be deemed to be a conclusive waiver of the grievance. The request of either party to extend the time limit for the convening of the Board of Adjustment due to extenuating circumstances will not be unreasonably denied.
Following the completion of step one as contained in the Letter of Understanding referencing Section 18, the Union’s request to hear a grievance through the Adjustment Board procedure may be denied by the Employer, and the Union may elect to proceed to arbitration. The Employer must notify the Union of such denial prior to the time limit or the extended time limit in which to convene Adjustment Boards as outlined in this Section. Adjustment Board requests will not be
15
unreasonably denied. Notwithstanding, the Union may request FMCS to mediate any denials for Adjustment Boards by telephone conference or as agreed, and the parties agree to accept the FMCS advisory decision as binding. In making such determination, the mediator shall take into account the overall relationship of the parties as well as the facts of a specific case.
If the grievance is not adjusted and is impassed, the Union, if it so elects, within twenty (20) business days following the meeting of the Board of Adjustment or denial thereof, shall proceed to arbitration. The Union’s intention to proceed to arbitration shall be communicated in writing to the Employer or its representative within the twenty (20) business day time limit specified above. For disciplinary cases only the following expedited procedure shall be utilized: A panel of arbitrators will be assigned by lot to each Union for a six-month (6) period. At the expiration of each six-month period, the arbitrators will rotate in the following order: 101, 373, 428, 648, 839, 870, 1179, and back to 101, etc. The arbitrators selected will provide the parties with all hearing dates in advance of each period of assignment.
The parties shall be allotted a minimum of twenty (20) days from date of request to prepare the case for arbitration. Discharge cases will be heard first on the agenda followed by suspension cases based on date of occurrence unless mutually agreed otherwise.
Each disciplinary case will be argued orally. Post hearing briefs may be filed by mutual agreement of the parties. Either party may request a court reporter at their expense; however, if mutually requested, the cost will be shared equally. Briefs are to be prepared and mailed within fifteen (15) business days from receipt of transcript with leave to extend by mutual agreement. A written opinion and award will be furnished by the arbitrator, within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing or receipt of post hearing briefs.
18.3	INTERPRETATION OR APPLICATION DISPUTES: Disputes as to the interpretation or application of the agreement shall be taken up by the party asserting it with the other party within twenty (20) business days of the date the asserting party has knowledge thereof. Said grievance shall be in writing, specifying in detail the basis for the dispute, including the applicable section(s) of the Agreement involved, to the best knowledge of the asserting party.
The parties shall have fifteen (15) business days in which to process and amicably adjust the dispute. By mutual agreement of the parties, the time periods provided herein may be extended.
If by the end of the period for amicable adjustment no resolution has been made of the dispute, there shall be fifteen (15) business days for the asserting party to request arbitration by an impartial arbitrator.
16
Within five (5) business days of the date arbitration has been requested, the parties shall move to select an arbitrator. Said selection shall be from the panel set forth above or shall be by mutual agreement. Should the parties fail to agree upon an arbitrator within the period herein provided, the arbitrator shall be chosen by lot from the panel named in Section 18.2 hereof. Failure of either party to meet within the time limits hereinabove specified, or failure to comply with the time limits, shall cause the dispute to be deemed substantiated or conclusively waived as the case may be. The request of either party to extend this time limit due to extenuating circumstances will not be unreasonably denied.
18.4	The parties may, by mutual agreement, proceed to FMCS to mediate unresolved disputes. The hearing shall take place within thirty (30) business days following the receipt of a written request from either party. Either parly may request a reasonable extension of time. The mediator will render a non-binding oral opinion at the conclusion of the hearing.
18.5	Each party shall in good faith divulge to the other party all available material facts at the time said party acquires knowledge thereof concerning the matter in dispute. Nothing contained herein shall require either party to supply documents which are irrelevant.
18.6	The award of the arbitrator or the Adjustment Board shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the Employee(s). The losing party shall pay the cost of the arbitrator. The parties agree that the arbitrator has the authority to determine appropriate proration of the cost in the event of a split decision and award. The arbitrator should be made aware of the requirements of this provision at the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.
18.7	The arbitrator shall not have the right to alter, amend, delete or add to any of the terms of this Agreement.
18.8	Interest at seven percent (7%) shall be payable on all money claims awarded by the Adjustment Board or by an Arbitrator, and such interest shall commence as of the date the complaint is first submitted to the Adjustment Board or when the parties meet to amicably adjust the dispute, whichever is applicable.
18.9	CLAIMS: In the case of a direct wage claim or a claim for contributions to employee benefit plans which does not involve an interpretation of any of the provisions of this Agreement, either party may submit such claim for settlement to either the grievance procedure provided for herein or to any other tribunal or agency which is authorized and empowered to effect such a settlement.
The Employer is not required to pay any wage claim or portion thereof retroactively for a period of more than six (6) months immediately prior to the date of the Employer's receipt, or written notice from the Union, of such claim.
17
The parties agree that Local 839 and Local 101 North Coast shall adopt the Bay Section 18 language in its entirety.

Section 5.8 -There is an understanding between the parties that the Unions may put up bulletin boards in the stores so long as it comports with Albertsons Letter of Understanding with Local 839 and that the materials posted on these bulletin boards are consistent with Section 5.8 of Local 428’s contract regarding official union notices. The Companies have the sole discretion to determine whether any such materials are “detrimental" to the company's interest.
Section 5.19 - The Union may select any employee(s) to be a SPUR. By mutual agreement, the selected employee(s) may serve as a SPUR for an initial period of up to six (6) months. Such leaves shall be requested and granted in writing. In the event the employee wishes to return to work prior to the scheduled end of the leave, the employer will be provided with at least two (2) weeks prior written notice. During the service period as a SPUR, the employee(s) will be considered to be on an approved personal leave of absence. After the service period ends, the employee(s) will be returned to his or her job or a comparable position with no loss of seniority. He or she will not, however, be credited any hours with the Employer toward advancement in the wage scale. He or she will be returned to the same wage as he or she made before becoming a SPUR and will be entitled to whatever benefits may be due under the terms of the documents and rules governing the applicable health and welfare and pension trusts.

In the interests of developing a more effective and efficient process to avoid grievances and resolve a backlog of currently deadlocked grievances, the parties commit to the following phased approach:
Step One:
For the first twelve (12) months following ratification, the parties will continue to schedule Adjustment Boards pursuant to the Agreement. During this 12 month period, the parties will take appropriate steps, including scheduling additional meeting dates to work towards the reduction of the current backlog of pending grievances. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) may be utilized at the request of either party. For the purposes of this Letter of Understanding, the foregoing is referenced as step one. Notwithstanding the above, step one will not conclude until the disposition of all impassed grievances have been determined.
To facilitate settling disputes amicably, the parties agree to fully explore possible joint training assistance from FMCS.
Step Two:
Commencing at the conclusion of step one, the parties will commence meetings no less than once every three (3) months through the remainder of the Agreement. The purpose of such meetings is to further the mutual cooperation of the parties in matters related to Section 18. These meetings may be cancelled by mutual agreement of the parties. The FMCS will be requested to attend these meetings at the request of either or both parties.
The following individuals, or their designated representative, will attend on behalf of their respective entities: Karen Casey (Albertsons); Frank Jorgensen (Safeway); Bruce Wright (Ralphs); for the Unions, the President of each Local or their designated representative.

In settling routine disciplinary and non-disciplinary cases handled by Union staff, written settlement agreements when requested, will be written as simply as possible for lay persons to understand. In these cases, decisions regarding what are “routine” cases as to which simplified settlement agreements are appropriate, are within management's sole discretion.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - JANUARY 23, 2005
INITIAL BENEFIT PLAN DESIGN SUMMARIES
The Bargaining Parties agree that the attached benefit plan designs identified as Benefit Fund Appendices A, B and C summarize the initial benefit plan designs that will become applicable to Active and Retired Employees for Plans A, B and C.
If the specified contribution is subsequently determined to be adequate to improve benefit levels (assuming the Plan will maintain prudent operating reserves), the trustees are authorized to improve benefits. Furthermore, if the specified employer contribution is subsequently determined to be insufficient to maintain the benefit levels outlined in Benefit Fund Appendices A, B and C and a prudent operating reserve, the Trustees are authorized and directed to reduce benefits to the extent necessary. Any such benefit modifications may be rescinded by the Trustees, if and when, the financial position of the Fund improves to so allow. The Plan will cover all medically necessary treatment, subject to current plan exclusions.
Except for those changes described in, required by, or necessary to implement this Article, and subject to the right of the Trustees to amend, modify or eliminate any Plan benefit or feature at any time as provided herein, the existing Plan coverages shall initially be part of the new Plan design. This provision shall not be interpreted, applied or construed to: (a) create any expressed or implied obligation to maintain or preserve any benefit or plan feature under the Plan; (b) create any vested entitlement to any benefit or feature under the Plan; or (c) limit or restrict, directly or indirectly, the right of the Trustees to make changes in those benefits or features when they deem it necessary or appropriate under the Plan and/or as a matter of fiduciary duty.
Annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits shall be reduced proportionately with the number of months remaining in the calendar year at the time the benefit changes are implemented for Plans A and B (including retirees).
The current Retiree Health and Welfare eligibility rules shall be modified as follows: any employee who has had five consecutive calendar years with no reported hours shall, in addition to other requirements, be required to accrue at least 10 years of Credited Service under the Pension Plan after such absence, in order to be eligible for Retiree Health and Welfare.
