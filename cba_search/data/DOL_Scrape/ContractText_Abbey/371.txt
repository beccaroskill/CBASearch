INTRODUCTION
The interests of Management and Labor in an industrial organization are mutual. Both are in the same business and the success of that business is vital to all concerned. Both Management and employees must work together to the end that the quality and cost of * the product will prove increasingly attractive to our customers so that the business will be continuously successful.
The basic interests of employer and employees are the same. However, at times employees and the Management have different ideas on various matters affecting their relationship. These differences can be ' peacefully and satisfactorily adjusted by sincere and patient effort on both sides.

Dear Mr, Bingham:
It is the policy of the Corporation to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the manpower, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve loKtself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors, This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of Corporation personnel in mind.
Very' truly yours,

21 Abbey Avenue Dayion, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr. Bingham:
During the current negotiations the Union discussed with the Corporation problems affecting the job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work.
During the course of negotiations, the Union expressed concern that in certain instances the work force in maintenance and tool and die trades particularly could be reduced through attrition and then work contracted out to the point where there was insufficient manpower available within the plant to perform the work, that the possibility existed for Helpers to be reduced to production jobs and work in their trades which they historically performed and which they were capable of performing could subsequently be contracted out for extended periods without recalling the Helpers to the skilled trades jobs from which they had been reduced; and that further there could be instances of skilled trades employees being permanently laid off and new work which they had historically per; formed contracted out for extended periods, instead of recalling these employees to their jobs.
The essential elements in the concern registered by the Union went to the question of job security.
150
Appendix "J-i " IContinued)
At times it is not practicable for the Corporation to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance and tool and die work, or contract it out. The Union recognizes that in making such decisions the Corporation must consider, among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines.
In our discussions we agreed that employees’ jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out, and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Corporation moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the performance of work which they have historically performed to produce its product and perform its services.
Accordingly, the Corporation states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work which adversely affects the job security of its employees and that it will utilize various training programs available to it, whenever practicable, to maintain employment opportunities for its employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. ,

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING - GOALS AND	-
OBJECTIVES OF JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS
The Corporation and the Union recognize that quality and operating efficiency are inextricably wed to job security, and that a high level of quality and operating efficiency requires mutual respect and recognition of each other’s problems and concerns. Accordingly, in addition to the Local JOBS Committee’s responsibilities for the JOBS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each Committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barrier's to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The local committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location’s operational efficiency.
Within six months of the effective date of the Agreement, each Local JOBS Committee will review with Divisional Management the overall competitiveness of the location’s products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing workforce and attract new work. Such plans must then be approved by the established National Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Committee.
At the national level, the Committee will have an equal number of Union, Divisional and Corporate representatives designated by the respective parties. The National Committee will oversee implementation and administration of these Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Plans. Members of the National Committee will meet jointly with Local Committees to
172
discuss the importance of job preservation and job creation, the reasons for the commitment to increase operational efficiency, suggest possible topics for consideration and encourage good faith efforts to develop and implement meaningful local plans. The National Committee will be available on an ongoing basis as a resource to Local Committees and will review progress at the local level at least on an annual basis.
In these efforts, it is recognized that a great deal of initiative and imagination will be required by the local parties. While not intended to limit such innovation, the following are examples of appropriate areas the local parties may address:	-
1)	Identification of investments in the facility or equipment necessary to improve product quality or operational effectiveness;
2)	the establishment of a team concept and/or pay-for-knowledge wage structure; .
3)	the identification of non-labdr cost savings and efficiencies;
4)	procedures and plans to review past outsourcing and outside contracting decisions, and ■ identify opportunities for insourcing and new busi-
ness;
5)	the examination of new forms of work organization, such as job assignments relating to Just-inTime or other quality enhancement systems;
6)	procedures to review supervisory staffing and support for the initiatives in this Job Security and Operational Effectiveness section of the JOBS Program;
7)	a realignment in skilled classifications to a number of appropriate basic trades to support the needs of the operation or location;
8)	the implementation of skilled trades team concepts;
173
9)	initiatives to reduce chronic absenteeism;
10)	procedures for improved access by the Local Joint Committee to product plans and other information affecting employment security and operational effectiveness, assuring confidential treatment of such information;
11)	the establishment of work standards on operations. that fully utilize employees;
12)	the examination of alternative work schedules which provide greater employment opportunities.
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes would not be effective unless agreed to by the local parties involved and approved in writing by the Labor Relations Staff of the Corporation. Such changes would be effectiveoniy at the locationfsj specifically designated.

APPENDIX "N
..	-	■ Sourcing
During these negotiations, the Union raised numerous concerns about the Corporation’s sourcing actions and their impact on employment opportunities. To that end, the Corporation will work with and assist the Union to preserve jobs, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action, and to create jobs for Protected employees and laid off employees. It is an objective of the Corporation to grow the business and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as the source of its products. During the life of the current Agreement, the Corporation will advise the Presi-. dent of the Local Union relative to sourcing recommendations, including the number of potential jobs affected. Additionally, data regarding incoming and outgoing work will be given to the Union in a quarterly meeting. In this manner, the parties can judge the success of mutual efforts toward improved job security. The Corporation agrees to incorporate the procedures and structure outlined herein when making sourcing determinations during the current Agreement.
The rationale for sourcing actions-will consider the criteria of quality, technology, cost, timing, statutory requirements, occupational and related environmental health and safety issues, the impact on long-term job stability, the degree to which the Corporation’s resources can be allocated to further capital expendi-' tures, the overall financial stability of affected facilities, and the impact on related facilities. Other factors considered by the Corporation before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on employment, and job and income security costs, on both a short and long-term basis. Such criteria shall give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on Delphi Automotive Systems-USWA represented employment ’ levels and the job and income security of Delphi Automotive Systems-USWA represented employees. The
177
National parties will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used to address sourcing issues. In developing this criteria transfer pricing profits will not be considered in making sourcing decisions. Only appropriate return on investment and burden will be considered. The Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing, ' ‘
If the Local Committee cannot resolve a sourcing issue, the local Union may file a grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure; In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of USWA members:	.
1.	Insourcing	.	’	.
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee - identifies as that which might be performed competitively at this Delphi Enerev:and Chassis Systems location based on the criteria outlined above. To assist in this process, the Union will be furnished a complete list of work similar to that currently performed at the location that has been (1) outsourced from that location or (2)‘is currently performed by non-Delphi/ USWA suppliers for Delphi Automotive Systems, These lists will be updated and expanded to include supplier expiration dales and will beTumished within 90 days following the effective-date of the Agreement, Thereafter, the parties will initiate efforts, to insource particular work consistent with the afore- ■ mentioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff. • .	. '	'
If it is established that certain work can be per-, formed competitively by the above criteria Manage
178
ment wifi adopt the Committee’s proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within 30 days of the decision to bring thework in-house.
2.	Outsourcing	*	.	-
Outsourcing as used herein means the Corporation's sourcing of work from USWA-DgJphL AWJhPliYe Systems locations including work connected with current, new or redesigned component products. When a request for quote is initiated, the Union will be advised in writing by the Corporation. At such time as the quotes have been received and an outsourcing decision is contemplated the Union will be given 150 days' written notice or longer advance notice when • possible. The notice will include the reason for the outsourcing, a description of the work involved, the number of jobs affected on both a short-term and long-term basis, if known, arboth the affected facility and any other Delphi Automotive Systems-USWA represented facility, the identification of the sourcing authority, and all financial information. Proposals to keep the work in-house will be made by the Union within 90 days of the receipt of the written notice.
a.	When such an outsourcing decision is contemplated and within the control of the Local Management, the written notice will be given to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. A copy of such notice will be sent to the President of the Local Union and the	for
(he Corporation.	.
b.	When such a contemplated outsourcing decision is initiated by any other sourcing authority of the Corporation at a level external to the affected location(s), that sourcing authority will provide sufficient advance written notice to allow the designated management representative at the impacted location
179
to comply with the notification procedure. The written notice will be given to the Chairperson of the Local Union Shop Committee. Also, a copy of such notice will be given to the President of the Local Union and to the Executive Director. Industrial Relations.
Additionally, Union input will be sought by the Corporation and its Divisions as early as possible in the outsourcing decision-making process. The intent of the evaluation period and the Union input being sought as early as possible is to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the long-term job stability of employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
c.	The sourcing authority will'not enter into a' contractual relationship with a non-Pelphi/USWA supplier until such time as the designated management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by die JOBS Committee, has taken place. ’	.
If it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix, Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep the work in-house. The Union shah thereafter obtain any necessary approvals or ratification within 30 days of the decision to keep the work in-house.	'
d.	The Corporation agrees to a full disclosure to the Union of the procedures utilized in sourcing activities.
3.	Future Product Sourcing
Union input to early sourcing decisions will be sought by the Corporation’s Divisions. In that regard, the Union will be notified in writing by the appropriate Division upon approval of “Project Charter’’ to
180
proceed for those subsystems or components that are included in the Product Development Process. Following the notification, the President of the Local Union shall have the responsibility for overseeing the interface with other USWA represented Delphi Automotive Systems facilities.
The implementation of this process should provide the parties with the mechanism to take advantage of every opportunity to use internal resources and to create jobs for Protected employees.	■
The commitments expressed in this Appendix are intended to contribute significantly to. our cooperatively working together to provide Delphi Automotive Systems employees in the United States improved job security by growing the business.	.
Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. Bingham:
Various documents in the prior Agreement pertained to matters of health and safety. Pursuant to our discussions during these negotiations, it was agreed to consolidate the highlights of those documents into a single comprehensive letter for the purpose of clearly setting forth the parties joint commitments to health and safety principles;	"
A. Noise Abatement Program	>
The joint parties recognize that the Corporation has had a comprehensive Hearing Conservation and Noise Control Program for the purpose of continuous incremental improvements in noise reduction. In accordance with this program, each plant is required to have a Noise Control Committee. The Noise Control Committee will consist, of representatives from Plant Engineering, Operations, Medical. Industrial Hygiene, Finance, Purchasing, the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee and others as deemed appropriate by the Plant Safety Review Board, such as certain skilled trades, personnel, and/or other employees. The Noise Control Committee has the responsibility to seek input from plant personnel in identifying noise sources and potential ways to reduce noise levels.
The Noise Control Committee will:
Ensure audiometric testing is performed for employees exposed above 85 dBA,
206	.
■4
t Perform an annual evaluation of the noise abatement plan and provide recommendation for improvement to the Plant Safety Review Board, ‘
• Ensure reports follow formaiS-Specified io.Delphi Hearing Conservation and Noise Program SL 3.0,
t Ensure npy and rebuih eqiiip.mgnr meet the Delphi Sound Level Specification SL 1,0.

B.	Working Atone	'	’*
The parties have discussed the Corporation’s policy regarding the assignment of employees to tasks in isolated locations or confined closed-entry spaces. The
207
Corporation explained that when work assignments involve situations hazardous to art employee, appropriate precautions will be taken in accordance with safe work practices, including air sampling and ventilation when necessary, communications systems, personal surveillance arrangements and, as required, adequate support personnel. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices,
C.	No Hands in Dies Policy
The Corporate policy has been and continues to be ‘No Hands in Dies', Implementation of ‘No Hands in Dies' in the plant requires provision for expendable hand feeding tools, slide feeds, sliding bolsters, automatic or semi-automatic operation, die cutouts or other means and procedures whereby the operators are not required to place their hands into the point of operation. In addition, well disciplined procedures for use of die blocks and safety lockouts and tags for maintenance and setup personnel are imperative. An intensive orientation program for operating supervisors, and process and facilities engineers may also be advisable.
D.	Health and Safety Representative Training
The Corporation advised the Union that an em-ployce appointed as full-time Health and Safety Representative pursuant to Section 111 of the Memorandum who may wish to enroll in courses of instruction relating to health and safety at approved educational institutions will be eligible to apply for tuition refund for such courses subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporation’s Tuition Refund Program, ‘	-
E.	Lockout Policy
During the current negotiations the LISWA and Delphi Automotive Systems discussed their mutual concern regarding fatalities, and serious injuries to
208
employees, including operators performing repair, service and maintenance activities on machinery and equipment. The parties agreed that, to be effective, the Lockout-Energy Control program must be universally implemented and enforced throughout the Corporation,
In addition to be effective, the parties reaffirmed that the elimination of the potential for injury from hazardous energy is critical to worker safety.
It is the policy of Delphi Automotive Sys'cems and endorsed by the USWA that: Lockout is required where employees may be exposed to hazardous energy which could cause injury. Exposure means that the employee is in a position to be injured by released energy,
Where’an employee is exposed to potential injury from expected machine energy/motion, the exposure must be eliminated. If the exposure cannot be eliminated, the machine will be locked out.
Each location will maintain an effective LockoutEnergy Control program which will apply to all employees based on implementation guidelines.
F.	Safety Talk Program .
The parties are aware that many individual plants and Divisions have developed safety talk procedures which are effective in their design and manner of presentation and which in some cases make use of devices. The review of these programs is a proper subject .for discussion by the National. Committee so that this information may be communicated to other Delphi plants.
G.	Training
Delphi Automotive Systems agrees to provide additional joint health and safety training to enhance the
209
safety awareness, hazard recognition, and, technical skills of Delphi Automotive Systems employees covered under the terms of this agreement. The parties recognize that in order to provide for basic uniformity, the National Joint Committee on Health and Safety will develop guidelines to be used by Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems - Home Avenue and Vandalia and the Local Health and Safety Committee to design training programs to meet local needs. The National Joint Committee on Health and Safety will develop a system to review and approve health and safety training programs. '
Training efforts will be initially concentrated in'the-following areas:
*	Skilled trades safety training; \
*	Union representatives and supervisors;
•	Local Health and Safety Committee;
•	Hazard communication training, where required, pursuant to a jointly developed program; and
•	Initiate pilot employee involvement safety training programs where appropriate.
H. Research
The National Joint Committee on Health and Safety will be responsible for evaluating the need fur research. The results of research conducled. wil! only^be used for purposes specifically authorized by. the National. Joint Committee on Health and Safety.
The National Joint Committee on Health and Safety will be responsible for prompt communication of research findings to affected employees. '	' "	.

One Union and one Management person will beassigned for the duration of this agreement to administer the elements of this strategy, In support of the joint-strategy to reduce fatalities, the parties agree to conduct research on serious and fatal accidents. Results of this research will be used for purposes specifically authorized by the National Joint Committee.	-
211
M.	Chemical Exposures
During these negotiations, the parties discussed concerns related to control of chemical exposures and employee health. Delphi advised the Union of ongo-. ing efforts designed to provide control of materials, equipment and layouts used in production processes where employes health and/or safety may be affected.
ThsloM-Eattics.agreedlJiat prior to imptemafiiag new chemical technology/processesand changes to current chemical processes, reviews wilt be made at the appropriate level fj,e.„Plant Safety Review. Board. Divisional Review Board, and National Joint Committee}, for awareness and. discusskHLOf safety related ia^ssjiadfof concerns-	.
The parties also agree to explore the concept of training hourly employees to assist in monitoring various aspects of the work environment and who would perform such duties under the direction of a Delphi industrial hygienist. A sampling plan will be devised where appropriate in conjunction with the local Joint Committee. Samples collected will be analyzed under the direction of a Delphi Industrial Hygienist.
Furthermore, Delphi Automotive Systems and the USWA recognize that the Hazard Communication Program is an outstanding example of the benefits derived from joint participation. The parties agree to explore methods to improve labeling provisions sor that the best interests of the employees are maintained.
N.	ERGONOMICS	'
DgJphLAafsmiljyg^^ will establish an ergonomics program at USWA represented locations utilizing guidelines established between Delphi Automotive Systems and the International Union, USWA. The purpose of die program is to deal coop
212
eratively and constructively with the problem of Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTD's) in the workplace.
Delphi Automotive Systems has re-committed to Fixing jobs that are, identified as presenting a corresponding and documented risk of employee injury. The parties recognize that effective corrective action for jobs which present a documented risk of injury, require the timely use of sound judgement in combination with training, experience, and the following:
j Analysis results from the risk factor checklist and secondary analysis tools (when utilized):
*	Injury/illness history of both the job and the worker:
t The history and future plans of the job.
Also: seats, chairs and mats can be considered appropriate solutions to control specific ergonomic risk factors. The Corporation agrees to leave such devices in place when they are provided in accordance with the guidelines in the USWA-Delnhi risk factor checklist,
This joint program will:	,
*	Establish a joint local ergonomics committee at each represented location which will implement, coordinate, review, and follow-up the ergonomics program. Each committee will consist of the plant manager and shop chairperson, who will oversee the program, and a working committee which will supervise the program, ensure job analysis, and follow-up work orders.
•	The Union Health and Safety representative will serve as co-chairperson of the working committee.
•	Management shall select a co-chairperson from among a medical staffer, a supervisory employee, an engineering employee, or the Management Health and Safety representative, with the others serving as committee members. The Union shall
213
also select one committee member from'each of the following groups: skilled trades employees, Union shop committeepersons, and production employees.
•	Where there is no full time health and safety representative, or where agreed to by the National Parties, the plant manager and the Union person functioning in accordance with this Agreement for health and safety matters shall conduct a program to reduce risk factors for CTD. Each of these plants will be required to prepare and submit to the National Joint Committee for approval a written plan for implementation and conduct of its program with a description of the allocation of resources. The National Joint Committee after approving each plan will monitor the progress and compliance with the approved plan.
•	The Ergonomics Committee shall meet at least monthly at plants where there is a full time Union Health and Safety representative. The National Joint Health and Safety Committee shall resolve any dispute concerning the timing/frequency of meetings at other locations.
•	Facilities will allocate sufficient persons and resources to accomplish the objective of the ergonomics program. The allocation may vary depending upon size arid nature of the operations. The ‘ Ergonomics Committee shall recommend such allocations necessary to accomplish the evaluation and correction within-the-specified time frame..The ■ -initial allocation-of such resources will address .’operations identified through injury/illness analy-
.. sis. Thereafter, the Ergonomics Committee will al-* locate ’Such resources according to priorities set taking into" consideration the-symptotris questionnaire, subsequent injury/illness analysis, job analysis and employes input. Upon request, the National
214
Joint Committee shall assist the Ergonomics Committee in determining proper allocation of persons ■ and resources,	.	,
The tasks of the Ergonomics Committee will be accomplished through the ergonomic coordinators with the assistance of ergonomic monitors, if necessary, Hie Ergonomics Committee will request sufficient numbers to be appointed to accomplish the objectives of this program within the timespeci-fled elsewhere. Reduction of time and effort by these individuals shall be based on completion of the tasks referenced by this Agreement and approved by the National Joint Committee,
• A written job analysis program will be developed to include the analysis of OSHA Injury and Illness Records, Worker Compensation Reports, and work related S & A data. Additionally, each facility will administer a symptoms survey and evaluate each production and maintenance job using the basic or supplemental job checklist. Training for-the Ergonomic Committee analysis'will be designed and provided by die National Joint Committee;
* Based on die results of the above referenced job analysis program, each facility shall implement feasible measures to control ergonomic risk factors. The Ergonomics Committee in comtinctton with input from tbe workers, engineering, supervision, skilled trades and others, gs appropriate, will make - teconimfibdatiofis for .^rag.gjiYoctipnsj£La£e^ ■ dance with the current ergonomics process. Once it . is determined through th; jg[ee.d_iipon gigopaillics
; process that a job requires cQrrection..recommen-'dations for corrective action will be developed us. ing the results of the jointly agreed upon analysis tools,DelphiMatiufacturing Engineering Ergonomics Guidelines may be referenced for information regarding areas for potential improvement, Delphi
215
Manufacturing Engineering Ergonomics Guidelines is currently undergoing revision and will undergo future revisions as deemed appropriate, by the Corporation. A good faith effort will be made to accomplish abatement of identified ergonomic hazards at a particular job or work station within six months of completion of job analysis. At those locations where ergonomically high risk aspects of a job have been identified by a systematic analysis (use of basic job checklist, injury/illness analysis) prior to establishment of the Ergonomics Committee as described in the Memorandum of Agreement, they will be abated as described above. ■
' ♦
•	Ergonomic factors will be considered with regard to new. equipment and processes.'Employees assigned to such operations will be monitored for symptoms and signs of CTD and, upon’medical " confirmation, job analysis and feasible corrective action will be taken.	■
•	The Corporation recognizes that informal agreements have been reached at a number of facilities to conduct ergonomic activities at the facility level. The parties agree that these activities should continue and be integrated into the process of the abovedescribed program. It is not the intent of the parties to reduce currently existing efforts in ergonomics while the job analysis system is being developed and implemented.
•	Training will be conducted for 'personnel at all Delphi.Automotive Systems facilities represented by the US WA. Specifically, awareness training will ■_be conducted forall production and maintenance employees with special training to be conducted - for select medical staff, and those who will train
plant personnel. Awareness training will be developed and made available, to the plants by the National Joint Committee. This training will be com
216
pleted at each location within one (1) year of the-completion of the plant’s written ergonomics plan..
*	The establishment of a medical management program for the early detection and treatment of CTD’s, The program will provide certain physical exami-■ nations, workplace walkthroughs, by medical/place-ment personnel, and placement for employees with medical restrictions.	.
•	An audit procedure will be established to review the effectiveness of the ergonomics program. The audits will be held on a timely basis and rhe information shared with all designated parties,
•	Include the systematicintroduction as determined by the; National Joint Committee of plants and facilities to the various phases of the program to facilitate proper communication, training and control of ergonomic factors. Plants and facilities will include Ergonomics in their business plans' to reduce or eliminate CTD risk factors. The Local Ergonomics .Committee will have access to the por-' ■ tion of the business plan that addresses ergonomics. The medical management program for the evaluation and treatment of CTD risk factors will be instituted concurrently at all Delphi-USWA facilities.
Delphi Automotive Systems recognizes the importance of identifying and addressing ergonomic issues early in the development process and values the importance of receiving input from plant ereo--nomic-personnel. Feedback from the Ergonomic Committee on site specific ergonomic issues and practices will be provided to the design process at the earliest appropriate planni'ng/design stage; This process will be evaluated and reviewed during the life of this agreement, Delphi Automotive Systems will take into account existing jointly established
217
analysis methods when developing internal ergonomic design recommendations for advanced product programs.
•	As the systematic introduction of the ergonomics program occurs, the National Joint Committee will determine the timetable for completion of the job ‘ analyses of those jobs identified through injury/ illness analysis. Job analysis of the rest of the facility jobs will be completed within the time frames established by the National Joint Committee. The job-analysis will be conducted using the USWA-. Delphi Risk Factor Checklist, as a first level screening tool which includes theUSWA-Delphi lift guideline as identified in the Practical Ergonomics Training (PET). Work stations or job assignments for which injury or illnesses related to CTD risk factors have been recorded, or for which symptoms have been reported and confirmed, will receive first priority.
*	The Local Ergonomics Committee may petition the National Committee for termination of a portion of the program. Such petitions may be filed on a showing that the program or phases of the program have been satisfactorily completed. The National Joint Committee (NJC) will make a determination based on the data submitted.
•	USWA-Delphi Health Promotion. Following negotiations, the USWA-Delphi Joint Committee will
. appoint a joint health promotion task force to develop a program to enable employees to discover risk factors which contribute to hypertension (high blood pressure), high levels of fat (cholesterol) in the blood, overweight, tobacco smoking and other health risk factors such as Acquired Immune Defi-
' ciency Syndrome (AIDS) and to take action to minimize the impact of these health risk factors. It is anticipated that the various elements of this jointly
218

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN DELPHI AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS AND USWA
EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Delphi Automotive Systems. Delphi Energy a»d Chassis, Home Avenue/Vandalia and USWA. Local Union 87, express their determination to work jointly-with personal problems including substance abuse and mental health among Delphi workers and their families. •	.
Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by medical, public health authorities, Delphi Automotive Systems and the USWA as a disease. Excessive use of alcohol or other drugs by workers impairs their ability to function, in their lives and on their jobs. It contributes to increased absenteeism and tardiness and deterioration of job performance. This in tom disrupts work schedules with consequent dissatisfaction among the majority of workers who are sincerely trying to do conscientious jobs. The combination of factors is recognized as having a potentially damaging effect on plant efficiency and endangers the job security of the worker. .
The causes of personal problems including alcoholism, drug-dependency and mental health are not well understood and cures are difficult. Nonetheless, Delphi Automotive Systems and the USWA believe that constructive measures are possible to deal with these problems which are a major cause of family breakdown and are related topersonal breakdown and violence in the community.	'	■
1.	Objective 1 ■ ’	-
Hie objectives of this joint effort are to help employees and their family members develop healthier life styles. Further, the purpose of this program is
225
designed to help prevent the development of personal problems'and provide access for treatment and after care for those already affected;
Delphi Automotive Systems and the Union acknowledge that neither management nor the local union working alone can always provide the level of motivation required by employees experiencing personal problems. As a result, joint efforts are imperative in encouraging die employe^ to seek treatment, as needed, to respond successfully to treatment, and to maintain a resolve to avoid further personal problems.
II.	Guidelines for Administration	,
Delphi Automotive Systems and the Union will engage in a cooperative effort and function administratively in consultation with an EAP Committee com-prised'of management and local union personnel which will review the efforts of the local EAP Team on a regular basis. In this regard it is important to:
I.	Generate a climate at Che plant level which will eliminate the effects of the social stigma associated with mental disorders, alcoholism and drug dependency, and other personal problems which act as a barrier to employees-seeking help to resolve personal problems.	,	-
2,	Insist that management and the local union at ail levels exercise their best efforts toward the objective of earlier identification and motivation of the employee to accept EAP services.
' 3. Assure confidentiality in working with the employee. .
4. Assist tn developing educational and informational materials for use at the plant level.
226
Ui. Local Employee Assistance Program Administration
The local EAP Committee consists of the Plant Manager or a designated representative, the Plant Personnel Director, the President of the Local Union and the Chairman of the Shop Committee. It will be the responsibility of this Committee to review on a peri- y odic basis the local Employee Assistance Program.
Delphi Automotive Systems and the Union will designate representatives of management and representatives of the local union to work jointly on these problems. Among the responsibilities of the local EAP Team are:	.	•	.	'
I. In cooperation with the central review organization (CRO), the carrier and the local central diagnostic referral (CDR) agency, survey community resources to determine the availability of appropriate1 treatment facilities and cost of treatment. Where facilities are inadequate or unavailable, undertake efforts io improve the situation.
* ' 2. Help employees understand that they may consult on a confidential basis with the local EAP Team,' or an outside central diagnostic and referral (CDR) agency, concerning their problem.
3.	Arrange for union benefits representative to be available to explain to the employee and others who* may be involved the, extent to -which ‘recommended treatment qualifies for payment under Delphi Health Care Program. ■	■
4.	Establish and maintain active aftercare and followup programs.. Help;employees.understand the therapeutic benefits of self-help groups and engage EAP participants in these group activities. , iWiLAulsm^^ edge that:	...	.
L
227
1.	Nothing in this statement is to be interpreted as constituting any waiver of Management's responsibility to maintain discipline or the right to invoke disciplinary measures in the case of misconduct which may result from or be associated with the use of alcohol or drugs or personal problems. The union may exercise its right to process grievances concerning
- such matters in accordance with the Delphi-USWA Agreement.
2.	During or following treatment the employee should not expect any special privileges or exemptions from standard personnel practices; and
3.	When a leave of absence is necessary so that an employee may undergo medical treatment for alcoholism or drug dependence or personal problems in or from an appropriate facility in accordance with this t program, and when the employee has voluntarily submitted to such treatment and provided the employee has unbroken seniority, a sick leave of absence will be granted pursuant to the Main Agreement and the employee will be eligible for benefits in accordance with the Delphi Health Care and Life and Disability Programs as negotiated with the Union.
IV.	Additional Understanding
During the course of 1996 Negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions over a wide range of EAP * subjects. The following represents the highlights of those discussions and the commitments arrived at between the parties;
1.	The parties have agreed that a key ingredient in combatting personal problems lies in education, early identification and early intervention. Accordingly, the National Parties will develop education and training programs directed at all levels of local management, local union, and the work force. Costs of
228
these activities and the implementation of any recommendations will be funded by Joint Training Funds.
2.	The National Parties will recommend standards for USWA-Delphi Employee Assistance Programs.
3.	The National Parties have also agreed to continue efforts towards facilitating the professional development of individual plant EAP Representatives. In line with professional development, the parties commit to expand professional development efforts to include mandating certifications of future EAP representatives. .
V.	EAP Representation
1,	The Employee Assistance Representative will be scheduled to report for Employee Assistance representation purposes during overtime, part-time or temporary layoffs, or inventory when 50% or more of the people he&hg represents on his/her shift are scheduled to work.
2-	During overtime hours, when less than fifty percent (50%) of the people he/she represents on his/ her shift are scheduled to work, he/she will not function pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding, but will be scheduled to perform EAP activities if he/ she would otherwise have work available in his/her equalization group.	■ .
V	I, Drug Testing
Because of'the recent emergence of a substantial body of legislation requiring drug testing of many of the Corporation’s employees, both represented and non-represented, the parties have had extensive discussions surrounding drug testing and have agreed to the following:
L
229
L All drug testing performed will be conducted in accord with applicable laws mandating or regulating such testing; such as, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, or Department of Defense.
V	II. Conditions of Employment Guidelines -For Those Employees in the Employee . Assistance Program Whose Seniority has 1 been Broken	.
When Employee Assistance Program participants or other employees suspected of being in need of EAP services return to work, the following can be agreed upon between the bargaining unit representative, Labor Relations, the EAP team and the employee. .
The specific items to be include^ will depend bn the individual case-and should be developed to meet the particular circumstances. Accordingly, items one ■ through five may be recommended for inclusion in a condition of continued employment by the joint EAP team.	'	■
■	L Participation in in-plant self-help meetings. Length of participation that will be required and frequency of meetings can be either specified in advance or left up to the discretion of the EAP team.
2,	Participation in outside self-help groups and mandatory completion of an aftercare plan which might include antabuse recommended by a treatment facility and the EAP team.
'	3/Mandatory cooperation' in' follow-up' and monitoring for a period of time specified by EAP team members.
4.	Periodic scheduled urine screening when if is felt this procedure could be of value in monitoring and encouraging abstinence. In cases of positive find
230
ings, the results must be confirmed by a second testing method.
S.	A specific period of total non-use of alcohol or other drugs can be agreed to between the parties. The EAP team and the employee must concur with this probationary period which is defined as not less than six months or more than two years and it must be understood by all parties that resumed use could result in termination of employment during this period.
The above items (one through five) will be administered jointly by the EAP'team for those employees returning under, these conditions. Any conditions of continued employment agreed to by Management, the Union and the employee are considered contractually binding and non-compliance could result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The employee’s previous disciplinary record and action which may be taken for further misconduct will be matters reserved to the actual settlement of any grievance(s) involved and/or will be resolved between die bargaining unit representative and Labor Relations. ■ ■	■ ■	■ ■	■ ■	*
The seniority status of the employee must be specified as either a new hire or reinstatement of former seniority. If seniority is reinstated, all rights and privileges .whkh would normally accrue in line with the reinstated seniority under the terms of the Main or local agreement must be granted.

During the current negotiations, the parties discussed and noted that in many instances the early indicators of an employes suffering from medical and personal problems such as those associated with substance abuse, for example, are manifested in disciplinary situations involving'violations of the Shop Rules. In those initial stages it is generally the first line supervisor and the district ’ committeeperson who are first exposed to the potential of such underlying causes behind employes behavioral problems.	■
Although the parties acknowledge Management’s responsibility to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where violations of the Shop Rules occur, it is also recognized that local management and union representatives at all levels are necessarily charged with the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral problems may be linked to medical and personal causes and to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. In many cases this could be accomplished through referral to the local Employes Assistance Program Committee.

Dear Mr. Bingham:
The following is the text of Delphi Automotive Systems written and published policy regarding sexual harassment.
“Delphi Automotive Systems has had for many years -a written and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based on age, race, color, religion or national origin, has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.”	,
‘"All employees are expected to deal fairly and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse of the dignity of anyone, through ethnic, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct, is offensive employes behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verba! or physical conduct of a sexual nature,”
“All Delphi employees are entitled to a work environment in which words and actions do not have even the appearance of disrespect. Sexually-oriented jokes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people and, therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. Delphi
236
i Automotive Systems facilities must be free of hostil-. ity resulting" from sexually-oriented behavior. It is the ■ responsibility of management and each employee to 1 maintain an environment free of hostility,”

'	“As in the case of other unfair employment prac-
tices, if you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment, you may bring your concerns to the atten-:	tion of either your immediate supervisor, personnel
, ’ director or representative, or you may utilize appropriate and existing internal complaint procedures,”
i	Delphi Automotive Systems and the USWA are in

■ SUBJECT: Orientation Program
Dear Mr. Bingham:
Men and women enter the work force today with little or no knowledge of what is expected of them as employees and as union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not been adequately prepared to cope with industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
New employees come to Delphi Automotive Systems with little or at best incomplete information about their employer and their union. They have little knowledge of the extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in collective bargaining between the USWA and Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems over a period of years.
Many new employees may be unaware of the commitment of Delphi and the USWA to fair employment practices and to the application of the Agreement to all employees without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability or sexual orientation. They are not familiar with basic contract provisions covering such subjects as transfers, promotions, shift preference and seniority. They may be unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid skilled trades jobs through the Apprentice Program. They tend to be unfamiliar with the obligations of the employee to his/her job, to the union and to his/her
244
employer. Many are unaware of the importance of regular attendance, quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by all in getting the job done. Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their job and their relationship to their union and their employer.
New employees usually have little knowledge of the long history of the USWA and the administrative structure of the USWA. They do not understand about their relationship to the union, about the initiation fees and dues requirements and their rights within the union.
Frequently, they have never seen (he inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, die.nature of the product and how it is used.	'
A properly developed and conducted orientation procedure designed to create an "awareness of the dynamics of the labor-management relationship, and the years long effort to build a community of interest in resolving labor-management problems through orderly procedures....” might serve the best interest of the employees, (he USWA and Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems.	'
Accordingly, Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems will, in cooperation with the Union, undertake development of a joint pilot orientation program to be presented to new job applicants prior to the time they start their jobs.
The content of the orientation program will be developed by Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems and the Union and implemented on a pilot basis. This experience could form the basis for the adoption and implementation of an on-going program.
Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems and the Union will determine how the various portions of the orien
245
tation program would be implemented. Some subjects might most appropriately be presented by a Management representative, some by a Union representative, and others by both Management and Union representatives.
The orientation program would not be subject to the grievance procedure and could be terminated by either the Union or the Company in the event that the program was not being carried on in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of the program as established by the parties. The joint orientation program would be limited to those subjects agreed to by the Company and the Union and the establishment of such a program would not limit any other communication by Management with its employees or by the Union with its members.
The Company and the Union will commence development of an orientation program following ciirreht Negotiations.

PLANT EQUAL APPLICATION COMMITTEE
December 8, 1999 Mr. Dennis Bingham
President, Local 87	-	’
USWA, AFL-C1O/CLC

Dayton, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr. Bingham:	.
During the course of current negotiations, Delphi Automotive Systems and Local 87, USWA reaffirmed the matter of the Company’s letter of December 10, 1973, regarding the Plant Equal Application Commit* tee. In line with that fetter, the Parties have agreed to the following:	.	-
For many years the Company and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination be* cause of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability or sexual orientation and sexual harassment and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated Paragraph (4a) in the Agreement that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Delphi Automotive Systems and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (1) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbhration procedure as the exclusive contractual1 method for prompt resolution of all claims of violation of Paragraph (4a), (2) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (3) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the following pur-
250
poses; (a) .toincrease understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forms simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, non-productive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice.	'
Accordingly, the parties agree to establish within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Agreement. a Plant Equal Application Committee.
The Plant.Equal Application Committee will be composed of-three. (3) representatives of the-Union, and two (2) representatives of the Company. The three representatives of the Local Union shall consist of the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee of the Union arid the Local Union President or Vice President. ‘
The .two (2) representatives of Management shall be the Plant Manager, or a designated representative, and a member of Management at the plant active in the Company’s equal employment opportunity program. The Plant Equal Application Committee will meet on a scheduled quarterly basis, and shall have the following duties: .
a. Recommend ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving claims of violations of Paragraph (4a).	'	‘	■
■ Suggest guidelines for Union and Company, representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievance alleging such claims.	•
251
c.	Maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state agencies for purposes set forth in the second paragraph of this letter.
d.	Review and discuss ways and means of implementing Delphi Automotive Systems policy regarding employment of individuals with disabilities set forth in the letter from Bernard J. Quick to Local Union 87 setting forth this policy.
e.	Recommend means for determining the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
When the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union is an employee of the plant wages will be paid for lime spent attending the quarterly meetings.
Copies of the minutes from these meetings will be made available to the Union.
In addition, the Chairperson will be permitted to leave work up to four (4) hours per week during straight time hours to conduct in-plant investigations of written grievances alleging a violation of Paragraph (4a) of the Agreement.	,
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral responsibility for assuring that all Delphi Automotive Systems employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom from discrimination as set forth in Paragraph (4a) of the Agreement. Consequently, the function of the Plant Equal Application Committee shall be advisory, consultative and cooperative. While the Company and the Union will welcome the recommendations the Committee may make, the Committee may not commit either party to a specific course of action. However, the Union agrees that
252
it will encourage its members to utilize the grievance and arbitration procedure as the means of resolving claims or complaints against the Company which allege a violation of Paragraph (4a).

Dayton, Ohio 45417	■ .
Dear Mr. Bingham:
During current negotiations, the parties discussed at length the problems involved in recalling large masses of employees back to work from layoff in situations such as the addition of a shift at a plant. Both parties recognized the mutual interest that would beserved by management notifying laid off seniority.employees in advance of such known mass recalls to facilitate the orderly recall when it in fact occurs.
Accordingly, when mass recalls are anticipated'suf-ficiently in advance, management and the local union should discuss the matter of a pre-recall notification to employees in an attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory method to implement the notice,.
It is mutually recognized that such notice or lack of notice will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any terms of the Agreement or any local agreements. Moreover, any agreement reached with respect to advanced notice of anticipated recall will not be cited or relied upon by an employee or the Union or the management as a basis for a claim for or denial of back pay.	.

Dear Mr. Bingham;
During the course of current negotiations, the Company and the Union agreed that the letter regarding expeditious grievance handling would again be published. The text of that letter is as follows: .
J]	f	. . r J • -	, *	•	,	.
“During 1967 negotiations fora new'Collective Bargaining Agreement, Company representatives and the Local Union 87 USWA Negotiating Committee discussed at length problems encountered with the administration of the Grievance Procedure. The parties reaffirmed their mutual determination that the purpose of the Agreement.as stated in Paragraph (I) is to provide orderly collective bargaining relations between the Company and the Union, to secure prompt and fair disposition of grievances... It was recognized that the filing of duplicate grievances or grievances which have no merit interfered with the efficient operation of the Company’s business. In addition, the Union and the Company agreed that this type activity and delays occasioned thereby and the holding of grievances at any step of the Grievance Procedure is contrary to the best interests of the employees and the parties.
“The parties affirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure that the Grievance Procedure will not be misused.
“The Company asserted that the provisions of the Grievance Procedure provide for a definite time limit
256
within which grievances must be appealed, otherwise they are not subject to further appeal. At certain steps of the Grievance Procedure, it is possible by mutual agreement to extend these appeal time limits.”
Because of the unprecedented volume of grievances filed during the term of the October 5, 1964-Agreement, time extension for appeal of grievances has been invoked in literally hundreds of cases, delaying-the processing of grievances, a number of which had merit, in the Procedure. The Company stated further that it is imperative that both parties work to eliminate grievances which neither serve the interest of.the employees or the parties arid that the parties, except in special situations, assume their respective responsibilities for appealing grievances within the time limits stipulated irithe Agreement.

During the 1967 negotiations for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement, Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems complained that in certain locations in the plants some committeepg^ous made little or no effort to resolve grievances at Step One of the Grievance Procedure, Further, it was the Company’s complaint that grievances had been filed in unprecedented numbers again in certain locations and investigation revealed the’high volume resulted from duplicate grievances and grievances which did not appear to reflect a bonafide complaint of an employee or group of employees.
The Local Union advised the Company that it fully subscribes to the principles set forth in the new provisions of Paragraphs (19a) and (19b) of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement which, in part, reads:
,, the prompt adjustment of grievances is desirable in the interest of sound relations between the employees and the management.”
Grievances should not be unduly delayed at any Step of the Procedure, whether such delay is occasioned by a committeeperson or a supervisor refusing or failing to meet his/her responsibility.

Accordingly, this letter serves to confirm the agreement reached between rhe parties that:

In addition, in the case of probationary employees, the Union stated that some were separated because they initiated production standards complaints.
It is important for Delphi AumQtiyft JySigJOS to retain its right to transfer employees in order to maintain and improve efficiency in our operations. It is also important to respect the right of employees to file legitimate grievances regarding production standards or disciplinary action. •	.

During negotiations leading to the current Agreement, the parties discussed pre-apprentice training as one method of achieving our common goal of bringing a greater number of members of minority groups and females into the apprentice training program. It is evident that we share a serious concern about the establishment of effective methods of achieving this desirable goal.
Accordingly, the Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee upon determining that a plant’s skilled trades workforce is under-represented bv minority groups and females, will consider matters pertaining to pre-apprentice training as it relates to achieving the above objective as well as approve any such training program for which points can be awarded under the Apprentice Selection Procedure.

During the current negotiations, the Union raised the question of apprentices being assigned to work alone. The parties agreed that good judgment and a rule of reason should be used when making these assignments,
As a result of these discussions it was concluded that, consistent with existing training methods and facilities in the plant, apprentices should not be assigned to perform work without a joumeyman/woman being present unless the apprentice has been trained to do the job; has been instructed in the proper safety procedures; and is considered competent to perform the assignment. Experienced journeymen?women will generally be available to assist the apprentice in many of his/her normal floor assignments until that level of competence has been reached. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices. Problems in this regard are a matter for review by the Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.

This will confirm the understanding reached during the current negotiations that within a reasonable period after a laid off apprentice has been recalled lo work, such employee will be paid an incentive bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses, required pursuant to Paragraphs (62r)(8)(e) and (62r)(8)(g), in which’the employee was enrolled at the time of layoff. 1
In addition, with prior Management approval and arrangements with the school, apprentices whom Management anticipates recalling to the apprentice classification prior to the expiration of the school term may be enrolled for one term and become eligible for an incentive bonus on the same basis. .
This incentive bonus will amount to a figure to be arrived at by multiplying the number of class hours in each course times the employee’s straight-time hourly rate less the amount, if any, paid to the employee for such related training prior to layoff.

Inter Organization
Date: Decembers, 1999
Subject: Testing for Helper Openings
To: Management Apprentice Committee Members
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the many tests which have been used in the selection of employees applying for jobs as Helpers. As a consequence of these discussions there is now mutual recognition that certain types of tests which have been used in the past may be of little aid in die proper selection of employees for Helper openings. On the other hand, there is also recognition that where tests have been used, appropriate aptitude and mechanical comprehension tests have been helpful in the selection of Helpers.
Examples of the latter tests are the Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test (to measure understanding of and ability to learn physical principles) and die Minnesota Paper Form Board tests (to measure ability to perceive spatial relations).
As an outgrowth of these discussions, the Company has decided that reasonable standardization in the use of tests for Helper applications where tests are used for this purpose, is desirable. Accordingly, a program will be undertaken by the Company to accomplish this result and to assure that the tests being used are of the type referred to hereinbefore.
It is not the Company's intent in inaugurating this program to expand or to limit the use of tests in the selection of applicants for Helper openings. If Management decities to. use tests in the selection of Helpers, the tests to be used and the reasons why they are

During the current negotiations the Union discussed the appropriate administration of Paragraph (62xX2) by the Company.
These concerns centered around the hiring of skilled trades employees as journey men/women without sufficient checking by Management of the documents presented by the applicants to assure they qualify for such status in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (62x)(2). They also discussed that in some instances Management shifted the blame to the Union when such an employee had to be released because, upon further investigation, the information upon which Management relied to hire the individual did not meet the criteria of Paragraph (62x)(2).
In response to these concerns the Company stated that when proof of journeyman/woman status is not clearly established such documentation will be furnished to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the matter will be thoroughly investigated before an employee is hired. Additionally, the Company assured the Union that any explanation concerning the reasons a newly hired journeyman/woman employee must be terminated because of failure to meet the requirements of Paragraph (62x)(2) is to be based on those factual reason and not on the fact that the Union may have questioned the matter.	,

Dear Mr. Bingham:
During the current Negotiations, the Union com-■	plained that procedures set forth in Paragraph (62y)(4)
'	are not being satisfactorily implemented by Manage-
ment in many instances.
'	This letter is intended to clarify the intent and pur-
pose of this provision:
1. The "advance discussion", except where time and circumstances prevent it, will take place '	“Prior to letting the contract for the performance
i	of maintenance and construction work", before
।	any decision has been made as to whether the
..	work should be contracted out. The “advance
1	discussion" will include information as to “why
;	Management is contemplating contracting out
.	the work’’. It is evident that except as noted
■	above, since Management is only “contemplat-
■	ing contracting out the work” when the “ad-
vance discussion" takes place, Management I	should not have made any decisions concerning
■	whether or not to contract out the work before
such “advance discussion" is held.
2.	Management should advise the Local Union of ■	the “nature, scope and approximate dates of the
work to be performed and the reason or reasons ’	(equipment, manpower, etc.) why Management
।	275
L	•
is contemplating contracting out the work.” This information is related to the letter originally issued January 15, 1968, and contained in the Main Agreement as Appendix “J”. That letter makes reference to “manpower skills, equipment and facilities” and also as to whether the Corporation “can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits.” Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a particular contract should be let out or not, it is necessary that Management advise the Local Union in the “advance discussion” concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decision making.
3.	If in the “advance discussion” it is clear that Management is only “contemplating contracting out the work”, and if in addition all the pertinent information as noted above is supplied to the Local Union, then Local Union representatives will be given a better opportunity “to comment on Management’s plans” and will also give an opportunity to Management “to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.”
4.	In addition the Union commented that in certain instances plant Management requested and contracted for maintenance service on leased equipment, and extended warranty arrangements or service contracts were being purchased which impacted the job security of seniority employees in skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while Paragraph (62y)(2) covers the “fulfillment of normal warranty obligations by the vendor”, warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts are not covered by these provisions. Rather, such arrangements or

service contracts covering work normally and historically performed by represented skilled trades employees are to be considered in the same manner as contracts for the performance of maintenance work and such decisions are covered by the provisions of Paragraph (62y)(3) of the Main Agreement,'

Dear Mr. Bingham:
'During die recent negotiations there were discussions concerning subcontracting which resulted from inadequate communication about such matters. As a result of these talks, the following commitments have been reaffirmed with Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems management. ’*	; J‘
During the current agreement the Union claimed labor relations problems in the.plants concerning subcontracting matters had been experienced. ■	.
In- many of these instances, the root cause of the problem was the lack of communication.

■■ The Corporation intends to achieve world-wide competitive status utilizing not only the skills of our employees, but also the suggestions and ideas of the
278
iple and the unions as to how work can best be .complished at the lowest possible cost with the highest possible quality and on time. “
This approach to managing the business should be utilized throughout the Corporation at all levels; production, skilled and technical Obviously, such discussions should be held in a timely manner with appropriate Management and Union personnel
Accordingly, an appropriate representative of Management in each personnel department should be responsible for having adequate information about each sub-contract for the performance of skilled trades work covered by the subcontracting provisions of the agreement. After determining that requited discussions have been held, this representative should approve die contract prior to its being let to an outside firm. This will require complete understanding and cooperation of your contractual requirements by the plant's engineer. - ing and purchasing personnel. •	'
. Plant relationships can only be improved by open, „ ■’ frank communications in all areas, particularly in car-v tying out our subcontracting responsibilities.
Mr. Battenberg and the Delphi Strategy, Board are [ in complete agreement that extraordinary attention must 1 be given to our managerial responsibilities in this area.
I have been assured by the leadership of USWA Local ’	87 that we will have their full assistance in bringing
about improved plant relationships when we have installed full advance communications relative to business decisions involving subcontracting.
Furthermore, with regard to tool, die and represeated engineering work, including prototype and prc, prototype work, other Delphi Automotive-Systems locations have implemented a process of notification, review, and competitive analysis which’ has enabled the parties to consider and serve the interest of skilled
279
tradesmen/women in job security, as well as Management’s needs for competitive and timely performance of this kind of work. Therefore, the Corporation and the Union are in agreement that they will encourage local Management to implement this approach in order to avoid conflicts over the subcontracting of such work.

Dear Mr. Bingham:
During the current negotiations, the Union complained there has been inconsistent administration of the “normal warranty” provisions of Paragraph (62y)(2) of the Main Agreement. The Union indicated that plant management insist on warranties beyond normal periods of ‘ time and that our skilled employees are not assigned to the new equipment or machinery until long after it has been in the plant. This does not provide the opportunity for our own skilled trades to learn how to keep such equipment operating effectively.	■
The Corporation informed the Union that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that the equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract. ,■	■
The Corporation agreed to remind the Divisions that the training and expertise that will be required of our own skilled trades must also be kept-in mind as an important business consideration. The transition from vendor to our employees and the training and timing of the transition are important pans of that consideration.

The Corporation and the Union agreed that content- । plated discipline should be discussed in a calm man-	i

21 Abbey Avenue Dayton, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr, Bingham:
The parties had numerous discussions during the current negotiations regarding the serious problems caused by absenteeism. The disruptive nature of absenteeism severely impacts Delphi Automotive Systems ability to compete effectively in the market place thereby jeopardizing job security. Over the years the parties have utilized various approaches to address the absenteeism problem with limited success. The union has suggested that a different method of managing attendance problems would be more effective than the current employee attendance procedure. The union contends that attendance problems are best addressed by the first line supervisors from direct responsibility for dealing with absentees. In this regard the union urged that the emphasis for correcting attendance problems be returned to the shop floor.
Accordingly, the parties agreed to cancel the existing Employee Attendance Correction Procedure and remove Shop Rule #6: “Absence without reasonable cause" and Shop Rule #7: “Reporting Late for Work” from the current disciplinary system and administer them separately and individually utilizing the current disciplinary system progression. All other Shop Rules would be administered utilizing the current disciplinary system progression. Further the parties agreed to jointly monitor on a periodic basis plant absenteeism data to assess the effectiveness of the traditional ap-
285
preach and where appropriate make recommendations where traditional methods have proven ineffective.
In canceling the existing Employee Attendance Correction Procedure the record of occurrences will be eliminated with the effective date of the 1997 Main Agreement.

PRINCIPLES OF FAIR DAY'S WORK PLAN

Mr. Dennis Bingham
President, Local 87	'
USWA, AFL-CIO/CLC
21 Abbey Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr. Bingham:
During negotiations on the conversion of the Incentive pay plan to a non-incentive Fair Day’s Work Plan the Union, on several occasions, asked Management what work performance would be expected of the employees under the concept of the new plan;
In consideration of the Union’s question, following hereunder is Management’s response:
Each employee will be expected to:
(1)	Work at a normal speed or tempo.
(2)	Follow the prescribed method of job performance.
(3)	Effectively use the facilities (tools, equipment, etc.) provided.
(4)	Stay’on the job except for reasonable personal needs,
(5)	Maintain quality requirements.
(6)	Willingly accept improvements and changes in the job operation.
(7)	Inform supervision when they have difficulties or are out of work. '
In discussion with the employees concerning standards of production, supervision will emphasize the foregoing factors of the fair day’s work concept and
290
will refrain from talking about number of pieces per hour or pieces per day as a measurement of the ■ employee’s responsibility to produce a fair day's work.
■ Unfortunately, as in the past, under the incentive pay system, some employees will refuse to follow instructions or, by their conduct or uncooperative attitude, will require corrective discipline.
Initially, with the effective date of the Fair Day’s Work Plan, it is Management’s intent to show a degree of tolerance for the employee who is cooperative with the new Plan but has been accustomed to work habits different from those outlined under the Fair Day’s Work Plan.	’
Such employee will be reminded of and urged to fulfill his/her obligations under the Plan. Obviously there may be some employees who will not respond to urging and will have to be dealt with more severely.'
No employee who is sincerely trying to give a fair day's work effort will be criticized but will receive additional training and instruction over a reasonable period of time to assist him/her in overcoming difficulties he/she may be having with his/her job performance.
In the event the Company and the Union are successful in negotiating the non-incentive pay play, I would suggest, for the first few weeks, a close line of communication between your office and the Labor Relations Section for the purpose of keeping both parties advised of any serious problems that may arise in the early stage of the Plan. ■
The content of this Company statement, when combined with the Supplemental Agreement providing for the conversion to a straight hourly rate pay plan, substantially covers the points of concern expressed by the Union in negotiations and should serve as a reply
291
to any inquiries you may receive from your membership relative to the Company’s administration of the Fair Day’s Work Plan.
This statement is intended as an addition to the information already presented to the Union.

OVERTIME POLICIES A
Inter Organization
Date: December 8, 1999
Subject: Overtime Policies	'	’
To: All Members of Supervision with .
Employees in the Local 87 Bargaining Unit -
As part of the current negotiations, Delphi Automotive Systems informed the USWA that it is the Corporation's intention to continue its previous policy regarding overtime practices.
There was considerable discussion in these negotiations about the claims of the USWA that too many employees who are required to work overtime over extended periods are not excused from overtime work assignments even though they have legitimate reasons to be excused,	.
The Corporation pointed out that overtime serves a number of functions essential to the effective operation of Delphi Automotive Systems tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances, overtime must be worked at one or more plants in order to permit other plants to meet their schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant short.work weeks for many-employees. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet model change deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer de-, mand for Delphi Automotive Systems products. ;
Both the Union and the Corporation recognized that the nature of the business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a Advisor’s group is needed to man the jobs which are working overtime. When less
299
than a full complement of employees is needed, it is usually practicable for the Advisor to excuse employees who do not wish io work and confine the overtime assignments to those employees who do wish to work.
In situations where there are sufficient employees available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employees who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused from doing so, insofar as practicable.
Employees who are required to work overtime should be given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary.
An individual employee’s personal problems in connection with working overtime should be given careful consideration and his/hg£ individual needs should be recognized. The individual employee’s request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period of time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the employee’s request is granted, he/she will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employee can make his/her personal plans accordingly. Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employee will only be made with his/her consent.
Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employee who is not assigned to a necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days, will be excused from work on the next following Sunday provided he/ she has requested the day off before the end of his/her shift on the previous Wednesday.

Dear Mr. Bingham:
During the'course of these negotiations, the parties discussed at length and mutually agreed to the need for increased competitiveness of Delphi Automotive Systems in the marketplace.
Together, the people of Delphi Automotive Systems have worked to improve product quality. This spirit of cooperation has resulted tn substantial improvement in the quality of the Corporation’s products. It is recognized that achieving and ‘maintaining world-class quality levels is an ongoing effort and commitment that must be shared by all employees in order to be successful. The Delphi Automotive Systems process for total quality is the Quality Network -the one process for customer satisfaction. Although management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Network, it is recognized that USWA leaders and members are valuable partners in the implementation of this process. It is further recognized that the Quality Network provides the foundation for jointly achieving and maintaining the necessary quality levels in everything we do and will result in customer satisfaction.	. .
As a result of these negotiations, the parties have restated their commitment to the successful joint implementation of the Quality Network process with emphasis on the beliefs and values, customer satisfaction, continuous improvement, and elimination of waste in all aspects of our business.
302
i
In recognition and support of the importance of this joint effort and the need for communication and coordination, the parties agreed to develop a Plant Quality Council consisting of the President of the Local Union, Plant Manager, Personnel Director, other appropriate Management Representatives and the Quality Network representative appointed by the Local Union, It is recognized that the duties of such Quality Network Representative are to assist in the implementation of the Quality Network process and related action strategies as directed by the Plant Quality Council, Additionally. the Quality Network Representative will support the principle that all employees have a responsibility for product quality by exercising due care and diligence in performing their duties.
The Plant Quality Council will implement a process for employees to voice their product quality conceru(s); independent of the grievance procedure, based on the following;
*	Empioyee/Supervisor discussion to attempt .to resolve concern, consulting as required with plant quality resources,
*	If unresolved, the District Committeeperson, if requested, will assist in the resolution of the employee’s concern. ■
•	The Supervisor and/or District Committeeperson may request the assistance of the Quality Network Representative to participate in the resolution of the concern,
•	Thereafter, if unresolved, the concern may be discussed with the Plant Quality Council at the next meeting.
*	The Quality Network Representative will advise the Plant Quality Council on the status of quality concerns referred to him/her.
303
•	Feedback regarding the status of employees concerns will be provided to the originating supervisor and employees by the Plant Quality Network Representative,
•	During overtime hours, such Quality Network Rep-■resentative will be scheduled to perform Quality Network related activities if so directed by the Plant Quality Council and they would otherwise have work available in their equalization group.
Finally, during these negotiations the parties discussed the necessity that all Delphi employees must take individual responsibility for product quality. Management will provide employees with the appropriate training, methods, systems, materials and equipment in an appropriate environment to perform their work. It is then incumbent upon employees to exercise diligence and properly perform their work to produce the highest quality, customer-valued products. It is only through personal commitment from every Delphi employee that we will satisfy our customers and maintain job security for all.

The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable. In particular, the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced production requirements to USWA-' Delphi Automotive Systems plants in the event of overall market declines. The Corporation agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical. .
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with the local seniority agreement and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the current Delphi-USWA Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a dif-
307
ficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of determining SEL related protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, arid in turn, just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of vehicle components that compete with or act as replacements for vehicle components produced by Delphi Automotive Systems employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation’s production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section 1(0 of the JOBS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local JOBS Committees adequate notice of any'impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the extent to which such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of SEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to SEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume re
308
total of 500 employees. The SEL plant number remains at 4,100.
(2) Plant B (5,000 SEL-eligibie employees) is not the sole source of Product Y, which is also produced in Canada for the U.S. market, in Plant BC. Plant BC supplies one-fourth of the U.S. demand for Product Y. An economic downturn in the LIS, reduced demand for Product Y by 160,000. In accordance with SEL guidelines, volume related employment reductions cannot exceed Plant B’s share of predownturn volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 units, causing layoffs of 2,000 , workers. Plant B's SEL remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open Bank positions. !
‘ Product Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. The Corporation decides-to produce 30,000'of those units in Plant B and the rest in Canadian Plant BC. The increase in production is not accomplished in proportion to pre-layoff.production shares; to comply with SEL, the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the 500 employees required for the pick up in production.-
• Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction of a new U.S.-built Delphi-Automotive Systems or a ndn-allted company product not sold by Delphi Automotive Systems, sales of another Delphi Automotive Systems-manufactured product may decline, and production of the latter product must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph i(£) of the Program.
310
la ted declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive.
• Market Related Conditions - included in this category is customer preference of one product over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built Delphi. Automotive Systems, product that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive imports or joint venture products or any other product sold in the U.S. by Delphi Automotive Systems but not produced in a Delphi Automotive Systems plant.
- Example of Market Related Conditions
(1) There is a decline in economic activity which depresses sales of Delphi Automotive Systems products. Lower production levels require the layoff of employees. Plant A. employing 4,100 &EL eligible employees, is the sole source of Product Z for the U.S. market; it is required to lay off one shift, or 2,000 employees. The plant’s SEL number remains at 4,100 including 2,000 open positions for laid-off employees.
While the plant is down to one shift, the Corporation decides to outsource Product X. which reduces employment requirements by 250 employees per shift. Two hundred fifty (250) employees are placed oh Protected employee status. There is no impact on the SEL numbers.
U.S. demand picks up to pre-layoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100. As the second shift is called back and . die' plant is back to pre-downturn production levels, an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which now leaves a
309
content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program.
• Non-Delphi Automotive Systems Commercial Customer Preference - Cancellation or declines in product volume for Delphi Automotive Systems manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such volume reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program.	'
- Examples of Non-Delphi Automotive Systems Commercial Customer Preference
Plant A produces heavy-duty cranking motors for off the road construction equipment. Volume is reduced as a result of a decline in the construction industry. One hundred fifty (150) employees are laid off; 150 open SEL positions are established.	:.
. At the time production is back to pre-layoff ■ / levels, the Corporation introduces two robots ' which replace 25 employees. According to SEL guidelines, all of the 150 employees are re-• called from layoff, 25 of them are assigned to Protected employee status, and the SEL number remains equal to its pre-layoff level.
* Non-Delphi Automotive Systems Produced Products - If sales of a new or replacement product manufactured by an allied company for Delphi Automotive Systems, that competes with a product manufactured by the Corporation, results in reduced sales of the Corporation - manufactured product, the action would not be volume related and layoffs under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program would not be permitted.
312
- Examples of Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Customer Preference
(1)	A new U.S.-built Delphi Automotive Systems product (or any other new non-allied company product which is not marketed by the Coiporation) is introduced. Sales of Product X decline by 50%, and assembly must be curtailed. The necessary reductions in employment are made through layoffs, keeping the SEL number at the plant at the same level.	■
(2)	Battery Plant C, employing 1,400 SEL-eligible people, produced half of the batteries for Product X; the other half are produced at a Corporate plant in Mexico, The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico, litereafter, in accordance with the JOBS guidelines half of the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event are assigned to Protected employee status, and the other 350 employees would be laid off. The SEL at Plant C remains at 1,400 including 350 open volume related positions.
• Faulty Product - Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Related Delphi Automotive'Systems product volume may also decline. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph J(£) of the Program.
* Changes in Retail Preference - Delphi Automotive Systems volume may decline because of customer preference shifts - in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference shifts to large car; option preference swings; high product
311
■ sidered volume related declines underjhe Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the wheels would not be considered like or similar components,
(2) Plant B receives a brake hose that has couplings assembled from a USWA-Delphi Automotive Systems plant and brake hose that have couplings assembled from a non-USWA Delphi Automotive Systems plant. The brake hose are used interchangeably and would be considered like or similar components. Therefore, any „ volume declines in brake hose assembly production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered volume related.
As implied by these examples, there are many variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework within which Local and National JOBS Committees may review the applicability of Paragraph 1(C) to volume reductions.
If a Local JOBS Committee cannot agree on a situation being defined as volume related, the matter may be appealed to the National JOBS Committee for resolution.	.	.

- Example of Non-Delphi Automotive Systems Produced Products
The Corporation outsources a product that it markets in competition with Product W manu-factored by Delphi Automotive Systems employees, This results in reduced sales of Product W. Employment requirements are reduced but this ■ event is not covered under Paragraph I(Q) of the JOBS Program and the layoffs are not permitted, This protection also extends to employees producing USWA-Delphi Automotive Systems components which are manufactured for Product W.
• Delphi Components or Materials
It is recognized that reduction in vehicle production will often be accompanied by reductions in component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from a USWA-Delphi Automotive Systems and a non-USWA Delphi Automotive Systems plant, production declines at the USWA-Delphi Automotive Systems plant will only he considered volume-related to the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
- Examples:
(I) Plant A receives hard plastic steering wheels from a USWA-Delphi Automotive Systems plant and softurethane steering wheels from a non-USWA Delphi Automotive Systems plant. A volume decline occurs in hard plastic wheels because of customer preference for soft urethane wheels. Such reductions would be con-

Dear Mr, Bingham:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the problem created when local management is reluctant to recall laid off employees to perform work of known short-term duration because under the ternis of the 1982 Agreement such employees regenerate costly benefits.
As a result of these discussions, changes are incorporated in the current agreement which delay regeneration of certain benefits. In response to those changes Ute Corporation assured the Union that local Management would discuss with the Local JOBS Committee plans to recall available laid off employees or hire other laid off Delphi Automotive Systems employees to fill such short-term openings.

Dear Mr. Bingham:	.
During current negotiations, the parties discussed problems that arise when laid off employees working at permanent jobs, in other Delphi Automotive Systems plants are recalled to former locations to fill openings .considered at the time to be temporary. It was determined to be mutually beneficial for such employees to remain on their present jobs. Accordingly, it was agreed that such employees would not be recalled or rehired under such circumstances.
Furthermore, if laid off employees working at permanentjobs with outside employers are recalled to fill openings considered at the time to be temporary, these individuals who desire to be bypassed under the provisions of this document should notify the appropriate employment office.	.
In this regard, solely for the proposes of calculating the periods relative to breaking seniority and exhausting rehire rights at their respective plant pursuant to Paragraphs (5 J e)( 1) and (62d)(5), such employees shah be considered as having accepted recall to their former plant on the date such work became available and returned to layoff status at such time as the period of temporary work is completed.

President	‘	■
Local 87, USWA, AFL-CIO/CLC	.

Dayton, Ohio 45417	’	.
Dear Mr. Bingham:
During these negotiations the parties discussed at length the need to focus our current joint program representatives on specific programs designed toras-sist our employees and the management in implementation of an improved working environment.
Over the years, we have agreed to a number of different joint program representatives appointed by the International Union, USWA, and, in some cases, by the local management and union leadership to cany out and administer certain negotiated agreement programs in the following functions; ■	-
•	Health and Safety
•	Joint Activities
•	Placement
•	Employee Assistance Program
•	Human Resource Development	-
•	Joint Training
•	Quality Network
Each plant in Delphi Automotive Systems, depending on employee population, may have employees assigned to the above functions. Each time new programs have been negotiated, people were assigned to per
331
form the tasks associated with each, program to the extent that we now have several well-trained experts in those fields. The parties recognize that over the years priorities have shifted and, as a result, there is a need to carefully analyze the programs that currently require increased emphasis, such as, employee assistance, health and safety; etc. As a result, the parties have concluded that these well-trained resources can now be deployed or reassigned to programs requiring special attention.
It is recognized that each plant location has its own unique culture and needs; therefore, the local joint leadership group (Plant Manager, Personnel Director, Local Union President and Local Union- Executive Board) will determine where their current full time representatives will be allocated to best serve the employees of the organization. It is recognized that at some locations additional representatives may be required to perform tasks associated with the newly determined local focus and at others less. In any event, the total number of new and current full-time joint program representatives shall not exceed the number provided for below;
Plant Population Up to 200 201 to 400 401 to 600 601 to 1,000 1,001 to 5,000 5,001 and above	Number of Representatives 1 2 3 4	' Ratio of 1:250 Ratio of 1:275
In the case of bargaining units between 1,001 to 5,000 and 5,001 and above, the number of representatives in a given bargaining unit will be determined by the number of represented employees (active, temporary layoff and Protected) divided by the appropriate ratio number. Where the fraction of the result is .5,
332
and above, the number will be rounded up to the next highest whole number and where the fraction is less than .5 rounded down to the whole number.
Nothing in this agreement limits or is intended to interfere with any local mutually agreed upon projects or initiatives falling outside the scope of this document that may provide additional staff resources to meet the specific objectives of the local parties.
Following the effective date of this agreement, each plant will submit an updated plan for redeployment of these resources by February 1, 1994 in accordance with specific guidelines issued by the Corporation. Such plan will include the names and assignments for each of the local representatives assigned to Joint Programs and will be forwarded to the Corporation Labor Relations Staff for approval prior to implementation. Likewise, as individual plant needs and priorities change, the local parties are afforded the flexibility to submit revised plans for approval,
' When plant population changes occur which would 1 increase or decrease the number of representatives, such population changes must be in effect for a period of six consecutive months before such adjustment is made in the number of representatives, in which case such adjustment will be made at the conclusion of the six month period. In the event such population change results from the discontinuance or addition of a shift, the opening of a plant, or the cessation of a plant’s operations, the adjustment in the number of representatives will be made within the first twenty working days following the first day such population change occurs. Other situations involving a sudden significant change in the number of employees at a location may be discussed by the Corporation and the Union.
When a reduction or increase in plant population calls for a change in the number of representatives,
333
the local parties will be require!! to submit a revised deployment of resources plan for approval!
It is understood that the Representatives redeployed in these locally determined areas of special focus and attention may require additional training. It is agreed that such training will be provided utilizing National Training Funds subject to the approval of the National Joint Activities and Training Committee.
it is agreed that such representatives shall function in accordance with governing provisions of the Delphi-USWA Main Agreement germane to their area of focus.
Longer range, the National Joint Activities and Training committee will establish a joint process aimed at effectively consolidating, simplifying, integrating, focusing and achieving better utilization of Joint programs at the plant level.	-
The spirit and intent of this document is to provide increased focus on joint employee programs and to more fully utilize the experience and talents of the representatives assigned to joint programs. The parties are committed to working together in a spirit of cooperation to improve our relationship and the effectiveness of our joint programs. The result of such cooperation will improve the working environment in the plant for ail employees.	.
Any problems relating to the implementation of this'document may be raised by either patty and it is understood that any necessary modifications may be made by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the Union.

■ STATEMENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
During current negotiations, the President of USWA Local 87 raised the issue of job security for USWA-represented Delphi Automotive Systems employees.
Historically, the parties have recognized that continuing improvement in the standard of living of represented Delphi employees depends upon technological progress, better tools, methods, processes and means of manufacturing, as well as a cooperative attitude on the part of all parties in such progress,	.
The Corporation is mindful of the Union’s concern regarding job security in the USWA bargaining unit and how 'such might be affected by new or advanced technology. Accordingly, jbe Committee on Technological Progress will meet periodically and will discuss the introduction of any new technological processes and the possible impact on job security for USWA-represented employees.
It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at Delphi Automotive Systems. -
Accordingly, where as a result of the initial introduction of new or advanced technology it is anticipated that an impact on the job security of USWA-represented employees may occur, the Management members of the Committee on Technological Progress will raise the matter with the Union members of the Committee. Such discussion will take place as far in advance of the implementation of the technological change as practicable. The Management will at that time describe for the Union the extent to which such technological changes may affect the job security of represented employees. The Management Committee
335
members'will'affmrd the Union Representatives an opportunity to comment on the Management’s plan and to give appropriate weight to those comments in light of all attendant circumstances.
The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility that new, technologically impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it. In view of the parties’ interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, as part of the discussion, the parties shall seek to identify appropriate, specialized training programs so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel.

Dear Mr. Bingham:	,
. During the discussions leading to the JOBS Program in the 1993 Agreement, the parties addressed the desirability of having a mechanism to send Protected employees home in situations where a large group of Protected employees exists thus making it impractical to find meaningful assignments,	,
The parties agreed that within 120 days of the effective date of the Agreement, they will develop a mutually acceptable Pre-Retirement Leave, Program that would permit the utilization of Protected employee position. Such leaves would be paid at 85% of straight time pay.	.	'	‘
Eligibility shall be limited to employees who would be eligible for a regular early retirement based on attaining 30 years of service within twenty-four (24) months of participating in a pre-retirement leave. Upon attainment of 30 years of service, the participating employee will retire. The National JOBS Committee is authorized to make jointly approved modifications to the program, as necessary.
Employees on pre-retirement leaves are considered to be Protected employees under the JOBS Program and will receive the same insurance benefits.

Doc No. 69 ' GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND
PROPER IMPLEMENTATION
December 8, 1999
■ Mr. Dennis Bingham
President, Local 87
USWA. AFL-CIO/CLC .	’
21 Abbey Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr, Bingham;
During the discussions that led to the 1990 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties held lengthy discussions regarding the Grievance Procedure and its proper implementation. Both parties acknowledged that the Grievance Procedure has worked well over the years in resolving problems when it was properly administered as outlined in the Main Agreement.
The Union claimed that in some instances, the Grievance Procedure provisions have not been properly applied relative to the intent of the Main Agreement. Specifically, the Union remarked that at certain times grievances were allowed to accumulate at the various steps of the Grievance Procedure and/or were not answered in a timely manner at the lower steps of the procedure. The Union further claimed that in some cases Management representatives were not available for or were unwilling to schedule regular grievance meetings. The Corporation stated their concern that at times, Union Representatives demanded answers to grievances before Management had an opportunity to investigate the charges contained in the grievance.
As a result of the foregoing, the parties reviewed the contents of Document No. 22 and Document No. 23 and reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to ^assure that grievances will not be unduly delayed nor allowed to accumulate at any step in the Grievance
339
Procedure in any plant. Furthermore, it was recognized that both parties have the responsibility to meet regularly on grievances in accordance with the terms of the Main Agreement and that such meetings should not unnecessarily be postponed or delayed. In this regard, the parties agreed that complaints in this area will be handled under the provisions of Paragraph (la) of the Main Agreement. Before such problems are referred from the plant, however, the situation will be discussed between the Chairman of the Shop Committee, the President of the Local Union and the Plant Manager and Personnel Director.

USWA-DELPHI MEMORANDUM OF COMMITMENT -
TO PRODUCT QUALITY
During.the past several years, the Corporation, in cooperation with USWA leadership, together with the people of Delphi Automotive Systems, have worked together in a spirit of teamwork to improve product quality. This spirit of cooperation has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality of the Corporation’s products and services. ■
Further, the parties recognize that the production of the highest quality, customer-valued products is essential to secure the Corporation's position in the market and assure job security. The Corporation stated that high quality products have to be the result of a total quality process if Delphi Automotive Systems is to achieve its vision of being “Recognized By Our Customer as The Best Supplier!”
Delphi Automotive Systems process for total quality management is the Quality Network - the one process for total customer satisfaction. Although Management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Network, it is recognized that USWA leaders and members are valuable partners in the development of the process, the action strategies, and its implementation plans.
Such participation is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, exemplified by the institution of quality councils at the plant and divisional levels. Further, the. parties - during discussion of this document have restated their commitment to the Quality Network process- and to the successful implementation of this jointly developed quality strategy. This process includes continuously improving the quality of everything we do and
341
eliminating waste in the manufacture of products and in services provided, and as a result, will serve to enhance the job security of all Delphi Automotive Systems employees.
It is recognized that the point where product design, technology, and process and materials come together and must work in harmony is at the worker/supervisor level in the organization. High quality products result from a well managed process that motivates employees to work together within a spirit of teamwork to continuously improve customer satisfaction. In this process, it is recognized that seeking opportunities for continuously improving product quality must be the foundation for customer satisfaction. It is acknowledged that it is ultimately management’s responsibility to establish and assure product quality requirements and provide the processes for continuous quality improvement that supports all employees and are based on the Beliefs and Values.
It is recognized that performance of high quality work is everyone’s responsibility, and as a result, it is intended that the Quality Network Representative and USWA leadership working together with local management will reinforce other ongoing quality improvement activities,	,
Finally, the parties discussed (he necessity for ah Delphi employees to take individual responsibility for product quality, Management’s business planning process will include the necessity for providing employees with the appropriate training, methods and systems, materials, and equipment in an appropriate environment to perform their work. It is then incumbent upon employees to exercise diligence and properly perform their work to produce the highest quality, customervalued products. The general guidelines for the parties to provide additional support to employees in this quality improvement process are set forth in the
342
Bernard J. Quick letter dated December 8, 1999, and entitled “Quality Commitment”, it is only through personal commitment from every Delphi employee to provide the highest quality, customer-valued products that we will satisfy our customers and maintain job security for all,
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto.have caused their names to be subscribed by their duly authorized officers and representatives on this 8th day of December 8, 1999,

ERGONOMICS COMMITMENT

21 Abbey Avenue Dayton, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr. Bingham: .	.
■ Re: USWA-Delphi Ergonomics Agreement
, Pursuant to our discussions during these negotiations Delphi Automotive Systems recognizes its commitment to provide sufficient resources to achieve compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Tri-partite Agreement with Federal OSHA. The • President of each division will communicate and emphasize the importance of Delphi Automotive Sys-terns ergonomics commitment to each of their
• respective facilities. The status of the ergonomics process for each facility will be reviewed periodically at the Divisional Review Board. Discussions concerning significant problems or roadblocks will take place at these meetings.
At the facility level, the Manager may designate one staff member to oversee the daily operations of the ergonomics process. However, the Manager remains responsible for overall compliance. The Manager and Shop Chairperson will review at least semi-annually the resource needs of the ergonomics process.
The medical management of Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTD’s) is an essential component of the facility ergonomics process. The Corporate and Regional Medical Directors are responsible for assuring that the local medical programs comply with the Delphi
344
Medical Management program. This program will be reviewed periodically for continuous improvement and elimination of unnecessary complexity.
The Presidents and the Corporate Medical Director will communicate this information following ratification of the new agreement.

GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY
December 8, 1999
• Mr. Dennis Bingham
President, Local 87
USWA, AFL-CIO-CLC
21 Abbey Avenue	.
Dayton, Ohio 45417
Dear Mr. Bingham;
During these negotiations, we have explored at length methods to preserve and increase the job opportunities of our employees - your members. Further, we have mutually recognized that the best potential for increased job opportunities is a growing and thriving Corporation fully competitive in all aspects of its business.
During the discussions, and in response to your concerns regarding the outsourcing of USWA work, a new sourcing letter has been submitted providing a mechanism for meaningful advance Union involvement so that the plant, division, or Corporate sourcing authority may objectively consider the Union’s input. The Job Security (JOBS) Program provides job security unmatched in American history.
The major concern addressed by both the sourcing letter and the JOBS program is the retention of USWA jobs within the Corporation. The entire issue of job security, however, is broader than the continuation by the Corporation of its current business activities. The Jobs Program recognizes that long range job security must include opportunities in our traditional business lines and development of businesses in nomraditional fields providing jobs for our current employees and future job entrants.
346
The challenge to’the'parties'is a serious one, requiring the full range of all of our talent, experience and imagination. To enhance opportunities for employment growth, the parties agree to form a Growth and Opportunity Committee during the term of the current Agreement, This committee is charged with pursuing opportunities in non-traditional business areas with ah overall view toward providing new jobs not currently included in the scope of Delphi Automotive Systems operations.	1
Each feature of the total business opportunity must be examined including 1) the market for the product to be produced,-2) expenditures that are required for equipment or tooling, 3) the cost of any plant modernization or rearrangement, including additions to an existing facility, 4.) the availability, of the necessary technology, 5) the lease or purchase of a new facility, 6) characteristics of the business including material, ■ capital funds, and wage and benefit levels of other employers in the industry in which the new business will compete, 7) the nature of bargaining agreements needed to assure the hew business is competitive, and 8) the expected return on investment relative to the standard in the industry in which the new venture would compete,	.	■
In analyzing the feasibility of entering into new business ventures the parties have agreed to call upon the full extent of Corporate and Union resources. As an indication of the seriousness of its commitment to employment growth through business diversification into non-traditional areas, the Corporation will make available up to $500,000 dollars of funding to provide for this program during the term of the current Agreement However, should the Growth and Opportunity Committee recommend new business funding in excess of this amount, the Corporation agrees to review such requests in accordance with the guidelines of this Document. These funds will be available for in vest-
347
ment in new business ventures including, as appropriate, the establishment of separate Corporate organizational structures.	■
Investment funds will be released on an .“as required” basis. Only those ventures receiving concept approval and initial funding prior to the expiration of the current Agreement will be considered as firm commitments by the Corporation. Accounting for fund expenditures will be the responsibility of the Growth and Opportunity Committee.
This new program will be administered by the Growth and Opportunity Committee. This Committee will be comprised of equal numbers of Corporate and Delphi-USWA representatives. It will be the responsibility of the Committee to make recommendations to the Corporation and Union for concept approval and to request new venture funding from the Corporation for business opportunities deemed to be consistent with employment growth objectives of the program.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be responsible to: J) communicate to divisional and local management and to regional and local union representatives the full scope of this new business concept, 2) review and study the feasibility of proposals made by the local JOBS Committee regarding entry into new business ventures, 3) initiate studies necessary for a complete examination of new business ventures proposed locally or by the Committee, 4) make presentations and recommendations to the National JOBS Committee, 5) report back, where appropriate, to the local JOBS Committee its findings and recommenda-' tions regarding a proposed new business venture, and 6) devise means of encouraging the entire organization, hourly and salaried, to participate in bringing new competitive business into the Corporation and creating new jobs.
348
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be guided by the following when considering new business venture proposals:	*
1)	The jobs created should be in areas in which there is no significant unionized domestic competition, or in the case of traditional areas, where the competition is non-union or outside the U.S.
2)	Work similar, but not identical to, work currently performed in-house, must be included for wage and benefit purposes under the Main Agreement, Such proposals may include high risk or marginally profitable projects that Delphi Automotive Systems would otherwise not consider.
3)	Such new business ventures must be located completely separate from facilities under this Agreement except for those described in Paragraph (2) above.
Contingent upon the business climate and market .	proximity, we have agreed to pay particular attention
i	to communities affected by the loss of Delphi-USWA
employment opportunities. Accordingly, any newly created business venture developed through the efforts of the Growth and Opportunity Committee will I	be expected to provide opportunities for new employ-
1	ees, with preference given to USWA represented emI	ployees laid off from or working at Corporation
facilities. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, the Corporation or other employer will recognize the USWA as the representative of the hourly employees working at businesses developed through the Growth and Opportunity Committee for the purpose of collective bargaining. In this regard, the parties recognize ,	the need to develop innovative approaches to labor
relations and commit to negotiating new collective 1	bargaining agreements for each venture.
349
The' Growth' arid ^Opportunity Committee ’will report periodically to the Delphi Strategy Board on their progress in identifying and developing viable opportunities for employment growth.	.	.
The approach to job security and new business opportunity reflected in this agreement requires a relationship typified by trust and the mutual willingness to take risks in return for economic rewards and job opportunities. Our enthusiasm to search for new business must be shared by divisional and local management and by union representatives. '
The success of this joint activity will be measured based upon results. A.high level of.commitment-will be required from all parties to enhance rhe potential for success. The commitment .of a full-time.effort to seek new employment opportunities should improve the overall effectiveness of the program.

Dear Mr. Bingham:
In discussions leading to this agreement the parties agreed that the provisions contained in the 2003 National Agreement negotiated with the UAW and IUE would be passed through to USWA Local 87 where the Agreement with Local 87 of die USWA has identical or substantially identical contractual or benefit provisions. In those cases where Local 87 does not have identical or substantially identical provisions, for example Legal Services and SUB, the parties will meet to discuss the applicability of those provisions to the Agreement between Delphi Automotive Systems and Local 87 of the USWA and the manner in which these items can be translated into the Delphi-USWA Agreement. However, the parties agree that Local 87 of the USWA will not be disadvantaged but will receive the same or equivalent improvements contained in the 2003 National Agreements between Delphi and the UAW and IUE.
In the event the Union believes that they have not received equivalent treatment to the UAW or IUE. the matter will be presented to arbitration. The selection of the Arbitrator will be by mutual agreement. The parties will also prepare and exchange at least 30 days prior to the arbitration hearing a written brief contain-
352
itig the issues in dispute and the parties position and supporting arguments. The arbitration hearing will be conducted in the manner prescribed in Paragraph (41) of the Main Agreement.
