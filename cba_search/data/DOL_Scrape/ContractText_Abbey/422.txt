Mediation
12.19	There may be, by mutual agreement, an intermediate step between the grievance procedure and arbitration. Such intermediate step is mediation.

The number of panels provided for in this paragraph may be increased by mutual agreement.
12.28	Hearings shall commence as quickly as possible following the designation and availability of the arbitrator and shall be carried to conclusion without unnecessary delay.

In all other grievances involving disciplinary action which are specifically subject to arbitration, as specified in paragraph 12.25 Section: Arbitrable Topics above, both Parties may, within fifteen (15) calendar days after the filing of the request for arbitration, elect to use this expedited arbitration procedure. The election shall be in writing and, when signed by authorized representatives of the Parties, shall be irrevocable. It no such election is made within the foregoing time period, the full arbitration procedure specified in “Arbitration" above shall be followed.

38
from either Party to the other. The umpire shall be notified of such termination by a joint letter from the Parties.

(D)	Within five (5) working days after the hearing, each Party may submit a brief written summary of the issues raised at the hearing and arguments supporting its position. The umpire shall give his or her decision within five (5) working days after receiving the briefs. The umpire shall provide the Parties a brief written statement of the reasons supporting the decision.
(E)	The umpire’s decision shall apply only to the instant grievance, which shall be settled thereby. The award of the umpire shall be final and binding upon the Parties, subject to law, and the Company and the Union agree to abide by the decision of the umpire. The decision shall not constitute a precedent for other cases or grievances and may not be cited or used as a precedent in other arbitration matters between the Parties unless the decision or a modification thereof is adopted by the written concurrence of the representatives of each Party at the third step of the grievance procedure.
(F)	In emergency situations only, the time limits in (A) and (D) above may be extended by agreement of the Parties or at the umpire's request. Such extensions shall not circumvent the purpose of this procedure.
(G)	In any grievance arbitrated under the provisions of this Section, the Company shall under no circumstances be liable for backpay for more than six (6) months (plus any time that the processing of the grievance or arbitration was delayed at the specific request of the Company) after the date of the disciplinary action.

Force Adjustment
26.35	The Company shall decide the necessity for and shall determine the extent of any force adjustment. Changes in employee job titles in the normal course of operations of the business, either at the employee's request or as a manager-initiated action, shall not constitute a force adjustment. There shall be no layoff of regular full-time employees if there are any outside contractors performing the same work, in the same work group, at the same work location, as performed by the Surplus Employee Group.
68
26.36 Definitions:
These definitions shall apply for purposes of force adjustment only.
(A)	Lateral Transfer - A lateral transfer is a change to another place of reporting with the same job title or to another job title, for which the maximum basic rate of pay is within or equal to plus Twenty-Five Dollars ($25) or minus Ten Dollars ($10) of the established maximum basic rate of pay for the employee’s prior job title.
(B)	Downgrade - A downgrade is a change to a job title with an established maximum basic rate of pay which is more than Ten Dollars ($10) lower than the employee's prior job title.
(C)	Surplus Employee Group - A Surplus Employee Group, as determined by the Company, is the group in which the surplus exists.
(D)	Hometown Job Area (HJA) - The Hometown Job Area comprises the Exchange in which the Surplus Employee Group is located and those contiguous Exchanges within the same state. (An Exchange is the territory designated for exchange telephone service for a city or town and its environs. These are set forth in Attachment 1 to this Article.)
(E)	Expanded Hometown Job Area (EHJA) - An Expanded Hometown Job Area comprises the Hometown Job Area and those Exchanges contiguous to the Hometown Job Area within the same state.
(F)	Surplus Transfer Request - A Surplus Transfer Request is a transfer request that affords a surplus employee the opportunity to receive consideration for any available non-management position at any location within the Company and priority consideration for any lateral or downgrade placement. In addition, a surplus employee shall have priority consideration for available non-management upgrade positions in the EHJA if the surplus employee has qualifications for the job that are substantially equal to those of other candidates and has self-nominated for the position through the Non-management Staffing Plan.
(G)	Voluntary Supplemental Income Protection Program (SIPP) Candidate Request -Any regular full-time, non-surplus employee who has met time-on-title requirements may express interest in receiving SIPP by submitting a Voluntary SIPP Candidate Request. Such a candidate shall have two (2) business days following a Voluntary SIPP Payment offer by the Company to confirm acceptance of the offer. Failure to confirm acceptance within this time frame shall result in the Request being canceled. In such a case, a new Request may not be submitted for thirty (30) calendar days following the cancellation of the prior Request. A former surplus employee ■ who has been placed in an upgrade position vacated by the acceptance of a Volun- I tary SIPP Payment by a Voluntary SIPP Candidate must reestablish time-on-title 1 prior to submitting a Voluntary SIPP Candidate Request.
(H)	Transitional Leave of Absence (TLA) - The Transitional Leave of Absence is a leave that may be offered to eligible surplus employees as business needs dictate in order to eliminate a surplus condition. The TLA only applies to surplus employees who, as of their force disposition date, are within twenty-four (24) months of achieving eligibility under the APP or successors or assigns thereto and who have not declined a lateral job offer in the HJA. A TLA may be offered no earlier than twenty-eight (28) calendar days following the surplus notification.
26.3	7 When the Company determines that a force surplus exists, it shall, prior to notifying the affected employees, advise the Union in writing with respect to the employee group(s) involved, job title(s) and approximate number of employees affected, the location(s) or
69
geographical area(s), and the anticipated force disposition date. Notification to the affected employees shall be made as soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the anticipated force disposition date. No affected employee shall be involuntarily terminated prior to ninety (90) calendar days following such notification. Any employee who elects not to accept a job in the Hometown Job Area which does nol result in a downgrade shall be considered to have resigned from the Company and will not be paid a termination payment.
Surplus orientation meetings shall be held with affected employees as soon as practicable. During these meetings the procedures and due dates described in this Section shall be explained.
26.3	8 The Company shall first attempt to reduce or eliminate the surplus within the Surplus Employee Group by offering lateral transfers by order of seniority, offering downgrades by order of seniority and involuntarily moving employees by inverse order of seniority to lateral positions within the employee group within the HJA.
26.3	9 An affected employee shall notify the Company of their acceptance of any “follow-the-work" job offer, where applicable, within thirty (30) calendar days following the affected employee's surplus notification or by such later date as is determined by the Company. Failure to so notify the Company by the deadline date shall constitute rejection of the offer.
Whenever a surplus situation exists which requires that employees within the Surplus Employee Group have the opportunity to “follow the work” to another employee group, the employees from both employee groups shall be considered on a "pooled seniority basis” Io fill available jobs within the then consolidated employee group.
26.4	0 In the event that a surplus remains following the application of paragraph 26.21(A), preceding, the Company shall canvass non-surplus employees who have filed Voluntary SIPP Candidate Requests for confirmation that they are willing to accept Voluntary SIPP Payments under Section: Supplemental Income Protection Program, above, and voluntarily terminate from the Company.
(A)	Voluntary SIPP Payments shall be offered to non-surplus Voluntary SIPP Candidates beginning no earlier than thirty-two (32) calendar days following the affected employees' surplus notification. Such a Candidate will have two (2) working days following a Voluntary SIPP Payment offer to confirm acceptance of the offer.
(B)	The canvassing of Voluntary SIPP Candidates and the placement of qualified surplus employees in the vacancies thus created, shall be in seniority order and in the following order of consideration:
(1)	The same job title in the HJA;
(2)	The same job title in the EHJA (if the employee has expressed an interest in the position on the Surplus Transfer Request);
(3)	A lateral position in the HJA;
(4)	A lateral position in the EHJA (if the employee has expressed an interest in the position on the Surplus Transfer Request);
(5)	A downgrade in the HJA;
(6)	A downgrade in the EHJA (if the employee has expressed an interest in the position on the Surplus Transfer Request).
70
(7)	The same job title, a lateral position or a downgrade (in that order) in up to four (4) exchanges outside the EHJA as specified by the surplus employee on the Surplus Transfer Request.
(C)	If a surplus employee refuses a job offer under paragraph 26,40, (B) no further job offers for that job title and location shall be made to the employee,
(D)	Any surplus employee who does not receive a job offer as outlined above may elect to replace the most senior Voluntary SIPP Candidate (for whose job the surplus employee is qualified) who has confirmed interest in accepting the Voluntary SIPP Payment and who holds the same job title as the surplus employee within the state,
(E)	Any remaining surplus employee who does not receive a job offer as outlined in paragraph (D) may elect to replace the most senior Voluntary SIPP Candidate (for whose job the surplus employee is qualified) who has confirmed interest in accepting the Voluntary SIPP Payment within the state.
26.4	1 Any surplus employee who has filed a Surplus Transfer Request within the requisite time frame, but has not received a job offer prior to the Force Disposition Date, and for whom no Voluntary SIPP Candidates were identified in accordance with Article 26.40 (A) and (B) above, shall be entitled, by order of seniority, to displace the least senior employee with their same job title, in their same Market Business Unit or in their same operating division ot the Network organization, within the Hometown Job Area, provided the senior employee meets the basic qualifications of the job. {The displaced junior employee shall be subject to layoff fourteen (14) calendar days following notification of displacement.]
26.4	2 if a surplus remains after application of paragraph 26.40, preceding, any remaining surplus employees within the Surplus Employee Group may, upon election:
(A)	Displace, if such displacement can be achieved with limited or no training, the leastsenior occasional, temporary or regular limited term employee within the EHJA. A surplus employee who displaces an occasional, temporary or regular limited term employee shall assume that employee's work completion date and the surplus employee’s force disposition date shall be extended to coincide with the completion date. The employee shall also retain surplus status and job title up to the date of the extended force disposition date,
(B)	Be allowed to fill an available, open requisition which has been submitted under the classification of regular limited term which requires more than little or no training for which the surplus employee is qualified. A surplus employee who accepts such a position will assume the work completion date established for the regular limited term position and will no longer be considered surplus lor the purpose of priority placement consideration, although other provisions of Article 26 will apply. In addition, after accepting this regular limited term position, the surplus employee may not participate in the Non-management Staffing Plan unless approved by the Company. Should the position be reclassified as regular full-time, or after twenty-four (24) months on the assignment, the employee would assume non-surplus status. If the employee should be work completed on the work completion date of the regular limited term assignment, the provisions of this article regarding termination pay and other related issues would apply.
26.4	3 At the force disposition date, any remaining surplus employees within the Surplus Employee Group who have not previously accepted SIPP or a job offer, shall be laid ofl by inverse order of seniority until the surplus is eliminated. Such employees shall receive termination payments in accordance with Section: Termination Payments following.
71
26.4	4 Wage treatment for employees who accept or receive jobs pursuant to the Force Adjustment procedures, set forth in this Section, shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement.
23.4	5 The force adjustment procedure herein shall not preclude limited, mutually agreed upon Union-Management modifications with respect to the geographic scope of the HJA and EHJA. (“Union" shall mean the Vice President of District 4, CWA, or other designated representative. “Management" shall mean the Vice President-Labor Relations or other designated representative.) Any such modifications will apply on a one-time basis and will not serve as precedent for other current or future force surplus adjustment procedures.
26.4	6 Surplus employees who accept a job under paragraph 26.36 (F) and who meet the conditions outlined under Section: Relocation, above, shall receive relocation payments. Those relocated employees and those surplus employees that transfer out of their HJA may utilize the Non-management Staffing Plan to be considered for either a lateral job or a downgrade, for which they are qualified, in their former HJA or EHJA. This opportunity shall remain in effect for two (2) years following the placement necessitating the employee's relocation or transfer and the employee shall, in order of seniority with other employees similarly situated, be given first preference, after surplus for a lateral job or a downgrade. The relocated employee shall not receive reimbursement for relocation expenses back to their former exchange.
Recalls & Reemployment
26.4	7 If additions to the work force are required in any work group within two (2) years of the last layoff made in such work group under a program of layoffs, the Company shall proceed as follows before hiring new regular employees.
26.4	8 The Company shall offer reemployment in order of seniority to regular full-time laid off employees, provided that the period of layoff of such former employees does not exceed two (2) years, in the following order:
(A)	Former employees who were laid off from the work group.
(B)	Former employees whose work location at the time of layoff was less than thirly-five (35) road miles, by the most direct route, from the work location of the work group being added to and who were qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
(C)	Former employees the same as described in (B) above except who were not qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
(D)	Former employees whose work location at the time oi layoff was thirty-five (35) road miles or more, by the most direct route, from the work location of the work group being added to and who were qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
(E)	Former employees the same as described in (D) above except who were not qualified by experience at the time of layoff to perform the duties of an available job.
26.4	9 Former employees under paragraph 26.48 (C) and (E) above who are offered a job and who wish to pursue the job opportunity, must demonstrate qualifications to the satisfaction of the Company which shall be identical to those the Company requires of newly hired employees. Failure to make such demonstration will not result in the former employee being removed from the recall list, but will entitle the Company to consider the next appropriate candidate.
72
26.5	0 Former employees must keep the Company informed of the address at which they can be reached. Any offer of reemployment shall be made by registered, return receipt requested mail addressed to the latest address furnished by the former employee. When an offer of employment has been so made, the former employee shall indicate their acceptance within seven (7) work days from receipt of the Company's offer,
26.5	1 The following actions on the part of a former employee will constitute a forfeiture of reemployment rights and the employee's name will be removed from the recall list:
(A)	Failure to notify the Company of their acceptance of an offer of reemployment within seven (7) days;
(B)	Failure to report for duty on the date specified after acceptance of the offer of reemployment; or
(C)	Refusal of the offer of reemployment within their former EHJA as set forth in Section: Force Adjustment, preceding.
26.5	2 When a former employee is recalled and assigned to the same, a lateral or a lower rated job title than their job title at the time of layoff, they shall be placed on the new wage schedule at the same monthly step which they were at when laid off.
26.5	3 Former employees whose new work location is thirty-five (35) or more road miles, by the most direct route, farther from their residence than was their work location at the time of layoff shall be granted a relocation allowance of Four Thousand Dollars ($4,000). However, if the former employee participated in the Training Opportunity Plan (TOP) upon layoff, they will not be eligible for this relocation allowance. If paid, this relocation allowance must be relumed to the Company if the former employee does not both report to their new work location and relocate their residence within one (1) year of the date of reemployment unless an extension has been specifically authorized by the Company. This relocation allowance is in lieu of any other payment for relocation expenses and shall be applied against the amount of termination payment to be repaid, if any, under the provisions of paragraph 26.56 ol Section: Termination Payments.
Termination Payments
26.5	4 A termination payment, plus compensation for any vacation days, Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays to which the employee is eligible at the time of leaving the Company’s service, shall be paid to a regular employee laid off because of lack of work, or may be paid at the discretion of the Company to an employee whose services are terminated for reasons such as unadaptability or inability to properly perform assigned job duties.
26.5	5 In no event shall an employee receiving a termination payment be eligible to receive payments in accordance with the provisions of Section: Supplemental Income Protection Program, above.

If the number of weeks from the effective date of leaving service to the date of employment or reemployment is less than the number of weeks' pay upon which the termination payment was based, exclusive of any payment in lieu of vacation, the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks shall be considered as an advance to the employee by the Company and repayment shall be made through authorized payroll deductions at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the employee’s basic weekly wage rate until the amount of excess is repaid.
26.5	9 A re-engaged employee who has received a termination payment and who is again laid off will be paid the difference between the computed payment to which he or she is eligible and the net amount of any payment which he or she may have received due to any previous layoff.

The local management and the local union will discuss the process by which the number of employees who volunteer will be assigned their shifts and tours, ft is further agreed that if the needs of the business require the Company to discontinue the four day tour, the Company will notify the Union in advance.
Four day tours will be scheduled in advance as full tours. No daily overtime payment shall be made for any of the scheduled hours worked which constitute the normal four day tour.
Subject to the above, and before implementing a tour day schedule in any work group, the local management and the local union will establish the parameters and implementation procedures for such four day tours. Unless otherwise agreed, the following will apply:
(1)	Weeks in which holidays fall will revert to a normal five-day tour.
(2)	Employees scheduled for a week of vacation will have their tours revert to the normal five-day tour.
(3)	Employees pre-scheduled for Excused Work Days, Day-At-A-Tfme Vacation, Floating Holiday(s), or jury duty will revert their tours to the normal five-day tour. Non-scheduled Floating Holidays, Excused Work Days, or Day-At-A-Time Vacation within a week in which the employee’s tour is four ten hour days will be treated as ten hour days. Employees may take no more than four ten hour unscheduled days (ie, forty hours) on a day-ata-time basis. These unscheduled days include Floating Holidays, Excused Work Days, or Vacation days.
(4)	Payment will be based upon a ten hour day for employees who are absent because of sickness or accident disability during the course of the four day tour. If the disability continues into the next week, the employee’s tour will revert to the normal five day tour.
This Memorandum of Agreement will remain in effect through the term of the 2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

Employees will be scheduled for testing based on projected job needs and employee availability (e.g. vacation, etc). If an employee is considered to be a candidate for an open position, but is unavailable for 5 business days or less to be scheduled for testing, regardless of whether there is a test request on file, the open position will not be filled until the employee can be tested.

Time on assignment must be served prior to an employee’s transfer to a different job unless waived by management and agreed upon by Labor Relations.
Open positions will be posted for seven (7) calendar days. Employees will be able to selfnominate for these positions twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. Employees may bid on an unlimited number of open positions.

Employees who have accepted a promotion or a position involving a job content change may, within ninety (90) days of the effective date of the transfer, notify their supervisor in writing that they wish to retreat to their former position. Employees will be retreated to their former jobs or equivalent jobs as the needs of Hie business permit. However, new time on assignment requirements must be met before an individual voluntarily retreating may be considered for other open positions in the future.
The Company will provide the Union with copies of revised Job Briefs for its review and will consider the Union's input for future revisions.
A designated member of the Union may contact the designated Company counterpart to address the appropriateness of qualifications for a posted job vacancy. The Company will respond within two (2) business days as to the appropriateness of the qualifications for the posted job vacancy.	■
Skills verification will be required in situations where the skill is a factor in the selection of the candidate. Hiring Managers must return completed skills verification forms to the SBC Midwest Staffing Center.
On a requisition, twenty-five (25) points will be added to the most senior candidate, per job opening. If the most senior candidate declines the job, or is otherwise disqualified, the points will be reassigned to the next senior candidate. If that candidate declines the job or is disqualified, these same twenty-five (25) points will be successively assigned in seniority order until the requisition is filled.
if the Company determines it is necessary to make changes to the Additional Qualification points, currently within the range of 98-103, it will discuss the changes and any impact they may have with the Union.
An Oversight and Review Board composed ol three (3) SBC Midwest representatives and three (3) members of the Union will meet quarterly, when necessary, and will:
•	Monitor the ongoing operation of the SBC Midwest Staffing Process.
•	Analyze its overall results.
•	Provide a forum to address concerns raised about the staffing of jobs through the SBC Midwest Staffing Process, including skills verification.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
MONITORING
The Company and the Union acknowledge that there is a responsibility to provide high quality service to customers and the need to be in a position to effectively compete in today's increasingly competitive communications industry. It is the intent to develop overall performance to provide service to customers in an efficient, courteous and responsive way.
Monitoring is a tool to evaluate the on-line effectiveness of employees to reach and maintain quality service. The approach for monitoring will continue to be based on a premise that fosters a work environment that builds on mutual trust and respect which enhances job satisfaction.
Monitoring includes, but is not limited to, the following:
a)	Service Observations: Monitoring of this type is intended to randomly review the performance of the work group to determine their effectiveness in providing quality service to customers. Official Service Observations, made at the direction of the Company for the primary purpose of determining the overall quality of service furnished to customers, are not intended nor will they be used for the purpose of identifying or rating the performance of individual employees except as noted below. The Company will not publish any result data of any official observing for small offices thal would allow for identification of individual employees.
b)	Diagnostic: Monitoring of this type is intended to review and evaluate new or changed products, practices and procedures.
c)	Evaluative/Developmental: Monitoring of this type is intended to be handled in a professional and confidential manner and to document performance of the individual employee for evaluation purposes. This type of monitoring will be conducted by management personnel and will generally be done at the work address / location. While conducting remote evaluative/developmental monitoring, management must display a visual indicator that employee monitoring is in progress. Evaluative/Developmental call monitoring wilt be from a sampling of calls. Such calls will not be arbitrarily selected for evaluative purposes. The monitoring results should be reviewed with the employee within twenty-four (24) hours after the monitoring has taken place. Other managerial steps, such as training sessions, visual observations, individual discussions and coaching may be used in addition to monitoring to evaluate and improve an employee’s performance.
Individual notification will be given to employees to be monitored the day the Evaluative/ Developmental Monitoring takes place. Employees' preference for side by side or remote observations will be honored where existing facilities permit.
Exception: Individual notification and preference are applicable once an employee has 6 months' on job experience after completion of formal training.
Where an employee demonstrates difficulty meeting established performance expectations, he/she may lose the privilege of receiving notification and choice of preference until performance expectations are met on a consistent basis.
107
Appendix A
A14
Monitoring used for Service Observations or Diagnostic review, will not result in employee discipline unless customer abuse, fraud or violation of the Company Code of Business Conduct are involved.
To administer monitoring, the Company will set guidelines on the monthly number of Service Observation and Diagnostic calls handled by employees which will be subject to managerial monitoring. These guidelines will provide for reasonable Company-wide consistency in the number of monitored calls needed to obtain a valid sample of the employee’s grade of service and to determine his/her training needs. Monitoring is not intended to harass an individual employee or any group of employees, nor should it be used to create an atmosphere of pressure in the work environment.
The Company's reasons for engaging in monitoring will be explained to employees subject thereto. They will be informed of the proper use of such monitoring by their managers.
Managers wifi be trained in analyzing observation data, in planning appropriate training, and in improving their interviewing skills, including placing emphasis on the positive aspects of an employee’s job performance.
At their request, employees will be allowed reasonable time during working hours (normally during a feedback of the results of manager's monitoring) to review their monitoring records and work performance summaries.
It is not the Company’s primary intent to use GPS, AMAs or electronic reports to monitor and discipline employees. However, should the Company become aware of misconduct through the normal use of GPS, AMA’s or electronic reports the Company can not ignore such information and reserves the right to take appropriate action, including application of appropriate discipline.

Dear Mr. Handley:
The parties agree to continue the use of the neutral evaluation process for the term of the 2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
As soon as is reasonable, following ratification of the 2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties will each select five (5) arbitrators who will comprise a special panel of ten (10) neutral evaluators ("evaluators") to be utilized for the purpose of this process. The parties will schedule neutral evaluation days with the evaluators, where the evaluator may hear up to four (4) dismissal and/or suspension cases per day. Each case will be limited to ninety (90) minutes as set forth below. The cases wifi be evenly distributed among the evaluators as practicality permits. The parties agree to equally share the compensation and expenses of cases evaluated, except in instances where cases are withdrawn less than twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the scheduled time for the evaluation. In such event, the withdrawing party will be responsible for any cancellation fees and/or expenses incurred.
Proceedings before the evaluator shall be informal in nature. The presentation of evidence and the issues heard will be limited to that which has already been presented or asserted during the grievance and/or Union-Management Review Board process. Formal rules of evidence will not apply. The parties will be represented by Labor Relations Case Managers and local Union Representatives, and no official record of the neutral evaluation will be kept.
Each party may have no more than two (2) individuals attend the neutral evaluation proceeding; and, each party will be limited to a half hour presentation. When unusual circumstances warrant, the parties may mutually agree, prior to the date of the evaluation, that one additional representative may attend for either party; or, that the presentation time for each party may be extended by a period not to exceed thirty minutes.
The evaluator will be provided one half hour to question both parties in the presence of one another, and to render his or her advisory opinion. This advisory opinion will resolve any procedural or arbitrability issues and/or determine whether the company acted with or without just cause, and where the disciplinary action lacked just cause, what if any, remedy should be imposed. Under no circumstances will the Company be liable for back pay for more than six (6) months after the date of the disciplinary action.
(Continued on next page)
121
Appendix A
A 22
Within two (2) working days following the evaluator’s advisory opinion, a party must notify the other party in writing it the party rejects the evaluator’s advisory opinion; otherwise it will be treated as accepted by the party. In instances where the parties accept the evaluator’s advisory opinion of no just cause, the company agrees to implement the remedy within ten (10) working days. In instances where the parties accept the evaluator's advisory opinion of just cause, the Union agrees to withdraw the grievance in writing within ten (10) working days.
In instances where the company or the Union rejects the evaluator’s opinion the case will be deferred to the regular arbitration process. No statements made by either party at the neutral evaluation proceeding may be introduced as evidence at an arbitration hearing by the other party.
This neutral evaluation process will be in effect and will include all applicable cases appealed to arbitration through December 31,2009.
This letter will remain in effect through the term of the 2004 Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties.

Re: Proper Use Of Union-Management Review Board
Dear Mr. Handley:
When properly used by both parties, the Union-Management Review Board process has facilitated the resolution of cases short of arbitration, including, in a number of cases, the reinstatement of employees with backpay when warranted by the facts. The Company is fully committed to the proper use of the Review Board process and will not tolerate its misuse.

Dear Mr. Handley:
This letter confirms understandings concerning Operator Services issues reached by the Company and the Union during the course of the 2004 Collective Bargaining discussions:

Either of two (2) methods shall be chosen;
(1)	The OSA may be assigned in seniority within the SA title group
Or
(2)	The OSA may be assigned in seniority within the Operator title group
The method selected will remain in effect for a minimum of one (1) year, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
2.	The method for selection for employees in the title Operator Services Assistant (OSA) temporarily assigned as Service Assistants (SA) for one or more shifts in a week will be locally determined between the Local Union president and the OSC Manager. Either of two (2) methods shall be chosen:
(1)	The OSA may be selected by rotation, or
(2)	The OSA may be selected by seniority
The method selected will remain in effect lor a minimum of one (1) year, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
3.

Ms. Dina Beaumont
Executive Assistant to the President Communications Workers of America 501 Third Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20001-2797
Dear Dina:
The following represents our agreement with respect to Evolving Technologies and Traditional Telecom Work: FTTP, VoIP, WiFi (and other wireless data technologies). This agreement shall expire on April 4,2009.
Much of the work related to the evolving technologies of the telecommunications Industry are extensions of traditional telephone,work or copper cable switched technology. The new technologies referred to here are Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), WiFi and other data services, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Traditional telephone work has been installation, maintenance, network construction & surveillance, repair, customer premise work, billing, operator services, sales and service, customer service, and technical support. Since the work supporting the new technologies is functionally related to the work required in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the new work will be performed by workers covered by trie collective bargaining agreements.
Fiber to the Premise (FTTP)
Both parties recognize that most FTTP work today is done under the core contracts. The parties agree that all non-management FTTP work which falls into the comparable categories of traditional telephone work now performed on the switched network including construction, repair, customer service, billing, sales, technical support, terminations, splicing and testing will be performed under the core contracts, Construction work that is similar to work that is currently done in the circuit network will continue to be performed as it is under the core contracts. For example, the parties recognize that trenching is work that is traditionally contracted,
Fiber to the premise shall be CWA bargaining unit work as described below. The assignment of fiber to the premise work shall be made just as it is for the copper switched network today. As the network evolves to a packet-switched fiber network, the core bargaining unit will continue to perform the type of work that was previously bargaining unit work in the circuit switched network.
CWA shall be recognized for construction, splicing, testing, terminations of fiber to premise/ neighborhood or node work and all associated equipment required to make fiber operational. Aerial drops to the premise shall be CWA-represented work. All other service drops in the fiber network shall be done as they are in the circuit-switched network.
When the customer premise work is performed by SBC, SBC CWA employees will do it under the core contracts or DataCornm contracts as it is done today. If in the view of the Company, the nature of some of the customer premise work and interacting with the customer and the required set of skills toperform that work require a different craft title, the parties agree to meet to bargain an appropriate rate.
This includes testing, splicing and termination at the interface device as well as installing associated equipment to make the fiber functional as communications cable at the premise.
293

Attachment 3
WiFi
Currently, WiFi (and other wireless data technologies) consists of DSL (and high-speed internet) lines installed by SBC CWA-represented employees from and including the central office to the customer premise termination including the interface device or protector. Terminal equipment is installed on the customer premise. As the WiFi business grows, SBC expects to expand the work performed by SBC employees. If SBC performs the customer premise work, SBC will utilize core or DataComm employees for CPE installations. Outside the SBC footprint, SBC may use contractors to perform this work. Within the SBC footprint contractors may be used on a temporary basis under unusual circumstances. SBC and the Union will discuss at the President’s Council the best way to meet service and installation commitments and grow the Business. These SBC non-management employees shall be represented by CWA or eligible for card check recognition. All DSL customer service work associated with WiFi (and other wireless data technologies) shall be done by CWA-represented employees.
VoIP
To the extent that routers and servers go into the network owned by SBC, SBC shall assign that work to the CWA bargaining unit since they perform related work in the circuit world. VoIP is an evolution of the PSTN and comparable work performed today by CWA-represented employees shall be performed for VoIP technology. VoIP work in the network and at the premises will be performed under the DataComm contracts. As the work transitions from the circuit switched network, the current core technicians will transition with the work. The Company will make training available to enable their transition.
Customer Service
Tier 1 DSL customer service work is best performed bundled with other SBC services, CWA-represented employees will perform this work as well as all customer service work for all SBC sendees. This work shall include billing, selling and servicing. This includes Tier II customer service work.

Dear Dina:
As our industry and our company evolve, powerful economic and competitive dynamics will be at work. While we address many of these dynamics In our Evolving Technologies and Traditional Telecom Work agreement, further discussion on issues not addressed in this agreement may be necessary. These include:
•	rapid product and service evolution that is driven by highly accelerated technological progress;
•	the rise of facilities-based competitors - especially the largely nonunion cable industry - that have a.distinct and substantial cost advantage in competing for customers;
•	a customer expectation of highly competitive price points for new products and services.
We acknowledge that it is tn our mutual best interest to anticipate these financial and market dynamics and to explore how we jointly address them in a satisfactory way.
SBC agrees with CWA that these new technologies will redefine the communications industry as we are challenged to provide our customers with a broader range of communications vehicles and options.
We strongly agree that it is in our mutual best interest as a company and a union to create a means for more timely, disciplined and formal discussions to explore the jobs associated with these new technologies and their impact on our company and its employees.
In light of our mutual recognition that this is a significant and important issue for the future of SBC and the CWA, we suggest that the Presidential Council that we have jointly established is the ideal vehicle for us to continue the formal exchange oi information and review of these sorts ot emerging issues.
We propose that the Presidential Council be expanded and charged with exploring the impact of future technologies in a timely manner. Some ideas that come to mind are:
•	The union and company could identify subject matter experts who can best serve in such a capacity.
•	Topics for consideration by the panel could include:
o SBC’s new technologies and product offerings
o SBC’s affiliations and partnerships
o SBC’s joint marketing programs
We are open to discussing additional ideas the CWA might have to explore the impact of new technologies.
Sincerely,
/i'I***

AMENDMENTS TO THE MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT REGARDING NEUTRALITY & CARD CHECK RECOGNITION
SBC Operations, Inc. (“the Company”) and Communications Workers of America (“the Union”) hereby agree to the following amendments to the Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) Regarding Neutrality & Card Check Recognition, dated October 1, 2002:
1.	Duration. The duration of the MOA shall be extended to April 4, 2009.
2.	New Language shall be added to the MOA as follows:
The issue of eligibility under the card check agreement needs further discussion. At issue is the impact on the Company and the Union of defining employees who are defined as non-supervisory under the NLRA and those who are defined as non-represented/non-management. In the 2004 negotiations, the Union is not seeking to change the historic balance. However, as technology changes the nature of the network and its services there may need to be an adjustment in some of the historical exclusions or the administration of the card check process. We need to address this issue and related definitional issues from a forward-looking perspective in the President's Council. The Company and the Union will appoint individuals to evaluate jobs in DataComm and report, jointly or separately, to the President's Council their findings and recommendations as to the proper job classifications in OataComm as management or non-management for purposes of application of the card check agreement. The President's Council will consist of the regional presidents, the data services president, and a senior representative of human resources on behalf of the Company, The Union representatives will consist of the District Vice Presidents and a representative of the CWA National office.
