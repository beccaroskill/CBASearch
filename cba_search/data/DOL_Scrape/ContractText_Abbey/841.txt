1
Registered professional nurses who are not members of the bargaining unit shall not routinely perform bargaining unit work.
The Hospital Center acknowledges that the Association has an abiding interest in maintaining the integrity of the current scope of nursing practice and the bargaining unit. The Employer shall meet, confer, and explore with the Association alternative options prior to instituting changes in the bargaining unit.
The Hospital Center will notify the Association at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to changing a title/position, establishing a new title/position, or deleting a title/position within the bargaining unit. Prior to implementation of such changes, the Employer shall meet, confer, and explore with the Association alternative options. The Association and Hospital Center shall negotiate regarding the job rate for such job and if no agreement can be reached by negotiation, the Association may process a claim for a change in the job rate for such classification in accordance with the provisions of Section 14 of the Agreement. The Hospital Center shall consult with the Association on other effects of such change.
At the time a new employee subject to this Agreement is employed, the Hospital Center shall deliver to said employee a written notice that the Hospital Center recognizes and is in contractual relations with the Association.
This Agreement applies to all bargaining unit members. Exceptions to any provisions of this Agreement shall be specifically stipulated.
2.	ASSOCIATION STATUS
2.0	1 Recognition
The Hospital Center recognizes the Association as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of every employee covered by this Agreement.
2.0	2 Association Membership
It shall be a condition of employment that all employees of the Employer covered by this Agreement who are members of the Association in good standing on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing and those who are not members on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on or after the thirty-first (31st) day following the effective date of this Agreement [or the execution thereof, whichever is later] become and remain members in good standing of the Association. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after the effective date, or the execution thereof, whichever is later, on or after the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of such employment become and remain members in good standing of the Association.
Hospital Center shall notify Association and local membership chairperson in writing of each new employee within fifteen (15) workdays of the employee's employment, and each terminated employee by the fifteenth (15th) day of each month after the employee's termination.
Association shall notify Hospital Center in writing of any employee who has failed to join the Association, and shall request that Hospital Center terminate employment of said employee within ten (10) days of said notification.
Whenever the Association shall charge that any employee, who is required by the provision of this paragraph to remain a member of the Association in good
2
standing has failed to do so and shall request the discharge of such employee, the Hospital Center shall be so informed by the Association by certified or registered mail and the Hospital Center shall have fourteen (14) working days following the receipt of such notice to take action on the requested discharge. If during said fourteen (14) day period, the employee shall pay delinquent dues, the Hospital Center shall not be required to discharge such employee.
"Good Standing" for the purpose of this Agreement shall mean the payment or tender of periodic dues, uniformly required as a condition of retaining membership to the Association. The Association shall indemnify and hold the Hospital Center harmless against any and all claims, demands or other forms of liability that may arise out of any action taken by the Hospital Center in fulfilling the terms of this paragraph.
On a monthly basis, the Employer will provide the following information:
•	New Hires: Name, address, date of hire, SS#, and job title.
•	Terminations: Name, SS#, and termination date.
•	LOAs (going out): Name, SS#, and effective date of leave.
•	LOAs (returning): Name, address, date of return, SS# and job title.
•	Bargaining Unit to Non-Bargaining Unit: Name, SS#, and date leaving bargaining unit.
•	Non-Bargaining Unit to Bargaining Unit: Name, address, date entering bargaining unit, SS#, and job title (in bargaining unit).
On a quarterly basis, the Employer will provide the following information for all employees:

Address
Home phone number
Date of Hire
Social Security Number
Title
Unit Employed
Employment Status (FT, PT/PD)
Payroll Status New Hire
Continuously Employed Revoked Check-Off Terminated/Laid Off Rehire/Reinstated
2.03 Deduction of Association Dues
An employee after thirty (30) working days, desiring to become a member of the Association may execute a written authorization in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit A. The Hospital Center shall provide each employee with a copy of Exhibit A, Dues Assignment and Deduction Authorization in the new employee orientation packet provided to each new employee. The employer shall provide NYSNA with written notice of those new employees who have received a copy of Exhibit A.
Upon receipt of such an authorization from an employee, the Hospital Center shall, pursuant to such authorization, deduct from the wages due employee each month and remit to the Association each month the dues fixed by the Association.
3
	The Hospital Center shall be relieved from making such "check-off" deductions upon: (a) termination of employment; (b) transfer to a title other than one covered by the bargaining unit; (c) layoff from work; (d) an agreed leave of absence; or (e) revocation of the check-off authorization in accordance with its terms or with applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the return of an employee to work from any of the above-mentioned absences, the Hospital Center will immediately resume the obligation of making such deductions, except that deductions for terminated employees shall require a new dues authorization card. The Hospital Center shall not be obligated to make dues deductions of any kind from any employee who, during any dues month involved, shall have failed to receive sufficient salary to equal the dues deduction. By the 15th of each month the Hospital Center shall remit to the Association all deductions for dues made from the salary of employees from the preceding month, together with a list of all employees from whom dues have been deducted, including social security numbers and dates of hire. It is specifically agreed that the Hospital Center assumes no obligation, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article, and the Association hereby agrees that it will indemnify and hold the Hospital Center harmless of any claims, actions, or proceedings by an employee arising from deductions made by the Hospital Center hereunder. Once the funds are remitted to Association, their disposition thereafter shall be the sole and exclusive obligation and responsibility of the Association.
2.04A	Association Business: Local Representative The Association will notify the Assistant Vice President for Nursing and Patient Services of its local employee representatives who are authorized to deal with the Hospital Center about employment conditions and adjustments of any problems arising under this Agreement. Association will notify the Director of Labor Relations in writing of said representatives' designation and authority and any change in either. Employees will engage in Association activities while on Hospital time only when expressly permitted to do so. An employee whose grievance is scheduled during hours outside the employee's regular hours of work will be paid at his/her regular rate of pay. Time off without pay for LBU officers for official Association meetings shall not be unreasonably denied. The Hospital Center shall provide up to a total of five (5) days per year for employees, not limited to elected representatives, for attendance at arbitrations at such employees' regular rate of compensation. Such days shall be allocated between the Sites at the discretion of the Association. The Hospital Center will allocate to the Association, to divide among Local Representatives, four hundred fifty (450) hours (at straight time rate) to compensate Local Representatives for time spent in dealing with the Hospital Center about employment conditions and adjustments of any problems arising under this Agreement during their off duty hours. Such time shall not include time spent for membership meetings; nor shall it include attendance at standing committee meetings set forth in Section 3.05. This time is not cumulative. The
4
Association shall provide the Hospital Center with an accounting for the payment of such compensation on a monthly basis.
Prior to the hearing of a class action grievance, the Employer and the Association shall mutually agree upon the number of members of the class to be paid at the grievance.
2.04B Association Business: Local Representative/Release Person The Hospital Center shall provide for the release of one (1) full-time employee from his/her work assignment for the purpose of dealing with the Hospital Center in matters affecting bargaining unit employees.
The Association shall designate the employee to be released and shall inform the Hospital Center of its designee. The parties agree that the representative shall be the initial contact for all matters relating to contract administration and shall serve in successive one (1) year terms.
Such individual shall be entitled to all applicable benefits of the current collective bargaining agreement, including shift differential when applicable. The employee shall be allowed to return to his/her former position (same unit and same shift).
The release person shall be considered an employee for the purposes of Section 5.08 Layoff.
Such individual shall be released to go to the New York State Nurses Association Convention. Cost of New York State Nurses Association Convention shall be paid by New York State Nurses Association.
2.0	5 Association Business: General Representative
A duly authorized General Representative of the Association may visit the Hospital Center premises by prearrangement with the Assistant Vice President for Nursing and Patient Services or Associate Vice President for Human Resources, at a reasonable time to discharge Association's duties as the employees' collective bargaining representative so long as the representative does not interfere with the work of the employees and the operation of the Hospital.
2.0	6 Association Business: Bulletin Boards/Mailboxes/File Cabinets
The Hospital Center will provide the Association with, and suitably locate three (3) bulletin boards at the Roosevelt Site and four (4) bulletin boards at the St. Luke's Site, on which to post official Association notices.
These bulletin boards will at all times carry a label, device or notice clearly identifying them as Association space (for use). The signature (or facsimile signature) of a duly authorized Association representative will be affixed to every Association notice posted in this space.
The bulletin boards shall be locked and a key held by the Hospital Center and an Association representative.
The Association shall have access to unit bulletin boards to the extent necessary to communicate with employees.
5
The Hospital Center shall provide one (1) mailbox at each Site for internal Association use.
The Hospital Center shall provide a locked file cabinet for exclusive Association use at each Site.
3. PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONER STATUS
A.	Employee Recommendations
The Hospital Center recognizes that due to their specialized education and experience, the employees covered by this Agreement have a unique contribution to make towards maintaining and improving professional nursing care at the Hospital Center and that, therefore, procedures should be developed whereby the views and recommendations of the employees covered by this Agreement can be heard and considered in the decision-making process within the Hospital Center.
Assignment of chart review/monitoring tool shall only be made when patient care needs allow as determined by management after consultation.
B.	Non-Nursing Functions
The Employer and the Association recognize that the performance of nonnursing functions by registered nurses impedes their ability to deliver quality, cost-effective patient care and is not intended to be a part of their responsibilities.
The Employer, therefore, agrees that registered nurses shall not perform nonnursing functions such as:
1.	Ordering/stocking supplies;
2.	Emptying garbage;
3.	Washing/making beds upon discharge and for admissions, except bed-
changing that is part of ongoing care;
4.	Transporting bodies to the morgue;
5.	Transporting patients for routine tests and stretcher preparation;
6.	Transporting patients being discharged;
7.	Moving beds with or without patients within a unit or to a unit unless, within the judgment of the RN, it is deemed that the RN should accompany the patient;
8.	Laboratory specimen pickups;
9.	Pharmacy stat med orders sheets/delivery to the unit;
10.	The routine performance of housekeeping functions.
It is agreed that RNs on units with assigned clerical employees are not expected, on a routine basis, to answer telephones, perform the actual transcription of MD Orders (except when professionally appropriate) and schedule appointments and procedures unless directed by his/her supervisor as specifically necessary for patient care. The Hospital Center will continue its ongoing consideration of improvements in clerical support for RNs and in this regard will initially increase the number of night shift floating unit clerks at each Site to four (4).
6
C.	Staffing
Mutually agreed upon RN staffing guidelines are memorialized in Schedule B1 of this Agreement. The Hospital Center agrees to meet both the current and improved staffing guidelines through the use of filled positions or, in the case of vacancies, supplemental staffing, i.e., voluntary overtime, per diem and agency nurses.
The Hospital Center acknowledges that patient care needs require an assessment of the adequacy of the RN table of organization. When the character of a unit has changed, Nursing Administration shall have the authority in consultation with the Association in the corporate Labor-Management Committee Forum, to modify unit-by-unit, shift-by-shift assignments. It may not reduce the total number of authorized RN positions during the term of this Agreement without consultation with the Association and the Executive Committee except under the conditions set forth below.
It is understood by both parties that, as the Hospital Center’s patient care units at both Sites continue to be relocated to the new facilities, the configuration of RN staffing will need to be changed due to both a potential reduction in beds as well as to a reconfiguration of the size of patient units. The Hospital Center and the Association agree to discuss, with at least sixty (60) days notice to the Association, in the Labor-Management Committee Forum, the establishment of new staffing guidelines. It is understood that, if the Hospital Center’s bed complement is reduced, its RN table of organization may be reduced commensurately.
The Hospital Center recognizes that record keeping requirements impact on the RNs’ availability to provide direct patient care and therefore agrees that it will make every effort to reduce paperwork and decrease duplicative record keeping and will communicate changes to the staff effectively and expeditiously.
Nothing in this provision precludes the Hospital Center, as a result of financial difficulties, from engaging in a reduction of force that will affect this bargaining unit.
The Hospital Center is consistently monitoring census fluctuations. It shall use the guideline of 15% of average occupancy rate to make adjustments to the staffing guidelines on units with an average occupancy of twenty-one (21) or more patients, and 20% of average daily occupancy rate to make adjustment to the staffing guidelines on units with an average occupancy of less than twenty-one patients. When patient census is fifteen percent above average occupancy on a unit with an average occupancy of twenty-one (21) or more patients, or twenty percent above average occupancy on a unit with an average occupancy of less than twenty-one patients, the Hospital shall add more RNs, as described in Schedule B herein. Every effort will be made to find additional RN staff as needed including the use of voluntary overtime, per diem staff and Agency staff.
When patient census is fifteen percent below average occupancy on a unit with an average occupancy of twenty-one (21) or more patients or twenty percent below on a unit with an average occupancy of less than twenty-one patients, the Hospital may reduce RN staffing on that unit.
7
	The parties recognize that other restrictions may exist which render these rules inapplicable on a given unit. In determining the census on a unit during the course of a work shift, for purposes of this Section, Hospital management will count the number of reasonably anticipated admissions and discharges during that shift. The Hospital Center agrees to make best efforts to provide that an RN who is assigned to care for a non-critical vented patient will be assigned no more than four (4) patients. All critically ill patients on the following units will be supported by guidelines that translate to one RN to every two patients: Roosevelt Hospital: 8A South, 8A East, NICU, PICU; St. Luke’s Hospital: 7E, 6E. On units where acuity has increased, the minimal staffing guidelines shall be supplemented, as the Hospital Center is able, through the use of voluntary overtime, an active float pool and subject to call. The Hospital Center will provide the Association with access to staffing reports, including the daily staffing sheet/daily work sheet, in the nursing offices, which provide information about the daily census, and the details of RN staffing. The NYSNA release person, NYSNA Nursing Representative and/or two members of the NYSNA Executive Committee appointed by the Association will have access to these records in both nursing offices and will be given access to a copy machine to obtain copies of these reports if desired. Unit based staff meetings to discuss staffing will be held regularly. Notice of such meetings will be given at the time of the posting of the final work schedule. It is understood that the final responsibility for staffing and other administrative issues on the unit rests with the nursing management. A claim by the Association or its members that the Hospital Center has failed to comply with the expressed commitment contained in this provision and Schedules B shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in Article 14 of the Agreement. Both parties commit themselves to an interpretation of this provision that shall not be unreasonable.
D.	Corporate Labor/Management Committee 1.	Structure The Hospital Center and the registered nurses agree on the shared goal of safe, high quality patient care and are committed to jointly achieving this goal. a. The Corporate Labor/Management Committee is the forum for discussion of nurse staffing requirements. The Committee shall be comprised of the NYSNA Executive Committee from both Sites, the Senior Vice President for Patient Care Services, the Corporate Vice President for Human Resources, the Chief Nurse, a Director of Patient Care Services and the Director of Labor Relations.
8
b.	The CLM shall function in an atmosphere that fosters group decisions through cooperative relationships between management and employees provided that this does not preclude the registered nurse representatives from exercising their rights under other provisions of the Agreement.
c.	Meetings will be held monthly in accordance with a predetermined schedule. Reminder notices shall be sent. Best efforts will be made not to cancel monthly meetings. However, cancelled meetings shall be held within a week of the cancellation at the request of either party.
2.	Staffing Issues
a.	The Committee will explore and evaluate other systems of delivery of patient care. In making its evaluations regarding the need for increased nurse staffing requirements, the CLM shall, together with input from registered nurses on the unit, take into account the following criteria:
•	Patient acuity;
•	Unit occupancy;
•	Qualifications of staff;
•	Staffing mix;
•	Productivity;
•	Unit geography;
•	Nature of service;
•	Number of admissions and discharges on each shift;
•	Vacancies (including sick calls);
•	Availability of supplemental staff (overtime, per diem, agency, float);
•	Budgetary parameters;
•	Protests of Assignment.
In addition, federal, state and local regulations and JCAHO regulations shall be considered.
b.	CLM requests for staffing records or other pertinent information will be provided for confidential review at the regular CLM meetings. Methodology for services such as outpatient settings, QA/UR, CRNAs, and Instructors will be developed over the term of the contract.
c.	The CLM is empowered to review, evaluate and reach conclusions based on the foregoing criteria regarding the need for increased nurse staffing in the Hospital Center generally and on a unit-by-unit basis at the Hospital Center.
d.	Upon completion of review(s) of a unit or units, the CLM shall submit its conclusions to the Senior Vice President for Patient Care Services in consultation with the Chief Nurse and Directors of Nursing, for joint discussion to begin within ten (10) days of submission. The Senior Vice President, Nursing and Patient Services will respond within ten (10) days following the discussion. If the CLM does not receive a

satisfactory response, the decision may be appealed to the President or designee who will respond in writing within ten (10) days.
e.	Following review, it is the Hospital Center’s intention to approve and implement CLM conclusions developed in accordance with the foregoing process. To the extent that implementing an approved plan would require an increase in staff, the Hospital Center will phase in such staff.
3.	Guidelines
The Hospital Center recognizes and encourages the role of the professional nurse in setting priorities for patient care delivery on individual patient units. Consistent with this, the Committee will develop and update guidelines which will provide options and alternatives to be used in those instances when the required nursing care hours are greater or lesser than the available staff hours and will include a method for prioritizing nursing care. These guidelines may include, but are not limited to, float pool, voluntary subject-to-call pay, use of agency and per diem nurses, use of alternate weekend schedule, and Tailor Time, but not mandatory overtime. In addition, this list shall include guidelines for determining the appropriate use of nurse management personnel in performing direct patient care. Following review, the Hospital Center is responsible for implementation of CLM guidelines within thirty (30) days of receipt thereof. This implementation shall not be arbitrarily or capriciously denied.
4.	Protest of Assignment
a.	In the event that a registered nurse questions an assignment based on her/his professional judgment of the safety of her/his staffing on that shift, the nurse shall immediately notify the responsible Administrative Coordinator or Nurse Manager Supervisor or designee. The Administrative Coordinator or the Nurse Manager Supervisor or designee shall appear on the unit within thirty (30) minutes, or as soon as possible in the event of multiple requests or an emergency occurring at the same time, and will review the assignment and make a determination in writing on a Protest of Assignment Form as to whether the assignment is safe.
The Administrative Coordinator, Nurse Manager, Supervisor or designee will report the Protest of Assignment to the Director of Patient Care Services at the completion of the shift or upon the Director of Patient Care Services return to work if the Protest of Assignment occurs on the evening or night shifts.
b.	If the response to a POA from the Administrative Coordinator or Nurse Manager is determined by the RN to be inadequate, then the RN has the option to request from the Director of Patient Care Services a written response within ten (10) working days.
The Director of Patient Care Services will not be required to respond in writing to protests in situations where proven efforts were made to provide staffing.
10
If a satisfactory agreement is not reached with the Director of Patient Care Services written response to the affected registered nurses, the matter will be presented at a Step Three hearing. The hearing shall be scheduled within five (5) working days and heard within ten (10) days unless otherwise mutually agreed by both parties. The Hospital’s response shall be given within five (5) days following the hearing.
The Hospital Center agrees to hear multiple Protests of Assignment filed for the same unit, same shift, as a class action grievance at Step Three.
c.	An employee shall not in any way or manner be disciplined for questioning any assignment.
d.	If a satisfactory resolution is not reached at the Step Three hearing, the matter may be submitted to a confidential, advisory arbitration proceeding before a non-party healthcare professional (Arbitrator) mutually acceptable to the Hospital Center and the Association.
e.	The issue before the Arbitrator shall be whether an unsafe patient care condition exists as alleged in the Protest.
f.	In the event the parties cannot mutually agree on the identity of said neutral, the rules for voluntary arbitration of the American Arbitration Association shall be invoked, per Section 14.06 but from a qualified health care panel.
g.	A confidential hearing shall be held before the arbitrator at which the Association and the Hospital Center will present relevant evidence in support of their positions. Such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of submission to a mutually acceptable neutral; otherwise, the time limits provided for within the AAA rules shall prevail.
h.	The parties agree to submit a joint request to the AAA to develop a qualified health care panel.
i.	Following the hearing, the arbitrator will issue a written report, and if deemed appropriate by the arbitrator, a recommendation regarding the protest to the NQAD and NYSNA. This report shall be discussed in confidence with CLM members at a meeting of the NQAD. The CLM members will also be advised of any actions to be taken as a result of the report. The RN who originally filed the protest shall have a right to attend this meeting. The report and any recommendations by the arbitrator hereunder shall be advisory only and may be accepted or rejected by the Hospital Center in its discretion. If NYSNA finds the resolution unacceptable, the report and recommendations may be judiciously utilized by the Association.
j.	On a case-by-case basis, should the Hospital Center conclude that the foregoing process is being used in a manner designed to harass or embarrass the Hospital Center, or in a manner otherwise inconsistent with the effective and efficient operation of the Hospital Center, the process will be suspended pending a decision by an
11
arbitrator selected pursuant to the Expedited Rules of AAA with regard to the Hospital Center’s belief. However, such a claim of inconsistency, harassment or embarrassment will not be found if a valid complaint regarding unsafe patient care exists. If the arbitrator determines that the Hospital Center’s allegation has no merit, the process shall resume. If the arbitrator determines that the Hospital Center’s allegation has merit, the process for that particular case becomes null and void.
3.01 Local Bargaining Unit
There shall be a Local Bargaining Unit (LBU) at the Hospital Center.
Membership
Membership of the LBU shall consist of all employees covered by this collective bargaining agreement.
3.02 Joint Nursing-Medical Practices Committee
The Hospital Center shall maintain a Joint Nursing-Medical Practices Committee. The Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives of the Local Bargaining Unit, Nursing Administration and Medical Staff, with each group selecting its own representatives and shall meet a minimum of once every three (3) months. The Committee shall address itself generally to all matters affecting patient care in the Hospital Center and, specifically, to areas of overlapping responsibilities which have implications for patient care.
The Committee shall have the authority to discuss the foregoing matters and to make such recommendations in these areas as it deems necessary and appropriate for consideration by Nursing Administration and the Medical Board. Any deadlocks in this Committee shall be resolved by the President or designee.
3.03 Central Education Committee

The charge of the Committee shall relate to the subjects of continuing education, tuition reimbursement, and the administration of those aspects of this Agreement that relate to education and certification differentials.
The Central Education Committee shall meet bi-monthly beginning October 17, 2005. There shall be three representatives from the Association, one local representative from each Site and the Association General Representative and two representatives from Hospital management. The local representatives shall be paid for two hours for each meeting.

3.04 Standing Committees
Management will cover attendance at standing committee meetings in the following manner:
1.	Calendars shall be published in September and revised in March of each year with the express dates and times of meetings shown. NYSNA shall provide the Hospital Center with the names of the members of contractual committees.
2.	RNs who are members of standing committees shall reinforce the dates/times their attendance is necessary at such meetings at the time work schedules are being developed.
3.	To maximize attendance, the meeting times of committees composed of RNs only shall be scheduled at the start/end of shifts. The Hospital Center shall make best efforts to schedule the meeting times of committees composed of RNs and non-RNs at the start/end of shifts, but the parties acknowledge that such decision shall be left to the committee members themselves.
Since the attendance by RNs at the meetings of standing committees of which they are members is a high priority, at the time schedules are being developed, the Nurse Manager or applicable supervisor shall exercise his/her discretion to provide coverage staffing for the committee member, which may include overtime, but may also include, as mutually agreed, a day off. If a mutually agreed day off is utilized, the time spent at the committee meeting shall be compensated in pay or compensatory time off, at the discretion of Nursing Administration and, in this case, the fifth paragraph of Section 7.20 shall be applicable.
The Hospital Center shall produce minutes of the proceedings of all committees listed herein, and shall provide copies of such minutes to the Co-Chairpersons of the two Sites.
Hospital Standing Committees covered by this Section are:
Nurse Practice Committee
Policy and Practice
Nursing Nutrition

Preplanned release time shall be scheduled for those registered nurses who are in need of improving their efficiency in CODE management to observe and participate in CODES occurring in other units. The parties understand that such release time is contingent upon the operational requirements of the unit.
It shall be the responsibility of Nursing Administration to ensure that nursing staff be proficient in code management, and that such proficiency shall be measured by established standards.
E.	The Employer agrees to respond to requests for continuing education approval within two (2) weeks of submission of request. Time off and financial aid within reasonable limits will be granted for participation in educational institutes, workshops or meetings. An annual amount of money, equal to $190 times the number of RNs covered by this Agreement at each Site, shall be budgeted and administered by the Vice President, Nursing Patient Services, Assistant Vice President, Nursing and Patient Service or designee in a reasonable and non-discriminatory manner, with recommendations from the LBU, for expenses in attending such educational programs up to three (3) days per year. Additional days may be approved at the discretion of the Vice President, Nursing and Patient Services, Assistant Vice President, Nursing and Patient Services, or designee. Such authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld.

There shall not be any carryover of unused funds from year to year. Mandated courses shall not be charged to the Fund. A report on fund activity shall be issued quarterly and provided to the Association on or about February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1 of each year.

The Hospital Center will pay reimbursable conference expenses within thirty (30) calendar days after submission of the reimbursement request to the Nursing Office at each Site, provided the employee has submitted all necessary documentation within sixty (60) calendar days after completion of said conference. Failure of an employee to submit documentation for reimbursement within the above described period will preclude reimbursement unless the employee presents a valid reason which is beyond his/her control for being unable to comply within the sixty (60) days. However, employees shall have the option of utilizing the Hospital Center travel agency for making their travel arrangements for expenses incurred herein.
At least one (1) CRNA shall be scheduled to attend the annual CRNA convention held in August for five (5) days and if staffing permits, one (1) additional CRNA may be scheduled for vacation during that week.

Any transfer to the posted position will take place no later than the start of the pay period beginning
15
four (4) weeks after a decision to effectuate this transfer. Unsuccessful candidates will be offered a counseling session with the interviewing Nurse Manager or Department Head as applicable to discuss how such candidate may strengthen his/her position as a candidate for a future opening. All efforts shall be made to fill positions from within. All vacant positions from each Site shall be included in the Hospital Center Nursing Newsletter.

The said period may be extended up to an additional three (3) months with the consent of the Association which will not be unreasonably withheld. These employees shall be eligible only for the salary schedule and grievance procedure and shall not be eligible for any benefits.
The Hospital Center shall be entitled to employ independently contracted registered professional nurses only to the extent it is unable to recruit qualified regularly employed personnel.
When this Section must be invoked, the Hospital Center shall hold such independently contracted personnel to the same standards as it does its regular staff (i.e., after orientation under the in-service department is provided such employees shall be required to implement all policies and procedures as expected of regular personnel).
Temporary employees have the same weekend obligations as regular staff and temporary employees with six (6) or more months of service with the Hospital will work one holiday each year, either Christmas or New Year’s Day.
In addition, agency nurses shall be expected to administer blood products and count narcotics.
Travel Nurse (Agency)

An employee will be on probation for sixty (60) working days from the date of employment, excluding time lost for sickness and other leaves of absence. The length of the probationary period for flextime employees shall be converted to hours. The Hospital may automatically extend the probationary period for up to an additional sixty (60) working days. The Hospital Center will provide the employee with written notice containing the reason and length of extension of the probationary period and will provide the Association with written notice containing the length of extension of the probationary period. During the probationary period, the employee will be subject to demotions, suspensions, other disciplines or discharge at the Hospital Center's sole discretion, without recourse to the grievance procedure, but will otherwise be covered by this Agreement. For specialty areas, the probationary period will be ninety (90) working days. The Hospital Center may automatically extend the probationary period for up to an additional ninety (90) working days. Specialty areas are defined as any unit requiring ACLS, PALS, NRP, as well as oncology areas requiring chemotherapy skills.
Employees on probation shall receive frequent regular counseling guidance and assistance by Hospital management regarding their performance with a view toward improving any deficiencies that develop.
Probationary employees shall not be assigned the charge responsibility, and shall not be floated off their unit unless staffing and patient care requirements create conditions in which there is no other option. The parties understand this to mean that non-probationary employees on a given unit will take charge and will be floated prior to probationary employees. Probationary employees will take charge and be floated when there are no non-probationary employees on the unit to do so. Probationary employees, who have previously been employed at the Hospital Center within the last three (3) years and those who are serving a probationary period due to a transfer to a new unit or division, may be assigned the charge responsibility and may be floated. These restrictions do not apply to employees in the float pool.
4.08 Post-Probationary Discipline
Except as stated in paragraph 4.07, an employee will be demoted, suspended, otherwise disciplined, or discharged only for just cause. The term "just cause" shall be deemed to include, but shall not be limited to, an infraction of any of the rules and regulations of the Hospital Center. If an employee feels aggrieved by any order to perform a certain task, the employee shall perform the task and then submit the protest as a grievance.
The procedures set forth in Article 14 apply to post probationary discipline.
Prompt notice of any disciplinary conferences shall be given to the employee. The Employer will provide the reason for the meeting when notifying the employee of the need for a disciplinary conference, or “fact finding” meeting. The Hospital Center will apprise employees of their right to Association representation before conducting a disciplinary conference. If an employee wishes to be represented by the Association in this regard, the Hospital Center will provide a reasonable opportunity for the employee to meet with the representative prior to a disciplinary conference. Whenever possible, the
19
disciplinary meeting and/or fact finding shall be scheduled at a reasonable time during the employees’ regular work hours. Whenever possible, employees shall not be contacted while off duty for purposes of this paragraph.
Any conference notes or verbal warnings relating to a matter which has not recurred within a one (1) year period shall be removed from the employee's file. Conference notes are not disciplinary.
4.09 Seniority: Definition
Bargaining unit seniority is defined as the length of time an employee has been continuously employed by the Hospital Center.
4.10 Seniority: Accrual and Acquisition
An employee's seniority shall commence after the completion of the probationary period and shall be retroactive to the date of the employee's last employment date. A regular part-time employee shall accrue prorated seniority. Seniority shall not accrue during unpaid leaves of absence, or while an employee is on suspension. Seniority will accrue when an employee is on a leave and receiving workers' compensation.
A regular full-time or part-time employee who converts to per diem and remains available on a regular basis for per diem assignments shall, upon reemployment, be credited with the accrued seniority he or she had at the time of the original conversion.
4.11 Seniority: Loss of Seniority
A.	An employee's seniority shall be lost when the employee: (a) terminates voluntarily, except employees who voluntarily resign and are accepted for reemployment within twelve months will be reinstated per B. below; (b) is discharged for just cause; (c) overstays a leave of absence, except where illness of the employee as a cause of delay in returning to work is certified by a doctor, or when another provable reason makes it impossible for an individual to return on time, provided that employee notifies the Hospital Center of such illness prior to the last day of the scheduled leave of absence, and expected date of return; (d) is laid off for a period of one (1) year or a period exceeding the length of the employee's continuous service, whichever is less, or if for any reason one (1) year has elapsed since the employee last worked for the Hospital Center; or (e) failure to return to work within two (2) weeks after issuance of a recall notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the employee's last known address, provided that the Assistant Vice President for Nursing receives a written commitment to return to work from the employee recalled within eight (8) calendar days after issuance of a recall notice. An employee may receive an additional one (1) week to return to work where illness of the employee is the cause of the delay and is certified by a doctor, or where another provable reason makes it impossible for an individual to return on time, provided the employee provides written notification of such reason within eight (8) calendar days as discussed above; or (f) fails to apply for reemployment within the statutory period after honorable separation from military service.
B.	Employees who voluntarily resign and are accepted for re-employment within twelve (12) months will be reinstated. When an employee is reinstated he/she retains all previous seniority, experience differential,
20
vacation and other length of employment related benefits. The Hospital Center retains the right to deny employment to any applicant.
4.12 Seniority: Application
Bargaining unit seniority shall apply in the computation and determination of eligibility for all benefits where length of service is a factor pursuant to this Agreement.
Bargaining unit seniority will apply to layoff and recall.
Bargaining unit seniority within the unit will apply to vacation time selection. For purposes of vacation selection, a unit is defined as those employees sharing a time sheet. If a combination of time sheets adversely affects employees' priority to vacation time selection, the Hospital Center agrees to meet with the Association and make reasonable adjustments to minimize the impact of such change.
In vacation time selection, seniority will be subject to the Hospital Center's operating requirements.
In filling permanent vacancies, the Hospital Center will give first opportunity successively to (a) regular full-time employees and (b) regular part-time employees. Where a promotional vacancy in a bargaining unit position occurs and two (2) or more employees are under consideration for such vacancy, the Hospital Center shall promote the most competent employee, as determined by the Vice President for Nursing, or designee. Where two or more employees are under consideration for a vacancy and both require training in order to perform the duties of the position, the most senior employee will be selected provided that the employee has not been disciplined in the twelve months prior to their application. The Hospital Center in its discretion, may waive the twelve month restriction.
All applicants will be notified of the status of their application in writing within one week of the selection.
Disputes under this provision shall be subject to the grievance procedure only if the question involves an arbitrary decision of the Vice President for Nursing or designee. An employee who is promoted shall serve the same probationary period in the new position as a new employee. If the employee is removed from the new position during the probationary period, the employee shall be permitted to return to the employee's former job title without loss of other benefits, excepting that if the employee is discharged, such discharge shall be in accordance with paragraph 4.07 of this Agreement.
The Hospital Center may continue the practice of offering temporary promotional opportunities classified as "acting." Such employee shall receive the pay and prerequisites of the higher position so long as the employee holds that position. A dispute concerning the period of such "acting" status shall be subject to Section 14 hereof.
Where more than fifty percent (50%) of an employee's regular compensation rate is charged to a special or non-budgetary fund or grant and such employee is informed at the time of employment or at the time of transfer that the employee's employment is for a special non-budgetary or research project and
21
subject to this paragraph, such employee shall, for the purpose of layoff, be considered to have grant seniority which may be exercised only within the project or grant to which assigned. Such employee shall be considered to have bargaining unit seniority for purposes of transfer or recall to a vacant position outside of the special project, provided that the employee transferred or recalled has the ability to perform the work in the new position as determined by the Hospital Center and such determination by the Hospital Center shall not be arbitrary.
Employees, fifty percent (50%) or more whose regular compensation rate is charged to the Hospital's budget, shall be considered as having seniority on that basis and not under a grant.
4.13 Seniority: Lists
The Hospital Center will, on execution of this Agreement and at least every April 1 and September 1 thereafter, post and furnish to the Association seniority lists and will correct such lists from time to time as may be necessary. The posted list will conclusively establish an employee's seniority unless the employee protests it, in writing, within thirty (30) days from presentation to the Association or, if the employee is on absence leave or vacation or otherwise unable to so protest it within such time, within thirty (30) days after the employee returns from such leave or vacation or such disability is removed.
Bargaining unit seniority lists shall be divided into units and posted on a unit-by-unit basis twice per year April 1 and September 1. For purposes of this Section, the unit shall be where employees share a time sheet.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this Section, an employee given notice of layoff shall have seven (7) calendar days to review the seniority list and notify the Director of Records and Systems of a claimed error in his/her seniority date. If an error is identified, it shall be corrected.
4.14 Transfers
Hospital Center will notify the Association at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the proposed implementation date of any transfer between the Roosevelt and St. Luke's Sites.
The Hospital Center shall provide the Association with a list of units to be transferred between Sites and the movement of staff that will result no later than two (2) weeks after the final administrative decision to effect such a transfer is made. Proposed transfers of the work force between Sites will not take place arbitrarily and capriciously.
An employee who is transferred from one Site to the other Site shall not lose his/her seniority.
This Section shall not be invoked to avoid implementation of Section 5.08.
If an employee selected for a voluntary lateral transfer is removed from the new position during the first sixty (60) calendar days in the new position, the employee shall return to the employee’s former position, if available, or to another vacant position in the original clinical division. If that position is on a different shift from the original position, the employee shall have priority to return to the first available vacancy on the original shift in the original clinical
22
division. Employee rights under this paragraph are secondary to the provisions of Section 5.08 Layoff.
5.	WORK TIME
5.01 Normal Workday
For the purposes of determining application of an employee's regular compensation rate, the employee's normal workday will be seven and one-half (71/a) consecutive work hours, excluding any scheduled meal period, unless otherwise specifically provided in the appointment to the position.
Nothing herein shall preclude the continuation, without penalty, of the Hospital Center's present practice with regard to scheduling of work on the night shift. The weekend definition at the Roosevelt Site shall be the same as the St. Luke's Site.
When an employee's regular workweek or schedule is changed as a result of changed operating requirements, the Hospital Center shall give timely advanced notice to the Association and then to the employees affected. The Hospital Center will meet with the Association to discuss the impact of such changes.
When shift times on a unit are changed, the Hospital Center shall request volunteers from the affected shift. If there are no volunteers, then employees from the affected shift shall be assigned to the changed work schedules based on bargaining unit seniority within that shift. Those employees affected will be defined as all employees on the shift affected by the work schedule change.
When the Hospital Center has a need for an employee with a particular, specific skill to move to the changed work schedule, it shall not be required to follow the above described procedure.
When the Hospital Center expands services, it shall not unreasonably deprive incumbent employees of their existing benefits, such as the shift and work schedule for which they were hired.
5.02 Normal Workweek
For the purposes of determining application of an employee's regular compensation rate, the employee's normal workweek will be seventy-five (75) hours in ten (10) workdays in each biweekly period, and the employee will have four (4) days off in each biweekly period unless otherwise specifically provided in the appointment to the position.
The workweek begins 12:01 a.m. Sunday and ends midnight Saturday.
Nothing herein shall preclude the continuation, without penalty, of the Hospital Center's present practice with regard to scheduling of work on the night shift.
5.03 Alternate Workday and Workweek
The Hospital Center and the Association agree to engage in Alternative Work Schedules to improve staffing and offer opportunities for the professional staff to vary schedules. The intent of the parties with these alternate work schedules (AWS) is to continue to provide quality nursing care within existing budgetary
23
limits, provided that existing budgetary limits are a general limitation, not a specific prohibition of conversions that involve additional cost.
Effective as soon as possible but no later than August 19, 2008, the AWS B. 2) will be implemented in the PACU at the St. Luke’s Site. Effective July 1, 2009, the AWS B. 2) will be implemented in the PACU at Roosevelt Hospital.
The Hospital Center agrees to discussions concerning implementing the AWS B. 1) schedule in the Ambulatory Surgery Units at both St. Luke’s and Roosevelt Hospitals in January, 2009.
A.	DURATION:
Units on Alternative Work Schedules and positions on mixed units will continue on those schedules for the duration of the current collective bargaining agreement. The decision to modify the program will be subject to mutual agreement of both parties.
B.	ALTERNATE SCHEDULES: WORKDAY AND WORKWEEK:
1)	A four day, 37.5 hour workweek
9.375 paid hours/day
40 minute unpaid meal break
Two fifteen (15) minute paid rest breaks
Length of workday - 10 hours
A unit may use the four day workweek on a limited basis on a specific shift if such scheduling meets the staffing requirements.
2)	11.5 hour shift, i.e., 7:30 a.m. - 8:00 p.m. with
One (1) hours meal period - unpaid
Two (2) fifteen (15) minute paid breaks
One (1) twenty (20) minute paid break
13 shifts in a four (4) week period
The Employer will make best efforts not to schedule more than three (3) 11.5 shifts in a row unless the employee agrees. The Hospital Center will not use unit closure to circumvent the continuance of any alternative work schedules.
Employees working the 11.5 shift will retain such shift unless they transfer to a unit where no 11.5 hour shifts are being worked or if it disrupts shift pairing on the new unit.
On those shifts on a unit which have AWS, the Nurse Manager or designee, if requested by employee, will have the option to combine meal periods with rest periods, if the activity of that unit so indicates.
C.	SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL:
Shift differential will be paid for all hours worked between 3:30 p.m. and 8:30 a.m. for those participating in the Alternate Work Schedules.
The Hospital Center agrees to grandfather current pay arrangements for shift differential in existing flexible schedules.
D.	PREMIUM COMPENSATION RATE:
Except as noted in subsection N below, overtime for employees in the Alternate Work Schedules shall be calculated for work exceeding seventy-five (75) hours biweekly.
24
E.	POSTING:
Preferential consideration will be given to present employees. When vacancies occur in Alternate Work Schedules they shall be posted by the Nursing Department in the usual manner.
F.	MONETARY BENEFITS: COMPENSATION FOR TIME NOT WORKED: Entitlement to sick time, vacation time, holidays, personal days, bereavement, marriage and family event leave shall be calculated and credited in actual hours and paid and deducted accordingly. Deductions shall be made from the appropriate time accrual only.
Where employees are approved to attend up to and including three (3) days of Continuing Education, they shall be compensated for such days at the rate of 7.5 hours per day times their regular hourly rate of pay and, if their regular work day is in excess of 7.5 hours, they shall have the option to supplement such compensation for such days up to their regular work day by charging accrued holiday, personal or vacation benefits on an hour for hour basis.
G.	EVALUATION:
Any Alternate Work Schedule shall be evaluated jointly by the Hospital Center (Nursing Administration) and the Association annually and any changes will be subject to mutual agreement of both parties.
H.	NOTIFICATION:
The Hospital Center agrees to notify the Association and the Council Chairperson of those units involved in Alternate Work Schedules and the type of schedules implemented.
I.	DEFINITIONS:
Budgetary limits or budgetary constraints are defined as the budgeted resources historically allocated to the unit in the form of benefit relief for vacations, holidays and sick time, i.e., budgeted per diems and overtime.
J.	LIMITATIONS:
Nothing in this provision shall be construed as an exception to Section 13.
K.	MASTER PLAN:
The Hospital Center shall not utilize the Master Plan to phase out 11.5 hour positions. The Hospital Center shall not use the Master Plan to circumvent the AWS agreement. If a flex-time unit merges with a 7.5 hour unit, flextime employees shall be able to maintain their flex time status, unless the operational needs of the unit change. This language shall not be enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner.
The parties agree that grievances relating to this issue shall be presented directly at Step Three of the grievance procedure. The Association shall proceed to expedited arbitration if it is unsatisfied with the Step Three resolution.
L.	DISCIPLINE:
The Employer agrees to maintain the current practice on discipline. For example, suspensions shall be rendered in single day increments.
25
M.	DEFINITION OF EXEMPT STATUS EMPLOYEES:
Regularly scheduled full-time employees on the 11.5 hour work schedule will be paid on a salaried basis. This salary shall not be subject to reduction for absences of less than one (1) full day or for absences on account of jury duty, judicial witness duty or temporary military leave. Deductions from salary for absences of one (1) full day or more will be made after a registered nurse has exhausted his/her accrual of paid sick and personal leave or if the nurse elects an unpaid absence of one (1) or more full days.
Full-time participants will be paid a bi-weekly salary which is equivalent to 75 hours of pay at the nurse's regular compensation rate. This amount shall not be subject to reduction, yet may be increased for overtime work performed in accordance with the following subparagraph.
N.	OVERTIME:
Overtime, in addition to salary, will be paid at a rate of one and one-half (11/2) times regular compensation rate for work in excess of 34.5 hours in a week in which three (3) alternative work schedule shifts are scheduled, and for work in excess of 46 hours in the week that four (4) alternate work shifts are scheduled. For this paragraph's purpose, an employee's workweek shall include time compensated for annual leave days, leave for death in family, marriage leave, paternity days, jury duty, sick leave and education days.
O.	VACATION:
An employee must indicate on his/her vacation request form if he/she is taking a three (3) or four (4) day vacation week. Failure to do so will result in a three (3) day week vacation.
5.04 Work Schedules
The Hospital Center will post a work schedule of each employee's assignment on the Friday two weeks in advance of the start of the workweek. This schedule will remain until it is superseded by a new schedule or changed by agreement between the Hospital Center and the employee concerned.
After full-time, part-time and per diem employees have had their normal work schedules developed, and the voluntary overtime slots have been posted and filled, the Nursing Office shall determine where unmet staffing needs exist.
Employees with five (5) or more years of service shall not be required to rotate. Employees with less than five (5) years of service shall rotate up to a maximum of two (2) weeks.
There shall be a maximum of two (2) different shift rotations composed of days, evenings or nights, assigned in a five (5) day period, except in unusual circumstances, without the consent of the nurse.
Employees will have ten (10) hours off duty from the end of the work period unless an individual nurse agrees to less.
A day shift Assistant Nursing Care Coordinator does not rotate to evenings and nights. Assistant Nursing Care Coordinators shall not be required to float.
26
5.05 Overtime Work: Compensating Time Off
Except with mutual consent of the Hospital Center and employee, the Hospital Center will not require an employee to take compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay.
5.06 Work Obligation
An employee will report to work on time, ready, willing and able to work. An employee will work the hours assigned, provided, however, that mandatory overtime is abolished inasmuch as Voluntary Subject-to-Call (Section 10.14) shall be invoked when units are vulnerable to such situations.
Voluntary overtime shall be allocated on an equitable basis. A written record of the Hospital Center's request for voluntary overtime shall be maintained in a log book in the Nursing Office or the unit, as appropriate.
Notwithstanding the above, employees may be required to work mandatory periods in disasters such as blackouts, floods, major snowstorms and hurricanes. Before mandating overtime, the Hospital Center will make a good faith effort to obtain coverage via per diem/agency nurses and voluntary overtime. If these alternatives are unavailable, overtime shall be assigned on an equitable basis and a written record of such assignments shall be maintained in a log book in the Nursing Office or unit, as appropriate. When employees are required to work mandatory overtime under this paragraph they will be scheduled for no more than sixteen hours of work.
5.07 Employment Security
Employees who are employed or who are on the recall list as of January 1, 2007, will not be replaced by non-bargaining unit employees for the duration of this Agreement.
An employee hired into a Hospital budgeted position prior to January 1, 2005 shall not be subject to layoff during the term of this Agreement except in the event of: closure of beds for longer than three (3) consecutive months; a reduction in total number of in-patient discharges/out-patient visits in the affected unit for a period of no less than forty-five (45) consecutive days as compared to the immediately preceding period of like duration; changes in, reduction of or elimination of clinical programs; any consequential reduction in reimbursement rates that is enacted after January 1, 2005.
For purposes of this Section, clinical programmatic change refers to:
1.	Change in type of patient population.
2.	Change in acute care to sub acute care.
3.	A demonstrated change in in-patient acuity within an area of clinical practice as the result of a change in clinical modality.
An employee guaranteed employment during the contract term, but whose job is eliminated, shall obtain a position through the procedures in Section 5.08.
This Section shall expire on the ratification of a successor collective bargaining Agreement.
The sixty (60) day notification requirement in Section 5.08 Layoff can run concurrent with the above time requirements.
27
5.08 Layoff
(a)	Layoff is defined as a loss of a position by reason of a mandatory reduction in the number of occupied positions on a unit due to a work force reduction.
(b)	The parties recognize their mutual interest in avoiding layoffs and maintaining a stable and secure work force. When the Hospital Center needs to achieve economic savings which may entail or result in layoffs, it shall meet with the Association sixty (60) days in advance of the contemplated layoffs to discuss:
1.	job security;
2.	whether the savings can be practicably achieved without resort to layoff; and
3.	if layoff is necessary, how the affected nurse's job rights are to be protected with minimal disruption. The Hospital Center will make its best effort to maintain the affected nurse in comparable employment per Sections 5.08 and 5.09 of the contract.
Once the sixty (60) day notice has been given, request for transfer and/or shift changes will not be approved and vacancies will be frozen.
The sixty (60) day notice will include the positions being eliminated, displacement list, seniority lists, (alphabetical, by clinical division, least senior to most senior) and the current vacancy list. The vacancy list will be updated weekly until layoff process is completed.
In the event of a layoff in a job title covered by this Agreement, probationary employees within the job title within the clinical division affected shall be laid off first without regard to their individual period of employment. Regular employees serving a probationary period due to promotion, transfer, or temporary assignment to a position other than their regular position shall be considered non-probationary for the purposes of this Section.
Where an employee who is on a leave of absence returns within three (3) months as required by Section 8.02, such employee shall be entitled to exercise his/her layoff rights in accordance with this Section as if he/she were an incumbent in that position at the time of the layoff. Any temporary employee filling the position of the employee on leave shall be considered probationary for the purposes of layoff.
Next, non-probationary employees in the job title within the clinical division affected shall be laid off in reverse order of their bargaining unit seniority with the least senior employee laid off first. This paragraph is subject to the minimum staffing requirements of Section 5.08(l).
(c)	There will be two (2) categories of employees affected by a layoff, displaced or subject to layoff.
Displaced employees are RNs who are not among the least senior nurses in the clinical division but whose units are being downsized or closed.
28
If a unit is being downsized, the least senior employees on the unit will be affected regardless of shift. Once the sixty (60) day notice is given and a vacancy occurs on an affected unit, then the most senior employee on the displacement list on that unit may take that vacancy and be removed from the displacement list.
RNs subject to layoff are those RNs who are the least senior in their clinical division regardless of whether their unit is being closed or downsized.
When employee occupied positions are being eliminated, employees in those positions will be placed on the displacement list unless they are the least senior in the clinical division in which case they will be placed on the subject to layoff list. The Employer will then give layoff notice to additional employees within the clinical division starting with the least senior, equal to the number of full-time and part-time positions on the displacement list minus the number of existing vacancies.
Employees who are being displaced then get to choose by bargaining unit seniority from a vacancy list that includes vacancies created as set forth above plus already existing or newly created vacancies. Employees will maintain their full or part-time status at their option within the clinical division. If an employee does not choose from the clinical division vacancy list, he/she will be subject to layoff and allowed to choose from the Hospital-wide vacancy list that will subsequently be available to all employees subject to layoff.
The Hospital Center will begin placement interviews not less than one (1) week after providing the vacancy list to the Association absent pending arbitration regarding 5.08(l). Placement decisions will be made during the appointment with the nursing recruiter, designee or by the conclusion of the scheduled interview appointment time. If after making a reasonable effort to contact the nurse, the Hospital Center fails to do so, the Hospital Center and the Association will consult on a placement decision.
Once the displaced employees have made decisions, the employees on the subject to layoff list then get to choose by bargaining unit seniority from among the remaining Hospital-wide vacancies as set forth in the preceding paragraph.
(d)	Once the vacancy list is exhausted or there are no available vacancies on the employees shift, then the employee may bump either the least senior employee in the same or next lower job title working on the same shift, regardless of the clinical division. Employees who have been bumped as a result of the above may then bump the least senior nurses in the Hospital regardless of shift. If an employee chooses to bump into a lower job title, the employee will be paid at the lower job title rate.
(e)	If a part-time employee who is scheduled to be laid off has greater fulltime equivalent bargaining unit seniority than a full-time employee in the same job title, the part-time employee must choose to either accept a full-time position to which he/she is entitled under this Section by filling a
29
vacant position, or if no vacant positions are available, by exercising bumping rights, or in either instance, choose to be laid off.
(f)	An employee may choose, at his or her option, to be laid off in lieu of accepting a vacant position or bumping into a different position to which they may be entitled under this Section. An employee who chooses layoff rather than accepting a vacant position has no preferential recall rights as described in Section 5.08(j).
(g)	At no time may an employee of less bargaining unit seniority bump an employee of greater bargaining unit seniority, regardless of job title. There will be two bumps for each employee that is laid off.
(h)	Employees who as a result of the elimination of their position move into a vacant position in a lower job title or bump into a lower job title shall be given the opportunity to schedule and take all accrued vacation, earned holidays and personal days before moving into the lower status.
(i)	The Hospital Center will provide only to non-probationary employees no less than thirty (30) working days' notice to employees initially affected by a layoff and will provide compensation to employees who involuntarily suffer a loss of employment resulting from such layoff to the extent of one day's pay at the employee's regular rate of compensation for each day such notice was initially deficient.
(j)	Employees who are displaced by bumping or accept vacant positions that are not on the same shift within their clinical division and full or parttime, whichever the employee affected worked, shall be placed on a preferential recall list for filling subsequent vacant positions within any clinical division. Preferential recall list shall supersede the recall list. Where two or more employees are under consideration for the same position, then bargaining unit seniority shall prevail.
Employees who step down to a lower salaried title within their clinical division will be placed on the preferential recall list for recall to their higher title in that clinical division.
Any employee placed on the preferential recall list shall remain on this list until he/she accepts any vacant position, regardless of clinical division, or in the case of a laid off employee, until that employee's seniority is terminated in accordance with this Agreement. In no event will an employee remain on the preferential recall list in excess of one (1) year. When an employee is offered a vacant position under this provision, the employee must commit in writing within eight (8) calendar days to accept that position and actually begin said assignment within two (2) weeks of its being offered or forfeit his/her preference for that position. An employee may receive an additional one (1) week to return to work where illness of the employee is the cause of the delay and is certified by a doctor, or where another provable reason makes it impossible for an individual to return on time, provided the employee provides written notification of such reason within eight (8) calendar days as discussed above.
30
(k)	Orientation shall provide the employee with the opportunity to acquire skills to perform in the area chosen. Skilled for the purposes of this Section shall be defined as the ability to provide independent, safe, direct patient care with responsibility for a full and regular work assignment in the patient care unit within a period not to exceed ninety (90) working days (18 weeks). No employee shall be denied the right to bump into a unit on the basis of this provision.
Employees who do not achieve the above definition of "skilled" may opt to go on a subject to layoff list and choose from positions in their previous clinical division only if vacancies and seniority allow them to do so.
If they are unable to fill a position, then they will receive terminal benefits and be placed on the recall list where they will be restricted to vacancies in their previous clinical division.
(l)	The Hospital Center and the Association are both committed to providing the highest quality patient care. They recognize that there may be instances where the operation of the layoff or bumping provisions of the contract would adversely affect patient care by the depletion of employees with the present ability and experience in certain patient care areas. In this event a committee will be convened comprised of Council members and the Vice-President for Nursing, or his/her designee, to establish minimum numbers of RNs with the present ability and experience to ensure that specific patient care areas maintain appropriate standards for safe, specialized care despite layoffs or bumping. Any numbers the parties are unable to agree on will be submitted to Arbitration. Where strict application of the other provisions of Section 5.08 would cause a particular patient care area to fall below the established minimums, then the next least senior employee in any clinical division within the job title affected, the loss of whom would not cause a particular patient care area to fall below the established minimums, will be laid off or bumped. If the employer wishes to utilize the process set forth in this paragraph, the Employer will meet with the Association within five (5) days of issuance of the sixty (60) day notice set forth in 5.08 (b). A dispute regarding the implementation of Section 5.08 (l) shall be submitted by either party within five (5) days of the meeting to the American Arbitration Association.
American Arbitration Association will contact the Arbitrators from a predetermined list agreed to by the parties and choose an Arbitrator who is available to hold a hearing not less than fifteen (15) days or more than twenty-five (25) days from the filing date. If no Arbitrator on the list is available, then American Arbitration Association will immediately contact the parties in order to find a mutually agreeable Arbitrator who is available. The Arbitrator will issue a decision within twenty-four (24) hours. The question before the Arbitrator will be, “What is the minimum number of experienced RNs required to maintain appropriate patient care?”
This paragraph is applicable only during times of layoff or recall affecting those limited nursing care areas described herein and is not intended to
31
establish operational minimum staffing numbers. None of the patient care areas described herein is automatically and completely exempt from the regular operation of the seniority provisions of this Section. The Association recommends that the Employer utilize per diem instructors in order to minimize the usage of this paragraph.
(m)	The Hospital Center and the Association agree that the clinical divisions for purposes of lay off are as follows:
1.	LDPP, Labor and Delivery, Fetal Evaluation Units, Birthing Center, Maternal Infant Care Unit
2.	Operating Room (SLR and Brodsky), Ambulatory Surgery (SLR and Brodsky), PAT, Endovascular Suite
3.	PACU, ICU, CCU, Neuro ICU, Cardiac Catheritization, Emergency Department, (including pediatrics) Progressive Care Units (SL 8B, SL 10B, RH 10B) and Interventional Radiology
4.	Medicine and Surgery, Rehab, Endoscopy/GI Unit, Infection Control, Hemodialysis, Radiation Oncology, Pap Smear, Discharge Planner, Infusion Services
5.	Psychiatry, In-Patient Substance Abuse Rehabilitation and In Patient Detox, CPEPs
6.	Home Care
7.	In-Patient Pediatrics and NICU, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit
8.	Ambulatory Care, Psychiatric Clinics, HIV Clinics, Outpatient Substance Abuse, Addiction Institute Evaluation Unit, and Ambulatory Mental Health Services
9.	Utilization Review
An employee’s clinical division shall be determined by the Vice President for Nursing. In the event that an existing area of clinical practice is not listed above or a new area is created, this area will be placed into one of the above categories by mutual agreement of the Association and the Vice President, Nursing and Patient Services.
5.09 Recall
Whenever a vacancy occurs in a job title within a clinical division and the preferential recall list described in Section 5.08 has been invoked, employees who are laid off in that job title shall be recalled in accordance with their bargaining unit seniority in the reverse order in which they were laid off.
If the clinical division in which there is a recall has been adversely affected by the depletion of employees with the present ability and experience to perform the work involved as defined in Section 5.08(l) at the time of the recall, then the employees with the present ability and experience to perform the work and assume the responsibilities required shall be recalled first, regardless of seniority until a sufficient number of such employees are returned to the clinical division concerned. However, this procedure cannot be implemented until the Employer has utilized the committee procedure in Section 5.08(l) and the Arbitration procedure in Addendum F.
32
Probationary employees who have been laid off have no recall privileges.
Regular part-time employees on layoff shall have recall rights to regular full-time positions only if they are willing to work the required full-time schedule of hours.
One week after the layoff is implemented the preferential recall list and the recall list will be provided to the Association and updated upon request.
Employees will remain on the recall list until he/she accepts a vacant position but in no case longer than one (1) year.
5.10	Severance Pay
Employees with one (1) or more years of bargaining unit seniority who voluntarily or involuntarily lose employment because of a layoff shall receive severance pay at the rate of one (1) week for each full year of bargaining unit seniority up to a maximum of four (4) weeks' pay. If an employee who has received severance pay under this Section is recalled to work within a period of time less than the number of weeks for which he/she received severance pay, he/she shall repay to the Hospital Center any amounts by which his/her severance pay exceeds the number of days he/she lost work because of a layoff.
5.11	Weekend Schedule
Employees shall receive at least every other weekend off. Depending upon staffing needs, employees may be scheduled to work the weekend before or following a vacation period.
Where circumstances permit a lesser weekend obligation on a unit, this lesser obligation shall be rotated equitably among the nurses on that unit, unless the third paragraph of Section 5.01 is applicable.
5.12	Floating
A.	For the purposes of this provision, floating is defined as the assignment of a registered nurse to work on other than that registered nurse's usual unit, with such assignment taking place shortly before the start of the employee's shift or during the shift. No employee will be floated more than once during the employee's shift. It is not considered a float for an employee to return to his/her usual unit.
An RN covering the meal break for another RN on other than his/her unit, for a period of time, not to exceed ninety (90) minutes per shift, shall not be considered a float. Such assignment will be equitably distributed.
PACU nurses may float within their clinical division when no patients are present in their unit. However, when they float to another unit they will not be expected to take a patient assignment and will return to the recovery room upon admission of a patient.
B.	The Hospital Center shall be permitted to float within the clinical division on a unit where the staffing guidelines have been exceeded. The determination to float shall be based on staffing guidelines, census, and acuity.
C.	When floating, the Hospital Center shall first utilize the float pool. Should the situation not be resolved through the use of the float pool, the Hospital Center shall obtain supplemental staff in the following categories: voluntary
33
subject-to-call, voluntary overtime, per diem, agency nurses. After all available means of supplemental staff have been exhausted, the Hospital Center is permitted to float.
D.	If supplemental staff is unavailable by all of the above methods, the Hospital Center may float outside the Clinical Divisions to meet this need.
E.	Whenever a nurse may be floated, agency/travel nurses who are already on duty or scheduled to work on that shift shall be floated first. Where no agency nurse is available to float, float assignments shall be equitably distributed among regular staff.
F.	No registered nurse will be required to float into a unit where specialized skills are required if the nurse lacks those skills.
G.	Except in an emergency, the Hospital Center will continue its practice of not floating between Sites. This provision does not apply to the following Corporate Departments: Staff Education, QA/UR, AIDS Program Center, Home Care and Infection Control. However, there shall be no change in the existing practices in the Home Care Department due to this provision.
Effective January 1, 2003, employees with fifteen (15) or more years of SLRHC service shall not be floated more than seven (7) times in any one (1) calendar year.
At the Roosevelt Site, employees hired in the Maternal/Child Health Division (not including pre-83 hires who already have permanent assignments) shall be given an option to choose their area of permanent assignment. However, one position on each shift shall be designated as a "float" and be paid the additional float pool differential. Seniority will prevail when more than two (2) employees desire the same position. In cases where no employee desires a position, reverse seniority shall prevail.
H.	Not withstanding the above, on a unit where all employees scheduled to work have met the 15 year, 7 float limit, the Employer may float employees on a rotating basis starting with the least senior. Before these employees can be required to float they must have been offered the opportunity to use paid leave time. Whenever possible, the Employer will attempt to contact the nurses two (2) hours before the shift begins.
I.	Nursing management will assure that all necessary nursing leadership personnel fully understands the capabilities of RNs floated within the Emergency Department and the requirements of the assignments to which they are floated.
J.	St. Luke’s Pediatric Unit: In circumstances where staffing exceeds census requirements, and nurses have been offered the opportunity to use paid leave, but decline to do so, the nurses may be floated to the Peds ED, after training is provided. This provision is subject to change if the Pediatric Unit’s clinical division is changed.
34
6.	MONETARY BENEFITS: COMPENSATION FOR TIME WORKED
6.01a Regular Compensation Rate
The regular compensation rate is an employee's salary which includes any shift differential, experience differential, certification, educational, or float pool differential to which the employee is entitled pursuant to paragraphs 10.03, 10.04, 10.05, 10.06, 10.11, and 10.13 of the Agreement.
An employee's regular compensation rate will apply to all work up to seventy-five (75) hours in each biweekly pay period.
6.01b Base Compensation Rate
An employee's base compensation rate is an employee's salary exclusive of all differentials.
6.02 Premium Compensation Rate: Overtime Work
All hours worked in excess of seventy-five (75) hours in a biweekly pay period shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (1/) the individual employee's regular compensation rate.
Regular part-time employees who volunteer for and work a second (2nd) consecutive full shift following a straight time shift or who, following a 11.5 hour straight time shift volunteer for and work at least an additional consecutive four (4) hours, shall be compensated for such second (2nd) shift or additional hours following a 11.5 hour shift at the rate of time and one-half (1/) the individual employee's regular compensation rate.
For this paragraph's purposes, an employee's workweek will be deemed to include time compensated for holidays, personal days, vacation days, paid sick leave days, leave for death in family, marriage leave, family event leave and jury duty leave.
Overtime payment for hours equal to or greater than an employee’s regular shift shall be paid in a separate check on a biweekly basis. Overtime payment for hours less than employee’s regular shift will be included in the regular paycheck.
The parties recognize the need to avoid, whenever possible, situations in which employees report to duty to perform overtime and are informed at that time that the overtime has been cancelled. Accordingly, employees scheduled to work overtime shall call the Nursing Office ninety (90) minutes prior to the beginning of the overtime shift to verify their overtime. If, after the overtime shift has been verified, it is cancelled when the employee reports to duty, the employee shall be compensated for four (4) hours. If the employee fails to call the Nursing Office within the requisite time period, the employee will not be compensated if the overtime is cancelled. Employees who are scheduled to work overtime and whose travel time to the Hospital Center is greater than ninety (90) minutes, shall inform the Nursing Office of that fact. Such employees shall be allowed, if practicable, to call the Nursing Office two (2) hours prior to the start of the overtime shift.
When an employee has agreed to work an overtime shift, and has begun to work that shift, he/she shall be compensated in the following manner if the Hospital Center cancels the balance of that shift. Employees working a regular
35
(7.5 hours) overtime shift shall be compensated for the full 7.5 hours. Employees working an 11.5 hour overtime shift shall be compensated for the full 11.5 hours if the balance of the shift is canceled after they have worked more than four (4) hours. If the employee has worked less than four (4) hours of the shift, he/she shall be compensated for 7.5 hours.
6.03 Premium Compensation Rate: Limitations
Neither compensation nor compensation rates will be pyramided or compounded in computing compensation payable under this Agreement, and if more than one (1) type of premium compensation rate would otherwise apply to the same work, only the higher rate will be paid.
6.04 Pay Period/Payroll Issues
The Hospital Center recognizes its responsibility to pay employees accurately.
a.	Pay Period. Payment shall be biweekly for all employees.
b.	Night Shift. The Hospital Center will routinely pay checks for employees coming off the night shift at the St. Luke’s Site on payday at or before 8:30 a.m. At the Roosevelt Site, paychecks will be available beginning at 7:45 a.m. on Monday.

A regular part-time employee will receive a proportionate benefit under this paragraph.
7.0	2 Holidays: Entitlement
Recognizing that the Hospital Center operates every day of the year and that it is not possible for all employees to be off on the same day, the Hospital Center shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to require any employee to work on any of the holidays herein specified. The Hospital Center will, consistent with the needs of the Hospital Center, distribute holidays off on an equitable basis within job classifications, and consult with the employees as to preference.
If a holiday falls on an employee's regularly scheduled day off the employee shall receive a day off at the regular compensation rate within thirty (30) days before or after the holiday. If a holiday falls during an employee's vacation, the vacation may be extended by one day, or, at the option of the Hospital Center, the employee may receive a day off with the regular compensation rate within thirty (30) days before or after the holiday. In making the determination, the Hospital Center will take into consideration the employee's expressed preference. If an employee receives a day off in lieu of the holiday, within thirty (30) days before the holiday, and terminates prior to the day on which the holiday is legally celebrated, the unearned holiday must be reimbursed to the Hospital Center and such paid unearned holiday will be deducted from the employee's final paycheck.
37
If an employee is absent on the scheduled workday before and/or after a paid legal holiday, the Hospital Center may demand proof of illness. The Hospital Center may deny pay for such holiday if satisfactory proof is requested and not furnished.

One (1) personal day will be accrued each quarter as follows: One (1) day on January 1; one (1) day on April 1; one (1) day on July 1; and one (1) day on October 1.
In an emergency where advance approval is not possible, the employee may request a personal day provided the request is made as soon as possible prior to the start of the regularly scheduled shift and approved thereafter by the Nurse Manager or Director of Nursing. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
It is an employee’s responsibility to discuss with his/her manager, or designee on duty, the circumstances of the emergency personal day (EPD) request and provide documentation if requested. The decision to approve or deny the EPD will be made within seven (7) days of receipt of information from the employee. Once an EPD is approved it shall be paid within the same or following pay period in which the EPD is approved.
38
Personal days shall be taken as full workdays. Employees may not carry over more than twenty-three (23) hours of personal time year to year. All personal time in an employee’s bank as of December 31, 1999 in excess of twenty-three (23) hours will be moved to the newly established “frozen bank” described in Section 7.08 Vacation: Scheduling.
Scheduled personal days shall be cancelled only upon mutual agreement by the Hospital Center and the employee.
In an emergency where advance approval is not possible, up to two (2) personal days per year shall be granted, provided the employee calls in at least two (2) hours prior to the start of the shift, unless the employee has a valid reason for being unable to do so.
An employee will be entitled to time off with pay to vote in City, State and Federal elections, if and when necessary, in accordance with New York State law. The Hospital Center reserves the right to require proof of voter registration as a condition of such time off.

39
7.0	7 Vacations: Entitlement
The vacation eligibility year and/or the vacation eligibility date shall be as heretofore. No unpaid absences shall be deemed or considered as time worked in the computation of vacation pay. Where an employee has been absent without pay, the vacation pay shall be prorated on a percentage basis, i.e., the employee shall receive prorated vacation time off with pay, based on the percentage of actual time worked during the applicable year to regularly scheduled working time.
Absences due to established illness, maternity leave or injury not exceeding five (5) weeks shall be considered as time worked in determining the amount of vacation entitlement for employees with more than one (1) year and up to and including, but not exceeding five (5) years of service. For employees with service beyond five (5) years, such period shall be thirteen (13) weeks.
7.0	8 Vacation: Scheduling
The vacation period will be the entire year, subject to the needs of the Hospital Center, as determined by the Hospital Center. An employee will, subject to the Hospital Center's operating requirements, have his or her choice of vacation time; it being recognized, however, that vacations must be scheduled by the Hospital Center in a manner designed to insure the effective and efficient operation of the Hospital Center.
Vacation requests submitted by December 1st for the period February 1st to April 30th, by March 1st for the period May 1st to September 30th, and by August 1st for the period October 1st to January 31st shall be granted on the basis of bargaining unit seniority, provided that each employee shall be entitled to a minimum of two (2) consecutive weeks of scheduled vacation during the period May 1st to September 30th in any year. Requests submitted after the cutoff dates shall be honored in the order in which the requests were submitted, regardless of bargaining unit seniority. Employees shall be notified of their approved vacations no later than two (2) weeks after each cutoff date. In cases where employees have submitted after the cutoff date, such approval shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week after submitting the request.
During the period December 15th to January 15th, after personal days, holidays and single vacation days have been scheduled, then other available vacation time requests will be allowed. For requests submitted by November 1, best efforts shall be made for approval by November 14, with a guaranteed decision by November 21.
No part of an employee's scheduled vacation may be charged to sick leave.
Vacations shall be taken each year and may not be accrued from year to year, and an employee will not be compensated for vacation time not taken from prior years, provided that the present practice permitting accumulation of vacation up to eight (8) weeks shall continue.
Effective January 1, 2000, the maximum vacation that may be carried into each year will be one hundred and fifty (150) hours. As of December 31, 1999, all accrued vacation time for employees will be moved to a newly created frozen bank.
40
The Hospital Center will encourage employees to utilize their frozen time. Vacation days may be taken singularly, on a prescheduled basis, with the approval of the Nurse Manager or his/her designee.
In the event of termination of employment, any hours remaining in an employee’s frozen bank will be paid as terminal pay.
A minimum of one (1) week's vacation is to be taken at one time; however an employee may take five (5) vacation days singularly during the year, subject to the operating requirements as set forth above. Additional vacation days may be taken singularly with the approval of the Nurse Manager or designee.
The total number of Registered Professional Nurses who may be on simultaneous vacations is determined by dividing the total number of vacation weeks to be earned during the vacation scheduling periods as outlined above by the number of weeks in the vacation scheduling period. When the resulting number is a fraction, the next whole number shall be used.
7.0	9 Sick Leave: Entitlement and Earning
After thirty (30) days of employment, regular full-time employees shall be entitled to paid sick leave earned at the rate of seven and one-half (7.5) hours for each month of employment during the first year of employment up to a maximum of ninety (90) hours per year.
Employees, after one (1) year of employment, shall be entitled to a total of ninety (90) additional hours of sick leave at the beginning of the second and each subsequent year of employment.

Employees may accrue sick leave to a maximum of six hundred seventy-five (675) hours of sick leave including days earned or to be earned in the current sick leave year.

An employee who changes from regular full-time status to regular part-time status shall retain any accrued sick leave benefits.
For the purposes of retirement, nurses who have accrued up to forty-five (45) days sick leave may use that accrual as time worked. This time will be calculated towards their last working day.
7.10	Sick Leave: Pay
An eligible employee will be paid for sick leave at the employee's regular compensation rate for the employee's regularly scheduled workday.
41
Sick leave will be applicable only if the employee is ill on days during which the employee is regularly scheduled to work.
To be eligible for sick leave benefits, an employee who is absent due to illness or injury must notify the employee's supervisor or other designated individual as soon as possible, but at least two (2) hours before the start of his/her regularly scheduled workday, except in cases of proven inability to furnish such notice, and shall continue to give such notification on a daily basis unless another arrangement has been made.
The Hospital Center may require that an employee submit proof of illness or accident satisfactory to the Hospital Center as a condition of receiving sick leave pay. Employees who have been put on notice by their managers that their sick leave usage is excessive will be required to submit proof of illness for every absence for up to six months or until the next attendance review, whichever is sooner.
Unless another arrangement has been made, employees who have been on sick leave may be required to be examined by the Hospital's health service physician before being permitted to return to duty. An employee whose initial shift upon returning to work from said sick leave is one for which the Employee Health Service is not open may arrange to have his/her returning examination done by a physician in the Emergency Room.
Discipline for sick time usage will not be capricious, arbitrary or unreasonable.
Hospitalization will not be counted as a period of absence in determining frequency of absence; however, as is currently the practice, it will be counted in determining the employee's ability to meet the attendance requirements of the job. No sick leave will be paid for any work absence for which the employee is otherwise compensated, e.g., by Workers' Compensation.
If an employee resigned or is dismissed or laid off and has exceeded his/her allowable sick leave (or pro rata portion for the year of termination) the excess sick leave shall be deducted from any monies due him/her from the Hospital Center at the time of resignation, layoff or dismissal.
7.11	Workers' Compensation
Employees who file for Workers' Compensation may elect to remain on the payroll by drawing on sick leave from their own individual bank for the length of their period of disability. They shall also continue to have contributions made on their behalf to the Benefits Fund until the sick leave has been exhausted and/or throughout their period of Workers' Compensation. The first five (5) days of leave for an employee who is eligible or becomes eligible for Workers' Compensation shall be paid as Hospital Business Days. However, if an RN is denied compensable damages in a Workers' Compensation hearing, the RN shall refund this leave from his/her accrued time.
7.12	Incubation Periods
Employees who have been exposed to a contagious disease with a short-term incubation period, and who as a result are required by the Hospital Center to absent themselves from the workplace during that incubation period, shall not
42
be required to use their sick leave for such absence. All such time shall be considered to be paid Hospital business days.
7.13	Sick Bank/Disability Option
A.	Disability Option I
An employee who (a) has been sick or disabled for a continuous period of more than seven (7) days, (b) is entitled to receive disability benefit payments from the NYSNA Benefits Fund and (c) is entitled to paid sick leave under the Hospital Center's sick leave plan, shall be paid by the Hospital Center for each day of absence for which the employee is entitled to receive disability benefit payments from the Fund, at the rate of eighty percent (.8) of a day's pay for each day of absence and such leave shall be charged against the employee's sick leave entitlement at the rate of eighty percent (.8) of a sick day per day of qualifying absence up to the maximum amount of the employee's sick leave entitlement under Section 7.09 hereof.

B.	Disability Option II
Employees who are eligible for disability benefit payments from the NYSNA Benefits Fund and have a minimum of twenty (20) days of accrued sick leave entitlement may opt to receive full sick leave pay for each day of disability up to the maximum amount of the employee's sick leave entitlement. Until such time as the Fund may change its current procedure, employees who choose to use this program as a condition of receiving full sick pay, must agree in writing on a form to be provided by the Hospital Center and irrevocable for a period of one (1) year, for checks for disability benefit payments from the Fund to be sent to the Hospital Center Human Resources Department and endorse such payments to the Hospital Center. Upon doing so, the Hospital Center will credit, subject to collection, back to the employee's sick leave bank one-third (1/3) of a day of sick leave for each full day of disability originally paid for which the Hospital Center has been reimbursed from the Fund. The sick leave bank of employees participating in the Disability Option Plan shall be credited upon the employee's return to work. Employees choosing to use the program during a calendar year must notify the Hospital Center of their agreement to do so, which shall be irrevocable for such calendar year, in writing, on a form to be provided by the Hospital Center before October 1st of the preceding year.
C.	Catastrophic Illness Program
The Hospital Center has created a mechanism to enable employees to donate their unused sick leave for the use of another employee who is suffering from a catastrophic illness. Upon submission of the list of sick time donors by the Association to the Vice-President, Corporate Human Resources, the Hospital Center will adjust the sick leave banks of the donating employees and the bank of the employee receiving the sick time. A computer run reflecting these changes shall be provided to the Association General and Local Representatives at each Site by no later than the second (2nd) pay period following submission. Employees who elect to
43
so donate the sick leave shall forfeit the donated portion for purposes of the buyback mechanism delineated in the last paragraph of this Section. (See below.)
D.	Buy Back Plan
Employees who use sixty (60) or less hours of sick leave per calendar year will have the option to cash in all or part of those unused hours up to sixty (60) hours. Any hours the employee chooses not to cash in will be banked subject to the limitations contained in Section 7.09.

Employees will be terminated for obtaining leave by false pretense or for failure to return from a leave. The Hospital Center reserves the right to require proof of death and relationship in the case of funeral leave; and marriage and birth, in the case of marriage and family event leave.
7.20	Rest Period
An employee working a full-shift shall be entitled to two (2) rest periods of fifteen (15) minutes each in each working day.
This time cannot be taken at the beginning or ending of the work shift. One (1) fifteen (15) minute break may be added to the meal period if the activities of the unit so indicate.

48
8.	This Plan is a total substitution for the present Hospital Medical and Insurance Plan except the Hospital Center will continue Workers' Compensation coverage as at present, in accordance with law.
9.	Should the Association agree with any other health care facility to provide the same benefits for the same time period at a lower contribution rate approved by the Trustees of the New York State Nurses Association Benefits Fund (except for a rate which is lower solely because of an actuarial adjustment made to reflect differing contract effective dates), the Hospital Center shall reduce its contributions hereunder to such lower rate.
In the event the Hospital Center decides to withdraw from the Association Benefits Fund, it shall provide benefits for its employees substantially similar and in the aggregate not less than those then provided by the Association Benefits Fund.
10.	Benefit Plan Safety Net. If during the term of this Agreement it is actuarially determined that the contractual Benefits Fund contribution rates are not adequate to provide the Plan Benefits for the term of the Agreement, and either Presbyterian Hospital or Mount Sinai Hospital agree to make such additional contribution, the Hospital Center shall increase its contribution to the amount actuarially required to fund such benefits for the term of the Agreement.

Contributions for covered employees who regularly work less than the scheduled work hours of full-time employees are to be prorated in the proportion that their scheduled hours bear to the scheduled hours of full-time employees under the collective bargaining agreement.
The Hospital Center shall begin making payments for newly hired employees ninety (90) working days after their date of hire.
49
In the event the impact of the extension from sixty (60) working days to ninety (90) working days after date of hire is found to have a negative impact on a nurse's pension benefit, the Hospital Center shall forthwith proceed to commence making payments required for the thirty (30) working day period on such a schedule as to restore the nurse's level of benefit to that which would otherwise have existed.
Payments by the Employer shall be made monthly based on the previous month's payroll and the annualized rate set forth above. These payments shall be paid no later than the end of the month following the month of computation.
In the event that the Hospital Center shall fail to make payments provided hereunder, the Association Pension Plan shall be entitled to charge interest upon such obligation from the end of the grace period herein provided, at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum, one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month.
2.	Such payments shall be used by the Trustees of the New York State Nurses Association Pension Plan for the purpose of providing pension benefits for employees as the Trustees may from time to time determine.
3.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is under stood and agreed that the obligation of the Hospital Center under this Section is subject to and conditioned upon the fulfillment of each of the conditions that:
a.	The Association Pension Plan shall be held and administered under the terms and provisions of the existing agreement and Declaration of Trust, and any amendments thereof.
b.	All employees covered by this Agreement who are or have been participants under the Hospital Center's Pension Plan shall, as of March 1, 1975, cease to be participants in the Hospital Center's Pension Plan and become immediately and continuously covered under the Association Plan, provided, however, that the Hospital Center's Pension Plan shall continue to make payments of pension benefits to those retirees who are now receiving benefits, and those participants who are or become eligible before September 1, 1975 for a normal, early or disability retirement, application for which is received by the Hospital Center before such date, to be effective on or before September 1, 1975.
c.	The Association Pension Plan benefit formula, eligibility requirements for normal, early and disability retirement, vesting criteria, and other conditions of benefits shall be no less valuable to employees previously covered by the Hospital Center's Pension Plan than that which such employees would be entitled to under the terms of the Hospital Center's Pension Plan in effect as of March 1, 1975.
d.	The Association Pension Plan shall be a complete substitute for the Hospital Center's Pension Plan for all employees as herein provided who now or in the future become participants of the Association Pension Plan. Accordingly, the Association Plan shall assume the obligation for the past and current service credits, vesting rights and other benefits
50
earned under the Hospital Center's Pension Plan in accordance with the terms in effect as of March 1, 1975.
e.	Except for the obligations assumed herein for retirees and prospective contributions to the Association Pension Plan, the Association, Association Pension Plan and the employees shall have no further claim for pension or retirement benefits upon the Hospital Center's Plan and its accumulated assets and all such benefits presently accrued under the Hospital Center's Plan, whether or not vested are, except as otherwise specifically provided herein for the period March 1, 1975 to September 1, 1975, waived for the employees covered by this Agreement.
f.	Approval of the Association Pension Plan and all the foregoing benefit and financial arrangements is obtained from the Internal Revenue Service as a qualified pension plan as well as from other government agencies having jurisdiction over such matter. A copy of the IRS qualification letter shall be sent to the Hospital.
In the event that all of the above conditions are not met, or the government agencies mentioned above impose supplementary conditions upon the Hospital Center's Pension Plan or the Hospital, such as requiring the continuation of coverage for employees for the same periods of employment as are covered by the Association Plan, then the obligation of the Hospital Center to contribute to the Association Pension Plan shall be deemed null and void from its inception, and any monies contributed by the Hospital Center shall be immediately paid over to the Hospital Center's Pension Plan, and this entire Section reopened for further negotiation and settlement.
4.	An independent audit of the Pension Plan shall be made annually and a statement of the results thereof shall be furnished to the Hospital Center.
5.	The Hospital Center will provide to the Plan Office by March 1 of the following plan year a computerized magnetic tape, or hard copy list where the Employer does not have computer capability, which contains the following information for each participant covered by the plan as of December 31 of the preceding year: (a) name; (b) social security number; (c) date of birth; (d) date of hire; (e) sex; (f) number of annual hours regularly scheduled to work; and (g) annual base compensation and differential, excluding overtime, shift and educational differentials and any other form of compensation.

The Parties agree to monitor recruitment for the Float Pool and discuss the cause of difficulty in filling positions as well as possible solutions should positions remain unfilled.
10.1	4 Voluntary Subject-To-Call
1.	Employees who volunteer to be subject-to-call, pursuant to a one (1) week posting, on a unit or grouping of units, will receive a sign-up pay of forty-five dollars ($45.00) per shift whether or not called to work. The posting of subject-to-call opportunities shall identify the unit or units to be covered, the shift or shifts involved and whether in-charge responsibilities are required.

When the registered nurse is called, he/she will be told the specific unit he/she will be working on and whether he/she will be in charge.
3.	Subject-to-call posting shall be used where registered nurse staffing levels are barely sufficient as a result of accelerating acuity and a single sick call would clearly cause gross understaffing and would otherwise require mandatory overtime in violation of this Agreement because the specialized skills required by the unit are unique and not available from the float pool and voluntary overtime because a vacancy has not been anticipated in that unit.
4.	In accordance with Section 3.04 the Corporate Labor Management Committee will develop guidelines regarding the placement of the foregoing subject-to-call postings as well as other appropriate uses, including diminishing last minute floating needs.
11.	HEALTH AND SAFETY

The Hospital Center's policy is to provide, by dispatch through the Central Nursing Office, personnel assigned to other duties who can be made available on an as-needed basis to assist in the movement of unusually burdensome patients. While the Hospital Center does not guarantee the availability of assistance, and the unavailability of assistance in a particular case is not subject to the grievance procedure (Article 14), it is agreed that the Association may process as a policy grievance a claim that the Hospital Center has not implemented this policy in good faith.
The Hospital Center agrees to apply best faith efforts to insure that nurses who work in clinic settings shall no longer be required to work alone beyond normal clinic hours. Such efforts shall include reconfiguration of work schedules of all employees to maximize employee safety.
11.03 Employee Obligation

Inability of the Hospital Center to continue operations because of a labor dispute or work stoppage or to merge or discontinue any part of its operations or functions within the bona fide exercise of its management rights as set forth in this Agreement shall not be considered a lockout.
Should a group of employees unilaterally and independently engage in any of the aforementioned activities, the Association shall notify such employees, in writing, of its disapproval of this action and instruct such employees, in writing, to cease such action immediately. Copies of such shall be furnished simultaneously to the Hospital Center.

The Hospital Center has both the legal responsibility and the sole right to manage the Hospital Center and, except as specifically limited in this Agreement, to (a) hire, assign, transfer, promote, demote, schedule, layoff, recall, discipline, discharge its employees and direct them in their work and (b) control all Hospital Center property. Except as this Agreement otherwise specifically provides, the management of the Hospital Center and the direction of the work force shall be in the sole discretion and the sole responsibility of the Hospital Center, and except as otherwise provided herein, the Hospital Center retains its sole and exclusive right to promulgate rules and regulations; direct, designate, schedule and assign duties to work force; plan, direct and control the entire operation of the Hospital Center; discontinue, consolidate or reorganize any department or branch; transfer any or all operations to any location or discontinue the same in whole or in part; merge with any other institution; make technological improvements; install or remove equipment regardless of whether or not such action causes a reduction of any kind in the number of employees, or transfers in the work force, requires the assignment of additional or different duties or causes the elimination or addition of nursing titles or jobs; and carry out the ordinary and customary functions of management whether or not possessed or exercised by the Hospital Center prior to the execution of this Agreement, except as limited herein. All the rights, powers, discretion, authority and prerogatives possessed by the Hospital Center prior to execution of this Agreement, whether exercised or not, are retained by and are to remain exclusively with the Hospital Center, except as limited herein. None of these rights shall be exercised in a capricious or arbitrary manner.
14.	GRIEVANCE ADJUSTMENT
14.0	1 Scope
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, every grievance either the Association (and the employees it represents) or the Hospital Center may have with each other arising from application or interpretation of this Agreement or otherwise, will be adjusted as stated in paragraphs 14.02 through 14.07.
Without waiving its statutory rights, a grievance on behalf of the Hospital Center may be presented initially at Step Three by notice in writing addressed to the Association at its office.
A grievance which affects a substantial number or class of employees, or on behalf of the Association, in which the Hospital Center's representative designated in Step One lacks authority to settle, may initially be presented at Step Two by the Association's representative, provided that such grievance must be filed within the time period set forth in Step One of the grievance procedure as set forth herein. Paragraphs 14.02 through 14.07 will apply equally to the Nurse Anesthetist and Anesthesia Instructors; however, where the term "designee" is used in paragraphs 14.04 and 14.05, it shall be deemed to include the Director of Nurse Anesthesia Services as applicable and appropriate.
14.0	2 Informal Discussion
An employee who has a grievance arising from application or interpretation of this Agreement, or otherwise, will present the claim promptly to the employee's immediate supervisor. The employee and the immediate supervisor will discuss and attempt to resolve this grievance.
61
14.03 Procedure and Time Limits: Step One
If the grievance is not adjusted by informal discussion as provided for in paragraph 14.02, or if the grievance involves a matter other than a matter involving compensation, affecting more employees than one (1), the Association or group of employees allegedly affected will serve a written notice of grievance on the appropriate Nurse Manager or Director, within fourteen (14) days after occurrence of the facts on which the grievance is based, or in the case of a monetary benefit (i.e., a claim for compensation, holiday pay, vacation pay or any other benefit payable in money for an employee fringe benefit) within thirty (30) days after the occurrence if it could not have been discovered within the foregoing fourteen (14) day period. If no such notice is served in the time specified, the grievance will be barred. A meeting/conference about the grievance will be scheduled as soon as possible but no later than one month after filing of the grievance. Within five (5) days following any conference between the local representative and the appropriate Nurse Manager or Director, the answer of the appropriate Nurse Manager or Director shall be given to the local representative.
14.04 Procedure and Time Limits: Step Two
If the grievance is not adjusted in the time specified in Step One, the grievance may, within ten (10) days after the answer in Step One, be appealed to Step Two by written notice served on the appropriate Director, Nursing or designee. If no such notice is served in the time specified, the grievance will be barred. A meeting/conference about the grievance will be scheduled as soon as possible but no later than one month after filing of the grievance. Within five (5) days following any conference between the Association's general representative and the appropriate Director, Nursing or designee, the answer of the appropriate Director, Nursing or designee shall be given to the Association.
With grievances concerning professional nursing practice issues at Step Two of the Grievance Procedure that cannot be resolved by the Director, Nursing, the Association may present the grievance to the Assistant Vice President for Nursing and the time for appeal of such grievance to Step Three of the Grievance Procedure shall not begin to run until the answer of the Assistant Vice President for Nursing is given, which answer shall be given within five (5) days following any conference between the Association's general representative and the Assistant Vice President for Nursing.
Discipline
The Hospital Center shall notify the Association and the Chairperson of the Grievance Committee, in writing, of any discharge, demotion or suspension within forty-eight (48) hours (not including Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) from the time of such disciplinary action. If the Association decides to contest a discharge, demotion or suspension, except in the cases specifically excepted from such contest by this Agreement, it shall give written notice thereof to the Hospital Center within ten (10) working days after receipt of a notice of discharge, demotion or suspension. The notice of contest shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Association and shall set forth specifically the following information concerning the event complained of: name and job of the employee, date, time or approximate time, place, article violated and remedy sought. The grievance shall be submitted and determined under the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth herein, commencing, however, at Step Two
62
of the grievance procedure. A meeting/conference about the grievance will be scheduled as soon as possible but no later than one (1) month after filing of the grievance. If a disciplinary action results from conduct relating to a patient and the patient and/or person involved does not appear at the arbitration hearing, the arbitrator shall not consider the failure of the patient or other person involved to appear as prejudicial.
The Hospital Center shall notify the Association and the Chairperson of the Grievance Committee, in writing, of any written discipline (other than a discharge, demotion or suspension) within forty-eight (48) hours (not including Saturday/Sunday/holidays) from the time of such disciplinary action. If an employee is given a verbal warning and the verbal warning is put in writing, the Hospital Center shall provide the Union delegate who is present when the warning is given with a copy of the warning. If no delegate is present, a copy of the warning will be provided to the Association. Failure to provide notice of any disciplinary action shall extend the Association’s time in which to contest the disciplinary action to ten working days from the date the Association does receive the notice. If the Association desires to contest such written discipline, it shall commence such contest at Step One of the grievance procedure.
In the event that the Hospital Center disciplines or discharges an employee on the stated ground of misconduct in matters involving relations with or conduct of an employee towards patients, matters involving potential danger to patients or breach of professional ethics or responsibility with respect to the treatment of patients and the Association requests arbitration of the discharge, the burden of going forth with the evidence shall be upon the employee and the Association that the discharge has been made for reasons other than the grounds stated or that there was no such misconduct on the part of the employee.
Suspensions may be presented, at the Association's discretion, at Step Two.
14.04a Reports to Office of Professional Discipline (OPD)
When the Hospital Center reports a registered nurse to the Office of Professional Discipline (OPD), the Employer will notify the Association, the fulltime release person and the affected nurse that such action has been taken within ten (10) working days of the report. The notice shall be a copy of the letter sent to OPD.
14.05 Procedure and Time Limits: Step Three
If the grievance is not adjusted in Step Two, the Association may, within ten (10) days after the answer in Step Two, appeal the grievance to Step Three by written notice served on the Site's Assistant Vice President-Human Resources or designee. If no such notice is served within the time specified, the grievance will be barred. A meeting/conference about the grievance will be scheduled as soon as possible but no later than one (1) month after the filing of the grievance. Within five (5) days following a meeting between the Association's general representative and Associate Vice President of Human Resources or designee, the answer of the Associate Vice President of Human Resources or designee shall be given in writing to the Association.
Terminations may be presented, at the Association's discretion, at Step Three.
63
14.06 Procedure and Time Limits: Step Four
If the grievance is not adjusted in Step Three and involves the application or interpretation of this Agreement, such grievance may be submitted to arbitration by the Hospital Center or the Association. The Hospital Center and the Association will select the arbitrator from lists submitted to them by the American Arbitration Association under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules or the Expedited Rules if mutually agreeable. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding on the parties. If the grievance is not submitted to arbitration under this paragraph within twenty (20) days after the Hospital Center answers to Step Three, it will be barred. The fees and expenses of any arbitration will be shared equally by the parties. The arbitration shall be handled in accordance with the then-existing rules of the American Arbitration Association.
14.07 Non-Nursing Department Grievance Procedure
In the case of grievances by employees in non-nursing departments, the Step One management representative shall be the immediate supervisor and the Step Two management representative shall be the Director or designee, provided that when the immediate supervisor and Director are the same person, the grievance shall be filed at Step Two within the time period for filing grievances as provided under Step One. Where a grievance in a non-nursing department involves a matter of professional nursing practice, the Assistant Vice President for Nursing will, upon a written request of the Association made at the time the grievance is submitted at Step Two, designate a member of nursing administration as a consultant to provide nursing practice input at Step Two.
14.08 Arbitrator's Powers: Limitation
The arbitrator shall not have any power to add to or subtract from or otherwise amend this Agreement.
14.09 Time Limits
All time limits herein specified shall be deemed to be exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The time limits specified in this Section shall be deemed to be substantive provisions and failure to comply with such time limits or any of them shall be a complete bar to any action, except that failure on the part of the Hospital Center to answer a grievance at any step shall not be deemed acquiescence thereto and the Association may proceed to the next step.
The time limits herein may be extended by mutual agreement.
14.10 Expedited Arbitration
The parties agree to seek expedited arbitration on monetary and staffing issues and for employee terminations. The list of arbitrators to be utilized for purposes of expedited arbitration is attached as Exhibit F.

ADDENDUM B
Mr. Bart Metzger
Vice President, Human Resources
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center
411 West 114th Street
New York, NY 10025
Re: Various Issues
Dear Mr. Metzger:
The Association understands that the parties agreed to the resolutions of the above-captioned matters during our recent negotiations for the 1991-92 collective bargaining agreement:
1.00 ANCC Issues
The parties, in connection with negotiation of the 1989 agreement, have discussed that ANCCs may be performing leadership functions including responsibilities with regard to guiding the work, making reports (excluding budgets) and/or exercising professional judgment and having input in evaluations of employees. It is understood that ANCCs shall participate in direct patient care on a regular basis. The Hospital Center expressly states that their leadership responsibilities do not make these ANCCs supervisors under the contract or the NLRA and, in reliance on that Hospital Center representation, the Association will withdraw its proposal for restriction on such current leadership responsibilities.
2.02 Association Status
During the negotiations leading to the 1991-1992 agreement, the Hospital Center and the Association agreed upon a uniform system of providing information required of the Employer by Section 2.02 of the agreement. That system is explained in the attached letter dated January 4, 1991.
In addition, the Hospital Center has agreed to assume full responsibility for enrollment of all eligible employees into the NYSNA Benefits Fund. Such enrollment shall be done by the Human Resources Department.
Lastly, the Hospital Center has agreed that the Human Resources Department shall be responsible for securing dues deduction cards.
Article 3 Non-Nursing Functions
Patient Valuables: The Employer agrees that the policy will reflect that the handling of patient valuables is the responsibility of non-bargaining unit employees. This policy, already in effect at the Roosevelt Site, shall be in effect at the St. Luke's Site no later than July 1, 1991.
Drug Searches. The Employer agrees that the policy will reflect searches of all types are to be the responsibility of non-bargaining unit employees, except that Security may request an RN to be a witness to a search, but the RN can delegate that request to other personnel.
76
Addendum B - Page 2
Clinics. Effective May 15, 1991, the Employer agrees to include up to two (2) bargaining unit members in any investigation of the flow of records and impact on clinic efficiency.
Clerks - The Employer agrees that it will not use the word "assign" in the contract to avoid its responsibility under Article 3 (B) Non-Nursing Functions to continue to provide clerical support on units to which it currently provides such support.
Home Care - Employer agrees to implement a 6-month pilot no later than July 1, 1991. The burden is on management to prove new system does not work; clericals will assume financial verification (except where RN interaction is required); clericals will make calls of a routine nature to locate home health aides based on specific criteria provided by RN.
3.0	1 Council of Nursing Practitioners: Professional Issues.
Unit Dose:
The Employer agrees that the Unit Dose system shall be in compliance with the New York State Health Code as set forth in the 4.05.17 regulations.
4.11	Seniority: Application.
The Hospital Center and NYSNA agree that non-nursing departments are governed by the seniority provisions of this Section and can no longer limit application in favor of "teams" (or similar terms). This agreement was reached so that the parties are in compliance with the prior agreement reached under Article 1, Agreement Scope.
4.12	Seniority Lists.
The Hospital Center and NYSNA agree that non-nursing department seniority lists are to be included by the Hospital Center when fulfilling its obligation under this provision.
4.13	Fact Sheet - Transfers Out of the Bargaining Unit.
It is understood by the Association that by July 1, 1989, the Hospital Center will prepare and provide to both the Association and the employees affected a copy of a fact sheet outlining the effect on employees' fringe benefits when they transfer out of the NYSNA bargaining unit, with the exception of the Pension Plan. The fact sheet shall advise the RN to call the Plan Office for pension information.
5.07 Floating.
The Hospital Center acknowledged that Section 5.07 (G) Floating precludes the Hospital Center from splitting any position between Sites beyond that specified in that Section.
9.01 Health Benefits Coverage.
In the event the NYSNA locates an alternate carrier or carriers to underwrite a plan of benefits identical in all respects to the NYSNA Benefits Fund Plan 96 1A in existence on December 31, 1989, the Hospital Center agrees to contribute the amounts required by Section 9.01 to such carrier or carriers upon sixty (60) days' written notice from the Association.
77
Addendum B - Page 3
10.05 Withdrawal Re: Psychotherapy Postgraduate Institute Training Proposal.
and
10.08
The parties recognize that the Association withdrew its proposal for multiple certification recognition under Section 10.11 in the 1989-90 contract negotiations. However, during those negotiations, the Hospital Center did state that psychotherapy postgraduate training is a certification and otherwise payable under Section 10.11.
10.11 Certification Differential. The parties agree that certifications under Section 10.11 shall include New York State Certified Alcoholism Counseling, Chemical Dependency National Consortium of Chemical Dependency.
11.02 Hospital Center Obligation. During the negotiations leading to the 1991-1992 collective bargaining agreement, the Hospital Center agreed to continue to make best faith efforts to find more suitable space for the QA/UR Department.
16.01 Parking: The Employer agrees to issue a memo setting forth the current rates at the 1090 parking lot.
Rates shall be:
$12/$18, $3 on weekends and holidays
$6.50 - night nurses
Grace period for flextime
Availability of parking - Roosevelt Site
16.02 Housing
With respect to this section, the parties agree to the following: It is understood by the Association that individual employees experiencing problems with Hospital Center-provided housing should pursue a resolution of the problem beginning with the building superintendent and, if a satisfactory resolution is not reached, the matter should be appealed to the Real Estate Manager and, thereafter, to the Administrator, Real Estate and, finally, to the Vice President, Corporate Human Resources.
Jitney. It is understood by the Association that hereafter the Hospital Center Jitney will stop at 70th Street upon request, and will discharge employees at 59th Street and 10th Avenue on the final Jitney run.
Lockers: It is understood by the Association that it is the intention of the Hospital Center to move lockers currently warehoused; such lockers will be in place on all units at the St. Luke's Site where there is a need for such lockers by September 1, 1989.
If this meets your understanding, please affix your signature in the space provided below.

ADDENDUM C
RE: SICK TIME DONATION FOR CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS OR INJURY
POLICY
In order to provide additional financial protection to employees who suffer a catastrophic illness or injury, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center will provide a mechanism through which employees may donate sick time from their sick time accruals to that of a stricken employee. The recipient of such donated sick time may then use it after exhaustion of his/her own sick time in the same manner in which his/her own sick time was used, except where noted in this policy.
DEFINITION
"Catastrophic illness or injury" is defined as one which is terminal, life threatening or profoundly disabling for a period of not less than three months. Recommendations as to whether individual cases meet the definition of catastrophic illness or injury will be made by the Director of Employee Health Services to the Site Associate Vice President for Human Resources.
ELIGIBILITY
Any regular employee working a minimum of half time and with at least one year of service with the hospital center, who is a member of NYSNA or Local 721 bargaining units or any non-bargaining unit employee, is eligible to participate as either a donor or recipient. Temporary and per diem employees are not eligible. Also excluded are employees who have informed the hospital center of their intention to resign or who have received notice of termination.
Employees who are paid through special non-budgetary funds or grants and who meet the criteria above, are eligible to participate. Decisions relating to eligibility are not subject to the grievance procedure.
WAITING PERIOD
Recipients shall begin receiving donated sick time one month or thirty calendar days from the date that their application is logged in at the respective Site Human Resources Department.
During this one month or thirty calendar day period, all reviews/approvals for participation by the Employee Health Service and the Human Resources Department shall be conducted.
Also during this waiting period, recipients shall first use up their own sick time. Any time missed beyond that shall be treated as unpaid absences until the waiting period is over, and the employee has begun to receive the donated time.
DONOR LIMITS AND CONDITIONS
Employees may donate a maximum of eight sick days per anniversary year to another employee. Donations will be made in whole sick time days (donors') converted to standard hours (recipients') and will not affect the donors' attendance record. Additionally, a donation may not leave an employee with a sick time balance of less than five earned days. This limit is to ensure that donating employees have at least enough sick time to be paid until they reach the waiting period for short-term disability benefits in the event of their own illness.
79
Donated sick time which is not used by a recipient does not revert back to donors. Instead, it shall accumulate in a universal donor bank. Such excess time shall be available for use by future recipients whose needs may exceed the donations made on their behalf. NYSNA Executive Committee and General Representative shall receive an accounting of any such time on a semi-annual basis.
Donations will be permitted between eligible employees in different employee groups and on an inter-Site basis.
RECIPIENT LIMITS AND CONDITIONS
The maximum amount of donated sick time an employee may receive depends upon his/her length of service. Maximum amounts are as follows:
Completed Years of Service	Maximum # of donated sick days
1 year but less than 5 years	40 days
5 years to 9 years	120 days
10 years or more	160 days
Eligible employees may be a recipient of this benefit on no more than two (2) occasions during their employment with the hospital center.
Donated sick time may be used only after exhaustion of the employee's own sick time.
Pay for donated sick time may not be retroactive.
A person who returns to work from a catastrophic illness and has unused donated sick time may continue to use donated sick time if they suffer a relapse of the original condition within six months of having returned to work. This relapse must be supported by medical documentation. Donated sick time is eliminated if the recipient (a) terminates his/her employment or (b) returns to work and does not use it within six months.
For purposes of accrual or other forms of paid time, such as vacation and personal days, an employee using donated sick time will be treated as if he/she were on leave without pay.
COORDINATION WITH OTHER BENEFITS
Donated sick days are to be used after exhaustion of the employee's own sick time and in the same manner as his/her own sick time practice as stipulated by his/her existing union contracts or hospital center contracts.
For those non-bargaining unit employees who are eligible for long-term disability benefits, there may be some delay in the beginning of LTD benefits where the donated sick time extends beyond six months from the date the employee last worked.
APPLICATION PROCEDURE
An employee who has suffered a catastrophic illness or injury and wishes to be eligible to receive donated sick time completes as application and submits it to the Site Benefits office.
The Benefits office presents the employee's application to the Director of Employee Health Service. The Director of Employee Health Service is then responsible for assessing the employee's condition for eligibility and recommending approval or denial. Approval or denial is affirmed by the Site Associate Vice President for Human Resources, who notifies the employee and his/her department head by letter. A copy of the decision, where applicable,
80
will be sent to NYSNA or Local 721. Denials may be reviewed, upon request, by the Vice President for Human Resources.
NYSNA, upon receiving notification of an employee who is eligible for catastrophic illness/injury protection, will solicit sick time donations and submit a list of the same to the Site Human Resources office. Human Resources will then make the appropriate adjustments to the sick time balances of the donors and the recipient, and provide a list documenting the changes to the NYSNA's general and local representatives no later than the second pay period following submission.
Any employee who wishes to donate sick time will be required to complete a donor form. Forms are available in the Site Human Resources office. When the donation is approved, a copy of the form will be returned to the donor indicating acceptance and transfer of sick time.
BUDGETING
The costs for donated sick time will be charged to a general Human Resource cost center.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN ST. LUKE'S-ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL CENTER AND
NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION
RE: Discussion of AWS for other Areas

By acknowledging this, Hospital Center does not have any obligation not already contained in the collective bargaining agreement.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN NEW YORK STATE NURSES ASSOCIATION AND
ST. LUKE'S-ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL CENTER
RE: RETIREMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAM
The parties agree that a retirement incentive window program will be implemented by the Hospital Center, as follows. The window program shall be available to eligible nurses, as defined below, from October 1, 1995 through January 31, 1996. In order to be eligible for the incentive, nurses must be at least 60 years of age and have twenty (20) years of service by January 31, 1996.
Eligible nurses between the ages of 60 and 65 shall be eligible for retiree medical benefits in the Hospital Center's Medical Plan until their 65th birthday and a payment equivalent to one-half their annual salary. The plan of benefits such employees will be eligible for will be identical to those benefits currently being provided to the Hospital Center's non-union employees, and will involve the same monthly contributions required of non-union employees. Employees will not be subject to any preexisting condition restrictions and there will be no lapse in coverage when switching plans. Employees will be granted extension in order to allow them to utilize the 45 day sick leave retirement benefit described in 7.09 Sick Leave: Entitlement and Earning.
The payment of one-half year's salary shall be made in 26 bi-weekly installments and will start immediately upon retirement.
Eligible nurses who are 65 and over shall be eligible for a payment equivalent to one-half their annual salary as described above, and payable as above (but not to medical benefits). Nurses who retire as part of this program shall retire between January 1, 1996 and February 1, 1996. If extensions beyond February 1, 1996 are requested, the Hospital Center shall seek to accommodate these requests.
