Section E	- Salary Schedules and Guides - Teaching Personnel
1.	Teacher Pay Schedule - See Appendix A
a.	2003-2004 Salary and Benefits
1.	Teachers will receive a 6.1 percent pay increase to include schedule, steps and lanes.
2.	Beginning with the 2003-2004 school year the minimum placement for a teacher will be Step 00 of the appropriate lane.
3.	The District will pick up the District portion of the benefit increase cost.
4.	If the dollar amount required to fund lane changes for 2003-2004 is less than or greater than the 1.5 percent allocated for that purpose, the District will make the appropriate adjustment on the 2004-2005 salary schedule.
b.	Years 2-5: 2004-2008:
I.	Salary enhancement for years two (2) through five (5) will be at the state rate as allocated through the state legislature.
2.	State Rate Definition:
a.	State Rate is the “Per Student Allocation” as defined in SDCL 13-13-10.1(4) plus the funds allocated under House Bill 1191, which is intended in future years to be the Educational Enhancement Fund earning, calculated as a per pupil allocation. The rate increase in years two (2) through five (5) of the contract will be the percent change in the previous year per pupil allocation as defined above.
b.	If during the five-year term of the contract there is a change in the state funding formula for education, the District and the Association will meet to determine the effect on the salary portion of the agreement. The District and the Association agree to modify the contract definition of State Rate if other sources of revenues are added to the State Rate through the legislative
14
process. This would be accomplished by recalculating the previous year “Per Student Allocation” to reflect the change in the formula. Then calculating the percent difference between the previous year “Per Student Allocation” and the revised “Per Student Allocation.”
3.	If the State Rate is increased between 1.5% and 2%, the District will guarantee a 2% salary increase. If the State Rate is above 3.5% but at or below 4%, the increase will be 3.5%. If the State Rate is below 1.5% or above 4%, the District will split the difference between the entities. For example, if the percent increase were 4.2%, the rate of increase applied to the salary package would be 3.6%. Likewise, if the increase were 1.3%, the percent increase in the salary package would be 1.9%.
4.	The District will fund the District portion of the benefit increase cost.
5.	In years two (2) and four (4) of this contract, salary enhancement will be funded at the State Rate. The funding will be as follows: State Rate minus lane change cost, not to exceed 1.5 percent, minus step increases with the remainder to be added to the schedule. Step movement will occur if a step is available. If the cost of lane changes exceeds 1.5 percent the District will absorb the excess cost.
6.	In years three (3) and five (5) of this contract, the State Rate minus the cost of lane changes, not to exceed 1.5 percent, will be added to each position on the schedule. If the cost of lane changes exceeds 1.5 percent the District will absorb the excess cost. No teachers will receive step advancement in years three (3) and five (5) of this contract.
2.	Placement on the Salary Schedule
a.	Beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, the minimum placement for a teacher will be step 00 of the appropriate lane. In year three (3) of this contract, 2005-2006, the 00 step is dropped and Step A becomes the base salary.
b.	A newly hired teacher with prior teaching experience shall be placed in the appropriate degree lane and on the step with the majority of previously employed teachers with the same number of years teaching experience, according to the New Teacher Placement Schedule. (See Appendix A.) One (1) year’s credit shall be granted for each full year in which a person was employed on a half (1/2) time or greater basis or for one (1) semester of full-time employment.
c.	Newly hired employees shall be granted one (I) year experience credit for each year of prior employment provided that experience occurred:
1.	in a setting similar to that for which they are being employed, and
2.	certification/licensure was required.
d.	In those instances where trade experience is a consideration in program staffing, the Assistant Superintendent or designee, after consultation with the President of the
15
Association, may grant one (1) year of experience on the schedule for each two (2) years of trade experience.
e.	When a change in education status qualifies a teacher for placement on a different degree lane of the salary schedule, such change shall be in addition to any step advancements.
3.	Advancement on the Salary Schedule
a.	Currently employed teachers in the District will advance according to the Current Teacher Placement Schedule. (See Appendix A.)
b.	If a teacher qualifies for a lane change to the next higher salary lane, the teacher will move to the corresponding step on the higher lane. Teachers may not advance more than one (1) vertical step on the salary schedule in a given year and may only advance one salary lane in a given year after completing an MA/MS degree.
c.	Teachers with a BA/BS degree will qualify for the BA+12 lane, upon presenting evidence of having obtained twelve (12) semester hours of college or recertification credits after the BA/BS degree.
d.	Teachers pursuing a pre-approved program of study leading to an MA/MS degree in their major subject area, or which provides additional certification or endorsement, who present evidence of having obtained twelve (12) semester hours of pre-approved graduate credit after the BA+12 lane will qualify for the BA+24 lane.
e.	Teachers presenting evidence of completing their approved program of study by obtaining an MA/MS degree will qualify for the MA/MS lane.
f.	Teachers with an MA/MS degree will qualify for the MA+12, MA+24, MA+36, or MA+48 lanes upon presenting evidence of having obtained 12, 24, 36, or 48 hours of pre-approved graduate credits beyond the MA/MS degree. These credits must relate to the teacher’s competency in “what to teach,” “how to teach,” or “how to more effectively fill the role of teacher.”
g.	Teachers with an earned doctorate will receive a $ 1,000 stipend in addition to the amount determined by placement on the salary schedule.

Article VI - Extra Pav - Extra Work
Section A - Extra Pay - Extra Work Point System

If the administration wishes to add positions that call for the payment of extra duty pay, the position and job description will be submitted to the Extra Pay - Extra Work Committee by January 1 to determine the point value of the new position. It will be the responsibility of the administration to fund the position through the budget process. The new dollars will be added to the total dollars in the points pool.

26
according to Appendix C or two (2) points, whichever is less, for a 24 hour day. One (1) point or the hourly rate, whichever is less, shall be paid from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and one (1) point or the hourly rate, whichever is less, shall be paid from 4 p.m. to 8 a.m.

3.	Elementary Schools - Elementary principals will maintain a rotation list of teachers available during the lunch period as defined above for cafeteria and other lunchtime supervisory duties. Should the elementary principal be unable to employ a sufficient number of non-teaching personnel or be unable to use teacher volunteers to cover the lunchtime supervisory duties, a principal may assign a teacher to supervise up to fifteen (15) minutes of the student lunchtime at the elementary school level. No teacher shall have less than a 30 minute duty free lunch period unless a teacher volunteers to supervise during the teacher’s lunch period. Anyone assigned or volunteering to assist with lunchtime duty shall be paid according to Appendix C.
4.	If possible, no elementary teacher shall be assigned lunchtime duty on a day when the teacher does not have at least one (1) planning period within the student day; nor will a teacher on the rotation schedule be assigned lunchtime duty more than twice a week unless the principal needs to assign the teacher in order to provide adequate lunchtime supervision.
5.	The District and the Association agree to review the assignment of elementary teachers to lunchtime supervision annually to determine the number of times each week that a teacher who is on the rotation schedule is being assigned lunchtime supervision. If, as a result of the survey information, either the District or the Association feels the rotation system is working unfairly, the language of the contract may be opened for negotiations.
6.	Secondary teachers assigned cafeteria supervision beyond their full load shall be paid according to Appendix C.
Section K - On-staff Substitute Teachers
Teachers shall not be required to find their own substitutes. It shall be the responsibility of the Administration to secure all necessary substitute teachers.
When necessary to ensure the safety or security of children, a principal may request that a teacher serve as an on-staff substitute. Principals will maintain a list of on-staff substitute
27
volunteers and an on-staff substitute rotation list. Should there be no ready volunteers, the principal will use the rotation list to assign a teacher as an on-staff substitute. At the elementary level on-staff substituting may be accomplished by the regular classroom teacher keeping the students during the “special” period. In the event that this occurs, the teacher will be compensated at the on-staff substitute rate.
If the principal and the designated teacher agree there is a pressing reason for the teacher not to accept the assignment, the teacher will be excused but will remain at the top of the on-staff rotation list. A teacher who believes that assignments to on-staff substituting have been too frequent may appeal to the Superintendent or designee.
A teacher accepting assignment as an on-staff substitute for another teacher shall be paid according to Appendix C.

Any teacher who has attained the minimum age of fifty-five (55) on or before June 30 and has been employed by the District for twenty (20) years or more, may elect to retire. Upon such retirement, the District shall provide the teacher retirement benefits consisting of a health benefit in accordance with paragraph 2c (if the teacher is qualified for such benefit under the provisions of Paragraph 2) (the “Health Benefit”) and an IRC §403(b) benefit in
29
accordance with paragraph 3 (the “403(b) Benefit”), such benefits collectively referred to as the “District Retirement Benefit.” The total amount of the District Retirement Benefit shall equal the following percentage of a teacher’s last contract salary, exclusive of extra pay for extra work salary:
20 years of service - 80% of last contract salary
25 years of service - 85% of last contract salary
30 years of service - 90% of last contract salary
Twenty percent (20%) of the total amount (the “Annual Benefit Amount”) shall be paid by the District in the form of a Health Benefit or §403(b) Benefit during each July 1 - June 30 period (the Plan Year), commencing July 1 of the year of retirement. The District Retirement Benefit shall be provided for five (5) years. The Annual Benefit Amount shall be first applied to provide the Health Benefit (if the teacher is eligible for payment of such benefit by the district under paragraph 2c) and any remaining Annual Benefit Amount shall then be applied to provide the §403(b) Benefit. A teacher shall not be entitled to payment of any of the District Retirement Benefit in cash. In no event shall any individual be entitled to receive the District Retirement Benefit provided by this policy more than once.
Entitlement to a District Retirement Benefit is subject to the following additional conditions:
a.	Any teacher who has 181 days of current and accumulated sick leave may count the 181 days of sick leave toward one (1) additional year of District service in calculating the total number of years of service for retirement purposes. This applies to the District Retirement Benefit but does not in any way affect how the South Dakota Retirement System counts years of service.
b.	No teacher shall be eligible for the District Retirement Benefit unless, during the school year retirement is elected, the teacher has taught through the entire school year, unless that teaching has been interrupted for reasons of the teacher’s health or other reasons found acceptable to the Association and the Board. The decision with respect to such reasons shall not be reviewable or grievable.
c.	In order to qualify for the District Retirement Benefit, a teacher shall notify the Superintendent in writing not later than February 1 of the teacher’s intention to retire in the current school year. The Assistant Superintendent shall forward the list of early retirees to the Association President within five (5) working days of February 1. If a teacher fails to inform the Superintendent of the intent to retire by February 1, but subsequently wishes to retire early and has met all other requirements of this policy and if the Superintendent and the President of the Association support the request, the Board may authorize the District Retirement Benefit, but the total amount of such Benefit shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Such late requests may be submitted anytime prior to August 1.
d.	In the event a teacher entitled to the District Retirement Benefit shall die before receiving the total amount of the District Retirement Benefit, such unpaid benefit
30
shall be paid in cash at the time or times the benefit would have otherwise been provided the teacher under paragraph 1 of this policy to: (i) the beneficiary designated in writing by the teacher on a form prescribed by the Finance Office of the District; or (ii) in the event no beneficiary designation has been made, to the estate of the deceased teacher. Payment by the District in accordance herewith shall fully discharge the District’s obligation under this paragraph 1.
If the Internal Revenue Service issues regulations, or otherwise rules or determines, that the provisions of this paragraph Id adversely affect the taxation of the Health Benefit or 403(b) Benefit under the income or employment tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the parties hereto agree to renegotiate the terms of this paragraph Id.
2.	Health Benefit
a.	Any teacher who:
(i)	is a minimum of fifty-five (55) years of age and has been employed by the District for at least eight (8) consecutive years; or
(ii)	is younger than fifty-five (55) years of age but whose age and years of consecutive employment with the District total eighty-five (85); and is currently enrolled in the District Major Medical Plan or Basic Life Insurance Plan at the time of election of retirement may continue to participate in the District’s Major Medical Plan or Basic Life Insurance Plan until Medicare eligibility (currently age sixty-five (65)). If the teacher maintained dependent coverage under the Major Medical Plan at the time of retirement, the teacher may continue such coverage. A retired teacher’s coverage under the Major Medical and Basic Life Insurance Plans will terminate at Medicare eligibility (currently age sixty-five (65)). Dependent coverage under the Major Medical Plan shall terminate at the earliest of the dependent reaching age sixty-five (65), the date the retiree is no longer eligible for coverage or the date the dependent is no longer an eligible dependent.
b.	A teacher who is eligible for this Health Benefit, but is not eligible for the District Retirement Benefit set forth in paragraph 1, shall be responsible for payment of Major Medical and Basic Life Insurance coverage at 102% of the rate charged to then current teachers and/or their dependents.
c.	If a teacher is eligible for both the Health Benefit and the District Retirement Benefit, the District shall be responsible for payment of the contribution rate for Major Medical and Basic Life Insurance to the extent and subject to the terms of paragraph 1. The amount of the Benefit provided a teacher for the purposes of determining the amount of the Health Benefit provided under paragraph 1 shall be computed at the rate of 102% of the contribution rate charged to then current teachers and/or their dependents. Once the District has provided the Annual Benefit Amount for any Plan Year or the total amount
31
of the District Retirement Benefit, the teacher shall be responsible for the payment of Major Medical and Basic Life Insurance coverage, including dependent coverage, on the same basis and at the rate of 102% of the contribution rate for then active teachers.
d.	A teacher eligible for the Health Benefit under this paragraph 2, whether eligible for the District Retirement Benefit or not, may elect continuation coverage under COBRA for other medical benefits provided by the District but shall be responsible for payment of the applicable premium in accordance with COBRA.

The District shall estimate the Annual Benefit Amount to be provided for the Health Benefit for the Plan Year prior to September 1 of each Plan Year. The amount of contribution to the 403(b) Plan will be adjusted prior to June 30 of each Plan Year to take into account any variation from the estimated amount. The §403(b) contribution shall not exceed the applicable dollar limit under IRC §415 and shall otherwise comply with the requirements of IRC §403(b).
Section E - Tax Sheltered Accounts

The President of the Board and the business manager are appointed and authorized to carry out such plans and to enter into such agreements as may be necessary for such purpose. Provided, however, that by the adoption of said plan the Board makes no warranty to employees participating therein and assumes no responsibility to employees that the amounts contributed or paid for any account for said employee shall be excluded from the gross income of the employee for federal income tax purposes.
2.	It is the intention of the Board that such plan and program qualify for such exclusion as authorized under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and that in all matters respecting the purchase of an account for an employee, the Board assumes no financial responsibility regarding said account. The District assumes no liability for assisting in the calculation of any plan contribution limits. The administration shall establish the necessary rules and regulations in order to facilitate this policy.
a.	If completed paperwork is received by the Payroll Department by the tenth of the month, the first withholding by the District will be the same month. Otherwise the first withholding will be the following month. Companies or organizations must submit a single billing form with all their tax-sheltered accounts listed on the billing form not later than the fifth of the month.

2.	Any personal property being used in the instructional program of the school must be registered with the principal when brought to the school for said instructional purposes, and no claim for reimbursement shall be paid on unregistered property.
3.	No claim will be considered in an amount less than five dollars ($5) and in no event shall the liability of the School District assumed hereby exceed $800 on any one (1) occurrence per claimant. No claim hereunder shall be paid by the District unless the loss is not covered by valid and collectible insurance.

The work “strike” shall mean the failure to report for duty, the willful absence from one’s position, the stoppage of work, or the abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful and proper performance of the duties of employment by concerting action with others, and without the lawful approval of one’s superior, or in any manner interfering with the operation of the government of the School District for the purpose of coercing a change in the conditions or compensation or the rights, privileges or obligations of employment. In the event such prohibited activity occurs, and upon notification from the District, the Association will immediately take such action as is reasonable and necessary to terminate such activity and to provide written evidence to the District that the same has been accomplished. If the Association believes the person(s) was not engaged in an activity prohibited by this contract, or not otherwise illegal, the right of the Association to assist the person(s) to dispute the dismissal is reserved.
The Association further recognizes and agrees that violation of this no-strike agreement by the Association shall constitute breach of contract by the Association.
Section C - Survival of Recognition and No-Strike Provision
If this contract expires without a new contract between the parties, or is otherwise terminated before its intended time of expiration, the Recognition Clause (Article I, Section A) and the NoStrike Clause (Article XV, Section B) shall survive the expiration or termination until such time as a new contract is made by the parties, or until the Association is, pursuant to law, no longer the recognized bargaining representative.
Section D - Duration
Unless otherwise agreed to by mutual consent of the parties, this Agreement shall be effective from July 1, 2003, and shall continue in effect through June 30, 2008.
68
Negotiations may be reopened by mutual consent if additional funding for education becomes available.
Section E - Reopening of Negotiations
During the life of this contract, negotiations shall be reopened for salary negotiations if the District receives additional funding from the State legislature or Federal government specifically designated for teacher or employee enhancement purposes.
During the life of this contract, negotiations will be reopened if federal or state mandates impact conditions of this contract.
In witness whereof the parties have caused this agreement to be signed at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the 25th day of August, 2003.
