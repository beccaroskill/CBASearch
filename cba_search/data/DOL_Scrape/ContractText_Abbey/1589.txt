The doctor shall evaluate the employee's statement. Such doctor's visit shall be paid for by the Contractor.
(3)	An applicant who has been employed within Hawaii's Construction Industry but who has not taken a physical examination within the year immediately preceding the date of referral may be required by the Contractor to secure such examination under the Hawaii Carpenters Health & Welfare Plan as a post-offer prerequisite for employment.

ADDENDUM I
AGREEMENT COVERING DRUGS AND OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ON CONSTRUCTION JOB SITES IN THE STATE OF HAWAII
WITNESSETH
WHEREAS, the Union and the Company recognize that drug and alcohol abuse is a problem that affects many employees, and wish to address this problem;
WHEREAS, especially in the construction industry, an employee who is under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol while at the workplace or is abusing controlled substances while at the workplace is a danger not only to himself or herself but to his or her fellow employees;
WHEREAS, the Union and the Company wish to make the workplace a better and safer place of employment by eliminating the danger that such employees create by being under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the workplace;
WHEREAS, such employees who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol have lower productivity than employees who are drug and alcohol free;
WHEREAS, the Union and the Company wish to have employees working at normal capacity, doing an honest day’s work for an honest day's pay;
WHEREAS, the Union and the Company wish to comply with the Federal Law known as the "Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988," Public Law 100-690 in order to obtain a drug-free workplace.
A.	Prohibition Against Alcohol and Controlled Substances At the Workplace
1.	Every employee who is employed by the Company and who is covered by the Master Agreement is prohibited from unlawfully manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, possessing, using or being under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol at the Company's workplace. Any employee who violates this prohibition shall be subject to immediate removal from the aforesaid workplace, as well as other disciplinary action, including discharge.
B.	Use Of Over-The-Counter Medications Or Medications Prescribed By A Licensed Physician
1.	Use of over-the-counter medications or of a medication prescribed by a licensed physician in accordance with the physician's orders;, is NOT prohibited; but to avoid an unwarranted accusation and/or other misunderstanding, the employee is required to report the fact that he is taking such medication to his Foreman and/or Supervisor, prior to commencing work at the workplace.
2.	Any employee who is lawfully using a controlled substance at the workplace, i.e., taking prescription drugs in accordance with a doctor's order, while not subject to disciplinary action, may nevertheless be required to leave the workplace, if consumption of that medication presents a safety hazard or prevents; him from being able to properly perform his work.
-69-
C.	Education and Awareness Program
To complement and foster our Joint Company and Union Policy and Program of achieving a drug-free workforce and a alcohol-free workplace, the Company shall establish and implement a Drug Education And Awareness Program which shall include the following:

In connection with the above, employees will be encouraged to seek counseling and other assistance from these agencies on a self-referral basis if they feel they have a need for it. An employee who voluntarily seeks help and undergoes treatment for drug or alcohol abuse prior to being required to undergo testing will NOT be subject to disciplinary action because of admitted substance abuse, provided he or she thereafter remains drug and alcohol free after commencing treatment.

1.	Pre-employment and post-accident testing of applicants and employees subject to U.S. Department of Transportation regulation;
2.	Appointment of a Medical Review Officer who will be responsible for making the final decision to verify a positive test result after review of all relevant data on the testing and any explanations offered by the individual tested;

In utilizing the foregoing criteria of a "reasonable, objective basis," the parties hereto expressly agree that the Federal or State Constitutional law standards of "probable cause" or "reasonable suspicion" are not applicable.
The Contractor shall complete the attached form (Appendix B) prior to sending an employee to be tested For Cause.
(b)	Periodic Testing. Periodic, routine or intermittent testing shall be conducted at different times and at different intervals for all employees on the project to

4.	Refusal to sign an authorization to submit to a drug, controlled substance, or alcohol test, the refusal to undergo such a test, or the refusal to permit the physician or medical laboratory to provide the test results to the Company and Union shall constitute an act of insubordination. This aforesaid insubordination shall be just and proper cause for discipline, including discharge. The penalty for this aforesaid insubordination shall be: (a) a two (2) week suspension from work without pay and without fringe benefits accruing, for the first act of this aforesaid insubordination; (b) a four (4) week suspension from work without pay and without fringe benefits accruing for the second act of this aforesaid insubordination; and (c) discharge from employment for the third act of this aforesaid insubordination.
5.	An employee shall complete the "Consent For The Release Of Confidential Information" form as set forth in Appendix "C" prior to undergoing a substance abuse test. When an employee is tested, the employee, the Company and the Union shall be notified of the test results.

Where the employee believes that the positive test result is not due to unlawful use of alcohol or a controlled substance, but due to exposure to a workplace substance, or that the accuracy of the test result was confounded by a workplace substance, he/she shall have the right, at the Company's expense to have an independent laboratory designated by the Company evaluate the specimen by mass spectrometry or other state-of-the-art technology. If the evaluation indicates that the positive test result was due to a workplace substance, or that a workplace substance confounded the accuracy of the test: (a) the employee will be put back to work immediately with full back pay and benefits, and with a rescission of any discipline imposed along with an explanation for such rescission; and (b) the Company shall take immediate steps to insure that employees are not exposed to such substances al: levels that may produce or cause such positive test results, or that may cause material impairment of health or functional capacity.
7.	An employee who tests positive and is later allowed to return to work pursuant to paragraphs G.1.(a) or (b), below, shall be subject to unannounced testing by the Company until two (2) subsequent consecutive tests of this nature are negative. Such tests shall be conducted within twelve (12) months after the employee returns to work, and in any event shall cease after the expiration of tine aforesaid time period.
G.	Schedule Of Disciplinary Actions

The violation of this aforesaid prohibition by an employee shall constitute just and proper cause for discipline, including but not limited to discharge, as defined in the Master Agreement, and as specified in this Addendum to the Master Agreement. In the event the employee engage;:; in a separate act of misconduct, in addition to the violation of this Policy, (such as insubordination, fighting, etc.) or engages in conduct which results in physical injury- or property damage, the employee may also be disciplined for such conduct or misconduct in addition to discipline for the drug or alcohol offense. Such discipline shall be in accord with principles of just and proper cause.
1.	The following disciplinary actions shall be taken against an employee whose drug or alcohol test has a positive reading, as defined in Appendix “A" hereto, or who is guilty of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance or alcohol at the workplace, and hereinafter collectively referred to as an offense:
(a)	First Offense
(1)	Employee Option 1 -- The employee shall be afforded the opportunity to enroll in a substance abuse assistance or rehabilitation program. If the employee enters such a program, his or her status as an employee will not be affected
-73-
and he/she will be allowed to return to work and to continue to work as long as he/she remains drug free, as indicated by a negative drug or alcohol test result.
(2)	Employee Option 2 - A first-offense employee who does not choose to enroll in a substance abuse assistance or rehabilitation program shall be suspended for the length of time it takes to obtain a negative reading from a subsequent drug or alcohol test but in any case, no less than a two (2)-week suspension. The employee must make arrangements with his or her Company prior to undergoing drug or alcohol retesting. Should a subsequent drug or alcohol test fail to produce a negative reading within three (3) months after the first offense, then the employee shall be considered as having committed his or her second offense.
(b)	Second Offense -- A suspension from work for the time it takes to obtain a negative reading from any subsequent drug or alcohol test but in any case, no less than a four (4)-week suspension from work.
