This is a Memorandum of Understanding between the undersigned parties regarding a Clark County Multi-party Healthcare Committee.
Purpose: It is the purpose of the Healthcare Committee, working within the negotiated parameters, to seek a balance between the continuance of the quality of care traditionally provided to the County's represented employees and keeping the parties' costs to a minimum, while meeting legal and contractual obligations.
Committee Membership: The Committee shall be comprised of two representatives from each bargaining unit (including representation from their respective union staff), two (2) representatives from the ranks of the non-represented employees and up to eight (8) representatives from management provided that bargaining unit representation shall always make-up no less than two-thirds (2/3) of the total membership.
Ratification of this Memorandum of Understanding by the signatories shall empower each party's selected representatives to reach a binding decision. Such decisions shall be reached by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of all members of the Committee present or via proxy. Members who will be absent during a meeting may participate in decisions by submitting a vote by proxy.
One (1) union representative and one management representative will be selected to serve as meeting coordinators who will set meeting times and places, prepare agendas and arrange for meeting minutes to be prepared and distributed.
Parameters of the Committee: The Committee is authorized to determine healthcare benefits for the parties based upon the following parameters:
1.	The Committee shall research and make decisions about the structure, coverage, design, and plans, excluding eligibility, of medical, vision and dental insurances provided to employees. The Committee will be responsible to ensure plan design encompasses federal and state laws.
2.	The Committee will be responsible to ensure plan design encompasses federal and state laws.

Medical Examiner’s Unit Agreement
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018
Page 28
5.	The Committee will take into consideration, research and make decisions about plan design in order to try to avoid any cost associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax or charge. In the event the healthcare committee decisions do not avoid the ACA tax or charge, this cost will be borne by the employees and the parties agree to reopen no later than June 30, 2017 to bargain the implantation.
6.	A High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) with a Health Savings Account (HSA) will be included as an additional option, along with an HMO plan and a non-HMO plan. The particular design elements of the plan will be the responsibility of the Committee
7.	The Committee shall determine the cost distribution for the payment of insurance premiums between that portion contributed by the County and that which may be contributed by the employee.
8.	The Committee shall meet on County time, but the County shall not be required to pay overtime to any member due to the scheduling of daytime meetings outside some members' normal work shifts. Committee members meeting outside of their regularly scheduled shift will be permitted to flex or adjust schedules if possible to accommodate meeting attendance.
9.	As the last item on its agenda, the Committee shall draft and publish an update of the meeting.
10.	Departments within the County will promptly provide all requested information about insurance that is in the possession of the Departments.
11.	The Committee will set meeting dates as determined necessary.
Budget for the Committee: The County’s financial commitment to funding healthcare benefits shall be limited per the Per Employee Per Month (PEPM) budget The Per Employee Per Month composite budget will be fourteen hundred and twenty dollars ($1420.00)
•	Employees will be responsible for contributing seven percent (7%) of the composite cost each year; and if costs exceed the composite budget and employee contribution both the County and employee shall share in the excess cost on a 50/50 basis.
Decision Making:
•	The Committee may choose to work with a Mediator. The Mediator shall not be a voting member of the Committee. However, if the Healthcare Committee is unable to reach a decision for any benefit year by September 1st. The Mediator shall direct a solution no later than October 1st. Such solution shall be binding on all parties to this Memorandum of Understanding. The Mediator’s solution shall be within the parameters outlined above, based upon her/his understanding of the positions of the parties gained through the mediation process. Therefore a formal hearing shall not be necessary.
Medical Examiner’s Unit Agreement
January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018	Page 29
•	If any costs are attached to the mediator’s work they shall be paid as follows: Clark County fifty percent (50%); the remaining fees shall be divided equally among the participating units.
