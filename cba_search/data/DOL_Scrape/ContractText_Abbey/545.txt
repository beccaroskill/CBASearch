SENIORITY
Seniority shall be defined as the length of continuous employment with the Employer within the bargaining unit and shall begin with the employee’s last date of employment. For seniority purposes, a “date of employment” shall mean a date the employee actually commences work on the job. Seniority ranking for employees commencing employment on the same date shall be determined by the day and month of birth. The employee whose day and month of birth is closest to January 1, within the calendar year, shall have the greatest seniority. Supervisors transferred back to the bargaining unit shall be credited for all seniority earned prior to the supervisor's promotion out of the bargaining unit.
No employee shall acquire any seniority rights until he has been employed by the Company for at least thirty (30) days, provided that after thirty (30) days employment, the seniority shall revert to the last date of hire.
Seniority may be broken only by quit, justifiable discharge, layoff for one (1) year, employment with the Employer outside the bargaining unit for one (1) year or failure to return to work in accordance with the terms of a leave of absence or recall from layoff.
In the application of seniority, there shall be 3 seniority groups:
1)	Regular Clerks
2)	Bakery/Deli Clerks
3)	Utility Clerks
The seniority groups are defined as follows:
Regular Clerks are all employees other than classified employees, Bakery/Deli Clerks, and Utility Clerks.
Bakery/Deli Clerks are all employees working exclusively in Bakery and Deli Departments.
Utility Clerks are all employees whose duties are limited to sorting, bagging and packaging sold merchandise; carrying and loading sold merchandise; sweeping floors anywhere in the store; cleaning the parking lot and other adjacent areas outside the store; filling bag racks; cleaning areas around and in front of the checker lanes: cleaning rest rooms; collecting and sorting returnable containers; disposing of trash and rubbish; washing and cleaning of shelves and fronts of cases, without handling merchandise; washing windows; posting of window signs; returning of merchandise left by customers from check stands to shelves or displays; changing light bulbs, tying paper/cardboard bales (over 18 years), cleaning employee break area and cleaning inside and

outside the store; mopping of store and blocking shelves between the hours of 8:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. for a maximum of sixteen (16) hours per day per store.
* The above is intended to refer to gift baskets throughout the year. It is not the intent of the parties to change their present practice of mass fruit basket preparation at the holiday season.
The transfer of an employee to a seniority group having a higher wage schedule shall be deemed a promotion. Such employees shall have two (2) seniority dates, to wit: the date of hire and date of promotion. Within the employee’s new seniority group, the date of promotion shall apply. In the event an employee is returned to a lower seniority group, the date of hire shall apply. In the event an employee is returned to his higher seniority group, the time previously spent in the higher seniority group shall apply for the purpose of establishing the seniority date.
The Employer shall prepare seniority lists as follows: The Employer shall prepare a master list for all stores covered by the contract and a separate list for each store. The Employer shall prepare the master list once each six (6) months. The separate store list for each seniority grouping shall be prepared each four (4) months. Copies of all lists shall be submitted to the Union and maintained in the store office. Additionally, copies of the separate store lists shall be posted in the store in a conspicuous place accessible to the employees. The list shall include each employee's name, rate of pay, date of hire, classification and promotion date where applicable. No employee shall be bound by a seniority date appearing on a list if, in fact, the seniority date is incorrect.
In order to maximize the opportunity for employees to exercise seniority rights in a manner which will allow employees to work in stores convenient to their store of last employment, the parties agree that there shall be mutually agreed upon geographical groupings of stores. Employees’ seniority rights shall be exercised on a store basis, geographic grouping basis as well as a local union basis as more specifically set forth below. By mutual agreement, the geographic grouping may include stores located within the jurisdiction of two (2) or more locals. In the event of a new store opening, the parties agree to meet prior to the date of posting the new store opening to discuss the geographic grouping and revise the same if necessary. In the event of a store closing, the parties agree to meet within seven (7) days following the store closing to discuss the geographic grouping and revise the same if necessary.

Section 8.10
Layoffs: Layoffs within the store shall be on a strict seniority basis within the affected seniority classification. The Employer shall offer employees a reasonable period of training, up to thirty (30) days if necessary, to comply with this seniority requirement. A laid off employee shall have the following options based upon seniority.
The laid off employee may elect to transfer within his seniority classification to any store in the geographic grouping provided that in the store selected by the laid off employee, there is at least one (1) less senior employee working in the same classification. If the transfer involves work which the employee has not previously performed, then the Employer shall offer the employee a reasonable period of training, up to thirty (30) days.
In the event the laid off employee's seniority does not permit a transfer within the geographic grouping, then the laid off employee may elect to transfer to any store within the jurisdiction of the local union in accordance with the employee’s seniority, on the same basis and under the same conditions as set forth in paragraph (a) above.
A laid off employee may elect to take a demotion to a lower seniority grouping within his store (a seniority grouping with a lower wage schedule). The employee will then be placed upon the applicable seniority list based upon the employee's last date of hire. Lateral transfer between equal wage structure seniority groups within the store.
In lieu of exercising the above options, the employee may elect to accept lay-off status. Before hiring any employees or promoting an employee to a job within the laid off employee’s seniority classification, the Employer will offer the job to employees who exercise the demotion option of paragraph (c) above or employees on the lay-off list, in accordance with seniority. An employee may decline to accept a recall to any store other than to one within the same geographic grouping from which the lay-off occurred without forfeiting the recall rights.
All employees shall have recall rights up to one (1) year from lay-off. Employees shall be notified of recall by certified mail to their last known address if the Employer is unable to contact the employee by telephone.
An employee who is reduced in hours by more than six (6) hours per week for four (4) consecutive weeks will be eligible to transfer as set forth above. The base period used to determine the six (6) hour reduction will be the average number of hours worked

during the preceding four (4) weeks. Employees who wish to transfer under this provision must notify their store manager in writing, with a copy to the Union. The transfer will be made in accordance with 8.8 above and will be effective the beginning of the second week following receipt of such notice.
Any employee laid off as a result of a store closing or any employee laid off as a result of transfer pursuant to the aforesaid transfer provisions, including a lay-off occasioned by the transfer of an employee from a closed store, shall have the same transfer rights as set forth above.
Promotions and Demotions: Promotions and demotions shall be handled in the following manner, except as otherwise provided for in paragraph 8.8 (e):
When a job opening occurs within a store, it shall be filled either by a voluntary transfer in accordance with paragraph 8.13 or by an employee from the next lowest seniority group within the store. After giving due regard to seniority, the Employer shall have the right to exercise his judgment. Such decision shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
Promotions to classified jobs shall be within the sole discretion of the Employer, provided, however, that all classified jobs shall be filled by unit employees. This does not preclude the right of the Union to grieve such promotion.
The Employer shall afford every promoted employee a reasonable period of training in the position, up to thirty (30) days.
An employee promoted to a classified job must perform the duties of the classified job.
No employee shall be demoted from any seniority group or any classified position specified in Section 10.3 without just cause.
Involuntary and Voluntary Transfers - The Employer may transfer employees to meet the necessities of the business with the following limitations and under the following conditions:
No employee shall be involuntarily transferred outside of their geographical grouping.
In the event a transfer is required outside of the geographic grouping, the Employer will first seek volunteers. In the event no volunteers apply for a transfer, the Employer will make the transfer in accordance with inverse seniority.
No involuntary transfer will be made when it is known that a reduction in hours for the transferred employee will occur.
Should the regular employee be temporarily transferred from his

or her regularly assigned store to another store and such transfer results in additional transportation expense, the employee will be reimbursed by the Company for such additional transportation expense. Transportation cost shall be computed on the basis of the Federal Travel Expense Standards in effect at the time or the Employer's regular mileage reimbursement rate.
e) An employee desiring a transfer to a store closer to home shall notify the Employer in writing of his or her desire to transfer to a specific store. In the event of a job opening in the specific store within the employee’s seniority classification involving a comparable number of hours, the Employer will transfer the employee to the specific store. The employee requesting the transfer must have greater seniority than other employees on layoff in the geographic area or other employees in the store who have requested to fill the job opening.
