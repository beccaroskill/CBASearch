If the names submitted by the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service are unsatisfactory to either the Company or the Union, a new list will be requested.
18
Each party may reject one (1) list submitted by the Director of Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
(a)	Arbitration Proceedings:
1.	The arbitrator so appointed shall conduct hearings at mutually agreeable locations as may be necessary to determine the facts in the grievance.

ARTICLE VIII—SENIORITY
8.1 (a) The Company and the Union affirm that seniority is that principle of employment policy which recognizes the precedence of one employee over another, based on length of continuous service. They recognize, however, the difficulty in providing in this agreement for the application of this principle to all the various situations that may develop. However, it is agreed that the senior employee shall be considered at having preference in matters of layoff, recall, promotion, and transfer, providing always that the senior employee shall have the necessary qualifications as herein defined and shall be willing to perform the work in question.
(b) As used herein the term “qualifications” or “qualified” is intended to mean such factors relative to job performance as: physical fitness, skill and ability to learn the job within the trial period; license, where required; training and experience where necessary for entry into the job; and past work record with the Company including such items as attendance, safety, quality and quantity of work. In considering qualifications for jobs which require some direction of lower skilled employees, the ability to direct people shall also be considered.
8.2	The word "seniority” in this agreement accordingly refers to “plant wide seniority”. Employees who are covered by any other
bargaining units shall have no seniority in the bargaining units covered by Local 143.
8.3	The Company shall continue the present practice of furnishing to the Union after the event, notice of transfer, employment, or severance of any employee covered by this agreement, except that in case of lay-off, other than temporary as hereinafter defined, a minimum of seven (7) calendar days advance notice will be given or five (5) days pay in lieu thereof provided he/she has one (1) or more years continuous service with the Company.
8.4	Any employee returning to the bargaining unit after having been transferred out of the bargaining unit will upon return to the unit have his/her seniority within the unit for purposes of transfer, promotion, or lay-off commence from the date of his/her return to the unit. Exceptions are as follows:
(a)	If an employee transferred out of the unit to a permanent job returns to the unit within three (3) months, his/her seniority shall be unbroken.
(b)	If an employee transfers to a job of temporary duration outside of the unit, his/her seniority on return to the unit shall be unbroken and the employee shall be returned to his/her former status. An employee may transfer no more than three (3) times for a total of
22
23
six (6) months in any twelve (12) month period.
8.5	Seniority of employees shall be one of the governing factors in connection with shift assignments or temporary transfers subject to their qualification.
(a) It is the intent of the Company when making temporary assignments to another classification to offer the assignment in seniority order to those available employees who are qualified.
8.6	The Company will post in each department a seniority and overtime list. This overtime list will include all employees regardless of shift worked.
8.7	Any experience on temporary assignment documented by skill blocks will be counted towards qualifications for that job. However, no employee shall be permanently assigned to a vacancy solely because he/she has previously performed the job in question as the result of a temporary assignment thereto. Thus, an employee who is out sick cannot be displaced by a senior employee who may temporarily be assigned to his/her job, so long as the qualifications of the employee replacing him/her result principally from experience gained during the temporary assignment.
24
8.8	An employee temporarily assigned to a job or replacing another employee on a leave of absence, vacation, Virus Production, or working on a job of known duration (3 months or less) returns to his/her former status when the need for the assignment, leave of absence, vacation replacement, Virus Production, or known duration job (3 months or less) no longer exists.
8.9	If the need for overtime is not covered by the normal overtime list by hours, and no volunteer is obtained, then the junior qualified employee on the seniority list in the classification, on the shift, shall be required to work the overtime.
(a) No such junior qualified employee will be required to work more than two consecutive 16 hour days provided there are other junior qualified employees available to perform the work.
25

(f) If the employee’s new rate is equal or lower than his/her old rate, the employee will be moved to the maximum of that labor grade after a six (6) week period. Thereafter, the employee will follow the limitations established in the Contract and the Classification Definitions.
9.3	An employee that is the successful bidder on a job the employee previously held will receive the rate of the current classification at the step in the wage progression previously attained.
9.4	Selection, subject to physical qualifications, will be on a basis of plant wide seniority in job bidding and in the cases of employees laid off from their job under 10.1 for the classification listed:

Employees who have bid up successfully will be restricted from lateral or downward bidding for a period of six (6) months, with the exception of shift changes within the employee’s department.
(b)	Employees who bid on a temporary position will be allowed to exercise their bidding rights should a permanent position be posted in that classification..
(c)	Employees who have bid on a temporary job may not bid on another temporary job until they have first returned to their permanent job unless they were initially hired on a temporary job, or the temporary job they wish to bid on is in an equal or higher labor grade.
ARTICLE X—LAYOFF
(REDUCTION IN FORCE)
10.1 In case of layoff (reduction of force) in any department, the Union will be notified before the affected employee(s). The person in the department in the job and classification affected by the layoff who is latest on the official seniority list will be laid off first. However, at such time, unless the layoff is temporary (for not more than two (2) weeks), such person may exercise his/her seniority for jobs which he/she is qualified to fill. During periods in which employees are laid off from the plant they will be considered employees under this Contract in respect to all references to employees in a laid off status. Employees laid off shall be rehired in the order of their seniority for jobs which they are then qualified to fill and which are open, except that to avoid useless notifications, an employee so laid off who is willing to return only to specific jobs or shifts may so state on a signed statement to the Employment Manager (a copy of which will be forwarded by the Company to the Union), and recall for other jobs may then be omitted. Further, an employee so laid off who unreasonably refuses jobs offered may be terminated, and be so notified by the Company by mail, a copy of which notification will be forwarded to the Union.
28
29
UN
i.
(a) In cases of significant reductions in force (impacting at least fifty [50] positions or by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union) the person in the department in the job and classification affected by the layoffs) who is most senior on the official seniority list will be laid off first following the provisions of this Article (X).
In addition to the provisions of this Article (X) the senior employee may elect to bump (paper bump) a less senior employee but remain in their current classification while business conditions permit. The Company may hold (paper bump) an employee effected by a layoff (reduction in force) in their current classification that has bumped a less senior employee while business conditions permit. A less senior employee(s) that is bumped (paper bumped) will also remain in their current classification and bump in accordance with their seniority level.
10.2	Any employee laid off from the plant for lack of work shall retain his/her seniority for a period equal to their length of continuous service at the time of layoff for a period of not less than two (2) years and up to a maximum of ten (10) years, unless he/she fails to reply within ten (10) days after notice is sent to his/her last known address and the Union Office that a job is open, unless there are extenuating circumstances satisfactory to both the Company and the Union. However, laid off employees must register in
30
person at the Personnel Office each year within five (5) days before the expiration of each such twelve (12) month period from the time of layoff. Failure to register will automatically terminate the employee’s seniority rights. No new employees shall be engaged while qualified employees are still laid off and have not had an opportunity to return to work as herein above provided, except when the need for employees is urgent, (in which case an employee so hired may be displaced by an employee returning to work in accordance with the provisions of this article).
(a)	If temporary work (apparently for two (2) weeks or less) develops which laid off employees are qualified to perform, they may refuse to return for it without affecting their seniority.
(b)	Likewise, if the need to get the temporary work done is urgent, while reasonable effort will be made by the Company to obtain qualified laid off employees in order of their seniority, employees may be rehired as they are found to be available. Employees so hired, if out of order of seniority, may be displaced by senior qualified employees who have not refused the work, if the work continues more than two (2) weeks.
10.3	Bumping and Layoff Procedures All Employees. The Company and the Union have agreed to the following:
31

Notification of job elimination will be sent to the Manager of Labor Relations, Employment Office, Union and the employee.
Employee’s file is reviewed by the Employment Office.
Employee remains in his/her classification until contacted by Employment Office for review of bumping options.
Any employee with contractual seniority of two (2) years or less, whose jobs have been eliminated or who are bumped may only execute his/her bumping rights into a BASIC JOB or vacancy as qualified. Any employee, with two (2) years or less contractual seniority, who exercised his/her bumping rights is not protected in the position in which they bumped.
The eligible employee reviews the list of open positions and other positions for which the employee is qualified (exclusive of “Basic" jobs). If an employee is not eligible for the entry level of a job family or higher, the employee will bump the least senior “Basic" job holder, regardless of shift or department. There will be no interviews for "Basic" jobs.
Employees will choose three (3) positions from the list for
interviews as appropriate. Interviews and selection decisions will be made within five (5) business days. In cases where the most senior employee(s) is laid off first persuant to Article 10.1(a) the Company may extend the interviews and selection decision(s) beyond five (5) business days.
8.	Bumping will be based on seniority and qualifications. An employee will not be disqualified from bumping into a position based soley upon an interview record for performance in his/her personnel folder. Under the 20% rule, prior experience in a position is waived except for maintenance craft employees as indicated in Article II, Section 2.4. Employees bumping into a department will enter at the entry level for the classification until the employee satisfies all assessments of the job classification/level.
One bump. Employees may only bump into a single classification when in “bumping” status. During bumping an employee can opt out of a job within the first three weeks, at which time the employee will be moved into a “Basic" job position. Should an employee not complete the ten (10) weekproba-
tionary period, they will be moved into a "Basic" job position. The employee may not bump into another classification for the period of one (1) year.
20% Rule. Any employee who has held a bumped position for the probationary period (10 weeks) may not be bumped from that position for a period of six (6) months from start of that job. No more than 20% of the employees within any classification, in any department, on any shift will have less than six (6) months experience on the job. An employee who is unable to bump into a classification due to the 20% threshold must accept the position of the least senior person holding a "Basic" job. When the selected department no longer exceeds the 20% threshold, the affected employee will be given his/her bumping rights into the department. The 20% Rules does not apply to "Basic" jobs. "Basic” jobs will be defined and listed as those jobs that do not critically impact an operation. A list of "Basic” jobs will be provided to the Union.
9.	If an employee rejects all jobs offered from his/her list of three
34
I
interviews, the employee will be offered a position into a "Basic” job or layoff depending on seniority. Bumped employees placed on layoff either by choice or seniority must sign a “Laid Off Employee Option Form” prior to being laid off.
10.	The Company and the Union have agreed that the “Laboratory Service-Aseptic Cleaning” will be entered into the “Basic” job classification. Because of the critical GMP nature of this position, bumping will be limited to no greater than 20% of the positions per month.
11.	The Company and the Union have agreed that, because of the critical USDA and GLP nature of the “Animal Attendant” position, bumping into this position will be limited to no greater than 30% of the positions per four month period.
12.	The following departments will have the 20% rule but with a 12 month protection from bumping:
Solvent Recovery - Dept. 503
WLVP Department 421 - Setup Workers WLVP Departments 445,476 and 477 TAB & Operator classifications
Should future assessments indicate a shorter time frame the parties will review as appropriate.
35
ARTICLE XI—LEAVES OF ABSENCE
11.1	The Company agrees to give leave of absence for illness without affecting the employee’s service continuity, up to two years and six months. At the expiration of this time he/she will be considered resigned, unless it is agreed by the Company and the Union to continue his/her seniority. Such extensions for leaves for illness must be renewed quarterly by notice and approval of the Manager, Labor Relations. Employees having less than six (6) months service in the Plant may at the end of their leave be placed in jobs other than the one they previously held. A positon vacated for six (6) months due to an absence in accordance with this article will be filled on a permanent basis. An employee who returns to work from medical leave of absence after six (6) months will return to work in accordance with the bumping procedure (Article 10.3).
11.2	The Company agrees to give consideration to each request for leave of absence for other valid reasons and to grant such other requests as, in the opinion of the Company, may be consistent with business requirements, for periods not to exceed three months. Such authorized leaves, including any extensions that may be authorized, will not affect the employee’s absentee record for the purpose of disciplinary action. When taking a personal
36
leave of absence, employees may retain up to ten (10) days of vacation entitlement, if any.
11.3	Employees who leave the Company to enter military service will be entitled to all rights guaranteed them under existing applicable federal legislation.

(a)	For jobs carrying a higher rate of pay, such higher rate shall be paid for full day worked if two (2) or more hours are worked in the higher rated job. When such jobs are not single rate jobs, such “higher rate of pay” will be the rate which would be paid the employee if he/she was promoted to it.
(b)	For jobs carrying a lower rate of pay, such lower rate of pay applicable to such other job shall not apply.
(c)	Employees normally work within their classification. However, employees are expected to perform any assigned work for which they are qualified by such training or experience as is necessary for the assignment.

Such changes will be considered temporary for their working days after the Union will be notified within a week of the date a change is approved by the President or his/her designated representative. Such changes will be considered temporary for thirty working days after the Union is notified.
