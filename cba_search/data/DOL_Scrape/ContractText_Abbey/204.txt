OCCUPATIONAL REQUEST PROCEDURE
In order to provide a uniform method for employees to make known to the Company those jobs they are interested in for promotion within their respective departments, the following procedure will be followed.
54
The Human Resources Department will maintain a computer listing, by department and job title, of all jobs within the plant In order to receive consideration on a specific job, an employee will complete an Occupational Request Form and turn it in to any Human Resources Department employee. The Human Resources Department employee will sign and date the Request and the employee will retain one copy of the verified form for his records.
When an opening occurs in a job in the employee’s department, it will be awarded to the most senior employee within the department who has submitted a request for the job, provided such employee’s request was received in the Human Resources Department by 7:00 a.m, on the Monday proceeding the day the schedule is filled out in the department.
In the event no employee within the department has submitted a timely request for the opening, the job will be awarded to the most senior employee who has signed a Transfer Request for that department by 7:00 a.m. on the Monday proceeding the day the schedule is filled out in the department
If an employee is not working due to occupational or non-occupational illness or injury, or is on regular vacation and does not return to work prior to the date that an employee is awarded the opening, the employee first entitled but not available will be given no further consideration, until the next permanent opening occurs. However, if the employee first entitled but not available returns to work within 30 work days he will be entitled to the promotion and the other employee removed with no credit being accumulated in his behalf.
If an employee declines to accept a job for which he has made an occupational or departmental transfer request, he shall not be allowed to again request consideration for that job or department for a three month period.
It is agreed between the Company and the Union that the only way such a system can work property is to limit those requests to employees having a sincere desire for consideration on a job. To do otherwise would defeat the purpose of this program. Thus an employee may sign for consideration on a maximum of three permanent jobs at any given time. Both parties pledge their support to this principle.
The Company further agrees to make a good faith effort to post Expansion jobs for employee’s informational purposes only. Failure to
55
do so will not result in a grievable offense.

ASF Small Parts
Small Parts shall consist of all finishing operations of small parts currently performed in what is called the side frame building, # 1 floor Molding and associated small parts finishing done on one floor or 19 track. Should the work be performed elsewhere within the facility, the union will be notified.

Employees transferring to ASF Small Parts will be subject to the wages and work rules that have been established for Small Parts. Employees transferring will retain their current seniority date, benefits and pension vesting rights. However, such employees will be unable to exercise their transfer rights to return to the Large Part operation for a minimum of one year from the effective date of each transfer in. The event of a downturn in business of the ASF Small Parts Plant, any current employee who has transferred there from Large Parts will be permitted to use their present seniority to bump back into Large Part production and finishing,
An employee hired as a Small Parts employee may not request a transfer to Large Parts until completion of 1 year of service. The maximum number of transfers or eligible employees from small parts to large parts per month shall be one (1) employee from 1 floor and two (2) from finishing.
Should Large Part production fall below 120 pieces per day, bargaining unit employees in the employment of the Company as of January 1, 1997, may exercise his plant seniority to bump into ASF Small Parts provided the following criteria is met:
1)	Employee must be actively working at the time big parts production falls below
2)	Employee must hold bumping rights on occupation(s) where the main function of the occupation is essentially the same as the one to which he is bumping.
However, if an employee gains seniority on a job by working in Small Parts for one year he may use that seniority for bumping purposes in accordance with the current contract language.
Large Part employees who transfer to Small Parts under the above provisions will be considered as “temporary” employees and, as such, will acquire no seniority in Small Parts. Such employees must return to Large Parts in the event they are recalled.
73

(Example: Costs are $.50/hour worked. Employee worked 2,000 hours - employee receive 2000 X $.50= $1,000).
To be eligible, an employee must be on the payroll as of December of the calendar year for which the dividend is being paid.
