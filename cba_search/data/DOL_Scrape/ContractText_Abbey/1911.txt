This letter will continue the understanding that the parties reached during the negotiation of this collective bargaining agreement between the New York City School Construction Authority ("AUTHORITY") and DC 37 covering employees in Unit B concerning provisions for the implementation of civil service law with respect to layoffs, and the applicability of disciplinary procedures.
In recognition that the AUTHORITYis in a period of transition toward a system of filling positions where appropriatOrthrough competitive civil service examinations and that many long-term employees currently serve, in their positions, only provisionally, the parties, have agreed that the following provisions will apply during the transition period to employees who are on the payroll on the date of execution of this Agreement, with respect to each title or position in Unit B covered by the collective bargaining agreement.
These provisions shall be effective from the date of the execution of the collective bargaining agreementuntil such time as initial competitive examinations have been given and appointments have been made for each respective title. The provisions of this side letter shall be subject to review by the parties at the request of either party upon the reopening or expiration of the collective bargaining agreement-
layoffs
Layoffs will be administered in accordance with New York State Civil Service Law, the Public Authorities Law Section 1737, and shall be subject to the
provisions of Article XVIII of the collective bargaining agreement. However, where positions are abolished or reduced prior to the date that initial examinations have been given and permanent appointments are made with respect to any title or position in Unit B covered by the collective bargaining agreement, incumbents holding the same or similar positions who are serving in their positions only provisionally shall be suspended or demoted, es the case may be, prior to the suspension or demotion of any incumbents who are serving in their positions permanently. Additionally, incumbents serving in positions provisionally shall be suspended or. demoted, as'the case may. be, in inverse order of seniority measured from their first date of employment with the AUTHORITY.
Once initial examinations have been given and permanent appointments are made in a particular title, any • necessary abolition’or reduction in positions will be administered acdording to Civil-Service Law and the Public Authorities Law.
A union-management committee, shall be established to review and resolve technical problems concerning procedures, consistent with applicable law, which may be utilized if layoffs occur.
Disciplinary Procedures
Employees who have been appointed to a position from a civil service list and who have already served in the same title for 1 2 months at the time of their appointment will, upon appointment from the list, be subject to a probationary period, as'prdvided in the SC A.Civil Service Rules; however, such employees have the'right to utilize disciplinary due process rights provided by Section 4, Article XX of this Agreement. '
In addition, employees who have served in a particular title provisionally for more than one year but less than two years at the time of the execution of the collective bargaining agreement shall have the right to utilize the disciplinary due process rights provided'by Section 4, Article XX of this Agreement.
The transitional layoff procedures, including the calculation of seniority, and disciplinary due process rights described above do not apply to the removal of provisionals as a result of action of a civil service list. Once an exam has been given, these transitional layoff procedures including the calculation of seniority and disciplinary due process, rights expire and do not carry over to any subsequent provisional appointment either in the same or another title.
Sincerely,	...	.
