HEALTH AND CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
Within the funding of the plan, the Trustees will implement Integrated Health and Care Management Programs with the goal of both improving participant health and decreasing health-care costs and cost trends over time. The cost of the Health and Care Management Programs will be no more than the projected savings over a reasonable period of time. The programs shall be designed to progress over the term of the Agreement to “best-in-class” levels with respect to the key characteristics listed below:
$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $	Quality education campaign for all participants Superior participant communications, including robust web tools Superior participant information tools Analytic measuring participation, compliance, and results Very strong comprehensiveness of programs High levels of integration Strong physician behavior-change mechanisms Significant levels of medical and drug trend reduction
Such programs may include, but are not limited to:
1.	Establish a health-risk assessment questionnaire to be completed during Annual Enrollment. If employee (and spouse where applicable) completes the HRQ during enrollment, an incentive amount as previously proposed will be added to the HRA account. During the term of this Agreement, the Trustees may, by mutual agreement, reallocate the HRA incentive amounts. Any disagreement will not be subject to binding -------arbitration^ ■
2.	A 24-hour nurse call-in line and/or medical decision support.
3.	A medical management program that targets high-risk participants with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. In order to encourage participant engagement in such programs and to enhance the goal of improving health status, a series of incentives must be developed.
There is recognition that incentives may take various forms and will likely evolve and change over time based on program experience with a goal of maximizing program effectiveness and reducing health costs and medical trend. The initial focus will be a thorough educational campaign in connection with program roll out.
4.	Free and/or reduced cost educational programs such as:
a.	Weight management
b.	Smoking cessation
c.	High cholesterol management
5.	Reduce prescription drug co-pays as shown below for participants taking maintenance drugs (and related supplies which require a prescription) for certain disease states which would include categories of drugs such as:

It is understood that the Plan’s consultants will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of including these scheduled drug categories on Plan costs and based on their recommendations the Trustees may remove drugs from this list and/or add other categories of drugs consistent with the objective of increasing compliance with prescribed drug therapies which will lower plan costs and trend.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN UFCW Locals 5, 8 and 101 AND SAFEWAY INC.
MEAT EXTRAS
A Meat Extra employee will be considered an ongoing employee of the Company. After being initially set up in the Company’s computer system, such an employee need not complete an application for employment, an I-9 form, or other pre-hire paperwork prior to being scheduled to work thereafter at a different store of the Employer. Such an employee will be issued, and may retain until termination, an employee identification card which must be used for the purpose of clocking in and out of a store’s payroll computer in the same manner as other regular employees. Such an employee shall be entitled to the benefits in the Agreement for Extra Employees and shall not accumulate seniority except as provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. An employee’s status as an ongoing employee shall be considered to be terminated only upon the employee’s inclusion in the list of employees who are not to be dispatched, the provision of written notice by the Company to the employee of the employee’s termination of employment, octhe. employee's provision of written notice of resignation to the Company’s Human Resources Department.
Meat Extras shall be paid on the same schedule as all other employees of the Company and their regular weekly check will be sent to their home store for pick-up unless the employee has signed up for direct deposit. At the request of the employee, the Company agrees it will allow the employee to change their home store designation so that the employee can pick up their check at a more convenient location. In the event the employee does not receive their weekly paycheck on the next normal payday, it shall then be the employee’s obligation to immediately notify both their home Store Manager and the Union. If the employee has properly recorded their work time at the store, upon notification from the Union that the employee did not receive their normal weekly paycheck, the Company shall then issue the employee’s paycheck within three (3) business days of receipt of notification from the Union.
After one (1) year, either Party shall have the right to cancel this Letter of Understanding. In such event, the language in the Parties’ 2004-2007 Collective Bargaining Agreement shall apply.

LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
1.	HRA: The Parties direct the Trustees to implement Health Reimbursement Accounts, with details as agreed to in these 2007 Safeway negotiations, no later than January 1, 2009.
2.	Merger of the Meat and Grocery Agreements: The Parties have agreed in concept to merge their respective Meat and Grocery Agreements into one contract. However, due to the time needed to fully discuss and properly complete this process, the Parties have agreed to continue their discussion regarding the merger of these Agreements after ratification.
3.	HMO Cost Containment Review: The bargaining Parties agree to direct the Trustees to periodically solicit competitive bids from a number of HMOs, with the objective that such HMO premiums would be reasonably close to the monthly cost of the Trust’s indemnity plan (taking into account demographic differences that currently exist between the indemnity and HMO plans). It is understood that in implementing this procedure, the Trustees retain their discretion to determine which HMOs shall be solicited for bids as well as the time frame and manner in which such parity is ultimately achieved. It is noted that a factor in determining whether an HMO will be invited to bid is their willingness to provide sufficient data to properly analyze the rating and underwriting methodology.
3a. Trustee Letter Only: Notwithstanding the HMO cost containment review side letter, it is understood that this side letter is not intended to alter the current HMO plan design without the mutual agreement of both Union and Employer Trustees.
4.	Retiree Health and Welfare: The bargaining Parties agree to direct the Trustees to establish a subcommittee of the Trust for the purpose of redesigning the current retiree Health and Welfare Plan. The Trustees shall establish the specific goals, objectives, and parameters of the subcommittee’s work. This subcommittee shall be directed to complete their redesign work no later than June 30, 2008, with the intention to implement the redesigned plan no later than January 1, 2009. The Trustees shall further establish a procedure for submitting any unresolved issues of this redesign to binding arbitration, in accordance with the goals, objectives, and parameters mutually agreed to by the Trustees, with such arbitration to be held in a time frame which will still accomplish the implementation of the redesigned plan no later than January 1, 2009.
5.	“Super Card”: Safeway agrees to meet with the Unions following these negotiations to consider any lawful arrangement which would permit the establishment of this card.
