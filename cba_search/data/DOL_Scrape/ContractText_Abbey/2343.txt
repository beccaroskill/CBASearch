AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the 1st day of June, 2015, by and between HOST INTERNATIONAL, INC. at McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada (hereinafter, called the “Employer”) and its successors and assigns and the LOCAL JOINT EXECUTIVE BOARD OF LAS VEGAS, for and on behalf of CULINARY WORKERS UNION, LOCAL 226, and BARTENDERS UNION, LOCAL 165 (hereinafter, called the “Union”).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the parties have, by negotiations and collective bargaining, reached complete agreement on wages, hours of work, working conditions and other related, negotiable subjects to be incorporated into a new Labor Agreement which shall supersede all previous verbal or written agreements applicable to the employees in the bargaining unit defined herein which may have existed between the Employer and the Union or between the predecessor of the Employer, if any, and the predecessor of the Union, if any.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing the execution of this Agreement and the full and faithful performance of the covenants, representations and warranties contained herein, it is mutually agreed as follows:
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT COVERAGES
1.01. Recognition of the Union.
The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the Employer’s retail food and beverage employees working in the Airport Division at McCarran International Airport under the Union’s jurisdiction and working in those job classifications listed in Exhibit 1 attached to and made a part of this Agreement. The Employer and the Union agree that all employees working in classifications listed in that Exhibit are properly within the bargaining unit. Any classification in the Airport Division retail food and beverage units operated by file Employer at McCarran International Airport established by the Employer and not listed in Exhibit 1, where the employees perform duties covered by this Agreement, shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate to be negotiated between the Union and the Employer. Excluded from the bargaining unit are office clerical, confidential employees, clerical employees, maintenance employees not performing porter’s work and guards, managers and supervisors as defined by the National Labor Relations Act of 1947 as amended which classifications shall perform no bargaining unit work except such occasional work as is reasonably connected with or incidental to the proper and orderly conduct of the operations they are performing.
ARTICLE 2	- HIRING OF EMPLOYEES
2.01. Hiring Procedure.
Whenever the Employer finds it necessary to hire new employees for those classifications covered by this Agreement, it may recruit and procure applicants from any source.
At its sole option, the Employer may notify the Union who shall assist the Employer in obtaining applicants who meet the qualifications required by the Employer. When applicable, the Union’s
1
Host International, Inc.
selection of applicants for referral shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis, and shall not be based upon or in any way affected by membership in the Union or the Union's bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspects or obligations of Union membership, policies, or requirements, or upon an applicant's race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin, actual or perceived disability or a history of disability.
The Employer shall be the sole judge of an applicant's suitability, competence and qualifications to perform the work of any job to be filled. The Employer may accept or reject any applicant for employment, in accordance with applicable laws.
When the Employer considers applicants for employment who have not been referred to the Employer by the Union's dispatch office, the Employer shall, in order to maintain a consistent and orderly process, advise such applicants that in order to obtain employment they must be dispatched for available positions. The Union's referral service shall send applicants named by the Employer directly back to the Employer. The Union will process these applicants within four (4) hours during which the Union’s referral service is open for business. Such applicants named by the Employer shall be processed by the service without any discrimination. Any applicant named by the Employer shall be permitted by the Union's referral service to register in the same manner as others. This process shall be effective January 1, 2018 with a review of the process no later than January 1, 2019. If there are any problems with processing of applicants, the parties will review such problems and make such changes as may be necessary.
2.02. No Individual Contracts.
No employee covered by this Agreement shall be compelled or allowed to enter into any individual contract or agreement with the Employer, concerning conditions of employment which varies the terms or conditions of employment contained in the Agreement.
2.03. Hiring of Bartenders.
The Employer agrees that all Bartenders hired by the Employer shall have completed the Local 165 Joint Apprenticeship Training Program, and passed the craft exam related to that program, so long as in the Employer’s sole judgment this results in a sufficient supply of best qualified candidates. Notwithstanding the above, current Bartenders, and future Bartender transfers from other Host locations with a minimum of one year experience as a Bartender, are exempt from this requirement. HMS Host will provide documentation to verify the one year experience and will post the Union Craft Card as a requirement on all job postings. The Union shall indemnify, defend and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability including attorney’s fees, that may arise out of or by reason of action taken by the Employer in abiding by the terms of this paragraph.
ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY
3.01, Check-Off.
The check-off agreement and system heretofore entered into and established by the Employer and the Union for the check-off of Union dues by voluntary authorization, as set forth in Exhibit 2, attached to and made a part of this Agreement, shall be continued in effect for the term of this Agreement.
2
Host International, Inc.
3.02, Indemnification.
The Union will indemnify and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands or other forms of liability which may arise out of, or by reason of, any action taken or not taken by the Employer, at the request of the Union, in accordance with the provisions of this article.
ARTICLE 4	- UNION REPRESENTATIVES
4.01. Union Visitation.
(a)	Authorized representatives of the Union shall be permitted to visit the Employer’s establishment for the purpose of communicating with employees and supervisors regarding Union business and collecting Union dues, assessments and initiation fees.

Union representatives will be required to report to the designated office to sign in and wear identification while on the premises of the Employer.
(b)	Representatives of employees benefit plans or voluntary benefit programs sponsored by the Union or Culinary Workers Union Local 226 or Bartenders Union Local 165 or of any financial institution owned by affiliates of the Union shall be permitted to visit the Employer’s establishment for the purpose of educating bargaining unit employees about and enrolling them in the offerings of such plans, programs or financial institutions. Such visits may be limited by the Employer to a maximum of thirty (30) days in any calendar year which may but need not be continuous. The Union’s designated representatives shall not interfere with the conduct of the Employer’s business or with the performance of work by employees during their work hours. Such visits shall be scheduled with the Employer at least 30 days in advance and shall take place in such non-working, non-public areas as the Union and the Employer may mutually agree, provided that any disagreement shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to this Agreement under a standard of reasonable accommodation of the Employer’s business needs with the Union’s needs to communicate to employees about available benefits.
4.02, Bulletin Boards.
The Employer will provide the Union with space on their existing bulletin board for up to two (2) 8-/2” x 11” Union notices. The notices must be legitimate Las Vegas Joint Board Union business, affecting HMSHost employees. Prior to posting, the Union will provide a copy of notices to management.

Trained Union Stewards may act as Union representatives, or may assist Union representatives in proceedings under Article 18 (Grievance and Arbitration), and die discussion with the Employer’s designated representative of questions or concerns regarding the Employer’s work practices and procedures, provided that a designated Union official provides the Union Steward and the Employer’s designated representative with specific written authorization permitting the Union Steward to engage in such activity. The Steward shall not engage in the authorized activities described above on paid work time, unless the Employer’s designated representative provides specific authorization to the Union Steward. No employee shall participate in non-work meetings, discussions or other activities with the Steward while the employee is on paid work time, unless the Employer’s
3
Host International, Inc.
designated representative agrees that the employee attend on paid work time. Stewards engaged in activities authorized by the Union shall comply with the obligations imposed upon authorized Union representatives by Article 4 of this Agreement.
4.04. Employee Information.

(a)	By the tenth (10th) day of each month, a list of all employees hired into the bargaining unit or transferred into the bargaining unit during the preceding month, including each employee’s name, social security number, address, phone number, department, job title, gender, hire date, Article 10 category, and date of birth.
(b)	By the tenth (10th) day of each month, a list of all bargaining unit employees terminated, placed on leave of absence or transferred out of the bargaining unit during the preceding month including each employee’s name, social security number, the reason for any termination, leave of absence, or-transfer, the date(s) of any such personnel transactions, and the expected date of return for leaves of absence.
(c)	The reports described in subsections (a) and (b) shall be sent to the Union by encrypted email or uploaded to the union’s secured website.
(d)	The Employer shall furnish the Union upon request but not more than semi-annually with a list of all employees in the bargaining unit, including each employee’s name, Social Security number, department, job title, home address, phone number, and date of hire, date of birth, date of hire, gender, and ethnicity. Data regarding employee ethnicity will not be shared with any person, media or entity outside the Union and employee benefit funds.

This report shall be in an Excel spreadsheet or in a formatted text format like .csv, containing header information, in electronic form in any one of the following media:
1.	Downloaded by the Union from the Company’s FTP site;
2.	Uploaded by the Company to the Union’s FTP site;
3.	CD ROM
4.	Via e-mail transmission.
ARTICLE 5-WAGES
5.01. Weekly Payment.
All wages of regular employees shall be paid on a bi-weekly basis; if the Employer changes to a weekly payroll, the Union shall be notified.
5.02. Gratuities.
All gratuities left by customers are the property of the employees exclusively, and no Employer or department heads not covered by this Agreement shall take any part of such gratuities or credit the same in any manner toward the payment of an employee’s wages. Employees shall not be required
4
Host International, Inc.
to divide their gratuities with any person, except as provided otherwise in the Agreement. The Employer shall not post or display notices restricting gratuities.
5.03. Terminated Employees.
Employees who are discharged and/or who resign shall be paid in accordance with applicable laws.
5.04. Delinquencies.
If any Employer becomes delinquent in the payment of wages or is operating in receivership by the Board of Trade of a creditors’ committee, or in the case of liquidation or bankruptcy, all salaries accrued become due and must be paid at once. In such cases die Union reserves the right at any time to demand and receive daily payment of wages to all employees, provided that by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union such wages due may be deposited in an approved escrow.
5.05. Deductions and Donations.
(a)	No employees shall be required to subscribe to any form of insurance or to make contributions or suffer any deductions from wages without written authorization of such employee, except as may be required by law.
(b)	There shall be no automatic cash deductions from an employee’s wages for any cash shortage until after consultation with the employee and the responsibility for the shortage has been established by the Employer, provided, however, that prior to any such deductions the employee may have the Union review the case with the Employer. When any said deduction is permitted under the preceding sentence, then, in no event shall the deduction be delayed beyond the latter of five (5) days or the next pay check due after the employee is notified of the days or the next pay check due after the employee is notified of the intent to deduct. The Employer shall notify an employee in writing immediately after its determination that a cash shortage in accordance with the preceding sentence exists unless the matter is otherwise resolved.
5.06. Superior Workperson.
The wage scales in this Agreement are minimum scales and do not prohibit the Employer from paying higher wages. It is specifically agreed that employees compensated at said higher wage rates may be returned to the scales published herein at the sole discretion of the Employer. Employees paid Superior Workmen rates shall have their wages increased by amounts of not less than the increases in the minimum wages scales as specified in Exhibit 1, attached to and made part of this Agreement, for the classifications in which they are employed, provided that the Employer is not required to pay such increases to employees earning Superior Workmen rates that already equal or exceed the applicable minimum wage scales as specified in Exhibit 1.
5.07. Combination Jobs.
When an employee works in two or more job classifications in any day, he/she shall be paid for that day at the rate of pay for the highest classification, provided that this shall not apply in cases of relief for meal and rest periods. Where an employee works in more than one job classification during his/her shift, excluding meal and rest period relief, he/she shall be paid the highest of the classification rates in which he/she works for all time worked in excess of two (2) hours in a higherrated classification. An employee assigned to a higher paid job classification shall not be required
5
Host International, Inc.
regularly to perform the work of employees assigned to a lower paid classification; provided, however, that the above shall not prevent an employee in a higher paid classification from performing work incidental to his/her own job which has historically been done by employees in such classification, even though such work may also be performed regularly by employees in lower paid classifications.
5.08. Equal Pay*
The wage scales set forth in Exhibit 1 shall apply equally to male and female employees covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 6	- DISCIPLINE
6.01. Cause For Discharge.
(a)	No employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 17.01, shall be discharged except for just cause. An employee may be discharged without prior warning for dishonesty, willfill misconduct, drunkenness, drinking alcohol during working hours on the job, being under the influence of an unlawful controlled substance during working hours on duty, unlawful possession of a controlled substance during working hours, or using a controlled substance at any time while on the Employer’s premises, unlawful sale of a controlled substance, refusing to submit to testing for drug or alcohol usage as provided in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.01(b) of this Agreement, serious improper behavior or discourtesy toward a customer, guest, manager, or coworker, insubordination, failure to report for work without just cause, walking off the job during a shift, fighting, sleeping on the job or willful and malicious destruction of Employer’s property. The above provisions relating to controlled substances will not apply to medicine lawfully prescribed for the employee using the substance by a licensed physician and used in accordance with the prescription. Prior to any discharge for any other reason, an employee must be given a written warning and reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiency. Upon the discharge of any employee for reasons other than dishonesty, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee in writing. When an employee is discharged or suspended for willful misconduct, the notice shall contain the specific conduct or offense deemed by the Employer to constitute willful misconduct Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in making the discharge or suspension, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or the Employer's own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within five (5) working days after such request The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for discharge of the Employee. An employee may not be discharged solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. The Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of its inquiry to guests and of the guests* responses to any Union inquiry within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt Copies of videotapes relied upon by the Employer for any suspensions or discharges shall also be provided upon request, provided the Employer has the copying capability and if the Union pays the reasonable costs for furnishing the copy.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid
6
Host International, Inc.
for all time required for the examination. There is an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol where his or her blood alcohol level meets or exceeds the legal presumption of intoxication recognized by the State ofNevada. A positive GC/MS blood test result for a controlled substance provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of the identified controlled substance..
(c)	Employees with less than three (3) years' service may be offered before, after, or at any time during the grievance process two (2) months' pay including the higher of declared or assigned tips in lieu of processing a grievance and arbitrating the discharge. In the event the employee declines this offer when made by the Employer, the Union will not arbitrate the discharge unless it objectively determines that, in its judgment, the discharge constituted a flagrant miscarriage of justice. In the event a positive determination is made, and the Union processes the discharge to arbitration, the arbitration procedure to be used, i.e., either type of expedited procedure or the regular arbitration procedure, shall be determined by the Employer notwithstanding the provisions of Section 18.03.
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter, but in any event, warning notices shall be issued to employees only at the beginning or end of a shift. Due to the Airport Authority’s Mandate on security and security breaches resulting in the closure of security check point, employees having reported on time but delayed by the security breach will not lead to disciplinary action for the purpose of tardiness. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in issuing the warning notice, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer’s own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for the warning notice. An employee may not be issued a warning notice solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer’s own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action. Employees shall be required to sign all notices for the purpose of acknowledging receipt.
6.03. Time of Discharge.
No employee shall be discharged or laid off on his/her day off or while on vacation or leave of absence.
6.04. Disciplinary Suspension.
No employee shall be suspended or laid off or have his/her shift, station or days off changed for discriminatory reasons, or for disciplinary purposes unless a prior written warning has been given the employee except where the suspension is for one of the enumerated causes for discharge. All suspensions shall be for reasonable periods under the circumstances of each case. An employee may not be given a disciplinary suspension solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers.
7
Host International, Inc.
Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.05. Mitigation of Damages.
Any employee covered by this Agreement who is discharged by the Employer and who disputes his/her discharge was for just cause shall have an affirmative duty to mitigate any potential damages which might result to the Employer in the event the discharge involved is subject to Article 18 - Grievance and Arbitration and an arbitrator overrules the discharge. In any dispute over the amount of back pay due to an employee under an arbitration award, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award any back pay to that employee for any period of time since his/her discharge unless it is reasonable to do so taking in to account the efforts by the employee to fulfill his/her duty to mitigate damages with respect to that period of time.
ARTICLE 7	- REPORTING PAY
7.01. Reasons for Payment
When the Employer or his/her representative orders an employee to report for work, or fails to notify an employee not to report for work as previously scheduled, for any reasons, and said employee is not allowed to work, the Employer shall pay the employee at the employee’s regular rate of pay for his/her scheduled shift, provided, however, that where an employee is sent home because of airline operations beyond the Employer’s control, the employee shall be paid for the hours actually worked or four (4) hours, whichever is greater.
7.02. Discharged Employees.
Employees who are discharged must be notified not later than the end of their shift, except in cases of discharge for dishonesty discovered by the Employer after the end of the shift. If this is not done and the employee reports for work on his/her next regularly scheduled shift and is not allowed to work, he/she shall be paid for the scheduled shift.
7.03. Early Shift Release.
Employees shall not be required by the Employer to leave work before the end of a scheduled shift on which the employees have commenced work; provided that this section shall not be construed to prohibit an employee, with the Employer’s approval, from voluntarily leaving work early if he/she so desires and being paid only for the time actually worked on that shift.

The above probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union. An employee in probation with the Employer shall not be eligible for promotions nor preference for bidding.
17.0	2. Definition of Seniority.
(a)	House seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months an days from the employees most recent date of hire into the bargaining unit as a regular or steady extra employee by the Employer.
23
Host International, Inc.
(b)	Classification seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee’s most recent date of hire into or transfer into his/her present classification on a frill-time basis.
(c)	In the administration of this Agreement, each of the classifications listed in Exhibit 1 is a separate and distinct classification.
17.03. Layoffs and Recalls.
(a)	In the event of layoffs due to a reduction in force, probationary employees within the affected classification(s) will be the first to be laid off. Employees will be laid off from and recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with their house seniority, provided they have the qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work available in their regular job classification. It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In accordance with their seniority, employees in layoff status will be offered, but not required to perform (subject to subparagraph {c}), all extra work in their classifications before extra employees are hired, before steady extra employees are offered such work, and to the extent practical, before regular employees are assigned to work their sixth (6th) day; provided, however, that such employees who are offered and accept extra work shall be paid as extra employees for such work in accordance with Section 10.05, but shall not be covered by the provisions of Section 9.03.
(b)	In the event of a layoff because of circumstances affecting only a portion of the establishment, the affected employees may be laid off without regard to house seniority, provided the layoff is scheduled to be seven (7) days or less.
(c)	Employees to be laid off in accordance with Section 17.03(a) may be laid off without regard to their respective house seniority as each completes his/her current workweek. At the time of layoff, the employee shall state availability or nonavailability for extra work; where the employee indicates availability, the employee shall not be called for extra work after he/she refuses two (2) out of seven (7) offers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee may declare unavailability for extra work for a definite period while on layoff.
17.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	When the Employer promotes an employee to another classification, the Employer will consider the employee’s seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in the other classification and prior performance. However, for die purpose of looking at prior performance, documented verbal coaching/counseling will not prohibit an employee from being considered in a promotional bid. Where skills and/or qualifications to perform die work in the other classification are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. Any employee before being promoted to the classification of Bartender, must have passed the craft examination for Bartenders conducted by the Union. For purposes of this paragraph a “promotion” shall be deemed to be a transfer to another classification in which the transferred employee has an opportunity for increased compensation or for subsequent job progression as a result of the transfer. Any permanent vacancy that is not filled pursuant to 17.04(b), and which would constitute a “promotion” compared to another bargaining unit classification, shall be filled in accordance with this Section, provided there is a qualified bidder. Permanent vacancies to be filled
24
Host International, Inc.
by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for ninety-six (96) hours at a central location in Human Resources, with copies of each shift being posted in a predesignated location in each terminal for notification purposes only. In order for any employee to be considered for a posted shift, they will be required to sign the original bid sheet posted in Human Resources. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period. An employee promoted under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which promoted shall be transferred back to his or her former job, shift and station within thirty (30) shifts worked after the date of the promotion.
(b)	When there is a permanent vacancy, or a temporary vacancy of at least ninety (90) days, on a particular shift or station, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or stations who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/or station applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the employee desiring to transfer. When an employee signs a classification shift bid and is awarded the shift after 7 days or sooner from when the shift is taken down, the employee who was awarded the shift will not be allowed to change his/her mind whether or not to accept the shift. The Employer shall transfer the employee to the vacancy as soon as possible but not to exceed 30 days. An employee transferred under this section shall not be eligible for another such transfer for six (6) months, except when an employee is displaced beyond the employer’s control (i.e. DOA, airlines, construction). An employee transferred under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which transferred shall be transferred back to his/her former shift and/or station within thirty (30) working days from the date of transfer. Only the first three vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or station who desires to work on the shift or station where the vacancy exists.
(c)	The Employer and the Union hereby explicitly adopt the "60% rule" in application of Article 17. Under this rule, an employee’s shift or station is deemed so changed as to be a new, vacant position when the shift or station is less than sixty percent (60%) of what it was before the change. Conversely, if the shift or station remains at least sixty percent (60%) of what it was before the change, the incumbent employee keeps the shift or station despite the change, and there is no bidding.
The Employer and the Union further explicitly agree that the 60% rule applies to changes from eight (8) hour to ten (10) hour shifts. Where, after the change, the shift is still at least sixty percent (60%) of what it was before the change, the incumbent employee who had the 8 hour shift is entitled to the new, ten (10) hour shift. If the new, ten (10) hour shift is less than sixty percent (60%) of the previous eight (8) hour shift, then it is considered to be new, vacant and subject to bid.
The “60% rule” will consider the workweek to be comprised of shifts that fall into three categories: “days”, “swing”, or “grave”. If shift changes retain 60% of an employee’s shifts in their respective “day,” “swing,” or grave” designation, the incumbent employee keeps the shift or station despite the change, and there is no bidding. If shift changes retain less than 60% of the employee’s shifts
25
Host International, Inc.
designation as existed prior to the changes, then it is subject to bid. For purposes of applying the 60% rule, shifts under this paragraph shall be define as follows:
Day
Culinary:	Any shift starting at or after 4:00 am
Bartender:	Any shift starting at or after 8:00 am
Swing:
Culinary:	Any shift starting at or after 1:00 pm
Bartender:	Any shift starting at or after 4:00 pm
Grave:
Culinary:	Any shift starting at or after 9:45 pm
Bartender:	Any shift starting at or after 12:00 am

(c)	The employee is absent exceeding the period of an authorized leave of absence, or is gainfully employed elsewhere during the leave.
(d)	The employee is absent, due to injury or illness sustained during the course of employment, exceeding the period for which statutory, temporary, total disability payments are payable under the State Industrial Insurance System, provided, that the employee shall have one (1) week after his/her written release from the State Industrial Insurance System in which to return to work.
(e)	The employee is absent because of layoff exceeding six (6) months if he/she had less than six (6) months of active employment when the layoff began, or absent because of layoff exceeding twelve (12) months if he/she had six (6) or more months of active employment.
(f)	The employee is absent exceeding six (6) months because of illness or injury not compensable under the State Industrial Insurance System if he/she had less than six (6) months of active employment when the absence began, or is absent exceeding twelve (12) months because of such illness or injury if he/she had six (6) months or more months of active employment when the absence began.
17.06. Notification.
An employee who is to be recalled to work by the Employer under Section 17.03 shall be notified to return to work by the Employer advising the employee by telephone, certified mail return receipt requested or other available means of communication of the date and time the employee is to report, and by confirming such communication by certified mail, return receipt requested to the employee’s current address of record on file with the Employer. A copy of the confirmation letter
26
Host International, Inc.
shall be sent to the Union. Reasonable advance notice must be given an employee being recalled.
