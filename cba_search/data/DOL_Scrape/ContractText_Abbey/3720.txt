THIS AGREEMENT, entered into this +0* day of December 3047 INSERT DATE between the CITY OF PEORIA. ILLINOIS (the Employer) and LOCAL 50 INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS, (the Union):
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the City has endorsed the practices and procedures of collective bargaining as a fair and orderly way of conducting its relations with certain of its full time employees insofar as such practices and procedures do not interfere with the City's right and obligation to operate effectively in order to best serve the City and its residents, and to make clear all basic terms upon which such relationship depends; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the Parties to set forth herein their agreement covering rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and all other conditions of employment; and to provide the procedure for the prompt and peaceful settlement of grievances respecting the terms of this Agreement;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the Parties do mutually promise and agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION
SECTION 1.1 - UNION RECOGNIZED: The City recognizes Local 50 of the I.A.F.F. as the exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of establishing the wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment, for all full time, permanent employees who are in the classification of Firefighter, Fire Engineer, Fire Captain, and Battalion Chief, but excluding Fire Division Chief Assistant Fire Chief, and Fire Chief. Newly established positions within the bargaining unit will be bargained to the extent required by law.
SECTION 1.2 - AUTHORITY OF BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES: It is agreed that bargaining unit employees holding positions with any supervisory authority and/or responsibility, and those bargaining unit employees who may from time-to-time temporarily serve in a higher non-bargaining unit position having such authority and/or responsibility, shall have no authority or power to bind the City in labor relations matters (including but not limited to the commission of acts constituting grievances, or the resolution of grievances filed) unless expressly authorized in advance to do so by the Fire Chief. It is further agreed that such employees' acts or failures to act shall not constitute, nor form the basis of unfair labor practice charges against the City, unless their actions or failures to act were expressly authorized in advance by the Fire Chief or his designee.
SECTION 1.3 - MUTUAL COOPERATION: There shall be established a joint Labor-Management Committee including four (4) members from the Employer and four (4) members from Local 50, with these members being selected and designated by the Employer and the Union, respectively. This committee shall meet regularly, the exact date(s) of which shall be mutually agreed upon by the two parties. This committee shall also meet at a mutually agreed upon time when the following issues are first known to the respective parties:
1.	Pre-Discipline
2.	Pre-Grievance
3.	New or revised rules, regulations, and SOG’s (Standard Operating Guidelines)
4.	Federal, State, and Local Government Mandates
5.	Injury Prevention Measures

FILE NO.17-112
Both parties to this agreement agree to attend at least one joint training program together for Labor-Management issues. At least one representative from both parties to the joint Labor-Management Committee shall attend.

ARTICLE 5 GRIEVANCE
SECTION 5.1	- DEFINITION: A grievance shall be defined as a dispute arising between the Parties concerning a violation or alleged violation of this Agreement, or concerning any documented past practice (see Appendix A), or disciplinary action taken by the City.
SECTION 5.2	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: The Union and/or any employee may file a grievance. It is the intention of both Parties to promptly address grievances and to settle disputes at the lowest possible level.
Oral Presentation: An employee, or an employee and his/her Steward, shall first attempt to resolve the grievance orally with the immediate Battalion Chief or equivalent supervisor within ten (10) days of the discipline or other type of event giving rise to the grievance. This Chief will attempt to resolve the dispute whenever possible and if not settled, stating reasons why settlement was not possible. Grievances settled at the oral level do not have precedent on future grievances.
Step One: If the grievant desires to further process the grievance, it shall be delivered in writing within ten (10) calendar days of the oral denial to the appropriate Fire Division Chief. Grievances shall be delivered on forms mutually developed and supplied by the City. The Fire Division Chief shall investigate the grievance and meet with the grievant and/or his representatives within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance. If the grievance is
4
FILE NO.17-112
not resolved, the Fire Division Chief shall issue his written answer to the grievant and his representatives within ten (10) calendar days of receipt ofthe grievance, including his reasons for denial.
Step Two: If the grievant desires to further process the grievance, the grievance may be referred in writing to the Fire Chief or his designee, who shall be a person different than the person who handled the Step One grievance, and who shall be of a rank equal to, or higher than, the Step One person, within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt ofthe Step One response. The Fire Chief or his designee shall meet with the grievant and/or his representatives within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance. If the grievance is not resolved, the Fire Chief or his designee shall issue his written answer to the grievant and his representatives within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the grievance, including his reasons for denial.
Step Three: Ifthe grievant desires to further process the grievance, the grievance may be referred in writing to the City Manager or his designee within ten (10) calendar days ofthe receipt ofthe Step Two response. The City Manager or his designee shall meet with the grievant and/or his representatives within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance. If the grievance is not resolved, the City Manager or his designee shall issue a written answer to the grievant and his representatives within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the grievance, including reasons for denial.
Step Four; If the grievance is not settled in Step Three, and the Union desires to refer the grievance to arbitration, it may do so by notifying the City Manager in writing within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the Step Three response.
SECTION 5.3 - EMPLOYEES' RIGHTS TO FILE GRIEVANCES: Nothing in this grievance procedure shall be construed as limiting the right of individual employees to file and process grievances without the intervention of the Union through Steps 1,2, and 3; provided, however, that only the Union shall have the right to refer grievances to arbitration (Step 4). In the event that an employee files a grievance without the intervention of the Union, the City shall provide the Union a copy thereof within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt. The Union shall be notified of all meetings concerning the grievance and be afforded an opportunity to be present. No settlement of such grievance shall be made if the same would be inconsistent with the terms of the Agreement between the City and the Union. Should the Union believe that a settlement of the grievance is inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, it shall have the right to file a grievance.
SECTION 5.4 - ARBITRATION: in the event that the Union elects to refer a grievance to arbitration, the representatives ofthe Parties shall meet within ten (10) days ofthe City’s receipt of notice of referral. At this meeting, the representatives shall determine ifthe need for post-hearing briefs can be avoided for the particular grievance arbitration. It is the general intent to reduce the time and cost of arbitration, and limiting the use of post-hearing briefs is seen as one method of meeting the intent of the Parties. Also, at the meeting, the Parties shall attempt to agree on an arbitrator. Absent an agreement on the grievance arbitrator, the Parties, by joint letter, shall request that the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) submit a panel list of seven (7) arbitrators who shall be members of the National Academy of Arbitrators. The representatives of the Parties shall meet within ten (10) days of their receipt ofthis list from FMCS and engage in a mutual striking process to select an arbitrator. Each Party shall have the right to reject one (1) entire list, provided such rejection occurs within five (5) days of the receipt of the list. The Parties shall alternately strike a name from the list until there is one (1) name remaining, with the order of striking to be determined by coin toss. The remaining name shall be the arbitrator.

The employee shall not be responsible for the costs of such training to achieve EMT-P certification. It is understood that other conditions such as injury, illness, and military service could interfere with a timely completion of the paramedic and PAEMS certification requirements. In such case, the Fire Chief shall review the facts provided in writing by such employee for an extension of the time period to meet such requirements, and shall respond to the employee within ten (10) regular work days or receipt of such written request.

SECTION 7.2	- MAINTENANCE OF EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES: Employees may be required to perform routine, minor maintenance duties with regard to firefighting equipment and apparatus, and minor station cleaning and housekeeping chores.
When situations exist that may cause a health hazard, the Fire Chief may ask the personnel of the Fire Department to correct those hazards (e.g. kitchen exhaust vents).

SECTION 7.3	- JURISDICTION OF OTHER LABOR GROUPS: No employee shall be required to perform duties or tasks which fall within the jurisdiction of other labor groups without first bargaining with the Union. If such bargaining does not result in agreement, the Union recognizes the City's right to timely assign these duties and tasks to bargaining unit members, and the City recognizes the Union's right to submit the issue of compensation for such duties and tasks to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedure specified in Article 5 (Grievance Procedure).

It is further understood that such service is for a temporary period or special event only and that the request for service by the outside group may have been instigated by the Fire Administration or City Codes. The foregoing shall not apply to what are commonly referred to as "mutual aid pacts” or Agreements between governmental bodies to reciprocally provide emergency fire related services to each other.
Unless changes are requested and posted in advance by the sponsoring organization, persons working such secondary employment must wear departmental uniforms and are subject to the rules and regulations in effect for on-duty personnel. The Union and management will set up a separate hire book for these requests.
SECTION 7.6 - TRAINING: The City agrees to make training opportunities available on an equitable basis to bargaining unit employees. The Employer may assign Fire personnel to shift/duty assignments to accomplish training. Employees shall be required to undergo reasonable and on-going training in all phases of their duties, including tower drills and hose testing. Alt classes required for promotion eligibility will be offered equitably to the employees. The Employer shall take all steps necessary to prevent accidents and/or injuries to employees during training exercises, and the Parties agree that no employee shall be disciplined for refusal to participate in a training exercise which creates a substantial risk of injury, beyond those risks normally inherent in the Fire service.

ARTICLE 8
EMPLOYEE TESTING AND FITNESS FOR DUTY
SECTION 8.1	- FITNESS FOR DUTY:
A. PHYSICAL & MENTAL FITNESS: It shall be the responsibility of each employee to maintain the standards of physical and mental fitness required for performing his job. Whenever the Fire Chief has just cause to suspect that the physical or mental condition of an employee is endangering his/her own health or the safety of fellow workers, the employee may be requested to submit to an examination by a physician without expense to the employee which shall only be for the purpose of determining his/her physical condition relative to City employment.
B.: PSYCHOLOGICAL, PSYCHIATRIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTING: No employee shall be requested or required to undergo psychological, psychiatric or physiological testing unless the Employer has just cause to believe the employee is then unfit for duty. The Employer shall set forth the basis for such just cause orally and in writing, to the employee at the time the employee is ordered to undergo such testing, including relevant objective facts and subjective reasoning that forms the basis for the Employer's belief that the employee is then unfit for duty, provided that written documentation of the basis for the order may be submitted within twenty-four (24) hours of the date of the order, if it is not practicable to do so at the time the order is issued. Employees shall have the right to Union representation, if a representative is available, when being informed of the need for testing, and shall have the right to secure similar testing at their own expense from psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians of their own choosing. The City and the employee shall only utilize the services of qualified, certified medical doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists. The employee shall be given a copy of any and all information, reports and opinions that are provided the City as a result of such testing. Employee’s fitness for duty shall be measured and determined by bona fide occupational qualifications.
SECTION 8.2	- DRUG AND ALCOHOL - POLICY - COMMITTEE:
A.	POLICY: The Parties recognize that drug and alcohol (substance abuse) problems are a fact of life in the workplace today. The Parties also recognize that the nature of the duties of firefighting may put some of these employees at higher than normal risk for such problems on occasion.
Therefore, it is the policy and commitment ofthe City and Local 50 to adopt an aggressive and proactive approach to the problem of substance abuse as it affects the lives and the working environment of all members ofthe Fire Department. The Parties recognize that the consensus of the professionals in the area is that substance abuse is an illness which is treatable. Therefore, the Parties commit themselves to developing a proactive program to identify members of the Department who may be suffering from the effects of substance abuse or who may be at high risk for such problems, and to put these members in touch with the healthcare providers or other appropriate resources to deal with these concerns at the earliest possible time. While the Parties recognize that discipline may be a necessary element in any substance abuse program, the emphasis and priorities of both Parties shall be to focus on education, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation as the primary strategy for dealing with substance abuse and related problems of members.
To implement this policy on a priority basis, the Parties mutually commit their time and resources to a Joint Labor Management Committee to be known as the Substance Abuse Prevention and Rehabilitation Committee.
B.	COMMITTEE:	The Parties commit themselves and pledge their respective resources to a Joint Labor
Management Committee to be known as the Substance Abuse Prevention and Rehabilitation Committee, whose mission it shall be to promptly develop, implement and maintain an aggressive, proactive program of education, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and maintenance of members of the Fire Department who are experiencing or at risk, for substance abuse and related problems.

COMMITTEE MAKEUP
The Committee shall be composed of two (2) Union representatives from Suppression and one (1) from 40-hour employees, and three (3) management employees representing a cross-section of Fire Department management and a representative ofthe Human Resources Department. The Committee will utilize one or more Substance Abuse Treatment professionals to act as a resource to the committee. The Fire Chief and the President of Local 50, or their designees, shall be Co-Chairs ofthe Committee. Each Party shall designate its members to the Committee not later than thirty (30) days after the signing of this Agreement.
COMMITTEE TRAINING
All members ofthe Substance Abuse Prevention and Rehabilitation Committee who have not previously received the two (2) day base line substance abuse awareness training course shall be enrolled in that course as soon as possible. The vendor for the base line training shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. Committee members shall receive ongoing training in areas such as: identification of at risk individuals, peer counseling, effective intervention, resources for referral, treatment programs, rehabilitation programs, maintenance and support programs, and updates on new developments on programs in the area of substance abuse and related problems. The Committee will receive annual training.
DEPARTMENT TRAINING
Mandatory department-wide training will be conducted concerning the effects of alcohol and drugs. Additional training for management, supervisory employees and Company officers will be provided as recommended by the Committee.
PEER COUNSELING/INTERVENTION
it shall be the responsibility of all Committee members to be alert for signs of possible substance abuse and related problems among the commissioned members ofthe Department with whom they come in contact or of whom they are made aware. The Committee members are not counselors and shall not undertake to do professional counseling, but shall, within the limits of their training, approach individuals who appear to be suffering from substance abuse and related problems or appear to be at high risk for such problems. Such actions might include encouraging the member to get in touch with the City’s EAP, Union Counselors, talk with other members who have experienced similar problems and successfully treated them, and who have volunteered to be available to such members, or to explain to the member the employment consequences that could result from failing to identify and treat such problems. Only with the advice of a healthcare professional and the assistance of other Committee members would Committee members participate in a formal intervention, but they should not hesitate to make such arrangements if that appears to be called for.
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES
The Committee shall meet not less than monthly, or as mutually agreed to, for training and discussion of procedures and programs that may be of benefit to the Department, to assist other groups in setting up similar programs, etc. The Fire Chief and the Union President shall be provided a copy of the minutes taken by the Committee at each meeting.
SECTION 8.3	- DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE - PROCEDURES - TESTING:
A.	Consistent to the requirements of the Federal Drug Free Workplace Act:
I.	Any employee who consumes, possesses or distributes alcohol or any controlled substance while in the workplace or while conducting City business shall be terminated from the employ of the City.
2.	Any employee who fails to notify the City within five (5) days after they are convicted of a criminal drug offense for a violation taking place in the workplace or while conducting City business, will be terminated.
3.	Any employee convicted of the manufacture, sale, or distribution of prohibited drugs, regardless of when or where that act takes place, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
10
FILE NO.17-112
4.	The Parties shall provide employees and supervisors with a positive program of drug and alcohol education and training which shall include information on the resources available for such a problem.
B.	Voluntary Referral:
It is specifically agreed that no employee shall be disciplined where the employee notifies the Employer that he has a problem with drug or alcohol use, and voluntarily seeks assistance prior to initiation of an investigation of suspected drug or alcohol abuse by the employee or pending discipline. Such employees shall be referred by the managerial employee who is notified to the City’s Employee Assistance Program for confidential counseling and treatment.
Such voluntary participation shall not confer immunity from discipline, for any misconduct attendant to the substance abuse. The managerial employee shall not divulge any information received from the employee who voluntarily seeks the help of the Employee Assistance Program, except on a strict need to know basis. Such voluntary referral to the Employee Assistance Program, however, does not relieve the employee from the responsibility to adequately perform their job. In addition, voluntary submittal does not eliminate the employee from the requirements to take required drug or alcohol tests as described in this Article.
C.	Drug and Alcohol Testing:
(1)	There shall be no random across the board or routine drug testing of employees, except as provided by Section 8.3.C.3 and Section 8.3.D of the Agreement. However, the City shall require any employee to submit to drug or alcohol testing when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol on duty. The existence of reasonable suspicion shall be determined according to the standard defined below. Where reasonable suspicion has been determined to exist, the City may order individual employees to submit to blood, breath, or urine tests to determine the presence of alcohol and/or drugs in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section.
a)	Reasonable Suspicion Standard. Reasonable suspicion exists if the facts and circumstances warrant a rational inference that a person is impaired by alcohol or controlled substances. Reasonable suspicion will be based upon the following:
1)	Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use and/or the physical symptoms of impairment by alcohol or controlled substances; or
2)	Information provided by an identifiable third party which is independently corroborated.
b)	Recall. The Parties recognize that employees may be placed in a conflict arising from the fact that employees are not prohibited from consuming alcohol or legal drugs while off duty, but are subject to emergency recall during off duty hours. Accordingly, when employees are notified of any emergency recall from off duty, the following procedure shall apply.
1)	The recalled employee shall advise the Department representative notifying him if he has consumed alcohol or legal drugs during the day of the emergency recall and the extent of such activity.
2)	The officer in charge of the recall shall assess the employee's condition and fitness for duty and either assign him to duty or, if the employee is determined to be unfit for duty, will not allow him to sign in for duty.
11
FILE NO.17-112
3)	Any employee who reports for the recall without informing the Department of his consumption of alcohol or legal drugs as required in paragraph 1 above, shall not be allowed to work if he appears to be impaired and shall not be paid for reporting.
(2)	The foregoing does not limit the City from ordering testing in the absence of reasonable suspicion in the following circumstances:
a)	Preemployment screening of applicants for employment to bargaining unit positions;
b)	Original probationary employees during the final thirty (30) days of their probationary period;
c)	Employees who have voluntarily requested referral to the City’s EAP program, in lieu of disciplinary action, upon completion of treatment;
d)	Employees who have been absent from duty due to any medical leave (including duty injury) for a period in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days;
e)	post-accident testing for any employee who was driving a City vehicle involved in an accident where death or injury occurred; where property damage in excess of five thousand dollars (S5.000) occurred; or where the employee was issued a citation for a moving violation.
(3)	in addition, the City shall have the right to order unannounced periodic tests for the presence of alcohol or illegal drugs of any employee involved in any of the following described incidents:
a)	Any incident in Part A of this Section
b)	Any use or possession of prohibited drugs, regardless of when or where that act takes place, that results in a criminal conviction
c)	Any confirmed positive test resulting from implementation of Part C(l)(a) or Part C(2)(c), (d) and (e) d) Any DUI (Driving under the influence) conviction.
The right to order such unannounced periodic tests as to such employee(s) shall be for a full one (1) year testing period subsequent to the date of the incident, conviction, or confirmed positive test result, whichever is applicable. Such unannounced periodic testing will cease after the one (1) year testing period, provided no filrther incidents, convictions, or confirmed positive test results occur during the one (1) year testing period. Any subsequent confirmed positive test result will subject such employee(s) to the applicable disciplinary action as provided in Part D of this section.
(4)	Employees ordered by the Fire Chief or, if he is unavailable, by the highest ranking Chief Officer who is available, to submit to drug and alcohol tests shall promptly comply with the order, whether or not they believe reasonable suspicion or other grounds for the order exists. Refusal to submit to such tests as provided for under this Article, shall subject the employee to immediate discharge. Employees who submit to such tests shall not be deemed to have waived or otherwise impaired their rights to grieve or otherwise contest any aspect of the testing as may be provided by law or this Agreement. The City shall present each employee, prior to issuing the order to test, this Agreement and the policy of the City concerning drug and alcohol abuse. Employees shall have the right to Union representation, if a representative is available, when being ordered to submit to drug or alcohol tests. Tests shall not be unreasonably delayed because of the absence of the Union representative.
(a) It being the desire of the Parties to protect the safety of the public and other employees, yet safeguard the rights of individual employees, the Parties agree that drug and alcohol testing shall be conducted as follows:
(i)	Use only a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) certified licensed clinical laboratory to test body fluids or materials for alcohol or drugs, and only a breath testing device and operator currently certified by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). All breath tests shall be done on a DOT certified breath analysis machine;
(ii)	Establish chain of custody procedures for both sample collection and testing that will ensure the integrity of and identity of each sample and test result;
12
FILE NO.17-112
(iii)	Collect a sufficient sample of the same body fluid or material to permit an initial screening, a confirmatory test, and a sufficient amount to be set aside and reserved for later testing, if requested by the employee;
(iv)	Collect all samples in such a manner as to preserve the individual employee's right to privacy, insure a high degree of security for the sample and its freedom from adulteration. Proper testing may be conducted to prevent the submission of a false or adulterated sample;
(v)	Confirm any body fluid sample that tests positive in the initial screening for alcohol or drugs by use of gas chromatography, with mass spectrometry or an equivalent scientifically accurate and accepted method that provides quantitative data about the detected alcohol or drug metabolites;
(vi)	Provide the employee tested with an opportunity to have an additional portion of the same sample tested by a licensed testing facility of his own choosing;
(vii)	Require that the clinical laboratory report to the designated Medical Review Officer (MRO) for the City positive results only in the case where both the initial and confirmatory test results are positive as to the same sample. Prior to the MRO reporting a positive test result to the City, he/she will discuss with the employee any valid medical reasons for a positive result;
(viii)	Provide each employee with a report of the confirmed positive results of each drug or alcohol test that includes the types of tests conducted, the results of each test, the detection level used by the laboratory, and any other information provided to the City by the laboratory.
(ix)	Where a positive result is confirmed, specimens shall be maintained in secured, refrigerated storage for at least a period of one hundred twenty (120) days to permit additional testing at the election of the employee.
(x)	If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration of 0.04% of alcohol or more in the employee's blood stream (blood alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grains of alcohol per 210 liters of breath), the employee will automatically be deemed "under the influence" of alcohol within the meaning of this policy, and therefore, shall be subject to discipline under this policy.
(xi)	The testing or processing phase for body fluids shall consist of a two (2) step procedure:
a.	Initial screening test.
b.	Confirmation test.
(xii)	The body fluid sample is first tested using the initial drug screening procedure. An initial positive test result will not be considered conclusive; rather, it will be classified as "confirmation pending." Notification of test results to the City shall be held until the confirmation test results are obtained.
(xiii)	A body fluid specimen testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. The confirmation procedure shall be technologically different and more sensitive than the initial screening test.
(xiv)	Personnel utilized for testing will be certified as qualified to collect samples or adequately trained in collection procedures.
(xv)	Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by S AMHSA for screening tests shall be considered a positive test result when using the initial immunoassay drug screening test. At the present time, these levels are:
INITIAL TEST
Level - Nanogram/Milliliter (hereafter referred to as ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite	50
Cocaine metabolite	300
Opiate metabolite	2000
Phencyclidine	25
Amphetamines	1000
Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for confirmatory tests shall be considered a positive test result when performing a confirmatory Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectophotomotry test on a urine specimen that tested positive using a technologically different initial screening method. At the present time, these levels are:

(4)	Test for 6-AM when morphine concentration exceeds 2000 nanograms/milliliter
(xvi)	Employees having a negative drug test result shall, upon request, receive a memorandum staling that no illegal drugs were found. If the employee requests such, a copy of the letter will be placed in the employee's personnel file.
(xvii)	Each step in the collecting and processing of the drug testing shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and the chain of custody.
(xviii)	All records pertaining to City-required drug tests shall remain confidential, and shall not be provided to other employers or agencies without written permission of the person whose records are sought or by a court order.
(xix)	If an employee is required to leave work to take a drug/alcohol test, the City will pay the employee for time lost from scheduled work for that day.
(5)	The Parties agree that there shall be no random, periodic, or mass testing of employees for alcohol or drugs, except as provided in Sections 8.3C.3 and 8.3D of this Agreement. Employees shall have the right to grieve the basis for the order to test, accuracy of the tests, the consequences of the test, or any alleged violation of this Agreement. Should a grievance concerning such testing be sustained, the arbitrator shall have the authority to fashion an appropriate remedy, including but not limited to expungement of records, a prohibition against using information concerning the test or results thereof in any future employment decision, and the posting of appropriate notices. It is understood that employees' legal rights that may exist outside this Agreement concerning drug and/or alcohol testing are not limited or in any manner abridged herein and they may pursue the same as provided by law, this Agreement notwithstanding. The City agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Union for and against any claims, demands, or any liability that may arise, reasonable costs and attorney’s fees included, as a result of any testing conducted by the City.
(6)	The drug tests obtained pursuant to this policy shall be confidential in nature, shall be solely for employment purposes, and shall not be utilized in any civil or criminal proceeding (unless required to be released pursuant to court order). The City agrees to maintain all records concerning drug or alcohol problems of its employees in the utmost confidence, releasing such information only upon the written authorization ofthe affected employee, upon proper court order or as otherwise required by law. The Union does not waive any rights of access to employee information that it might otherwise have by law.
D.	Disciplinary Action for Confirmed Positive:
1.	First Positive. The first confirmed positive test result will be cause for a three (3) shift day disciplinary suspension which penalty shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. The employee must agree to the following conditions: (1) the employee will be mandatorily referred to the City’s Employee Assistance Program for evaluation, diagnosis, and development of a treatment plan consistent with generally accepted standards; and (2) the employee will be
14
FILE NO.17-112
required to cooperate in the treatment plan, undergo unannounced periodic drug and/or alcohol screening for a period of up to twelve (12) months after completion of treatment, successfully complete the prescribed treatment, remain free of drug and alcohol use, and sign an agreement consenting to said conditions. Failure to comply with these conditions of continued employment shall be cause for discharge.
2.	Second Positive - During T reatment. if an employee has a first confirmed positive test under the previous paragraph 1 and enters a treatment program, and thereafter that employee has a subsequent confirmed positive test result while the employee is in treatment, as a result of unannounced periodic drug and/or alcohol screening, the employee shall receive a fifteen (15) shift day disciplinary suspension and shall be required to continue in treatment and comply with the other conditions of treatment set forth in the preceding paragraph, which fifteen (15) shift day disciplinary suspension shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

4.	Employment Status. There is no requirement on the part of the City to keep an employee on active employment status who is receiving treatment under this Section if it is appropriately determined (i.e., determination by an independent physician and/or appropriately certified medical and/or psychological professional) that the employee’s current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing his duties or whose continuance on active status would constitute a direct threat to the property and safety of others.

During current contract negotiations the City and the Union expressed a mutual desire to further investigate and continue discussion of the potential benefits of a Peer Fitness Trainer program similar to that sponsored by the 1AFF and IAFC. Additionally, the parties agreed to improve the nutritional counseling program to provide for better opportunities for group training and individualized counseling. It was understood that current budgetary constraints prohibit any implementation of either program, but that the parties would continue discussions to develop the framework and processes required for successful implementation should such budgetary funding become available in the future.
SECTION 8.5 - MEDICAL LIGHT DUTY: Commissioned Fire personnel may be granted a modified duty project in the event of a non-work related disability if all of the following exist:
- The employee presents a physicians evaluation report describing the illness or injury and the expected length of disability.
A modified duty project is available.
The employee is willing to submit to an examination conducted by a physician of the City's choice.
The employee is scheduled to return to full duty within six (6) months or less of the date of disability.
The employee must utilize ten (10) accrued days (vacation, personal leave, sick leave), if any accrued leave is available.
The employee will not be required to fall below a balance of one hundred twelve (112) hours of sick time.
The accrued time used begins with the first duty day lost due to the injury. After obtaining a release for Light Duty from the City’s physician, the employee must submit a written request for Light Duty on a Form 2 to the Fire Chief or his designee.
Modified duty will be granted once for each type of disability regardless of the length of time the first period of disability extended. A modified duty project will be assigned, if available, on a first come first serve basis. Specified modified duty projects will be determined by the Fire Chief in concurrence with the Personnel Department. The Personnel Department may require an evaluation by a physician ofthe City's choice to determine the type of duty an employee is capable of performing.
The City agrees to temporarily transfer a pregnant female firefighter to a less strenuous or hazardous position for the duration of her pregnancy if she so requests, with the advice of her physician, where that transfer can be reasonably accommodated.
The City of Peoria and the Peoria Firefighters Local 50 recognize there is some support for the physical and psychological recovery benefits of helping an injured/ill employee maintain as consistent a work environment as is both safe and practical. To that end, consideration will be given by the Fire Chief, or his designee, to an employee request to be assigned to modified duty projects on his regular shift, but the determination ofwhich shift (40 hour week or 24 hour Suppression shift) or when a modified duty project can be performed is solely the discretion ofthe Fire Chief, or his designee.
SECTION 8.6 - LOSS OF LICENSE: The Union and management do not condone driving under the influence of alcohol or prohibited drugs. A loss of license, regardless of cause, will result in at least a one (1) shift (3 days) suspension in accordance with Section 11.1 (d)-Definition of Days of Suspension, and more severe suspension may be assessed based on the severity and the facts surrounding the incident which caused the loss of license.

19
FILE NO.17-112
until such time as full driving privileges are legally restored or the individual is issued a Judicial Driving Permit allowing him/her to drive at work. While working under any driving restrictions due to a loss of license, including a Judicial Driving Permit, the individual will not be eligible to be hired back, trade time, or act out of rank for a period of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days or until full driving privileges are restored, whichever occurs first. Any loss of full driving privileges that exceeds one hundred twenty (120) calendar days but is less than four hundred fifty (450) calendar days shall result in the employee being placed on administrative leave without pay until full driving privileges are restored. Should the loss of full driving privileges equal or exceed four hundred fifty (450) calendar days the employee may be terminated from employment with the City. The Chief of the department will take into consideration the employee's work reports, attendance, and any other information relevant regarding the employee's previous performance as a city employee.
For the purposes of Section, "full driving privileges" shall be interpreted as "the absence of any judicial or Secretary of State imposed driving restrictions".
it is further agreed that individuals who have their license suspended are to immediately notify, in writing, the Fire Division Executive of the division to which the employee is assigned. If it is discovered that an individual has had a loss of license without having properly notified the Department, this procedure is not available to the employee and disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, may result.

E.	BATTALION ASSIGNMENTS: For Battalion Chiefs assigned to Suppression, battalion assignments on each shift shall be granted on the basis of time in rank seniority, or in the case where two (2) or more Battalion Chiefs have the same time-in-rank seniority, then employment seniority shall be the determining factor, except that the Fire Administration retains the ability to assign probationary Battalion Chiefs as needed during their probationary period. These assignments will occur at the same time that company assignments are routinely conducted in Suppression.
Battalion Chiefs shall annually select their shift of assignment after completion of probation on the basis of time in rank seniority. Battalion Chiefs shall rotate semi-annually on their shift of assignment during probation.
F.	SPECIALTY TEAM ASSIGNMENTS: The Hazmat, Dive, and Technical Rescue teams are considered specialty teams. These teams will consist of “Core Teams" with the following numbers per shift: Hazmat 9. Technical Rescue 6, and Under Water Rescue 5. Core Team Members selected for the teams will be required to serve as a member for three (3) years, unless they need to be removed for medical or physiological reasons or are removed from the team by the Chief or his designee due to lake of maintaining his/her proficiency in accordance with departmental standards.

Along with each shift having Core Members of each team, each shift will also have alternate members who will be the next in line to fill any vacated position within each team. Alternate members could also be utilized to fill the core team if a member is injured or off work for an extended period of time. Teams will consist of the following alternate positions per shift: Hazmat 2, Technical Rescue 3, and Under Water Rescue 2. Alternate team members will not be called in to participate in the team functions requiring overtime. Each alternate will join the Core Team during any on shift training. Alternate members will be placed on a forty (40) hour work week while attending specialty classes. Alternate members can be removed from the team by the Chief or his designee for the same reasons and stated for Core Team Members.
Team participants: The union and the management of the Peoria Fire Department recognize that there could be a number of members that are not selected for any of the core teams or as an alternate. It could be that a member has an interest in a field, but does not want to be a core member or alternate on a team. Both the union leaders and the management leaders encourage those members to continue to be a part of these different disciplines as a participant. In this role, members will be able to train with the teams when they are on shift. Members with skills in these areas can always be utilized in an emergency situation and continuing to maintain competency in skills will benefit all involved. Participants on one or more teams will also be considered for future placement as an alternate, if desired, when a position becomes available. Outside training for these members will be at their own time unless it is cleared by the Division Chief of Training.
Selection for all of the specialty teams will be done by seniority through bidding, subject to passing the required medical examination and the certification testing required for the particular team. Members will be allowed to be on one (1) Core Team only. Members that are a Core Member on one team can be a participant on other teams but not a core member or alternate member of a second team. Core Team Members that switch shifts for any reason will be placed on the core team of the new shift if a position is available. If no position is available as a Core Member or an alternate, the member will be taken off the team until an opening on the team becomes available. Upon selection of each shift’s Core Team, one member from each shift and each team will be selected as the team's shift coordinator. It will be their duty to coordinate all functions of that shift's team with the Division Chief of Training or his designee as well as other shift coordinators.
On July 1st of each year a specialty team incentive allowance of two hundred forty-five dollars ($245) will be provided for participation on the Hazmat, Dive, and Technical Rescue Core Teams. The allowance shall be increased to two hundred eighty ($280) on July 1, 2008; three hundred twenty dollars ($320) on July 1, 2009; and three hundred fifty dollars ($350) on July 1, 2010.The specialty team incentive allowance will not be increased because of multiple team participation by an employee. In order to receive the incentive allowance an employee must have participated on a specialty team for the full year prior to that July 1st and passed any required Departmental proficiency tests during that period.. The incentive allowance will be provided on the first pay period after July 1a of each year with the final incentive being paid in July 2017, at which time the Core Specialty Team language as agreed to in Section 9.3F will go into effect. The maximum number of employees that may be eligible for a specialty core team incentive allowance in a year beginning July 1, 2008 is limited to ninety six (96) employees.

EVALUATION INSTRUMENT
The City and the Union have mutually developed a performance evaluation instrument to be used in evaluating Captains and Battalion Chiefs during their probationary period and annual performance evaluations. The importance of an appropriately objective and work-related evaluation instrument to serve as a legitimate and useful tool to measure and provide feedback on an employee's work performance was a major consideration of the Parties.
The Battalion Chiefs on the shift to which the Captain is permanently assigned will perform the annual performance evaluation of a Captain. The Division Chief of Operations will perform the annual performance evaluation of a Battalion Chief. An evaluation is intended to be a summary of the employee's work performance over the course of the evaluation period. It should communicate and document the employee’s level of performance and be used as a tool to motivate the employee. To this end, the evaluators and the employee will meet and discuss work responsibilities, job standards and objectives, review progress and plan for the employee’s future development prior to the evaluation being placed in the employee’s personnel file. The employee shall receive a copy ofthe evaluation, and have the opportunity to review and comment. The employee will also be able to attach written comments to the evaluation.
Whenever the evaluators give an employee a rating less than “meets standards" for the overall performance evaluation they will provide the specific reasons for such an assessment and the development of a performance improvement plan, with the input of the employee and the Fire Chief or his designee, to address the specifically identified areas needing improvement.
Any employee who disagrees with an overall performance rating that is less than “meets standards” may submit a written appeal to the Fire Chief or his designee. Such written appeal must be filed within ten (10) calendar days of the date of the receipt of the evaluation, and must provide specific reasons for disputing the performance rating. The employee will be provided a hearing on his appeal with the Performance Evaluation Review Committee (PERC) within fifteen (15) calendar days after the appeal was filed with the Fire Chief. The PERC will consist of the Fire Chief or his designee and two (2) Fire management representatives selected by the Fire Chief; and the Union President or his designee and one (1) Union representative selected by the Union President. The PERC will provide its decision to the employee in writing within seven (7) calendar days of the hearing. The PERC will be the exclusive process for disputes concerning performance reviews and ratings, and such performance reviews and ratings shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
Performance evaluations are considered a part of an employee’s work history. Those evaluations made after January 1, 2007 shall be used as a component of any promotional consideration and will constitute a portion ofthe points involved with the professional assessment/assessment center score in the promotional testing process.
The City and the Union agree to work together in a Labor-Management Committee to develop a performance evaluation instrument to be used in evaluating Firefighters and Fire Engineers during their probationary period and annual performance evaluations.

SIDE-LETTER AGREEME

FILE NO.17-112
RETURN TO WORK/NON-WORK RELATED INJURIES:
The parties agree that the ability of City employees to be physically able to safely perform their duties is of primary concern to all involved. This requires that employees who are off work for non-work related illnesses/injuries be cleared to return to duty by the City physician prior to returning to duty.
Therefore, in situations where an employee presents a return to work medical release from a non-work related illness/injury, from his/her personal physician that is based upon the appropriate medical protocol, and the City physician feels that additional testing is required prior to granting a release to return to work, wherever practical, the City physician will discuss the issue/concern directly with the employee’s personal physician. If after this discussion a difference of opinion still exists or the City physician still feels that additional testing is required, additional testing relevant to the illness/injury and appropriate for making a return to work determination may be ordered by the City physician. If the employee’s physician orders additional testing or rescinds the release, the City of Peoria is not obligated in any manner for any time off work.
Testing relevant to the illness/injury will be scheduled as expeditiously as possible and the employee will fully cooperate with the additional testing. If the results of these tests indicate that the employee is able to return to work, the City of Peoria will reinstate any leave time utilized by the employee that was directly related to the additional testing required by the City.

Re:	Peoria Kids Program
During the course of prior negotiations a number of discussions were held concerning the importance of providing encouragement, information, and leadership to high school students in the City of Peoria about the requirements and employment opportunities available at the Peoria Fire Department. Additionally, the necessity of establishing cooperative relationships over the broad educational spectrum in the community was deemed critically important for any success in this joint informational and recruitment endeavor. Both 1AFF Local 50 and the City of Peoria are committed to developing and mutually participating in the implementation of programs that will benefit and assist the young men and women of the City of Peoria in becoming Peoria Firefighters. Both parties will provide their commitment and resources to the program “Peoria Kids First” and any program(s) that will enhance the employment opportunities at the Peoria Fire Department for the youth of the City of Peoria. This memorandum underscores and reinforces the parties’ commitment to maintain this program for the duration of this collective bargaining agreement.

Re:	ALS Engine Companies
This side letter became effective on July 8,2008 contingent on a written understanding is in place with Advance Medical Transportation (AMT) for reimbursement of ALS/Paramedic supplies used, and approval by the EMS Director for PAEMS and/or State licensing and certification, and licensed staffing and backups are available at the Fire Department to staff two (2) ALS engine companies.
The City will continue this program provided licensed staffing and backup are adequate to safely and economically implement its requirements in accordance with PAEMS and State regulations. Additionally, the City may, at its discretion, determine to increase the ALS engine company program beyond the initial two (2) ALS engine companies. In that event, the City will notify the Union. Any changes necessary to this side letter for such additional ALS engine companies will be subject to negotiation.
The Fire Chief shall annually designate the engine companies responsible for full time ALS support and responsibilities. It is recognized that the designation of the fire houses for those companies may change from year to year dependent upon the needs of the community.
1.	Staffing
Staffing for ALS engine companies will be in accordance with Section 9.3 of the Agreement except as noted, and with the requirement that such companies shall be staffed with one system certified EMT-P (paramedic) at all times of operation:
•	An employee who is a system certified EMT-P (paramedic) shall have the right to displace another employee assigned to an ALS engine company in the same rank with greater seniority without such certification from an ALS engine company, provided no other system certified EMT-P is assigned to that ALS engine company. The sequence for displacement assignment will be from lowest rank to highest rank assigned to the Company, i.e., a system certified Firefighter will displace a non-system certified Firefighter before any consideration shall be given to the displacement of a Fire Engineer.
♦	Should there be an inadequate staffing of ALS engine companies of system certified paramedics due to voluntary assignment selections, the Fire Chief shall have the right to assign the least senior system certified paramedic to such ALS engine company, starting with the lowest rank and moving up through the ranks, until the ALS engine companies are staffed on each shift with at least one system certified paramedic.
•	The Fire Chief shall have the right to balance the shifts with sufficient system-certified paramedics to insure adequate backup coverage for the ALS engine companies. Any balancing ofthe shifts shall first be by volunteer, and if no volunteers come forward, by assignment to the applicable shift ofthe least senior system certified paramedic not assigned to an ALS engine company.
II.	Overtime
Overtime opportunities on ALS engine companies for the firefighter slot with system-certified paramedic requirements shall be assigned from the normal hiring book rotation for overtime opportunities except that only those officers with system-certified paramedic licensing shall be offered such assignment. An officer hired in to fill the ALS paramedic slot shall be eligible for non-paramedic overtime, but will held out of such overtime opportunity until all eligible firefighters for non-paramedic overtime have had an overtime opportunity. ALS engine paramedic overtime opportunities shall be rotated among officers with system-certified paramedic licensing.

FILE NO.17-112
III.	Vacation, Personal Days, Kelly Davs, Time Trading
System certified paramedics shall be allowed to trade time in accordance with Article 16.6 - Time-Trading, when there is at least one additional system certified paramedic on duty than what is needed to staff the ALS companies at the time the Battalion Chief “set’s up the board" on the duty day prior to the trade. If there is not at least one additional system certified paramedic scheduled to be working on the day of the trade as prescribed above, the trade shall be null and void; however the individual shall be allowed to trade time with a system certified paramedic. The Battalion Chief or his designee shall attempt to contact the individual requesting the trade the duty day prior to the trade if the trade is null and void. All other rules specified under Article 16.6 - Time-Trading shall be in effect.
IV.	Training
Under the current circumstances, Advanced Medical Transport (AMT) has agreed to provide most of the training classes necessary for certification and recertification of EMT-P licenses. Such provision includes both in-house and off-premises instruction. It is the intent of the City to make such training opportunities available to firefighters, and to utilize AMT for that purpose insofar as practical. Most of such training will be provided during duty hours, and no employee will be required to obtain or retain paramedic certification if the City does not provide the required training, and a reasonable opportunity to correct any deficiencies to retain such certification.
It is the City's intent to initially offer such training to the current ten (10) officers who have system-certified paramedic licenses, and to remaining six (6) employees who are paramedics without system certification. Thereafter, it shall be the City's prerogative to determine whether to increase the compliment of paramedic coverage and to extend the training commitment beyond the initial compliment of sixteen (16) system-certified paramedics.
V.	Quality Assurance
The Fire Chief shall have the discretion to maintain the quality assurance requirements of the ALS engines as mandated by PAEMS and the State of Illinois by the utilization of appropriately licensed personnel from Advanced Medical Transport, the Battalion Chief of Special Operations, or the assignment of such duties to licensed paramedics at the Fire Department. Until it is determined by the Fire Chief that a full-time EMS/QAO position is justified, and that funding is available and approved for that purpose, there is no obligation by this Agreement to reinstate the former EMS/QAO position.
VI.	Compensation
The City shall provide 2.00% incentive pay to the employees covered under this agreement consistent with the effective date of this agreement for up to sixteen (16) system-certified paramedics, or the number as determined in Section IV, paragraph 2 of this agreement. Effective January 1,2010 the paramedic incentive pay shall be increased to 2.5%.
The paramedic incentive pay shall be applied to the employee’s regular base rate. An employee approved to receive the paramedic incentive pay must maintain the required certifications and licenses in order to continue to receive the incentive pay.
