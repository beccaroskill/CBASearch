Only in cas-es of bona fide health and safety issues may a standby be justified. The Union pledges in good faith that health and safety will not be used as a gimmick. The employer shall have the option of having the men who raise a question of health and safety stand by until a decision isreached or “workingaround" the situation until it can be resolved, and no further work shall beper-formed on that disputed operation until the health and safety issue is resolved.
11.42	Onerous workload exception. Longshoremen on cargo handling operations shall not be required to work when in good faith they believe that to doso will result in an onerous workload. The Union pledges in good faith that the onerous workload claim will not be used as a gimmick, The employer shall have the option of having the men claiming onerousness stand by until a decision is reached or “working around”the situation until it can be resolved.
11.421	When a man is directed to take his own relief without a man being assigned to relieve him, this does not automatically present a question of onerousness of work or individual speedup for the men remaining on the job, regardless of the basic gang structure involved. A change in operations or manning to remove unnecessary men, or the handling of larger loads does not, in and of itself automatically present any question of onerousness of work or individual speedup.

CFS PROGRAM FUND
The parties acknowledge their mutual interests in develop-i ng produ ct i ve w ork opportu n i t ies that p rese rve for dockworkers their work and living standards. Such a program will retain and attract to the industry responsible, reliable andskilled persons whose availability will assure astable work force and will minimize the costs of those industry programs that are now required when work is unavailable.
The parties recognize that the continued movement of container work from the docks jeopardizes their aforesaid mutual interests. They desire to reverse that movement and encourage the establishment, development and growth of efficient and productive container freight stations on the docks to preserve the work which has historically been performed by the longshore work force.
To achieve these ends they have agreed as follows:
(1)	The employers will expend annually during the term of this contract approximately $3 million to be raised upon containerized cargo tonnage. (The reference to a dollar expenditure isnot acapupon the sum the employers may be required to expend annually to achieve the objectives of this program.) The funds shall be managed by PMA and distributed by it to those of its members who operate CFS facilities, such distribution to be on a basis which will encourage the preservation, growth and increase of such container stuffing and unstuffing facilities. PMA will report periodically to the Union on the receipts and disbursements of the Fund.
(2)	The provisions of the Container Freight Station Supplement shall not be burdened by arbitration decisions or past practices prior to July 1, 1984 whether
189
CFS PROGRAM FUND
oral or written. Any restrictions on the employer that are in conflict with the provisions of the Container Freight Station Supplement will be considered null and void.
(3)	The parties will hence forth comm it themselves to increasing CFS productivity and the elimination of wasteful work practices.
(4)	The parties agree to set up ajoint committee to report periodically to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee on the progress of this program and to make recommendations as to further implementation.
(5)	Disputes which arise with respect to this program shall be first referred to the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee for the port where the dispute may arise and, if necessary, may be referred by either party to the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee and then by either party to the Coast Arbitrator.
(6)	This program may be terminated with the mutual written consent of the parties upon 60 days' written notice to ail employers receiving distributions under thisprogram and, inall events, this program shall immediately terminate if the provisions of CFS Sections 1.5 through 1.543 of the 1970-71 Container Freight Station Supplement and CFS Sections 1.53, 1.54,1.55 and 1.57 of the am ended Container Freight Station Supplement that were entered into February 10,1972 are determined to be legally enforceable.

SKILLED HOLDMEN — HOLDMEN CAPABLE OF DRIVING LIFTS
CLRC No. 11, August 5,1966 (Item 2(e)}
The Employers stated they will not pay the skill differential to men until they arc capable of driving lifts.
The Union suggested the approach that where it is recognized at the local level that a gang does not have qualified machine operators therein, then prior to the 2 men receiving the differential, holdmen capable of driving lifts will replace them in the gang.
It is the dispatchers’ obligation to make up gangs properly, and this now includes providing 2 holdmen capable of driving lifts.
It was further agreed as follows;
1.	In gang boss ports, it is the gang bosses’obligation to see to it thebasicgang is properly constituted, and the holdmen capable of driving lifts are to be designated by him, where there
215

are steady men in his gang. In making up gangs, it is the dispatchers’ responsibility to see that the basic gang is properly constituted on dispatch;
2.	In all other ports the dispatchers shall dispatch the prop- . er holdmen;
3.	Should the employer find there are no holdmen capable of driving lifts he may—
(a)	Swing in-skilled men from the dock who are not on the old or disabled preferential list and swing out the
. holdmen who were dispatched as the men capableof driving lifts, or
(b)	Discharge the gang, or
(c)	Call for replacements, or
(d)	Suspend the skill differential, and
(e)	Process the complaint through the grievance machinery.
4.	The local LRC’s have the discretion of filling these skilled hold jobs with either Class Aor Class B longshoremen, and such men are to be regularly attached to the gang.
CLRC No. 21, November 3,1967 (Item 2)
The Committee again discussed the issues in this case and agreed that if there are no lift drivers available, meaning if no lift drivers are employed by the employer in the dock or terminal area, skilled holdmen may operate the lift on the dock for the purpose of bringing or removing gear or other necessary equipment to or from the hatch when no productive work is being performed.

(Reference is made to CLRC Meeting No. 7,May4, 1961, Item 3.)
The agreement reached on “In Lieu ofTime” in the meeting of the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee noted above is not to be interpreted so as to support claims for in lieu of pay for work normally and properly performed by American crews under the status quo understand ing or to al ter such understanding. Thus, the agreement to assign work as described to longshoremen does not result in payment of in lieu of time to longshoremen if such work is performed by crew members under the status quo for American ships.
Reference is made to the followingparagraph as contained in the above noted minutes:
(c) Handling Ship’s Stores. If loads are to be built on the dockand ship’s gear is to be used, longshoremen shall build the loadsand handle gear to land such loads on deck. During a shift when no longshoremen are employed the crew may use ship's gear to bring stores aboard.
The Committee agrees that the crew under the above language would not be used during meal hours or between shifts. Ship’s stores may be hand-carried aboard by the crew. If no longshore gangsareon the ship during a shift, the crew can use the gear (includes conveyor or sideport operation) and load ship’s stores, including the building of loads.
It was further agreed that:

Ship's stores delivered to ship’s side that are to be built into loads on the dock and then hoisted aboard ship to be thereafter de-pa)letized and stowed by ship’s crew can be so built and hoisted aboard with a basic gang that is already employed. Two of the 4 holdmen will assist the front men in building the loads on the dock, and the other 2 holdmen will unhook the loads on the deck.
3.	If longshoremen are directed by an employer to stow the stores in the various appropriate lockers or compartments, the basic 4 holdmen gang must be supplemented by not fewer than 4 swingmen; however, the contractual exception in paragraph 23 ofthe October 18,1960 Memorandum of Agreement shall apply, and the gang may or may not be further supplemented on the ship or dock, based on the needs ofthe operation at the employer’s option.

JOBS OF SHORT DURATION
CLRC No. 25, October 30,1961 (Hem 1)
Amended in CLRCNo. 12. June 23.1962 (hem 1)
The Coast Committee is aware that it has ruled on many disputes on this subject, but desired to define a job of short dura* lion so that it would be clearly understood. The Committee agreed upon the following definition:
An operation of short duration is one which is comprised of the following elements and only when the order is placed fora man of short duration;
I.	ft must be 6 hours or less with no meal.
2.	It pertains to the man and not the gang.
3.	It pertains to a man in a skilled classification (i.e., winch drivers, lift truck operators, bull drivers, etc.).
4.	It pertains to a specific shift.
5.	It requires a 4-hour minimum guarantee.
6.	It allows a skilled man to be shifted to comparable work on the original ship or dock.
7.	A skilled man may be shifted to comparable work on another ship or dock but if this is done, such a man receives an 8-hour guarantee rather than the 4-hour guarantee.
8.	A skilled man of short duration shall be ordered at regular dispatch to start the job at any time. This does not preclude orders for jobs of short duration during the course of the shift where the need could not be foreseen at regular ordering time.
9.	A ski lied man of short duration must be one s uppl emen t-inga skilled man ofthe same skill already on the job on the shift in which the requirement for the extra Skill man occurs. Each shift stands on its own insofar as employment of short duration is concerned.

NO DISCRIMINATION
ADO ENDA
Example 1. A job of short duration beginning after the midshift meal but not completed by the end of that shift may be continued on the next immediate shift as day follows night or night follows day, with another man employed for a job of short duration.
Example!. A job of short duration during a given shift and completed before the end of such shift and with cargo operations not requiring the manof short duration occurring after his release, may be repeatedon the next comparable shift and both such jobs shall be considered as jobs of short duration.
Example!. Ajob of short duration during a given shift and completed at the end of such shi ft and with cargo operations not requiring a man of short duration at the beginning of the next comparable shift will permit the employment of a man of short duration on that next comparable shift.
Example 4. It is not permissible under the Agreement to consider as jobs of short duration work which takes a man of short duration to the end of one shift and the start of the next comparable shift. Employment on such a basis will require payment of 8-hour guarantees on both such shifts.

I. Statement of Policy
It is the policy of the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee not to discriminate against disabled workers in hiring, dispatch and promotion, and to provide reasonable accommodations for applicants and incumbent workers who have covered disabilities within the meaning of state and federal law.
Further, it is the policy of the JCLRC that the Joint Port Labor Relations Committee in each port shall engage in an
238
ADDENDA	CLRC POLICY ON ADA COMPLIANCE
AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
interactive process with applicants for industry employment and incumbent workers who claim to have covered disabilities to determine whether reasonable accommodations exist which would enable the applicant or incumbent worker to enter or continue working in the longshore industry.
Otherwise qualified applicants and employees found to be able to safely perform longshore and clerk work with or without reasonable accommodations as may be required by law will be so employed. Applicants and employees found to be unable to perform longshore and work safely with or without reasonable accommodation shall not be employed and shall not be eligible for dispatch to such work.
The JPLRC will provide notice of this policy prohibiting discrimination and of the procedures for considering and resolving requests for accommodation to potential applicants for industry employment, and members of the incumbent workforce (including identified casual and registered workers) as required by law.
II.	Accommodation Procedures
Requests for reasonable accommodation shall be considered and resolved by the local JPLRC's in accordance with Section 17.4 of the PCLCA as modified herein. The Joint Port LRC shall be responsible for determining the following issues:
1)	whether the worker in question is qualified to perform work under the PCLCA;
2)	whether the worker in question has a bona fide disability that limits his or her ability to perform satisfactorily the essential functions of the job he or she holds or desires; and
3)	if so, whether the disability may be reasonably accommodated without imposing an undue hardship

on the Union or the Employers or without violating the bona Tide seniority provisions of the PCLCA except to the extent as may be required by law.
Al) three issues must be found in the affirmative in order for the JPLRC to grant reasonable accommodation. The JPLRC has the discretion to select the accommodation it considers most appropriate, giving due consideration to the suggestions and preferences of the applicant or employee seeking accommodation.
A. Written Request for Accommodation
Requests for accommodation by applicants for industry employment or incumbent workers who believe they are entitled to accommodation under the ADA or other applicable state law must be submitted in writing to the Joint Port LRC. tn the written request, the individual seeking accommodation shall provide the Joint Port LRC with following information.
I.	The nature and extent of the claimed disability;
2.	The precise job-related limitations he/ she believes are imposed by the claimed disability;
3.	Information and/or suggestions as to any accom-modation(s) that would enable the individual to overcome the job-related limitations and perform the work safely and satisfactorily.
The individual should include any medical documentation and other information which he or she believes is relevant and would assist the JPLRC in reaching a decision.
If the employee or applicant seeking accommodation requires assistance in preparing a written request for accommodation, JPLRC personnel will assist in putting
240

the request in writing. Further, in circumstances where it is apparent that an applicant or employee is disabled and may require reasonable accommodation, JPLRC personnel shall advise the applicant or employee of the procedure for requesting an accommodation.
B.	Interactive Process re: Accommodation Request
1)	Initial Meeting
Within 7 days after receiving a written request for accommodation, the Joint Port LRC shall provide the individual with written acknowledgment that the request has been received along with a written request to appear before the JPLRC to review the accommo-' dation request and to discuss alternatives. At this time, the Committee may request that the individual bring additional documentation or information to this initial meeting which the Committee believes is or may be relevant and/or would assist in reaching a decision, including, in appropriate cases, a medical release. The initial meeting should be scheduled to take place as soon as is practicable, depending on the circumstances giving rise to the accommodation request, but no later than 14 days following receipt of the written accommodation request.
2)	Opinion of Medical Specialist
Following the initial meeting, the JPLRC may, in its discretion, obtain an opinion from a designated medical specialist regarding: 1) whether the applicant or employee suffers from a disabling condition which limits one or more major life activity, 2) the applicant or employees' functional abilities and limitations with respect to the essential functions of the job he or she holds or seeks; and 3) possible accommodations.
241
CLRC POLICY ON ADA COMPLIANCE
AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
ADDENDA
One medical specialist shall be designated in each port to assist the JPLRC in reviewing requests for reasonable accommodation. Each designated specialist shall be made aware and become knowledgeable of the nature and requirements of longshore and clerk work and the established conditions and waterfront operations in the industry. The designated medical specialist shall also be knowledgeable as to the legal standards and requirements related to the employ* ment of disabled workers with or without reasonable accommodation.
In determining whether a particular applicant or employee has a disabling condition which limits one or more major life activity, the medical specialist will be asked to render an opinion based on any and all of the following s/he deems appropriate: an independent medical examination of the individual by an appropri* ate health care practitioner, the individual’s medical history, medical reports from the individual’s personal physician, reexamination of the individual, medical tests, x-rays, etc.
The medical specialist shall provide the JPLRC with a written report setting forth an opinion as to whether the applicant or employee has a disability which limits one or more major life activity along with an opinion as to the individual’s functional abilities and limitations in relation to the essential functions of the job which the employee or applicant holds or seeks.

would enable the disabled applicant or employee to work in the industry.
In the absence of unusual circumstances, the JPLRC will schedule an appointment for the applicant or employee with the medical specialist to occur within 14 days following the initial meeting. In the absence of unusual circumstances, the medical specialist, in turn, will provide his or her written report to the JPLRC within 14 days after this appointment takes place.
3)	Additional Meeting Before JPLRC
Within 7 days following receipt of the medical specialist’s written report, the JPLRC may, in its discretion, invite the applicant or employee to attend a further hearing before the JPLRC and/or request the individual to provide additional documentation or information relevant to the accommodation request. The JPLRC may also, in its discretion, proceed to gather any additional information it deems appropriate in determining whether a reasonable accommodation exists, including consulting with legal counsel and other technical assistance before rendering a decision.
In the absence of unusual circumstances, the JPLRC shall conclude the interactive process and prepare a written referral and recommendation to the Joint Coast LRC regarding the proper disposition of the request no later than 14 days following receipt of the medical specialists’ written report. The JPLRC shall make its recommendation to the Joint Coast LRC regarding the accommodation request based on the facts developed during the interactive process.

ing accommodation requests presented by disabled applicants and employees under the Americans With Disabilities Act and applicable slate law. Nothing in this policy may be construed to require the ILWU and the PMA to provide applicants or employees with particular accommodations or to provide accommodations where, in the opinion of the Committee, none are warranted. Nor may this policy be construed as acceptance by the ILWU or the PMA of additional, greater or different legal or financial responsibilities than those which are imposed on them by law for providing accommodations to disabled applicants or employees.
The procedures set forth in this policy may be flexibly applied by Jhe JPLRC's and JCLRC in particular cases when, in the judgment of the Committee, the facts and circumstances warrant it. The ti m e I ines for accompl is hing particular steps of the procedure are intended as guidelines, not strict time limits, which may be extended or waived in appropriate circumstances. Failure ofthe local committees or the JCLRC to strictly comply with the time lines shall not constitute a violation of the policy.
PICKET LINE LANGUAGE
CLRC No. 1, January 29,1954
Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines: There was a general discussion of language pertaining to this subject, wherein the Union stated that they did not expect longshoremen to get paid for observing picket lines, but on the other hand, did not want longshoremen necessarily ordered day after day.
It was agreed that the following language which was ini-tialedby the parties, will be the guide to settle any claims in the future and, likewise, wipe out the meaning of past arbitration awards on the subject,
245
PICKET UNE LANGUAGE
ADDENDA
Manpower Utilization and Picket Lines:
A local shall, through its president or its secretary, notify PMA in writing of intention to respect a specific picket line. Delivery of such written notice shall relieve the dispatching hall of obligation to furnish men or gangs to the picketed operation until a decision under the grievance machinery is issued ordering the start or continuance of work.
Men or gangs ordered priorto or within 2 hours of such written notice to PMA shall report to work without benefit of cov-' erage of minimum report time as provided in the Agreement.
Men or gangs ordered later than 2 hours following such receipt but prior to the issuance of a determination by the parties through grievance machinery shall, ifthey accept the order and report, be covered by the minimum provisions of the Agreement, provided, however, that failure of the employer to place orders following such receipt shall not constitute any waiver of the employer’s position noran acceptance of the union’s position, pending decision as hereinafter provided.
Following the establishment of any picket line about the premises of an employer affecting the work ofemployees covered by ILWU-PMA Agreements, either party may require a meeting of the Joint Labor Relations Committee of the port affected (or an Area Committee or the Coast Committee, if such is agreed to be appropriate) and such meetings shall be held immediately.
The Committee shall promptly examine the facts and issue its written decision as to whether the picket line is legitimate and bona fide under the Agreement. Should a Committee fail to reach such a decision, then either party may refer the matter to the Area Arbitrator for prompt interim decision.
Excepting as provided in this Document, men or gangs who leave or refuse to start or continue any work because of a pick-

In order to minimize any further delay to an operation which has been picketed, the local dispatching hall shall make every effort to famish men or gangs in accordance with employer orders immediately after the picket line is lifted, or as soon thereafter as possible.
SCHEDULING OF MEETINGS
Letter of Understanding dated July 1,1984
With regard to the revision of Sections 12.31 and 12.311 in the 1984 negotiations:
“The Union pointed out the above understanding could present a problem in ports where three 8 hour shift operations occur under the local agreements. In such situations the start of an 8 hour shift could overlap the time period of a scheduled meeting.
“The parties agreed that if the three 8-hour shifts present a problem, it would have to be accommodated so that all members of a local are given the opportunity to attend their scheduled meeting.”
GUARANTEES, SKILLED RATES FOR ALL LONGSHOREMEN AND CLERKS
Memorandum of Understanding, July 16,1996
Employees shall be paid at the appropriate shift and skill rates of pay in accordance with Sections 2 and 4, PCL&CA, and the provisions herein. Individual side agreements, including paid hours in excess of the PCL&CA, as defined by Area Arbitration No. SC-29-94, between individual employees or

STEADY SKILLED MEN
CLRC No. 14, October 11,1966 (Item 1)
The Employers inquired as to what the Union had in mind in implementing the “Steady Skilled Man” provision of the new Agreement.
' There was considerable discussion following which the Employers stated they would discuss this matter further and be prepared to talk about it again in the afternoon session.
The Employers stated they reviewed the matters discussed at the morning session and feel the following proposal will meet the needs of both parties:
1.	A guarantee to skilled men regardless of category at a minimum of 173 hours per month at the 250° differential shall be paid to steady employees. Such guarantee shall be paid irrespective of how long an individual is retained during any month as a steady skilled man; provided, however, that should such steady skilled man be released for cause during any month, the guarantee shall be prorated over the period such employee was retained as a steady man;
2.	Should a steady man be upgraded, he will receive the applicable higher skill differential for the balance of the shift regardless of the period of time ofutilization on the equipment carrying the higher differential;
248
SAN FRANCISCO STEADY SKILLED MEN
ADDENDA
3.	All hours worked (including dead time hours under the 8-hour guarantee) by such steady man will count against his guarantee;
4.	Travel time will not be a part of the guarantee;
5.	The guaranteeis not a limitation of the employers’ right to work such steady men over and above such guarantee; i.e„ the guarantee represents a minimum payment for the privilege of obtaining steady skilled men;
6.	It is not intended to allow an employer to hire steady skilled men so that he may then order longshoremen to make upa basic gang, thus avoiding usinga basiegang from the hall;
7,	Where a skilled man is required for a job of short dura-

4,	The fourth priority shall be given to Class B longshoremen who have completed the ILWU-PMA Semitractor Training Program.
With respect to those Class A longshoremen in 2 above, it is understood that time on the Semitractor Dispatch Board shall count toward meeting the “5 years in the hold" requirement (subject to the necessary waiver being granted by the Joint Coast Labor Relations Committee).
The Joint LLRC shall, in accordance with Section 9.4, provide for the appropriate number of Class Alongshoremen (in 2 above) on the Semitractor Dispatch Board from longshoremen elevated to Class A status after July 1,1987 . Any disagreement shall be submitted to the Area Arbitrator for resolution.
Jobs dispatched from the Semitractor Dispatch Boards and semitractor jobs from the Class B Board must be accepted or a flop shall be given.

3.	These UTR operators shall report to the job one-half hour prior to the start ofthe shift for work other than actual handling or moving of cargo. The phrase “other than actual handling or moving of cargo" is intended to permit the preparation of equipment including chassis for movement to or from the vessel so long as there is no actual movement of cargo directly to or from the vessel.
4.	Employers who elect to employ UTR operators on a monthly basis for both day and/or night operations may order up to 50% ofthe average daily number of UTR operators used against their operations during the previous payroll quarter as recorded by the Joint Dispatch Hall and PMA Allocations. New Employers or new container terminals may employ monthly UTR operators after a payroll quarter of operation, based on the foregoing formula.
5.	All ship operations with monthly UTR operators shall starton time should the Dispatch Hall on any given day or days be unable to fill Che remainder ofUTR operators from the Hall at the start of any shift.
6.	Monthly UTR operators shall work against vessels asdi-rccted, on all UTR rated equipment, providing full flexibility as required by the Employer. Such flexibility shall include all work before vessel’s arrival and after vessel’s departure on that shift. (This means cargo preparation for that vessel or dock storage of discharged cargo from that vessel.)
7.	Full flexibility includes the use of monthly UTR operators for uti lization between the vessel/C Y and container movements to or from Container Rail Transfer Yards. Other UTR dock work remains as per past practice (i.e., container move

Dispatch shall be based on “low man out” (lowest sign-in hours dispatched first). Individuals will have a timely check-in procedure for the 30-day dispatch.
9.	Monthly UTR’s will be responsible for arranging their own relief in accordance with Section 2.3 and subsections of the PCLCD. This allows the Dispatch Hall to dispatch relief UTR jobs on the low-man-out principle.
10.	Four days prior to the end of each month, Employers will notify the Dispatch Hall of their requirement of monthly UTR operators for the subsequent month. The number of such jobs shall be posted by the joint Dispatchers in the Dispatch Hall 3 days prior to the end of the month. On the first day of each month, the dispatch of monthly UTR operators shall occur at a time so as to guarantee arrival of all monthly UTR operators to their Employer one-half hour prior to the start ofthe shift.

For the purpose of these obligations, the 1996 base year expenses of the Dis-patchHalls shallbe the January 1,1996, toDecember 31,1996, equally shared expenses which appear on the audited financial statejnents. Whenever, due to reduction in dispatch hall costs or increase in the PCL&CAhoiiday cost, the average cost of a holiday exceeds 15% of the 1996 base year expenses, the Union’s 35% share shall be reduced by a proportionate amount allocated to the local dispatch halls administratively by the JCLRC. All additional jointly agreed to expenses above the base year expenses shall be shared equally between PMA and the Local Union. The formula for sharing extraordinary capital improvements shall be subject to mutual agreement of the parties.
(Notwithstanding the fact that PMA’s contribution towards Dispatch Hall costs is by virtue of this Agreement greater than the contribution ofthe ILWU, nothing herein contained or otherwise shall in any way change or modify the basic principle and understanding of the parties as expressed in this Agreement that the Dispatch Halls shall continue in the future, as they have in the past, to be maintained and operatedjointly and equally by the ILWU and the PMA.)
