Re:	Extended Compensation Participant in Alliance or ETOP
This is to confirm our mutual understanding that an eligible occupational employee who has chosen to participate in the Extended Compensation Option of the Lucent Career Transition Option Program and is available for temporary assignments through the Job Match Center, and who is also a participant in an Alliance or and ETOP training program, may reject a Job Match Center temporary assignment if that assignment conflicts with a verified Alliance or ETOP training program in which the employee is participating at the time.

1993 National Memorandum of Understanding
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between CWA, IBEW and Lucent Technologies addresses Union organizing and consent elections in those job titles and occupations in Lucent organizations that are not covered by the 1983 Union-Management Relations Agreement, separately attached hereto. It is effective on July 1,1958. .
As recognized by their participation in Work Place of the Future, and as a part thereof, the Unions and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to operate in the spirit of partnership and common vision. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development.
The parties also recognize the Unions' goal of growing membership. In order to maintain this perspective and to also avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to all wholly owned Lucent Business Operating Groups and Divisions throughout the country and shall be the exclusive means by which the Unions, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize non-management employees in the covered Lucent Business Operating Groups or Divisions.
1	Employee Choice
Both ihe Unions and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as lo whether or not to become represented by a Union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, il is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are Intended to establish, encourage, and nurture an environment during a Union organizing drive that will allow employees lo choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct, and voting will be performed by local management end local Union officials, i.e„ those directly impacted by these discussions. The local Union and management officials may request a meeting with the appropriate Union and Company headquarters representatives at the beginning of this process.
383
National Memorandum
2	Neutrality
The Company and the Unions agree that an organizing drive should be and will be met by Company conduct that neither helps nor hinders organizing efforts. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. The environment is intended to foster employee choice and information communicated by either party should be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be anti* management.
(b)	Management will net advocate that employees should vote against Union representation.
(c)	The Union(s) will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to communicate with employees. '
(d)	Management may respond to individual employee questions, and may correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a "third party" or "outsider".
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be simultaneously shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire or seek the assistance of consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h} Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked, by name or by descriptive reference, in campaign literature or discussions.
(1) Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j) The Company will not conduct "captive* audience meetings.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3	Election Procedures
389
National Memorandum
The procedures to be followed are listed below;
(a)	The Union must show that a majority of employees In a unit appropriate for collective bargaining have signed show of interest cards indicating their desire for a representation election. The cards must be dated within three months of the date they are presented to the Third Party Neutral (TPN). Cards signed by persons who are no longer employed by Lucent at the time of submission to the TPN will not be valid.
(b)	If an election is conducted and the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months. During this time, no Union organizing campaign for that unit will be permitted.
(c)	A majority of those who vote, validated by the TPN, will determine the outcome.
(d)	The TPN wilt resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots by following the NLRB's rules and decisions.
4	Time Bound
it is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will "start the dock". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It Is the intent of the parties that the 90 day time frame will Include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process, exceed 120 days. If the employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local union from having contact with the workers in the group outside of Ihe workplace. If the employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within BO days and any resulting collective bargaining agreement will apply only to the agreed upon unit.
390
National Memorandum
5	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about al! aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fad-based information to employees as II endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management's role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including any obligations and responsibilities of the parties
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies or misstatements or any employee misunderstandings of information disseminated during the campaign process.
6	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position end are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union, or any other persons or entities during any part of this process. One way to ensure this objective is to have an NLRB conducted election.
in the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process called , “Consent Election*. This process will work as follows:
(a)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a third party neutral (TPN) proof of support by means of show of interest cards as described in Paragraph 3(a), above. The TPN will then notify Lucent and request a list of names, job titles and work addresses. The Company will furnish the list within three business days. The applicable Union will also be furnished with the list. The "show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election win be conducted to determine the will of the unit If the TPN determines that the Union(s) has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process In accordance with this agreement.
(b)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role it is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two (2) weeks of the submission of the Union’s show
391
National Memorandum
of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a secret ballot election. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with Paragraph 3(c) of this agreement, a majority of those who vote will control. Each party may have an observer present when Ihe TPN counts the ballots.
(c)	tn all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases in which there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of the TPN and/or of using a neutral site will be shared equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to the composition of the unit, the TPN shall either dedde the issue within an additional seven days or order an election as described above with the decision as to the composition of the unit to follow the election within no more than seven days.
7	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the Union(s) for access, local management and Union representatives will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by Union representatives. The Union(s) will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Lucent facilities. It is the intent and commitment of the parties that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Luoent generally and, specifically, the unit which Is the subject of the organizing campaign. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times.
If Lucent and the Union(s) are unable lo agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other Lucent units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and Is reasonable. Lucent and the Unlon(s) commit that they will negotiate an access agreement in an expeditious manner.
0 Dispute Resolution
(a) Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in

(t»
particular, local Lucent management and appropriate Union representatives. It is the intent and desire of Lucent and the Union/s} that such matters be dealt with and are best dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third parly. It is also agreed, however, that, if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter still remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. The TPN must be an active or retired attorney who has experience in, and is familiar with, NLRB procedures and precedents regarding unit determination issues. Either Lucent or the Unkwi(s) can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three business days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide a complete statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between themselves.
II the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e.. the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.), the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN wilt attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived access problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five (5) days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
393
National Memorandum
(d> If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties ere unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to the TPN and an expeditious hearing shall be conducted. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Lucent and the Unions believe that these matters are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Lucent and the Union(s) agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be foe exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses resulting from the use of the TPN process shall be shared equally by Lucent and the Union.
9 Acquisitions And Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications equipment industry. Lucent may acquire another entity, it has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license Its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in these entities may be unrepresented, represented in whole or in part by the CWA or IBEW. or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement
394
National Memorandum
Nevertheless, Lucent will, after an initial transition period of one year following the dosing on an acquisition, and subject to any contrary legal or contractual requirements, apply this Neutrality and Consent Election agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary.

Annual Review
On an annual basis, the Lucent Vice President of Workforce Effectiveness, the President of the CWA and the President of the IBEW may review whether there has been substantial compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and, if the parties find repeated instances of violations or repeated instances of interference during the period up to the review, may implement e process for recognition based on 'card check' to replace elections in all cases or, if not, this Agreement shall continue in effect for the remaining term of the Agreement.

Gentlemen:
Re:	Standing Joint Subcommittee on Testing
This will confirm our understanding reached during 1998 Bargaining that a CWA-IBEW-Lucent Technologies standing joint subcommittee on testing will be formed. The subcommittee, to be appointed.by the bargaining chairs, will consist of four (4) repressntatves from the Unions, two (2) from IBEW and two (2) from CWA, and four (4) representatives from the Company.
Measurement and Selection Systems (M&SS), part of Lucent’s corporate human resources organization, is the organization with sole responsibility for the development or selection, validation, and authorization of all tests and policy and procedures used in the selection of candidates for Lucent occupational positions. M&SS is responsible to ensure that such tests meet Federal and professional standards for relevance and non-discrimination.
If the committee identifies a test currently in use which has not been authorized by M&SS, the test will be suspended pending the outcome of a review and report Io the committee by M&SS.
At least thirty days prior to Implementation, M&SS will notify the members of the committee of the intent to implement a new test or to revise a test or critical test score. M&SS will communicate to members of the committee the following pertinent information concerning the test:
the purpose the objective
401
National Memorandum
the need for the test or change
the tltle(s) for which it will be a requirement
the business groups which will use it
After receiving the information desalbed above, if the committee so requests, a meeting will be held to explore appropriate ways for the Company and the Unions to make available opportunities to assist employees h development of the new skills or job knowledge. The committee will also be expected to Identify and recommend ways to maximize the many advantages and resources offered through the Alliance, ETOP, and ERC's in meeting the goals described above.
In addition, the committee may explore other issues with M&SS, including such matters as an apparent low percentage of employees qualifying on a specific test. Where the Committee agrees, a Third Party Neutral (TPN) may be selected to review any disputed new or revised test for relevancy and validity, applying appropriate legal standards. The TPN shall guarantee confidentiality of al! tests under review and shall not release test items or scores to any person or entity. The TPN shall make recommendations to the Committee about the disputed test or score. Nothing herein shall prevent the implementation or use of a test during the TPN review.
The committee will meet upon request of the members, but no less than four (4) times a year to review new or revised tests.

Mr. Morton Bahr, President
Communications Workers of America
1925 K Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005
Dear Mr. Bahn
I am writing to respond to the expressions of concern raised at the Operations bargaining table regarding the Company’s contracting out of work, which have focused on situations in which a layoff is pending or has occurred (and exbargaining unit members retain recall rights) within the same force adjustment area where the work is to be contacted, and in job titles whose occupants would traditionally have performed such work.
I do not believe that CWA and AT&T have diverse views on this subject,
As to such work normally performed by our employees, we have always preferred not to contract such work out if it would otherwise be performed by bargaining unit employees in job titles in a geographical commuting area <1) where layoffs of such employees are pending; or (2) where a layoff has already occurred and such laid off bargaining unit members retain recall rights and are available to perform such work.
In the future, the Company will not contract out such work, under the conditions outlined above, except when it has no other reasonable alternative. Under such circumstances, the Company will discuss its decision with the Union.
Very truly yours,
/s/ RAYMOND E. WILLIAMS
