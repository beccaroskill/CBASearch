ARTICLE 7
Wages, Hours of Work, and Overtime
Section 1
The standard hourly wage rates for the respective job classifications covered by this agreement are set forth in Exhibit I.
Section 2
The workweek for all wage calculations begins with the start of the first shift worked after 12 midnight Sunday and continues for 168 hours.
Section 3
Overtime at the rate of one and one half of the employee's standard hourly wage rate (or the wage rate resulting from the application of one of the following pay differential percentages:
5
ARTICLE 7
Wages, Hours of Work, and Overtime
(+1%, +/-3%, +5%, +/-6%, +/-8%, +/-10%, +/-12%, +/-15%, +/-17%, +/-20%, +/-25%) will be paid for actual hours worked (time paid for as an allowance will not be considered as time worked in calculating overtime hours) in excess of 40 hours in a work week.
a.	For all hours in excess of 40 in a work week, overtime will be paid at a rate of time and a half.
b.	If an employee's work schedule is changed by the Company as a result of "call-in" with less than 48 hours of notice of the change between the scheduled end of the last scheduled shift worked and the start of the first shift on the changed schedule, the employee will be paid for the hours worked on the new schedule at straight time, the actual hours worked will count toward the calculation of weekly overtime, and the employee will receive a pay allowance equal to four hours pay at his/her standard rate or the rate of the job being performed.
c.	If an employee is normally scheduled to be off on a Holiday the hours scheduled to be off/missed will be counted as hours worked for the purpose of calculating weekly overtime. (Reference Letter of Understanding #5 for clarification).
d.	If an employee is called back to work for a full shift and there is less than 16 hours between the scheduled end of his/her prior shift and the beginning of the shift the employee was called in to work; the employee will be paid for the hours worked on the call in schedule at straight time, the hours worked will count toward the calculation of weekly overtime, and the employee will receive a pay allowance equal to one half of the hours worked on the call in. These provisions apply except in the instance it has been agreed to by two employees with the Company's approval for an exchange shift or when the Company approves an individual's request for a change of shift. If the call back is for less than a shift, it will be treated as an Emergency Call-in. The 12-12-12 and the 8-12-12-8 work schedules are not subject to quick come back overtime. Quick-comeback will be paid when there is 8 hours or less between shifts, except vacation coverage, and those schedules listed above.
e.	If an individual employee's work schedule is changed from his/her normal or regular work schedule such that he/she is scheduled off on a Holiday on which he/she would have otherwise worked, and then scheduled to work another previously unscheduled day, then those Holiday hours not worked shall count as hours worked in the
6
ARTICLE 7
Wages, Hours of Work, and Overtime
accumulation of hours for overtime pay purposes. Plant shutdowns are interpreted as schedule changes in this case.
f.	Any scheduled vacation taken in increments of 40 hours (5 days) or less in a work week will be counted as hours worked for purposes of calculating overtime for that work week.
Section 4
Any hours which are paid for at overtime rates under any section, article or provision of this Agreement shall not be counted as hours worked for the purpose of any other section, article, or provision of this Agreement calling for overtime or premium pay except those hours worked on a contract listed Holiday and those hours not worked (scheduled to be missed) on a Holiday as described above.
Section 5
a.	Employees shall work such reasonable overtime as may be required by the Company. The Company shall give as much notice of the overtime assignment as may be practicable under the circumstances.
b.	If an employee is asked to stay over in an emergency, not including work completion or delayed relief situations, the actual hours worked will be included in the calculation of weekly overtime.
Section 6
Overtime will be distributed among employees within each department as equitably as possible, according to procedures within the Department taking into consideration the skills and qualifications of employees, their work schedules, and the Company production schedules. Any employee who is required to work overtime and fails to work will be considered as having worked overtime for distribution of overtime purposes only. Records showing overtime distribution will be posted annually and weekly beginning anew each January 1st.
Section 7
a.	It is expected that from time to time employees may be assigned or contractually required to work on a higher or lower classified job. In the instances when an employee is assigned to a job or contractually required to work on a job with a rate classification either higher or lower than his/her standard rate, the employee will receive a pay
7
ARTICLE 7
Wages, Hours of Work, and Overtime
differential percentage for the actual hours worked on either the higher or lower classified job equal to either (+1%, +/-3%, +5%, +/-6%, +/-8%, +/-10%, +/-12%, +/-15%, +/-17%, +/-20%, +/-25%,) of his/her standard rate. The percentage pay differential will be that percentage which most closely approximates the difference in his/her standard rate and the rate for the higher or lower classified job. In the event the employee is eligible for an additional $.50 per hour as the result of holding an additional qualification (s), the percentage pay differential will include the full $.50 per hour for each additional qualification. (NOTE: Please see Letter of Understanding 6 for further explanation of pay for employees temporarily assigned)
b.	If an employee is temporarily transferred by the Company or assigned by the Company to perform the duties of a job having a lower rate classification, he/she shall be paid at his/her standard hourly wage rate for all purposes. This shall not apply when a reduction of the workforce occurs.
Section 8
a.	Any employee who reports for a scheduled shift of work but is unable to complete 4 hours work due to lack of work will be granted a pay allowance for the difference between 4 hours and the time actually worked. Only the hours actually worked will count toward the calculation of weekly overtime. This allowance will be paid at the employee's standard hourly wage rate, except where failure to provide work is for reasons beyond the control of the Company or where an employee who has been absent from work has failed to previously notify the person designated by the Company of his/her intention to return to work.
b.	If an employee starts his/her scheduled shift and is sent home before completing the scheduled 8 hour shift he/she would receive pay for the hours actually worked or a minimum of four hours, whichever is greater. Only the hours actually worked will count toward the calculation of weekly overtime. This allowance will be paid except where failure to provide work is for reasons beyond the control of the Company.
c.	When an employee requests to leave before completing his/her scheduled work period, and is granted permission by his/her supervisor, he/she shall be paid only for the time actually worked. Actual hours worked will be included in the calculation of weekly overtime.
8
ARTICLE 7
Wages, Hours of Work, and Overtime
d.	Any hours of reporting pay given to an employee for time not actually worked shall not be counted for purposes of computing overtime and shall not be paid for at overtime rates.
Section 9
a.	Employees who are called in or scheduled before the start of their regular shift and work until the beginning of that shift are not eligible for a pay allowance unless they are eligible for the quick come back/call-in allowance. They will be paid for actual hours worked at their standard wage rate plus any applicable percentage difference between their standard wage rate and the rate of the job being worked, and shall be entitled to work on his/her regular turn.
b.	Emergency work is work which cannot be anticipated or deferred, cannot be handled by personnel already at work, and which necessitates calling in an employee at a time other than the employee's normal work schedule. It is expected that the employee called in will report to the workplace as soon as possible following notification.
1.	Reporting for EMERGENCY WORK - Except as otherwise limited in this paragraph, employees who report for emergency work and who work less than 4 hours will be given a pay allowance for the difference between 4 hours and the hours actually worked. Employees who report for emergency work less than 4 hours prior to the start of their regular shift, and who do not work continuously to the start of the shift, will be eligible for a pay allowance. The pay allowance will be based on the amount of time between the actual start of work and the start of the regular shift less the time actually worked.
2.	An employee may be called in multiple times for EMERGENCY WORK on the same day. If these EMERGENCY WORK periods fall within a four hour time span, an allowance will only be paid for time not worked during the entire four hours.
c.	Extra work is work scheduled in advance at a time other than the employee's normal work schedule. Extra work may also include time spent in activities such as medical reexaminations, meetings, training sessions, or lectures.
1.	Except as otherwise limited in this paragraph, employees scheduled for extra work and who work less than 2 hours will be given a pay allowance for the difference between 2 hours and the hours actually worked. Employees scheduled for extra work less than 2 hours prior to the start of their regular shift, and who do not work
9
ARTICLE 7	Wages, Hours of Work, and Overtime
continuously to the start of the shift, will be eligible for a pay allowance. The pay allowance will be based on the amount of time between the actual start of work and the start of the regular shift, less the time actually worked. (Example: An employee scheduled for extra work who starts work 1 1/i hours before the beginning of the regularly scheduled shift and works for 1 hour is eligible for a pay allowance of J6 hour under this guideline.) This allowance will be paid at the employee's base rate of pay.
d.	Time worked by personnel called in for emergency work or scheduled for extra work begins when the employee arrives at the designated reporting area (the normal work location, a job site, shop area, or mobile equipment parking facility) and normally ends when the employee leaves the designated area. Time worked should include activities following arrival at the designated reporting area such as necessary planning or instruction, picking up tools, transportation from a shop area to a job site, and, when required, clothes change and shower time. If the employee's supervision is not at the work area when work begins or ends, time worked should be documented by the employee and provided to the supervisor.
Section 10
a.	Shift differential premiums will be paid to:
1.	All shift employees.
2.	Non-shift employees of any department when they are scheduled to work and do work on the 3-11 and 11-7 shifts. This provision includes work completion or call-in assignments during the 3-11 and 11-7 shifts.
3.	For hours worked on the 3-11 shift by employees mentioned above, a shift differential premium of $.70 per hour will be paid; for all hours worked on the 11-7 shift by employees mentioned above, a $.85 per hour shift differential premium will be paid.
b.	Shift differential premiums shall be used in calculating overtime compensation.
Section 11
Pay shall be bi-weekly with employees having a choice between direct deposit and having a check mailed to their home address.
10
ARTICLE 8 Vacation Eligibility
Section 12
Work schedules may be changed by the Company at any time provided at least fortyeight (48) hours advance notice has been given to the affected employees. Days of work will be scheduled consecutively whenever practicable, taking into consideration the hours of operation and scheduling difficulties. Any work schedule changes with less than fortyeight (48) hours' notice shall be regarded as "call-in".

Overtime Procedures
EXHIBIT IV Overtime Procedures
PRODUCTION DEPARTMENT - Overtime Procedures
The following guidelines will be used in determining overtime distribution for an individual department or group provided its employees have the required skills. With the exception of overtime required to fill vacancies for vacation relief, the following procedure will be used after it has been determined that overtime is required.
a.	When a vacancy exists, the incumbent job holder working the shift preceding the vacancy will be the first person asked to fill the vacancy provided his/her consecutive hours worked will not exceed sixteen (16) hours. Should the vacancy not be filled in this manner, the remaining incumbent job holders (including relief operator) will be asked next starting with the lowest employee. (The lowest employee is defined as the individual having the lowest total accumulated hours of overtime (worked and refused) as shown on the current overtime list.) When two or more employees have identical total overtime (within four (4) hours), the employee highest in seniority will be the first asked.
b.	If the vacancy is not filled in Step 1, any qualified employee(s) can be asked. Monthly inventory requirements will be filled under this step.
c.	Overtime coverage of a vacancy may be shared by two (2) employees. However, the first employee who agrees to cover the full vacancy will be allowed to do so, canceling (no refusal to be charged) any prior agreement by an employee to cover part of the vacancy. When two employees in the order of asking agree to share coverage of the vacancy, it will be deemed filled.
d.	An employee who refuses an overtime offer will be charged with refusal equivalent to the hours worked and will not be asked again during the next 24-hour period, unless an emergency or unusual situation occurs.
e.	An employee called for overtime while off due to illness or injury will not be charged with refusal, provided he/she has previously called in and reported off through proper channels.
f.	When an employee returns to work after an extended absence of ten (10) or more scheduled work days, due to illness or injury, his/her standing on the current overtime list

will be adjusted by adding the required hours to his/her overtime total to restore him/her to the same relative position on the list as he/she was at the start of his/her absence.
g.	An employee called for overtime while on vacation will not be charged if he/she refuses to come in. (An employee on vacation will be called only as a last resort or when an emergency is imminent.)
h.	When an employee enters the department via the bidding, bumping, or recall procedures or upon being newly hired, the employee will be charged with overtime hours such that his/her total charged overtime is one hour greater than the highest total charged hours of any other department member.
i.	An employee(s) who is scheduled for a sixth work day within a calendar week may exercise an option to obtain his/her own replacement. Replacement must be qualified and physically able to perform the job. Replacement must be obtained and supervision notified prior to twenty-four (24) hours of the desired schedule change.
j.	A separate overtime list will be maintained for each department. The list will be updated on Tuesday of each week and will serve as the basis for offering overtime during the next seven (7) calendar days.
k.	Overtime hours worked in another department will accumulate in both the department where an employee is temporarily assigned and the employee's regular department.
MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT - Overtime Procedures
The following guidelines will be used in determining overtime distribution for Maintenance Department employees having the required skills.
a.	Call-in or scheduled overtime will be offered first to the "lowest employee" having the required skills. "Lowest employee" is defined as the individual having the lowest total accumulated hours of overtime (worked and refused). The two exceptions to the lowest employee first rule are defined in items b and c below.
b.	The incumbent job holder working the shift preceding the vacancy will be the first person asked to fill the vacancy provided his/her consecutive hours worked will not exceed 16 hours.
54
EXHIBIT IV
Overtime Procedures
c.	When a job extends beyond the normal quitting time, those employees working on the job (job continuation) will be given first consideration to work over to complete the job. An employee in this position who refuses to work over will be charged with the equivalent hours required to complete the job.
d.	When calling for overtime in the maintenance department, the company will first use the voluntary overtime list then use the regular overtime list.
e.	An employee called for overtime while off due to illness or injury will not be charged with refusal, provided he/she has previously called in and reported off through proper channels.
f.	When an employee returns to work after an extended absence of ten (10) or more scheduled work days, due to illness or injury, his/her standing on the current overtime list will be adjusted by adding the required hours to his/her overtime total to restore him/her to the same relative position on the list as he/she was at the start of his/her absence.
g.	An employee called for overtime while on vacation will not be charged if he/she refuses to come in. (An employee on vacation will be called only as a last resort or when an emergency is imminent).
h.	When two or more employees have identical total accumulated overtime hours, the employee highest in seniority will be the first asked.
i.	When an employee is called between the hours of 11:30 p.m. and 7:30 a.m. for an emergency call-in and the Supervisor making the call is advised the individual is not at home or is otherwise unavailable, the employee will be considered to have refused the overtime and will be charged with three (3) hours overtime, or the equivalent hours to complete the job whichever is greater.
j.	When an employee enters a department via the bidding, bumping or recall procedures, he/she will be charged with overtime hours such that his/her total overtime hours exceed the highest total hours of any person in the Department by one (1) hour.
k.	It is permissible for personnel to "split" shift overtime (work four hours each).
55
EXHIBIT V Workforce Flexibility
I.	Overtime hours worked in another department will accumulate in both the department where an employee is temporarily assigned and the employee's regular department.
m.	An overtime standing sheet will be issued weekly for each craft and will serve as the basis for determining the lowest employee for overtime purposes. Overtime standings will be updated on Tuesday of each week. However, during the month of December of each calendar year, common sense may be used when it is known for a fact that the position on the list has changed due to a person receiving overtime between reports.
n. Maintenance Overtime Call-in List
A weekly list shall be composed of volunteers and asked in order of existing OT guidelines. OT hours worked by call-in volunteers will be kept separately. Therefore, the OT worked and refused will be kept completely separate from the normal department OT. Forced OT guidelines will remain the same.
It should be remembered that the basic reason for overtime is to make repairs and to get operations resumed in a prompt and orderly manner. Any method of overtime distribution ultimately adopted must, of necessity, reflect this objective. These considerations must be made and, in making them, there will be occasions when the lowest employee will be by-passed in order to bring in the individual(s) considered to have the skills to resolve the problem in a more timely and efficient manner.

Letter of Understanding 1 - VIP
The parties agree that bargaining unit employees are eligible for the Eastman Variable Incentive Plan program.
Letter of Understanding 2 - Fire Watch
The Company agrees to fill firewatch needs by recalling employees on layoff status in order of seniority and qualifications. Employees must hold a job qualification to be

EXHIBIT XI LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
recalled to this position or to bump to this position. Employees wilt be recalled provided there are 4 or more hours of firewatch work anticipated in a given week. If additional work is available beyond the initial 4 hours of firewatch, employees will be assigned additional work up to 8 hours.
In the event that no employees are available from layoff status, the Company will determine the method for filling firewatch needs. It is furthered agreed that employees recalled from layoff to perform firewatch work will be paid at a Rate Class 1.
Letter of Understanding 3 - Shipping Department
During the course of 2004 collective bargaining negotiations, the Company and Union have agreed to modify rates of pay in the Shipping Department.
Effective with the 2004 agreement, current employees holding a bid job in the Shipping Department will be red circled in their current rate of pay and will continue to be eligible for all applicable mark-up rates of pay.
All employees entering the Shipping Department by bid in the future will be paid at a Rate Class 5 and will be ineligible for any mark-up rates of pay.
This will establish the Rate Class 5 as the only rate of pay in the Shipping Department.
Letter of Understanding 4 - Maintenance Pager (Original Date 3/4/2002) (This section is intentionally left blank.)
Letter of Understanding 5 - Off on a Holiday (Original Date-9/6/01)
There has been a disagreement in the interpretation of Article 7, Section 3, Paragraph (c) in the recently ratified contract.
The contract section reads:
If an employee is normally scheduled to be off on a Holiday, the hours scheduled to be off/missed will be counted as hours worked for the purpose of calculating weekly overtime.
The Union has interpreted this to mean that if an employee who is working a rotating shift schedule and his/her scheduled day of rest falls on a holiday, then the holiday hours (8 hours) should count as hours worked for the calculation of weekly overtime.
65
EXHIBIT XI
LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
The Company has interpreted this to mean that "normally scheduled to be off on a holiday" means the employee does not normally work on holidays (day workers) and that rotating shift workers are normally scheduled to work holidays (75% of them work every holiday); therefore, holidays that fall on a scheduled day of rest do not count as hours worked for the calculation of weekly overtime.
Both parties acknowledge the misunderstanding and that it is a result of miscommunication rather than an intent by either party to mislead or misrepresent their position to the other party. Further, both parties acknowledge acceptance of the Union's interpretation will result in:
B employees receiving compensation for hours they did not receive compensation for under previous labor agreements
B rotating shift workers receiving advantageous treatment when compared with day workers
B compensation for holiday hours not being spread evenly over the employees on the four turns and that acceptance of the Company's interpretation will result in:
- some employees receiving less pay than they anticipated when voting to ratify the contract
» a continuation of past pay practices related to holidays falling on a scheduled day of rest for employees working a rotating shift schedule
H acceptance of standard Eastman wording and interpretation related to holiday hours falling on a scheduled day of rest in an effort to resolve the issue in a manner that is fair and equitable to both parties, the Union and the Company agree to the following terms for the duration of this contract
1)	For rotating shift employees (A-B-C-D Schedule), one turn out of four has a scheduled day of rest on a holiday. All four turns are scheduled for at least 40 hours of work during a week (three turns are scheduled for 40 hours and one turn is scheduled for 48 hours). When a holiday falls on the scheduled day of rest for these rotating shift workers, four hours will be counted as time worked for the calculation of weekly overtime.
2)	For day shift employees, holidays are normally not scheduled to be worked and the work week is reduced by eight hours due to the holiday. For day shift employees, the
66
EXHIBIT XI
LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
eight hours missed/not worked on the holiday will be counted as time worked for the calculation of weekly overtime.
3)	For other schedules or situations where the work week is reduced below 40 hours due to a holiday, the observance of the holiday results in 8 hours being counted toward the calculation of weekly overtime. For example, if a rotating shift schedule employee (either A-B-C-D or X-Y-Z who is not normally scheduled to be off on a holiday), has his/her schedule changed by management to not work on a holiday (this is not when a holiday falls on a scheduled day of rest); for example management shuts down an operation on a holiday due to low demand and "gives" the employees the holiday, the rotating shift employee will be treated the same as a day shift employee. Eight hours for the shift would be counted toward the calculation of weekly overtime.
4)	Employees who were working the rotating shift schedule and the July 4, 2001 and September 3, 2001 (Labor Day) holidays fell on their scheduled days of rest; the eight hours for each of those holidays will be counted as hours worked for the calculation of weekly overtime. This is a one-time action designed to relieve the dissatisfaction caused by the misunderstanding.
Further, the Union and the Company agree that these are interim actions for the duration of this contract. During negotiation of subsequent contracts, the Union and the Company will address this as a new issue and agree not to treat the interim solutions as precedence for future agreements.
Letter of Understanding 6 - Staffing (Original Date 7/18/2002)
Introduction
It is the Company's policy to satisfy staffing requirements in a cost effective manner while maintaining employment stability for Eastman employees. It is also the Company's intent to provide fair and equitable treatment to all employees. To those ends and in response to questions raised by Union leadership, the Company proposes the following letter of understanding. The provisions of this understanding apply to instances when an employee is assigned to temporarily work on a Rate Class job that is higher than his/her base or standard Rate Class. If an employee is temporarily assigned to work a job which has a lower Rate Class than his/her base or standard Rate Class, the provisions of Article 7, Section 7, paragraph (b) will apply.
67
EXHIBIT XI
LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
Categories of Staffing Requirements
Changes in staffing requirements will generally fall into one of three basic categories.
1)	Permanent - when there is an opening in a recognized job assignment. Normally, a "permanent" vacancy is the result of an incumbent leaving his/her job assignment with no reasonable management expectation of the employee returning to that job in the future.
2)	Temporary Long-Term - when there is either:
0	Reasonable management expectation that an incumbent will be absent from his/her job assignment for at least thirteen (13) consecutive weeks but will be able to return to the job at the end of the absence, or
0	A new job assignment has been created and it is expected that there will be a need for the assignment for more than thirteen (13) consecutive weeks but less than fifty-two (52) consecutive weeks
3)	Temporary Short-Term - when there is an opening in a recognized job assignment that is expected to last for less than thirteen (13) consecutive weeks.
Methods for Meeting Staffing Requirements
Permanent vacancies will be filled using the bidding and the qualification processes contained in the collective bargaining agreement.
Temporary Short-Term and Temporary Long-Term vacancies will be filled using the process in Article 12(A), Job Vacancies, Posting, Transfers and Temporary Job Moves (Production and Maintenance Department); Section 6, Temporary Job Move.
Compensation Treatment while on a Temporary Job Assignment
Temporary Short-Term assignments to a Rate Class higher than the employee's base or standard Rate Class:
■ The employee remains on his/her base/standard Rate Classification
68
EXHIBIT XI LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
0 All pay allowances (vacation, holiday, paid time off, etc.) are provided at the employee's base/standard Rate Class rate or the rate of the temporary job, whichever is greater. Reference contract provisions Article 8, Section 2, Paragraph f; Article 9, Section 3; Article 18, Section 1, etc. (Note: These references are not meant to be all inclusive but to serve as examples of the shared intent of the labor agreement.)
n The employee receives a pay differential as described in Article 12 (A), Section 6, Paragraph (g) in the collective bargaining agreement.
Temporary Long-Term assignments to a Rate Class job higher than the employee's base or standard Rate Class:
n The employee receives a "Temporary Promotion", (the "Temporary Promotion" is made within the SAP R/3 system) to the Rate Class of the job being worked.
a All pay allowances (vacation, holiday, paid time off, etc.) that are provided during the time of the "Temporary Promotion" are made at the Rate Class of the job being worked.
a When the "Temporary Promotion" is completed the employee returns to the Rate Class of his/her permanent bid job.
These statements do represent an addition to the collective bargaining agreement and would result in an expansion of the practices that have been followed since July 1, 2001.
Effective Date
This Letter of Understanding will become effective with the start of the payroll week on July 29, 2002 and expire with the expiration of the current Labor Agreement.
Special Situations
0 Employees who are on temporary work assignments on July 29, 2002 and if the sum of the time they have previously worked on the higher classified job plus the time management reasonably expects the assignment to continue is greater than thirteen (13) weeks they will receive a "Temporary Promotion" to the higher Rate Class job that is effective July 29, 2002 and continue until they are relieved from the higher classified job. There will be no retroactive pay calculations.
69
EXHIBIT XI
LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
a If an employee receives a Temporary Short Term assignment and the circumstances change such that management has a reasonable expectation, the assignment will be extended to exceed thirteen (13) weeks from the time the employee first started the Temporary Short Term assignment to the adjusted anticipated end of the assignment, the employee will receive a "Temporary Promotion" to the higher Rate Classification effective the first payroll Monday following the expectation of extending the assignment. There will be no retroactive pay calculations.
Letter of Understanding 7 - Maintenance Department Overtime
This document is an addendum to the Maintenance Department Overtime Procedures. Its sole purpose is to provide clarification and definition to this paragraph.
Job continuation is appropriate when all of the following criteria are met:
a)	A sense of urgency exists
b)	The work to be done is important
c)	It is efficient to do the work in this manner Emergencies or urgent repairs needed to keep the plant, operating unit or piece of equipment running constitute some of the examples of when job continuation is to be used.
Schedulable, multiple day jobs that are not of an urgent and important nature, and which would be inefficient to use job continuation, should not utilize job continuation.
Definitions of Terms:
Urgency - calling for immediate attention
Important - indicative of significant worth or consequence.
Efficient - a potential for action or use in such a way so as to avoid loss or waste of energy in effecting, producing or functioning.
When a daylight maintenance employee is called out prior to his/her shift and works extended hours, there is to be an 8-hour rest period that will be normally required prior to returning to work their regular scheduled shift. If the rest period precludes them from working their regular shift, that time not worked will be counted toward the calculation of weekly OT but will not be paid. Any portion of the day that the employee works will default to their regular work schedule. Any exception will require supervisor and department manager approval.

Letter of Understanding 8 - Outside Contractors
During the course of recent collective bargaining agreement negotiations, the Union and the Company discussed the implementation of the policy outlined in the management rights function article of the 2004 Agreement. This policy requires the Company to notify and consult the Union when outside contractors are used. The parties agree that the subject of "Subcontracting" will be included as a standing agenda item for Monthly LMPSC meetings.
Letter of Understanding 9 - Maintenance Subcontractors
During the course of recent collective bargaining agreement negotiations, the Company and the Union have agreed upon new language in the area of maintenance subcontracting, specifically management rights articles. This letter will confirm certain understandings reached by the parties concerning the parties' intent with respect to implementing the above referenced language.
The Company recognizes the importance of its skilled trades personnel to the overall, efficient operation of the Jefferson Plant and, where feasible, in accordance with the specific language of management rights article shall continue to utilize Maintenance Department personnel in lieu of hiring outside subcontractors. However, as in the past, the parties recognize that, under certain circumstances, the Company will continue to hire outside contractors to perform certain maintenance and construction tasks; e.g., those involving certain skills which are generally unavailable in the plant work force in the area of automotive maintenance, sheet metal and layout work, code welding and equipment erection, or additionally, those tasks that cannot be completed within time and cost limitations by plant personnel. The aforementioned examples are not meant to be all inclusive, but rather, illustrate selected examples of special circumstances which require the use of outside contractors.
It is further understood that the Company will continue to consider the skills and abilities of employees, other than skilled trades employees, who are subject to layoff when making the decisions to hire outside contractors.
Letter of Understanding 10-Short Term Disabiuty/Long Term Disability
The maximum benefit for Short Term Disability for all Employees is twenty six (26) weeks (1040 hours). Effective 1/1/15, there will be no unpaid waiting week required. In all
71
EXHIBIT XI
LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
cases of disability of 40 or more work hours you must present acceptable medical evidence that you are unable to work to the Medical Department within the time limits required by Eastman. Employees will not be paid STD for absences less than 40 consecutive hours.
In the event an employee is receiving Short Term Disability benefits, he/she may, upon request schedule vacation. For any vacation taken, the employee will receive his/her vacation allowance and the time will not count toward diminishing the STD benefit.
The employee will not be permitted to receive a vacation allowance and STD benefit simultaneously.
In the event that a former employee is rehired after a condition or injury which resulted in Long Term Disability status, the employee's seniority with the Union shall be restored. In order to qualify for rehire by the Company, the former employee must meet all eligibility requirements for employment, including but not limited to, having been an employee in good standing, meeting all essentia! elements of the job for which he/she is being considered and a clear status in all other pre-employment screening requirements of employment.
Letter of Understanding 11 - Holiday Allowance
Holiday allowance will be paid at the employee's standard rate classification or temporary transfer rate, whichever is higher, at the time of the holiday.
Letter of Understanding 12 - Work Coverage Posting
An employee who signs a "work coverage posting" (not vacation coverage) agreeing to work overtime and who fails to do so will be appropriately recorded as absent for those hours not worked. The employee will be required to report off in accordance with the "Call-Off System" provisions. This general rule will not apply to vacation coverage in those cases where the employee signs for the overtime and is unable to fulfill this commitment but who obtains coverage in accordance with the applicable overtime provisions and also notifies the appropriate supervisor of the change.

EXHIBIT XI LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
Letter of Understanding 13 - Return From Layoff
If a person is physically unfit to return from layoff when recalled, his/her condition will be confirmed by a Company designated physician. After such confirmation, he/she will retain recall rights for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the effective date of his/her original layoff or the length of his/her plant seniority, whichever is shorter.
The affected person may exercise his/her right to return to work during the time specified in the preceding paragraph upon verification by a Company designated physician that he/she is physically capable of performing his/her regular job assignment.
In no event will such recall rights extend beyond twenty-four (24) months from the original date of layoff, unless said person makes application for a Leave of Absence and such leave is granted by the Company.
Letter of Understanding 14 - Non-Refundable Vacation

Letter of Understanding 18- Maintenance Dept. Forced Overtime
The following procedure will be used for Maintenance Department forced overtime:
The purpose of this procedure is to guide the Maintenance Department in the selection of needed craft people for the repair of equipment at the Jefferson Plant.
In the event craft people are needed to work over and finish work or make repairs to equipment that is deemed by management necessary to keep the plant in operation, this procedure will be followed. This procedure will address those times when all other means of securing resources from our craft people have failed.
Maintenance Overtime List - Document of hours worked and refused for the Maintenance Department.
-	Hours Worked - Accumulation of hours worked
-	Hours Refused - Accumulation of hours refused
-	Total Hours Worked - Accumulation of both hours worked and refused
When it becomes necessary to secure craft people to continue a repair or to provide skills to a new failure on plant equipment, this procedure must be followed in the steps noted:
During the course of 2009 contract negotiations, the parties agreed- to the following clarification of Letter of Understanding #18.
Continuance of a repair past normal quitting time:
a)	Job Continuation (Including Shift Utility Mechanics)
74
EXHIBIT XI LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
b)	Overtime list for the craft needed
c)	Shift Mechanics
d)	Forced by lowest number of overtime hours worked
1.	Lowest number of overtime hours worked is required to work the overtime.
(The force will come from the Craft/Group that was working on the job.) Example: If Mechanics are working on a job, Mechanics will be forced. If Pipe/Steam are working on the job, Pipe/Steam will be forced. If Electricians are working the job, Electricians will be forced. If Shift Mechanics are working the job, Shift Mechanics will be forced.
2.	if more than one Craft/Group is working on the job, the force will come from the Craft/Group that is needed to complete the work. Example: If Pipe/Steam and Shift Mechanic are working on a job and someone has to be forced, the Craft/Group that has not been filled by the overtime list will be forced.
In addition, it is understood that lists are necessary for certain jobs. This is the case with Janitor and Snow Removal Overtime. People who volunteer for the overtime from working those jobs should be kept separate. Therefore, the overtime worked and refused on Janitor and Snow Removal will be kept completely separate from the normal department overtime. Effective this week, February 7, 2010, a separate Janitor and separate snow removal list will be maintained. Beginning this week, folks will be asked in order, lowest to highest, according to total hours asked and refused. These hours shall be considered separate, and will not be included in the normal department overtime lists.
