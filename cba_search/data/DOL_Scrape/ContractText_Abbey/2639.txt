The school year shall be the period July 1 through June 30.
E.	REASSIGNMENT OF SUPPORTIVE STAFF TEACHERS FOR THE FOLLOWING SCHOOL YEAR

5
Procedure A. Voluntary Transfer
Teachers desiring to transfer to vacancies in another school or program for the following school year shall file a written request with the Human Resources Department not later than April 1st of the year immediately preceding the year for which the transfer is desired. All transfers will be completed on or before June 30.
All voluntary transfers shall be based on:
1.	The transferring teacher meeting all governmental and court ordered requirements.
2.	Specialized academic needs of the District
3.	Length of service in District.
If a teacher’s request for voluntary transfer is rejected, the teacher shall receive the reasons for the denial from the Division of Human Resources.
Where employees' length of service is equal or within sixty (60) days of being equal, the teacher possessing the greatest professional preparation as measured by the District's degree code (utilized for salary schedule purposes) shall prevail.
Procedure B. Involuntary Transfer
(Reference also Section D. ASSIGNMENT OF TEACHERS WITHIN A SCHOOL OR PROGRAM)
All involuntary transfers shall be based on governmental requirements of race and/or sex balance, length of service in the District, professional preparation and the specialized academic needs of a given school or program. Grounds for involuntary transfer from one school or program to another for the following school year are as follows:
1.	Specialized academic and staffing needs of a school or program
2.	Declining enrollment
3.	School closing
4.	Emergencies unforeseen by normal school operation
5.	School reorganization
6.	Employee discipline
7.	Governmental requirements of race and/or sex balance
8.	Recall from layoff
Where employees' length of service is equal or within sixty (60) days of being equal, the teacher possessing the highest performance evaluation scores and the greatest professional preparation as measured by the District's degree code (utilized for salary schedule purposes) shall prevail.
6
An involuntary transfer for reasons other than discipline will be effected only after a communication, verbal or written, between the teacher and the immediate supervisor.
Disciplinary transfers, when necessary, shall be for documented cause and shall follow a conference with the Human/Employee Relations Specialist. The teacher may be accompanied by a representative. The use of the grievance procedure shall not stop the effectiveness of the transfer, pending resolution of the grievance. If a grievance is initiated, it shall be at Step 3.
Procedure C. Transfers in Case of Division of Family Services Investigations
1.	When the District receives notice that the Missouri Division of Family Services (DFS) or other agency is investigating a teacher for alleged child abuse, the District may immediately place the employee on paid suspension, removing the employee from any active assignment involving interaction with students. The District may reassign the teacher to a nonteaching assignment. The District will consider the nature of the allegations and the facts of the particular situation in deciding whether or not it is necessary to temporarily suspend the employee. Such a suspension is not to be disciplinary. The District and the Teacher's Unit recognize that it may be in the best interest of the teacher, students and the District to remove the teacher from the classroom while an investigation is pending. Any discipline imposed by the District will be based on the results of its investigation.
2.	If an employee is on paid suspension because of a DFS investigation, and the DFS issues a finding, the Human Resources Department shall make a prompt determination of the teacher's status, and take the following action or actions:
a.	Return the teacher to the teacher's prior position. If the suspension has lasted more than thirty (30) school days, the teacher may be placed in an equivalent position;
b.	Implement appropriate discipline;
c.	Implement a voluntary transfer of the teacher to another assignment if the teacher agrees to the transfer; or
d.	Continue the suspension with pay pending the District’s own investigation.
If the District completes its investigation prior to a DFS finding, it may take one of the actions in a, b, or c above.
1
3.	In the case where the District determines that the investigation should continue beyond the time of the DFS finding, the employee will be notified in writing of this decision. This suspension will be with pay. The suspension will last only so long as it is reasonably necessary to determine whether the facts warrant disciplinary action.
4.	The employee may challenge the length of the investigatory suspension no sooner than the fifteenth school day following a determination by DFS. This challenge will be filed with the Superintendent, who may appoint a designee to decide the issue. The Superintendent will determine whether or not the investigation should continue, and will render a decision within five (5) working days. If the Superintendent allows the investigatory suspension to continue, the employee may again challenge the length of the suspension no sooner than the fifteenth working day following the Superintendent's decision. This process may be repeated as necessary to assure that investigatory suspension time is kept to a reasonable minimum.
5.	If the Superintendent determines that the investigatory suspension should end, he/she will direct the Human Resources Department to enter a determination of the teacher’s status within five (5) working days. The Human Resources Department will thereupon take one or more of the following actions:
a.	Return the teacher to the teacher's prior position. If the suspension has lasted more than thirty (30) school days, the teacher may be placed in an equivalent position.
b.	Implement appropriate discipline.
c.	Implement a voluntary transfer of the teacher to another assignment if the teacher agrees to the transfer.
6.	If the Human Resources Department implements discipline under this Procedure C, the employee may grieve the discipline, commencing at Step 3 before the District Legal Counsel in lieu of the Human Resources Department.
H. TRANSFERS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR
Transfers made necessary during the school year shall be completed pursuant to either Procedure A, B or C in TRANSFER OF A TEACHER FROM ONE SCHOOL OR PROGRAM TO ANOTHER. Transfers should be voluntary, if possible.
1-	EMPLOYEE PLACEMENT NOTIFICATION
When an employee in the Teachers' Unit files a written application for an advertised District position, that employee shall receive a written acknowledgement of the application and
8
written notification of the outcome of the application. Failure to provide notification does not invalidate the selection procedure.
J.	PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION REPORTS TO BE DISTRIBUTED
It shall be standard practice for principals or their designees to inform teachers of school preliminary organizations prior to the end of the current school year.
K.	FACULTY MEETINGS
Each faculty may elect a faculty committee, or in its absence, use the staff advisory committee whose function will be to meet with the principal for the purpose of preparing agendas for faculty meetings. The agenda for a faculty meeting shall be available prior to the meeting, except in emergency situations when an immediate meeting is necessary. Teachers shall attend unless the teacher is absent that day or the principal or his/her designee has excused the teacher from attending.
The school administrator shall establish a regular monthly meeting day schedule. If a meeting is rescheduled, a 24-hour notice shall be given to the staff. No staff member shall be penalized, or reprimanded, for missing a rescheduled staff meeting due to unforseen emergencies or previously scheduled appointments.
Opportunities shall be provided at faculty meetings for discussion of appropriate items of special interest to the faculty.

However, the gradation given a student by a teacher is subject to modification only by the Superintendent of Schools or his or her designated central office instructional administrator.
The retention of students shall be based on applicable District policies.
The District will make every effort to restrict movement of students within a school beyond the first ten days of school except in the case of an emergency, or after application of the Code of Student Conduct, or when all parties involved concur (teachers, parents and administration). No student shall be transferred for disciplinary reasons unless the teacher
9
or teachers involved is (are) consulted. No teacher may refuse to accept an assigned student.
N.	STUDENT DISCIPLINE
1.	Student Discipline Committee
Each school, if a majority of the instructional staff so desires, shall have a Student Discipline Committee. The Student Discipline Committee shall consist of teachers chosen by the faculty in each building. The Committee shall include at least one (1) teacher who has been trained in the implementation of the Code of Student Conduct, the Safe Schools Act and the use of Conference Cards, and, if available, one (1) counselor:
a.	To analyze factors that may be generating particular problems.
b.	To make recommendations in resolving discipline problems.
c.	To assist teachers needing guidance in the implementation of the Code of
Student Conduct and the use of Conference Cards.
d.	To monitor the availability of Conference Cards, in their building, for use by teachers.
2.	Individual Situations
A teacher shall have the right to send a student to the office whenever the student is involved in a violation of the Code of Student Conduct The teacher shall notify the office immediately and shall submit to the office a completed Conference Card as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of the day. The principal shall cause a preliminary investigation to be made, based on a signed Conference Card.
In breaches of discipline, the parents/guardian will be contacted as per the Board approved Code of Student Conduct. The teacher may request implementation of the following additional procedures:

5
Procedure A. Voluntary Transfer
Teachers desiring to transfer to vacancies in another school or program for the following school year shall file a written request with the Human Resources Department not later than April 1st of the year immediately preceding the year for which the transfer is desired. All transfers will be completed on or before June 30.
All voluntary transfers shall be based on:
1.	The transferring teacher meeting all governmental and court ordered requirements.
2.	Specialized academic needs of the District
3.	Length of service in District.
If a teacher's request for voluntary transfer is rejected, the teacher shall receive the reasons for the denial from the Division of Human Resources.
Where employees' length of service is equal or within sixty (60) days of being equal, the teacher possessing the greatest professional preparation as measured by the District's degree code (utilized for salary schedule purposes) shall prevail.
Procedure B. Involuntary Transfer
(Reference also Section D. ASSIGNMENT OF TEACHERS WITHIN A SCHOOL OR PROGRAM)
All involuntary transfers shall be based on governmental requirements of race and/or sex balance, length of service in the District, professional preparation and the specialized academic needs of a given school or program.

Disciplinary transfers, when necessary, shall be for documented cause and shall follow a conference with the Human/Employee Relations Specialist. The teacher may be accompanied by a representative. The use of the grievance procedure shall not stop the effectiveness of the transfer, pending resolution of the grievance. If a grievance is initiated, it shall be at Step 3.
Procedure C. Transfers in Case of Division of Family Services Investigations
1.	When the District receives notice that the Missouri Division of Family Services (DFS) or other agency is investigating a teacher for alleged child abuse, the District may immediately place the employee on paid suspension, removing the employee from any active assignment involving interaction with students. The District may reassign the teacher to a nonteaching assignment. The District will consider the nature of the allegations and the facts of the particular situation in deciding whether or not it is necessary to temporarily suspend the employee. Such a suspension is not to be disciplinary. The District and the Teacher’s Unit recognize that it may be in the best interest of the teacher, students and the District to remove the teacher from the classroom while an investigation is pending. Any discipline imposed by the District will be based on the results of its investigation.
2.	If an employee is on paid suspension because of a DFS investigation, and the DFS issues a finding, the Human Resources Department shall make a prompt determination of the teacher’s status, and take the following action or actions'.
a.	Return the teacher to the teacher’s prior position. If the suspension has lasted more than thirty (30) school days, the teacher may be placed in an equivalent position;
b.	Implement appropriate discipline;
c.	implement a voluntary transfer of the teacher to another assignment if the teacher agrees to the transfer, or
d.	Continue the suspension with pay pending the District’s own investigation.
If the District completes its investigation prior to a DFS finding, it may take one of the actions in a, b, or c above.
7
3.	In the case where the District determines that the investigation should continue beyond the time of the DFS finding, the employee will be notified in writing of this decision. This suspension will be with pay. The suspension will last only so long as it is reasonably necessary to determine whether the facts warrant disciplinary action.
4.	The employee may challenge the length of the investigatory suspension no sooner than the fifteenth school day following a determination by DFS. This challenge will be filed with the Superintendent, who may appoint a designee to decide the issue. The Superintendent will determine whether or not the investigation should continue, and will render a decision within five (5) working days. If the Superintendent allows the investigatory suspension to continue, the employee may again challenge the length of the suspension no sooner than the fifteenth working day following the Superintendent’s decision. This process may be repeated as necessary to assure that investigatory suspension time is kept to a reasonable minimum.
5.	If the Superintendent determines that the investigatory suspension should end, he/she will direct the Human Resources Department to enter a determination of the teacher’s status within five (5) working days. The Human Resources Department will thereupon take one or more of the following actions:
a.	Return the teacher to the teacher’s prior position. If the suspension has lasted more than thirty (30) school days, the teacher may be placed in an equivalent position.
b.	Implement appropriate discipline.
c.	Implement a voluntary transfer of the teacher to another assignment if the teacher agrees to the transfer.
6.	If the Human Resources Department implements discipline under this Procedure C, the employee may grieve the discipline, commencing at Step 3 before the District Legal Counsel in lieu of the Human Resources Department.
H.	TRANSFERS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR
Transfers made necessary during the school year shall be completed pursuant to either Procedure A, B or C in TRANSFER OF A TEACHER FROM ONE SCHOOL OR PROGRAM TO ANOTHER. Transfers should be voluntary, if possible.
I.	EMPLOYEE PLACEMENT NOTIFICATION

8
written notification of the outcome of the application. Failure to provide notification does not invalidate the selection procedure.
J.	PRELIMINARY ORGANIZATION REPORTS TO BE DISTRIBUTED
It shall be standard practice for principals or their designees to inform teachers of school preliminary organizations prior to the end of the current school year.
K.	FACULTY MEETINGS
Each faculty may elect a faculty committee, or in its absence, use the staff advisory committee whose function will be to meet with the principal for the purpose of preparing agendas for faculty meetings.

However, the gradation given a student by a teacher is subject to modification only by the Superintendent of Schools or his or her designated central office instructional administrator.
The retention of students shall be based on applicable District policies.
The District will make every effort to restrict movement of students within a school beyond the first ten days of school except in the case of an emergency, or after application of the Code of Student Conduct, or when all parties involved concur (teachers, parents and administration). No student shall be transferred for disciplinary reasons unless the teacher
9
or teachers involved is (are) consulted. No teacher may refuse to accept an assigned student.
N.	STUDENT DISCIPLINE
1.	Student Discipline Committee
Each school, if a majority of the instructional staff so desires, shall have a Student Discipline Committee. The Student Discipline Committee shall consist of teachers chosen by the faculty in each building. The Committee shall include at least one (1) teacher who has been trained in the implementation of the Code of Student Conduct, the Safe Schools Act and the use of Conference Cards, and, if available, one (1) counselor:
a.	To analyze factors that may be generating particular problems.
b.	To make recommendations in resolving discipline problems.
c.	To assist teachers needing guidance in the implementation of the Code of
Student Conduct and the use of Conference Cards.
d.	To monitor the availability of Conference Cards, in their building, for use by teachers.
2.	Individual Situations
A teacher shall have the right to send a student to the office whenever the student is involved in a violation of the Code of Student Conduct. The teacher shall notify the office immediately and shall submit to the office a completed Conference Card as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of the day. The principal shall cause a preliminary investigation to be made, based on a signed Conference Card.
In breaches of discipline, the parents/guardian will be contacted as per the Board approved Code of Student Conduct. The teacher may request implementation of the following additional procedures:
a.	If a violation has occurred which requires a parent/guardian conference, the conference shall be held involving the parent/guardian and one (1) or more of the following persons: principal, assistant principal, counselor and teacher.
b.	The teacher shall receive from the principal, or his/her designated representative, a signed and completed copy of the Conference Card, by the end of the next school day.
c.	Whenever an offense committed at school is a violation of a criminal law, it is the policy of the School District to involve the police and to prosecute the
10
offender. Procedures shall be initiated through the office of the principal. A listing of these offenses may be found in the Code of Student Conduct.
O.	ACCOUNTABILITY
The Board of Education has adopted an Accountability Plan and will continue to implement that Plan during the 2000-2001 school year. The District and the Teachers’ union agree to work together to fully implement the following goals established by that Plan:
1.	Improve student achievement through alignment of the MAP with the Core Curriculum;
2.	Create a school climate where employees are respected and implement effective classroom practices and strategies;
3.	Administer and interpret test results of State and District performance-based assessments;
4.	Enhance and apply knowledge of the research based literacy practices adopted by the District;
5.	Create environments which promote learning, high standards of student achievement and non-disruptive behavior; and
6.	Develop and participate in staff development activities designed to meet state requirements.
P.	PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES
1.	Conferences shall be arranged by appointment, at a time mutually acceptable to parent and teacher. The office will take parents' calls requesting conferences along with the parents' numbers and will indicate to the parents when the teacher will have a preparation period, at which time the parents can expect the teacher to return the call. The teacher will return the call during his/her preparation period and the teacher will be called to the phone only when he/she is free of other duties.
2.	This procedure for scheduling parent-teacher conferences will be disseminated to parents.
3.	In those situations where a principal recommends that a parent should be seen by a teacher even though that parent has no appointment, the teacher shall:
a.	Meet with the parent, or
b.	Attempt to contact the parent by telephone within twenty-four (24) hours, and
11
c.	Schedule a meeting with the parent at a mutually convenient time, if the parent's concerns are not resolved by telephone.
4.	The teacher should not be subjected to abuse from parents. Parents shall, when entering upon school premises for purposes of conferring with the teacher, first make their presence known to the principal or his/her designee. When a parent who is apparently not in a frame of mind for a constructive conference comes to school, the principal or his/her designee should respond courteously but with firmness, and insist that the conference be held at another time. If the principal has knowledge that a situation of abuse to a teacher has developed, the principal shall intervene and inform the parent that the teacher has no obligation to accept abuse. If the parent becomes threatening to the teacher, or the situation otherwise warrants, the principal or his/her designee shall use all available means to provide safety for the teacher.
5.	Conferences with parents should occur during the teacher's on-duty hours. However, the teacher shall make every effort to be available for conferences at times convenient for the teachers and parents involved.
6.	When a mutually acceptable conference time cannot be arranged, the teacher shall, in writing on a standardized form, submit to an administrator or his/her designee, or counselor, notification of the student's problem and/or progress, as well as any suggestions for appropriate parent activities to assist the student. Copies of the teacher’s statement shall be mailed to the parents and a copy given to the building administrator.
Q.	TEACHERS TO PARTICIPATE IN SELECTION OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS
Teachers shall be involved in the recommendation and selection of instructional materials.
The School District recognizes that basic texts and supplementary materials should be chosen with the treatment of multi-ethnic and racial content as important criteria.
R.	SPACE FOR ITINERANT PERSONNEL
Appropriate space, as available, in each school, shall be provided to itinerant personnel of the District including, but not limited to, special education teachers, home school coordinators, remedial reading teachers, speech therapists and school psychological examiners.
The District shall make every effort in the preparation of specifications for new schools to include plans for said appropriate space.
S.	USE OF LIBRARIES
School libraries and resource centers fulfill an important role in the school's instructional program.
12
As important resource persons, librarians should not be used as substitute teachers. If, however, a clear emergency situation exists, librarians may be utilized as substitute teachers if given released time from library responsibilities during the period librarians are serving as substitute teachers.
Libraries shall not be used as disciplinary centers or detention facilities for disruptive children who are unable to perform in their regular classroom assignments.
T.	STAFF ADVISORY COMMITTEE
Each school, if a majority of instructional staff so desires, shall have a staff advisory committee elected by members of the instructional staff. Where applicable, this committee shall include a representative from the paraprofessional classroom employees.
The elections for staff advisory committee members shall be no later than September 15. The term of office for these members shall be one (1) year from September 15 of the school year when another election is held (but no later than September 15). The size of the staff advisory committee shall be no less than four (4), but no more than eight (8) members.
The function of the staff advisory committee is to recommend to and discuss with the school administrator or his/her administrative designee new rules, regulations and procedures and changes in existing rules, regulations and procedures of that school.
The school administrator or his/her administrative designee shall, except in emergencies, advise of and discuss with the staff advisory committee any new rules and changes in existing rules, regulations and procedures before such rules, regulations and procedures are implemented.
The staff advisory committee meetings shall be open meetings. School instructional staff other than staff advisory committee members may attend the meetings if they so choose.
U.	EMPLOYEE MEETINGS
Employees may schedule meetings in the buildings to which they are assigned provided that such meetings shall not be held before 6:30 a.m. or later than 5 p.m. and further provided that such meetings are not in conflict with other previously scheduled school or professional activities. Application for use of meeting rooms need not state the purpose of the meeting.
V.	NEW, EXPERIMENTAL, OR PILOT PROGRAM
Whenever the District considers a new, experimental, or pilot program, representatives selected by the majority representative shall be included in the planning and implementation processes.
Whenever the administration of a particular school considers a new, experimental or pilot program, the staff advisory committee shall be included in the formulation, if applicable,
13
planning and implementation process.
Appropriate information and training shall be provided the involved instructional staff to insure effective implementation of the program. Any training scheduled outside of normal workday hours shall be compensated at the rate shown on the extra pay schedule.
W.	UNSAFE OR HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS
Employees shall report unsafe or hazardous conditions to their principal or immediate supervisor who shall immediately inspect such conditions and take appropriate corrective action.
It shall be the responsibility of the building administrator to conduct scheduled and necessary interim fire safety inspections and direct the correction of below standard situations. Employees shall report situations involving possible below standard conditions to the building administrator upon discovery.
Employees shall not be required to work under unsafe or hazardous conditions or to perform tasks that endanger their safety.
X.	INDUSTRIAL ARTS - CAREERS AND LIFE SKILLS HOME ECONOMICS ■ SAFETY
The District recognizes that activities in Industrial Arts and/or Career and Life Skills (Family & Consumer Science) classrooms may create hazardous conditions for students. If, in the opinion of the teacher, any student is a hazard to his/her own safety or the safety of others, the student may be temporarily removed from the classroom. Before reinstatement, the local school administration will investigate the matter and report its findings to the teacher.
Y. JOB OPENINGS
A list of known teacher vacancies in the District for the following school year will be posted in each school by April 15. The posting will include:

b.	Reason for and probable length of absence.
c.	Name of the school to which the teacher is assigned.
d.	Grade or subject to be taught by substitute teacher.

a.	Outlines, bell schedules, charts, explanation of fire drills and other aids must be readily available at a moment's notice.
b.	Materials must be organized, instead, from the long range point of view and kept up-to-date so that the class can go on properly no matter what emergency sends someone else in to fill the regular teacher's post.
c.	It is expected that the absent teacher will, if circumstances permit, make plans and suggest procedures, so there may be only minimum interruption of the regular school program.
3.	A regular teacher who has been off duty is to call his/her principal by 9:00 a.m. of any day when he/she expects to resume work at noon and one hour before the closing of school of the day prior to the day he/she expects to resume work in the morning.
60
a.	A substitute teacher who is to be released by noon shall be notified by 10:00 a.m. or by the close of the school day if he/she is not to report for duty in the same assignment the next morning.
b.	Upon release the substitute teacher shall notify the Division of Human Resources at once concerning his/her availability.

1.	Aiding substitute teachers with local school regulations.
a.	The first few minutes with a new class are very important, therefore, the principal, or someone designated by him/her, should escort the substitute teacher to the classroom and present him/her to the class.
b.	Inasmuch as some procedures vary from school to school, it would be helpful if each principal would prepare a set of helpful instructions for substitute teachers.
i)	Secondary school principals may help by explaining plans for reporting attendance, library passes, lunch permits and hall passes, and by furnishing a chart of the building, showing location of health center, fire escapes and auditorium.
ii)	Elementary principals may help by informing the substitute teacher concerning the following: time for special meetings, such as assembly, clubs, student council; location of supplies; plan for playground supervision; physical education program; library facilities; project rooms available; procedure for cafeteria service; procedure for handling money; arrangements for showing films and irregular dismissals.
2.	Appointment and Assignment
a. Substitute teachers are appointed annually to take the place of regular teachers who are absent on account of illness or other emergencies.
i)	They are not under contract with the School District.
ii)	They are assigned on call from the Central Office of the School
District and are paid for the number of days taught.
iii)	In recommending appointment of substitute teachers, preference is given degree graduates and teachers formerly under contract in the system.
61
2. Certification
To be eligible for appointment as a substitute teacher, an applicant must be eligible for a Missouri Certificate to teach.
4.	Suggestions to Substitute Teachers

d.	Follow outlined plans and routine as closely as possible.
e.	Keep accurate records of attendance.
f.	Make entries in record book in pencil only.
g.	Be aware that when children are interested and	busy, fewer discipline
problems will arise.
h.	Check papers if it is the wish of the regular teacher.
i.	The substitute teacher should avoid erasing any special work on the chalkboard, changing seats permanently, giving out books permanently and any irregular dismissal except through the office.
5.	On Completion of Assignment
a.	The substitute teacher should leave for the regular teacher, a brief resume of work covered in each project or period, lesson plans, 'record of achievement and comments that he/she deems pertinent.
b.	When a substitute teacher has completed an assignment and is not to return to the same school the next day, he/she is expected to call the secretary in charge of substitute teachers.
1)	This procedure makes it possible for the substitute teacher to be placed immediately on the available list for further assignment.
62
6.
Availability: 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.
a.	Substitute teachers desiring assignments should be available by telephone each morning from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.
b.	They are asked not to telephone the Central Office between these hours as this interferes seriously with emergency calls coming in from schools.

The salaries of substitute teachers for the time served shall be in accordance with the provisions of the salary schedule.
D. SUBSTITUTE TEACHER FACULTY PARTICIPATION

Substitute teachers in vacancies or long assignments are expected to attend faculty meetings and other school related meetings scheduled for immediately before or after the school day.
AGREEMENT TO COLLABORATE BETWEEN THE KCMSD AND KCFT
The KCMSD Board and the KCFT Local 691 agree to explore a process of decision-making that will deliberately place greater authority and responsibility for education and related decisions within the school itself. The KCMSD Board and the KCFT will jointly explore changes in structures and procedures that will facilitate this change with goals of:
•	Providing better collaboration in quality educational services;
•	Placing the decision-making closer to the teaching and learning;
•	Creating an environment that can listen better and respond more quickly to the parents and the student’s needs; and
•	Improving the work environment of administrators and teachers, which is ultimately the learning environment for children.
The parties also believe that in the process of the implementation of Site-Based Decision Making, there will be a growing sense of openness of communication, trust, and ultimately an attitude to collaboratively solve problems for the education of pupils in the KCMSD.
Section 2	- Oversight Committee
To oversee and guarantee the integrity of Site-Based Decision-Making, an oversight committee should be formed. The role and makeup of the oversight committee shall be established by the Leadership Committee subject to the agreement of the KCMSD and KCFT.
63
Section 3	- Site Councils
Each school will have a site council consisting of professional staff (principal and instructional staff) making up a simple majority. The site council shall also include parents, other support staff, and in the case of a senior high school, students as well. Composition of the site councils is subject to the approval of the oversight committee.
The size of the school, the size and complexity of its instructional staff, and its grade levels will all influence the committee composition.
The Site Council’s goal is to make decisions about school issues such as site budgets, curriculum staffing, and day-to-day operation of the school. In general, the Site council wants to make certain that high quality decisions, that are appropriate, are made at the school level.
(Note: No staff member shall be excluded from the bargaining unit as a supervisory managerial employee within the meaning of the Labor Relations Act by reason of his/her participation in Site-Based Management.)
Section 4	- Limitations
The parties agree that we are willing to explore all the implications of the Site-Based Decision-Making process. However, none of us is able to set aside our legal responsibilities or certain dimensions of our organizational roles. Therefore, it is understood that unless exceptions are made, (see Section 5 below) this process cannot change:
•	State and Federal law as they pertain to us;
•	Missouri Department of Public Education rules and regulations;
•	The agreements between and of the organized labor groups and the KCMO Board of Education
Section 5	- Waivers
The Oversight Committee will accept requests for waivers from any existing policy, regulation, or a portion of the labor agreement These requests will then be referred to KCFT and Board of Education for appropriate action.
12.	It is clearly understood that these exceptions are not precedent setting, not system wide.
13.	The exceptions are temporary and are automatically rescinded each June 15 unless specifically extended.
14.	The Sites report to the Oversight Committee the implications, successes and failures based on.these exceptions.
Section 6	- Voluntary Involvement
Involvement in this process, at least in the first steps, is voluntary on the part of individuals and school sites. Schools will not be forced early into this Site-Based Decision-Making process.
64
Individuals within schools are also free not to participate even if one’s school is chosen. Obviously, the Oversight Committee hopes there will be a strong majority in participating schools to insure the environments in these schools will be very participative, team oriented, and parent and child focused.
At the same time, no adverse employment action will be taken against any staff member because of his/her non-participation in a Site-Based Decision-Making arrangement.
Section 7	- Slowing or Withdrawal
The parties recognize that the mutual exploration of Site-Based Decision-Making may lead into difficult areas and unforeseen problems. We each take this risk in good faith and with a readiness to examine our own attitudes and behaviors and improve together. So that each side may have the necessary safeguards and acceptance of the process, the School Board or the KCFT has the right to request either a slow-down and in extreme cases, a withdrawal from the joint process.
Each side can exercise this option by a formal letter to the other stating the desire to slow down or withdraw, and stating the reasons. There will then be a “cooling off" period of sixty (60) days during which the sides will meet at least twice to discuss the issues(s), possibly using a third party consultant. If after the 60-day period one party wants to withdraw, the process and agreement will be considered terminated.
