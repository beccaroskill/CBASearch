6.01. Cause for Discharge.
(a)	No regular employee or steady extra, after having completed the probationary period under Section 20.01, shall be discharged except for just cause except as provided for in 10.07(a). Prior to any discharge for reasons other than dishonesty, willful misconduct, drunkenness, drinking on the job, being under the influence of a controlled substance on duty, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, or using a controlled substance at any time on the Employer’s premises, unlawful sale of a controlled substance, refusing to submit to testing for drug or alcohol usage in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.01(b) of this Agreement, participation in a slowdown, work stoppage or strike in violation of this Agreement, serious improper behavior or discourtesy toward a customer or guest, insubordination, failure to report for work without just cause, or walking off the job during a shift, such an employee must be given a written warning and a reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiency. The above provisions relating to controlled substances will not apply to medicine lawfully prescribed for the employee using the stance by a licensed physician and used in accordance with the prescription. Upon the discharge or suspension of any employee for reasons other than dishonesty, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee in writing, and a legible copy thereof shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after the discharge or suspension. When an employee is discharged or suspended for willful misconduct, the notice shall contain the specific conduct or offense deemed by the Employer to constitute willful misconduct.

The foregoing provision shall not be interpreted to require consent to post-accident testing if, at the time consent is requested, circumstances known to management establish that the accident was caused solely by a reason unrelated to the employee being under the influence.
The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level at or in excess of the current level allowed by law provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol.

The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for the warning notice.

SIDE LETTER #2 - RE: SECTION 4.02 - UNION STEWARDS
Jn an effort io avoid problems for employees who also act in the capacity of Union Stewards, it is necessary to establish guidelines so that those employees adhere to the Employer’s rules and policies and still have the ability to fulfill their obligations as a Union Steward. The Union and the Employer therefore agree to the following guidelines:
1.	Before any employee can be recognized or function as a Union Steward, the Employer must receive from the Union an authorization letter appointing the employee as a Union Steward for the department in which the employee works and stating whether such Union Steward is permitted to engage in meetings. Such authorization may be general for various issues, meetings and/or grievances or specific to a particular issue(s), meeting(s) and/or grievance(s) but in all cases shall specifically state the scope of that Union Steward’s authority (for example whether the Steward can sign off on a settlement of a grievance) and the effective date and termination dale of such authority.
2.	There will normally be only one (1) Union Steward appointed by the Union per shift per department in which bargaining unit employees are employed, but if a department is unusually large, the Union may select more than one (1). If the Employer asserts that there are too many Union Stewards, the parties agree to consult and discuss ways to limit the number.
3.	Employees acting as Union Stewards must obtain a proper photo ID badge, through the same procedure Union representatives obtain such badges, for off-duty use to enter the service area of the Employer’s facilities. All procedures relating to badges for Union representative shall apply equally to badges issued to Union Stewards.
4.	Employees acting as Union Stewards who conduct business while off duly must sign in at a location designated by the Employer to provide evidence that the individual is on the property as an agent of the Union and not as an employee.
5.	Employees appointed as Union Stewards may not engage in any of his/her steward’s duties or activities while he/she is on work time. An appointed Steward may engage in such activities while he or she is on authorized breaks or lunch periods. However, under no circumstances and at no time shall an appointed Steward engage in his/her steward’s activities with a co-worker who is on work time.
6.	Employees acting as Union Stewards may become involved in investigatory meetings with the Employer only when such meetings may reasonably lead to discipline of a co-worker and only if requested by the co-worker.
7.	Employees acting as Union Stewards requesting copies of documents or information regarding a co-worker must make such requests to the Human Resources office.
8.	Employees acting as Union Stewards must provide Human Resources with their regular work schedule and advise of any changes to their schedule.
86
Fitzgeralds
9.	Employees acting as Union Steward must keep confidential any information obtained regarding co-workers’ problems and/or discipline and not discuss such information with other employees who are not involved.
10.	Employees acting as Union Stewards must attend and successfully complete the Union’s shop steward training program.
