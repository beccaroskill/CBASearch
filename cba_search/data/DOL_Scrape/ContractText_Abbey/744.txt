ARTICLES: DISCIPLINE
6.01. Cause For Discharge.
(a)	No regular employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 20.01, shall be disciplined and/or discharged except for just cause. The Employer shall follow a system of progressive discipline. The parties agree that progressive discipline normally requires, prior to suspension or discharge, that an employee be given a written opportunity to correct the deficiency, but that within the principle of progressive discipline, the Employer may impose immediate suspension or discharge for dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, insubordination, discourteous conduct toward a guest or an employee, failure to report to work without just cause, walking off the job during a shift, or drinking alcohol of use of controlled substance, or being under the influence thereof, during the employee's shift.
When an employee who has completed the probationary period is disciplined and/or discharged, the reason therefore will be given to the employee in writing. Based on the Union and
7
Circus Circus Las Vegas
Employer’s established practice when an employee is discharged, copies of the written notice to the employee will be sent to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours of the discharge.

(b)	■ Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge. The Employer shall pay for the cost of the - examination, and the employee shall be paid for all time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level of .10 provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol. In the event the State of Nevada lowers the legal presumption of intoxication below the .10 level, the contract shall automatically be amended to reflect the lower level.
6.02, Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Wanting notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter. A copy of any written warning notice shall be issued to the employee. The employee shall be required to sign all notices for the purposes of acknowledging receipt. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer's own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.03. Time of Discharge.
No employees shall be discharged on his/her day off or while on vacation.

SIDE LETTER #2 - Re: Initial Resolution Process
The Employer and the Union have implemented a pilot program called the “Joint Resolution Process". A key feature of this program is the “Initial Resolution Process” referred to as the IRP. The IRP gives responsibility to employees, union stewards and front line management to resolve workplace problems directly, quickly and cooperatively. The IRP is designed to reduce the level of formalism in the dispute resolution process, to identify and take care of potential sources of discord early on, and to create an environment of mutual respect and striving for success.
The program has worked very well and appears to be destined to continue to accomplish its goals. Therefore, the parties agree that they may, by written agreement, adopt the provisions of 6.01 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Union and Mirage Hotel & Casino. The Agreement shall specify the effective date of the election and as of such effective date, the provisions of section 6.01 of this Agreement shall be deemed replaced by those of the Mirage agreement.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto by their duly designated representatives have hereunto set their hands this 8th day of December . 2003, in Clark County, State of Nevada.
