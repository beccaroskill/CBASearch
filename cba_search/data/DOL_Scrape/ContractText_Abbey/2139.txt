Rest periods shall be scheduled in a manner so as not to interfere with workflow or continuous operations and Individual Employers shall be able to coordinate the timing of each ten (10) minute rest break with their Employees to assure the continuity of work. Employees shall be required to remain in their respective work area, or to take their rest period in a specific area designated by the Individual Employer. The second rest period may be added to the end of the meal period or workday when working conditions so dictate as determined by the Individual Employer. Employees who work more than ten (10) hours shall be authorized and permitted three ten (10) minute rest periods.
It is understood that the Employee will take his/her appropriate rest period unless the Individual Employer specifically directs the Employee not to take this rest break due to operational requirements. Employees are required to notify their supervisor whenever they are unable to take their rest periods.
If an Individual Employer fails to authorize and permit an Employee with a rest period as provided herein, the Employee shall be paid a penalty payment equal to one (1) hour at his/her applicable hourly wage rate excluding fringe benefits for all missed rest periods that day.
C.	A heat illness preventative recovery period of no less than five (5) minutes shall be made available in order to prevent heat illness.
Employees believing a preventative recovery period is needed to avoid heat illness or suffering from heat illness shall be provided access to an area with shade that is either open to the air or provided with ventilation or cooling or provided for a period of no less than five minutes. Such access to shade shall be permitted at all times. Cooling measures other than shade (e.g., use of misting machines) may be provided in lieu of shade if the Individual Employer can demonstrate that these measures are at least as effective as shade in allowing employees to cool.
Employees should not discount any discomfort or symptoms they are experiencing. They should immediately report any problems they are experiencing to a supervisor and coworker. Employees must notify their supervisors immediately if they believe they require access to shade, or alternative cooling measures and/or a preventative recovery period.
If an Individual Employer fails to provide an Employee a preventative recovery period in accordance with this Section, the Individual Employer shall pay the Employee one additional hour of pay at the Employee’s regular rate of compensation, excluding fringe benefits, for each work day that a requested preventative recovery period is not provided. No employee shall be discriminated against for exercising his/her rights pursuant to this Section.
D.	All disputes concerning meals, rest periods and/or heat illness preventative recovery periods are subject to the Grievance Procedures in Section 9 of the Agreement and must be brought to the attention of the Employer, in writing, by the Union or Employee within ten (10) working days of the alleged violation. Decisions resolving disputes arising out of the Grievance Procedures shall be final and binding upon both parties.
(This section is to remain consistent with the Laborers Master Labor Agreement and shall be modified to reflect any changes)

Sections No Cessation of Work
It is mutually agreed and understood that during the period when this Agreement is in force and effect, the Union or any Local Union will not authorize any strike, slow down, or stoppage of work in any dispute, complaint, or grievance arising under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, except such disputes, complaints, or grievances as arise out of the failure or refusal of any Individual Employer to comply with the provisions of the hiring clause, Section 3 A or B hereof, or as permitted under Section 28B and C hereof or whenever an Individual Employer pays Laborers improperly with checks which do not clear for collection. As to any Individual Employer who shall fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of the sections specified herein, so long as such failure or refusal continues it shall not be a violation of this Agreement if the Union or any Local Union withdraws its members who are subject hereto from the performance of any work for such Individual Employer, and such withdrawal for such period shall not be a strike or work stoppage within the terms of this Agreement. In the event that any employees of any Individual Employer should be withdrawn by reason of any dispute, complaint, or grievance arising out of the violation of any similar hiring clause in any agreement between Employer and any other Union, then the Union or any Local Union may respect such withdrawal and for the period thereof may refuse to perform any work for such Individual Employer, and such refusal for such period shall not be a violation of this Agreement.
Any employees so withdrawn or refusing to perform any work as herein provided shall not lose their status as employees, but no such employee shall be entitled to claim or receive any wages or other compensation for any period during which he/she has been so withdrawn or refused to perform any work.
Section 9 Grievance Procedure
Any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement, other than a jurisdictional dispute or a dispute arising out of Section 3A or 3B, or a dispute covered by subsection 13C(4), or a dispute of Section 28 (Health & Welfare Plan, Pension/Annuity Plan, Vacation-Holiday-Dues Supplement Plan, Training-Retraining/Apprenticeship Plan) which said Sections and the Subsections thereof are specifically exempted by the provisions of this Section, the following procedure will apply:

6.	The Board of Adjustment shall meet not less than once each calendar month with the exception of the discharge cases which must be heard at the earliest possible date not to exceed fifteen (15) working days. Failure of either party to meet or participate in the procedure shall relieve the charging party of further compliance with the grievance procedure.
7.	Decisions of the Board of Adjustment or an Impartial Arbitrator shall be within the scope and terms of this Agreement, and shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto. The Board of Adjustment or an Impartial Arbitrator shall only have jurisdiction and authority to determine the meaning, application of, or compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to or detract from, amend, modify or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement or its intent.
8.	In the event an Individual Employer fails to comply with any such decisions, the Union may withdraw employees or strike the Individual Employer and such action shall not be a violation of this Agreement so long as such noncompliance continues.

15.	In the case of discharge, the Board shall meet within fifteen (15) working days. The Board of Adjustment or Arbitrator shall be free to sustain the discharge or to find discipline other than discharge to be appropriate and may order reinstatement with full or partial back pay as he or it deems appropriate provided there shall be no discrimination on the part of the Individual Employer against any employee for activities in behalf of, or representation of the Union not interfering with the proper performance of his/her duties.
16.	If failure of a Board of Adjustment to meet on a discharge case within fifteen (15) working days is due to the unavailability of the Union, the wage payment and Trust Fund contribution liability shall be limited to the above fifteen (15) working days.

The Board of Adjustment shall settle any dispute or grievance involving a subcontractor as defined in Section 11 who has agreed under contract with the Employer, or any Individual Employer, or a subcontractor of the Employer, or any Individual Employer to perform on the job site any part or portion of the construction work covered by the prime contract, including the operation of equipment, performance of labor and installation of materials.

Section 11	Subcontractors
The terms and conditions of this Agreement insofar as it affects Employer and the Individual Employer shall apply equally to any subcontractor of any tier under the control of, or working under oral or written contract with such Individual Employer on any work covered by this Agreement to be performed at the job site or job yard, and said subcontractor with respect to such work shall be considered the same as an Individual Employer covered hereby. Subject to the provisions of this Section and any other Section of this Agreement applicable to subcontractors, if an Individual Employer shall subcontract work herein defined, such subcontract shall state that such subcontractor agrees to be bound by and comply with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. A subcontractor is defined as any person, firm or corporation who agrees under contract with the Employer, or any Individual Employer, or a subcontractor of the Employer, or any Individual Employer to perform on the job site any part or portion of the construction work covered by the prime contract, including the operation of equipment, performance of labor and installation of materials. The Individual Employer has the primary obligation for performance of all conditions of this Agreement. This obligation cannot be relieved, evaded or diminished by subcontracting. Should the Individual Employer elect to subcontract, the Individual Employer shall continue to have such primary obligation. Said primary obligation shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the Union’s majority status for the purpose of establishing the obligation of the Individual Employer to bargain collectively pursuant to Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended with the Union upon expiration of this Agreement, but for no other purpose, statute or law.
An Individual Employer who provides in the subcontract that the subcontractor will pay the wages and benefits and will observe the hours and all other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be liable for any delinquency by such subcontractor in the payment of any wages or fringe benefits provided herein, including payments required by Section 28 (Health and Welfare, Pension/Annuity, Vacation Holiday Dues Supplement and Training-Retraining/Apprenticeship Funds), except as follows:
The Individual Employer will give written notice to the Union of any subcontract involving the performance of work covered by this Agreement within five (5) days of entering such subcontract, and shall specify the name and address of the subcontractor. Written notice at a pre-job conference shall be deemed written notice under this provision for those subcontractors fisted at the pre-job only. Notification to the Union of any subcontractor not listed in writing at the pre-job must still be given in accordance with this paragraph.
If thereafter such subcontractor shall become delinquent in the payment of any wages or benefits as above specified, the Union shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Individual Employer and to the subcontractor specifying the nature and amount of such delinquency.
If such notice is given, the Individual Employer shall pay and satisfy only the amount of any such delinquency by such subcontractor occurring within seventy-five (75) days prior to the receipt of said notice from the Union, and said Individual Employer may withhold the amount claimed to be delinquent out of the sums due and owing by the Individual Employer to such contractor.
In the event the Individual Employer fails to give written notice of a subcontract as required herein such Individual Employer shall be liable for all delinquencies of the subcontractor on that job or project without limitation.
The Individual Employer shall not be liable for any such delinquency if the Local Union where the delinquency occurs refers any employee to such subcontractor after giving such notice and during the continuance of such delinquency. The provisions of this Section 11 shall be applied only to the extent

Any oral or written agreement between Employer or any Individual Employer and an individual employee, which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Agreement, or any supplemental agreements hereto, disestablishes or tends to disestablish relationship of Employer and employee, or establishes a relationship other than that of Employer and employee, shall forthwith terminate. No oral or written agreement which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Agreement, or any supplemental agreements thereto, shall hereafter be entered into by and between Employer, or an Individual Employer, and any individual employee performing work covered by this Agreement. Any practice of the Employer or Individual Employer contrary to this Agreement shall forthwith terminate. Any such future practice shall not be binding on the Union or effect the interpretation of this Agreement unless specifically authorized by the Union in writing.
Section 13A Elimination of Restrictions on Production
No rules, customs or practices shall be permitted that limit production or increase the time required to do any work. There shall be no limitation or restriction of the use of machinery tools or other labor saving devices.

The Union agrees to cooperate with the Employer and the Individual Employer in establishing drug and alcohol abuse policies to the extent legally possible.
Management Rights Regarding Substance Abuse:
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the Employer expressly reserves the right, in its discretion, to undertake the following measures:
(1)	In the sole discretion of the Employer and the Individual Employer, requiring covered employees to submit to physical examination by competent medical personnel to determine whether there is a probability that the employee is suffering from any physical impairment which might cause the employee to be a safety hazard to him/herself or others, or which might cause the employee to be unable to perform assigned tasks within the coverage of this Agreement in a prompt and competent manner. Such tests may include, in the discretion of the Employer and the Individual Employer, such tests of the employee's bodily fluids as the Employer and the Individual Employer may reasonably believe will elicit evidence of the employee's use of substances which are reasonably likely to alter or impair the employee's ability to perform his/her duties in a prompt, competent and safe manner.
(2)	Implementation of rules regarding the discipline and/or discharge of any employees that the Employer and the Individual Employer determines, as a result of the tests described in subparagraph (1), are reasonably likely to become voluntarily impaired or disabled from the safe performance of their work tasks as a result of the ingestion of alcohol or performance-impairing drugs.

(2)	All State and/or Federal and/or Local Safety Laws, Standards, Rules and Regulations shall be applicable to all work covered by this Agreement.

Any Individual Employer who is found to be delinquent as a result of an audit will pay and satisfy such delinquency with accrued interest and in addition pay liquidated damages. All delinquent contributions shall bear simple interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month until receipt of payment. Subject to accounting verification, liquidated damages shall be assessed on delinquent contributions at a flat rate of one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) per month to reflect the internal administrative costs incurred by the trust administrators in monitoring and tracking such late contributions. The cost of any audit shall be borne by the Individual Employer if the delinquency disclosed by the audit is in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) and is not the result of a clerical error. When economic conditions warrant, the Trustees of the Trust Funds specified in this Agreement are authorized to amend the liquidated damages and interest provisions of this Agreement. Any adjustments implemented by the Trustees shall be reflective of true increases in the administrative and legal costs associated with the recovery of delinquent Trust Fund contributions.
Section 28B Delinquency Withdrawals
In the event that the Board of Trustees of a fund into which the Individual Employers are required to pay, determine that an Individual Employer is delinquent in the making of any payments required by Section 28A hereof, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement, so long as such delinquency continues, if the Union takes economic action against such Individual Employer and such economic action shall not be a strike or work stoppage within the terms of this Agreement. In the event that any employees of any Individual Employer should be withdrawn pursuant to any similar clause in any agreement between the Collective Bargaining Representative of the Employer and any other Union, then the Union may respect such withdrawal, and for the period thereof, may refuse to perform any work for such Individual Employer and such refusal for such period shall not be a violation of this Agreement. Any employees so withdrawn or refusing to perform any work as herein provided shall not lose their status as employees but no such employee shall be entitled to claim or receive any wages or other compensation for any period during which he has been so withdrawn or refused to perform any work.
Section 28C Security For Individual Employer Payments Into Trust Funds
Each Individual Employer delinquent by one (1) or more months in making the payments set forth in Section 28A, above shall be notified by mail by the Administrator of the Trust or Trusts applicable to such delinquency. Copies of such notices shall be sent to the Employer and to the Union. Each such delinquent Individual Employer shall, within five (5) days of the receipt of such notice (by certified mail), give a satisfactory bond in a sum equal to two (2) times the amount of the delinquency. Such amounts are to be determined by the Administrator of the Trust or Trusts applicable. Such bond is not in any way to be construed as in lieu of any payments required under this Agreement.
All such bonds shall be deposited with the Administrator and shall be in a form acceptable by the Administration of the various Trusts.
CALIFORNIA
If the bond must be used to make any payments under Section 28A, the money shall be pro-rated among the amounts owed by such Individual Employer, with the first priority to the Vacation-Holiday-Dues Supplement Trust Fund, and the balance dispersed equally to the Health & Welfare, Pension/Annuity and Training-Retraining/Apprenticeship Trusts.
Whenever an Individual Employer fails to deposit a satisfactory bond within the time provided by this Section, if the notice herein provided for has been given, the Local Union shall not be required to dispatch employees, and further economic action by the Union to obtain compliance of this Section will not be a violation of Section 8 of this Agreement.

The clauses hereof relating to "Hiring," Section 3A hereof, and "No Cessation of Work," Section 8 hereof, are intended to be inseparable and mutually interdependent.

Its interpretation and the interpretation of each of the provisions of this Agreement are therefore intended to apply no broader than that permitted by law.

This Agreement is binding upon each Individual Employer regardless of whether he/she or it changes the name or style or address of his/her or their business.

SUPPLEMENT NO. 4
TUNNEL LABORERS’ APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM
1.	TERM OF APPRENTICESHIP: New applicants for union membership, who cannot demonstrate a minimum of 4,000 hours of experience as a Construction Craft Laborer shall enter the Laborers Apprenticeship Program (Apprenticeship Program). If an applicant is designated a journey-level Laborer by a referring Individual Employer who states in writing that the applicant’s knowledge and experience warrants journey-level status, such Employees shall be considered provisional journey-level Laborers and may retain that status so long as they are employed by the designating Individual Employer. Any provisional journey-level Laborer who is laid-off or otherwise discharged prior to working 4,000 hours may not be placed on a journey-level out of work list until assessed by the Apprenticeship Program.
2.	RATIO: Individual Employers shall participate in the Apprenticeship Program by accepting apprentices for employment upon referral by the Union. When four (4) journey-level Laborers are employed on a project for a particular Individual Employer, the next employee hired to perform Laborers’ work must be an apprentice and this ratio will be continued for every four (4) additional Laborers being employed on the Project. On projects with fewer than four (4) journey-level Laborers an Individual Employer may employ one (1) apprentice per project with at least one (1) journey-level Laborer.
3.	The Apprenticeship Standards approved by the Division of Apprenticeship Standards of the State of California are hereby incorporated by reference as part of this Agreement.
4.	All apprentices shall be properly dispatched through the appropriate Local Union’s hiring hall. The Individual Employer must secure a dispatch from the appropriate Local Union for any apprentices employed by the Individual Employer.
5.	Entry into the Apprenticeship Program shall be controlled by the Laborers Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee (JATC), which shall employ appropriate screening procedures. An apprentice in good standing advances from one level to another only upon determination of satisfactory performance by the JATC, which shall have the authority to grant accelerated credit where warranted by the performance of an individual apprentice. The JATC may also grant credited hours to an apprentice who received work experience and/or training prior to entry into the Apprenticeship Program. The JATC will not unreasonably withhold entry and advancement in the Apprenticeship Program for provisional journey-level Laborers after their employment with a referring Individual Employer is terminated.
6.	An apprentice should, whenever possible, be rotated by the Individual Employer through different types of work so as to become trained in a variety of operations and work skills. Where the Individual Employer is unable to provide an apprentice with experience in the full range of craft skills causing the apprentice to exceed the number of hours allotted to a given work process, the JATC may coordinate with the Local Union to reassign the apprentice to other employment in order to provide that experience. For so long as the Individual Employer is able to provide the necessary range of employment experience, the Individual Employer may choose to retain the apprentice from job to job but shall notify the Local Union and JATC of all reassignments. An apprentice shall not work on the jobsite unless supervised by a journey-level Laborer.
7.	Apprentices working underground shall not work without the supervision of a Tunnel Labor/Minef. Apprentices will be permitted to work inside a tunnel only upon the recommendation of the Individual Employer and after successful completion of a Mine Safety and Health Administration

(MSHA) course and a Tunnel and Shaft Worker Course that allows apprentices to experience actual working conditions. Apprentices shall complete such training prior to advancing beyond the third period.
8.	The Individual Employer shall release the apprentice to enroll in Related and Supplemental Instruction (RSI) when the apprentice is notified of mandatory training. An apprentice shall not be penalized for taking time off from work to receive RSI as required by the Apprenticeship Program. The Laborers Apprenticeship Program shall endeavor to notify the Individual Employer of any upcoming RSI requirements the apprentice must satisfy. The Laborers Apprenticeship Program will assist the Individual Employer in meeting its apprentice ratio requirements.
9.	An apprentice who fails to maintain his/her apprenticeship status shall not be eligible for employment as a joumey-level Laborer unless he/she successfully completes the Apprenticeship Program after reinstatement by the JATC. Reinstatement is at the sole discretion of the JATC. If reinstatement is denied, an apprentice may reapply for entry into the Apprenticeship Program after waiting one (1) year from the date he/she was terminated from the Apprenticeship Program. The failure of any apprentice to maintain his/her apprenticeship status shall obligate the Individual Employer to discharge such person upon written notice from the Apprenticeship Program.
10.	WAGE/BENEFIT SCHEDULE: Apprentice wage and fringe benefit rates shall be:
Hours of Credit	Wage Rate	Fringe Benefits
1-600	65% of Journey Worker	Health & Welfare, Training, Vacation Holiday Dues Supplement (current Supplemental Dues amount only), Contract Administration and Industry Stabilization
601 -1200	70% of Journey Worker	Health & Welfare, Training, Vacation Holiday Dues Supplement (current Supplemental Dues amount only), Contract Administration and Industry Stabilization
1201 - 1900	75% of Journey Worker	Full benefits
1901 -2600	80% of Journey Worker	Full benefits
2601-3300	85% of Journey Worker	Full benefits
3301 -4000	90% of Journey Worker	Full benefits
Journey Worker rates are based on the Tunnel Miner rate.
The Individual Employer may pay a higher rate at its option. However, the apprentice must meet his or her commitments to the JATC regardless of compensation.
CALIFORNIA
