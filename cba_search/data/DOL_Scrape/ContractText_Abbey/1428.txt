PREAMBLE
This Agreement is made and entered into this 26th day of May, 2002 by and between the Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc., herein called the “Association” for and on behalf of those persons, firms or corporations who have submitted written authorization to the Association to negotiate and conclude a Labor Agreement, herein called the “Contractor” or “Employer”, and the Northern Wisconsin Regional Council of Carpenters, with geographic jurisdiction as set forth in Exhibit A, herein called “Union” or “Unions”.
NEGOTIATING AGENT LIABILITIES: It is understood and agreed that the Northern Wisconsin Regional Council of Carpenters and Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc., are parties to this Agreement only as negotiating agents and shall not be held liable in any way for any violation of its terms by any Contractor, Regional Council, or its affiliated Local Unions.
ARTICLE I DURATION OF AGREEMENT
Section LI This Agreement shall become effective May 26, 2002 and shall continue in force until midnight May 31, 2008, and shall automatically continue in effect from year to year thereafter unless either party gives ninety (90) days written notice to the other prior to the expiration date, of their desire to open or terminate the Agreement for modifications, whereupon it shall continue past the initial period of the contract from day to day until either party gives five (5) days written notice to the other of its termination.
Section 1.2 The Union has claimed and the Employer is satisfied and acknowledges that the Union represents a majority of the Employer’s employees in the bargaining unit covered by this Labor Agreement. The Employer hereby recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent under Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act for all employees who perform work within such collective bargaining unit for all present and future job sites within the geographical jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
Section 1.3 It is further agreed that any part of the wage rate may be allocated to increase contributions to the Health, Pension, or Apprenticeship and Training Funds, or to increase Working Dues Deduction or Vacation Fund Deductions, provided, however, that any such increase shall be subject to the mutual agreement by and between the negotiating agents.
ARTICLE II
UNION SECURITY
Section2.1 Membership. The Employer agrees to require, during the life of this Agreement, membership in the Union, as a condition of continued employment of all employees covered by this Agreement, within eight (8) days following the effective date of this Agreement, or within eight (8) days following the commencement of such employment, whichever is later; provided, however, that such membership in the Union is available to such employees on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members and that such membership is not denied or terminated for reason other than a failure by the affected employee to tender the periodic dues and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
4
Section 2.2 The Contractor agrees to recognize voluntary and properly signed authorization cards of its employees requesting the Contractor to make deductions from wages for the amount of any delinquent dues, initiation fees, or working dues deduction; such amounts to be sent to the Northern Wisconsin Regional Council of Carpenters.
Section 2.3 Working Dues Deduction. Upon the Union’s receipt of an employee’s written authorization, which shall be irrevocable for not more than one (1) year or the term of this Agreement, whichever occurs sooner, the Employer shall deduct from the employee’s wages, working dues deduction in the amount per hour certified to the Employer by the Union as representative of that required of all members to maintain membership in the Union, and remit the same in an amount as specified under Article VII, Section 7.1 (Wage Rates) to the Wisconsin Carpenters Central Depository as specified under Article IX (Central Depositories) on a remittance form showing the names and amounts from whom the deductions were made in the amount required for the particular area where the work is performed. Such form shall also show the various Fund contributions made by the Employer pursuant to this Agreement. Upon the Employer request, the Union shall furnish the Employer with a copy of the employees written authorization. Failure of the Union to submit such authorization shall relieve the Employer of the obligation to deduct the Working Dues Deduction. Such written authorization by an employee may be revoked by the employee during a ten (10) day period prior to the anniversary or termination date of this Agreement, whichever occurs first. In the absence of such revocation, sent and received in accordance with the foregoing, the authorization shall be renewed for additional yearly periods during the term of this Agreement. The employee’s written authorization shall require that the employee acknowledge that employment in the construction industry may cause the employee to be employed by several different Employers signatory to this Collective Bargaining Agreement and that the authorization will extend to all Employers for whom the employee may perform work under the terms and provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in force and effect as of the time of employment. It shall be the Union’s obligation to provide each Employer with a copy of each employee’s current written authorization upon the establishment or re-establishment of an employment relationship.
Section 2.4 The working dues and assessments required of each employee shall be established annually by the Northern Wisconsin Regional Council of Carpenters in accordance with its Bylaws.
ARTICLE III OTHER AGREEMENTS
Section 3.1 Residential Working Agreement. The Employers recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all carpenters and apprentices for all carpenter work as defined by the Union’s Residential Working Agreement and are automatically bound by the provisions therein when performing residential work within the “Normal Construction Labor Market” of this Agreement (See Exhibit A). The Union shall furnish a copy of the Residential Working Agreement to all Employers.
Section 3.2 Pre-Engineered Metal Building Agreement. The Union shall make available a Pre-Engineered Metal Building Agreement to any Contractor signing this Agreement and desiring to enter into a Pre-Engineered Metal Building Agreement.
5

The Association agrees to furnish to the Union lists of such Employers prior to May 26, 2002 and upon request thereafter. Upon such authorization any Employer shall become a member of the multi-employer bargaining unit here involved and thereby a party to this Master Agreement. Individual Employers who have not so authorized the Association shall, by becoming party to this Master Agreement, also become part of said multi-employer bargaining unit, and said individual Employer authorizes the Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc., to negotiate successor Master Agreements on its behalf and said individual Employer specifically adopts all provisions of any successor Master Agreement entered into between the Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc.fjand the Union. Withdrawal from the multiemployer bargaining unit may be accomplished only by written notice to the Union and to the Association, at least ninety (90) days, but no more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to date of expiration of this Agreement or of any renewal period hereof. Notice to the Association, wherever is required herein, shall constitute notice to each and all members of the multiemployer bargaining unit.

This review shall be made by the Trustees of the Fund who shall be appointed under and in accordance with such Trust Agreement.

The aforementioned negotiations shall pertain to the Training Fund only and shall have no effect on the rest of this Agreement.

DRUG / ALCOHOL TESTING
SUBSTANCE ABUSE TESTING AND ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
This Substance Abuse Policy and Assistance Program has been adopted and implemented pursuant to the negotiations between the Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc., and the Northern Wisconsin Regional Council of Carpenters of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America (“Union”). The term “Contractor” or “Company” when used herein refers to the construction industry Contractors who are members of the Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc. Should any dispute arise with respect to the application or implementation of this policy and program as to employees employed by Contractors, such disputes shall be submitted to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the 2002 - 2008 Commercial Carpenters’ Labor Agreement (“Agreement”).
I PURPOSES
A.	To establish and maintain a safe, healthy working environment for all employees;
B.	To ensure the reputation of the Contractors, their products and services and their employees within the community and industry at large;
C.	To reduce substance abuse-related accidental injuries to persons or property;
D.	To reduce substance abuse-related absenteeism and tardiness, and to improve productivity;
E.	To provide rehabilitation assistance for qualified and eligible employees who seek help;
F.	To protect against liability because of injuries or accidents caused by individuals using alcohol or drugs at work;
G.	To deter individuals from bringing, possessing, or using alcohol and drugs in connection with work;
H.	To clearly state the commitment of construction contractors and the Union to a workplace free from the effects of illegal drug use; and
I.	To comply with any law or regulation requiring such programs.
II POLICY
A.	General Provisions
1.	The Contractor prohibits the use, possession or distribution on its premises or work sites of the following: narcotics, illegal or unauthorized drugs (including marijuana). Employees must not report to work impaired by any drug, intoxicant, or narcotic. Legally prescribed drugs may be permitted on company premises or work sites provided the drugs are contained in the original prescription container and are prescribed by a medical practitioner for the current use of the person in possession of the drug.
2.	The Contractor prohibits the use, possession, distribution of alcoholic beverages, or the presence of personnel impaired by such beverages on its premises or work site. The only exception to this policy is
34
the possession of unopened and sealed alcoholic beverages, which are permitted, in personal vehicles and on Company property.
3.	The Contractor reserves the right to have authorized personnel conduct any additional substance testing mandated by law.
4.	At the discretion of the Contractor, any persons found in possession, offering for sale, purchasing or distributing any illegal substance as described in item one (1) of this Section, will be reported to the civil authorities.
5.	Any employee working on a Federal project is required by law to report any conviction of a violation relating to a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace to his or her superior within five (5) days of such conviction.
6.	Where a contracting agent requires testing of Contractor employees other than as is provided for in this policy, the project owner, the Union, and the Contractor shall meet to find a mutually satisfactory solution for the particular project.
7.	No employee will be required to release information about the use of prescribed medication to the Employer in advance of, or in concurrence with, taking a drug test. This shall not preclude a Medical Review Officer from requesting such information from an employee in the course of verifying the employee’s positive drug test. The Employer may not use a urine specimen collected for drug screening purpose for any other purpose.
8.	Legally prescribed drugs may be permitted on Company premises or worksites provided the drugs are contained in the original prescription container and are prescribed by a licensed physician for the current use of the person in possession of the drug. The Contractor retains the right to request a letter from the employee’s physician explaining the effects any prescribed drugs may have on the ability of the employee to perform assigned duties.
9.	The term “employee” used herein shall be defined as: A person who was a former employee considered for rehire at a later date; or a person who was never employed by the Employer and is being considered for employment.
10.	The Employer will use collection and analysis procedures, which are consistent with the DWHS Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Test Programs (June 9, 1996 or as amended). This also includes the use of DWHS certified testing laboratories for analysis and the use of a Medical Review Officer to verify confirmed positive test results.
B.	Pre-Employment Screening
Only where pre-employment testing for drug or alcohol abuse is required by law, applicants must consent to such testing. Successful passing of such test will be required before applicants will be eligible for employment.
C.	Post-Employment Screening
1.	(a) Any employee that reports to work and whose supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is impaired by the use of drugs as defined in this Section, will be subject to discipline up to and including suspension and be required to undergo a drug test. Those circumstances, both physical and psychological, deemed to be pertinent will be given consideration. Reasonable suspicion is a belief based on behavior observations, or other evidence, sufficient to lead a prudent or reasonable person to
35
suspect that an employee is impaired by a controlled substance, (slurred speech, inappropriate behavior, decreased motor skills, etc).
(b)	A Contractor may also require testing where an employee caused a work-related accident or where an employee was operating or helping to operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work-related accident which resulted in a significant recordable injury as defined by OSHA regulations or significant damage to property and for which the cause of the accident is not readily explainable.
(c)	Any employee who reports to work and whose supervisor has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee is impaired by alcohol will be required to undergo a test for blood alcohol content. If the test is positive, the employee shall be subject to discipline up to and including suspension. Those circumstances, both physical and psychological, deemed to be pertinent will be given consideration. “Reasonable suspicion” is defined for purposes of this sub-section as in sub-section 1(a) above.
2.	Whenever possible, before an employee is required to submit to testing under this policy, the employee should be observed by more than one individual.
3.	(a) All positive tests for controlled substances will be confirmed with a second reliable testing method. Initial testing will be of the immunoassay type, with all confirmation testing being by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The testing lab will be certified for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs. Chemicals to be tested for are marijuana, cocaine, opiate, phencyclidine, and amphetamines. Limits for each of the substances will be according to the appropriate Federal, State and DOT regulations as they are updated periodically.
(b)	The Employer and the Union will select by mutual agreement a reputable laboratory to perform actual testing. The testing agency must be certified by the State or Federal government health authorities as a medical laboratory and must meet the regional requirements for forensic standards; testing must be performed by a certified toxicologist on equipment exclusively dedicated to testing. An unbroken chain of custody of the specimen from the time it is taken from the employee up through the time the laboratory tests the specimen shall be preserved; tamper-proof, sample-handling methods must be observed; and the laboratory must follow the test manufacturer’s instructions in both administration of the test and the reporting of results as “positive” or “negative”.
(c)	Upon notification of a positive drug screen, the employee will be informed of his/her right to have the same sample (or, if applicable, spit sample) re-tested at another certified laboratory at his or her expense. The employee will have seventy-two (72) hours from the time of notification to exercise this option. If the results are negative, the Employer will reimburse the employee for the cost of the test and will make the employee whole for any lost work time or other imposed consequences the initial positive result. If the test result is positive, at any detectable level of drug or drug metabolite, the consequences of the initial test will prevail. The additional test preformed at the employee’s request will be admissible under the grievance and arbitration procedures in this contract, however, if and only if the methodology employed is substantially identical and equivalent to the methodology authorized in this article.
(d)	Testing for blood-alcohol content will be by blood analysis or breathalyzer. A positive test result for alcohol will be reflected by a blood-alcohol content equal to or greater than current Wisconsin State Motor Vehicle regulation.
4.	In the event the test indicates a negative result, the employee shall be immediately reinstated and paid any wages and benefits that would have been paid had his work hours not been interrupted by the test. This is considered full reinstatement.
36
5.	In the event of a positive confirmatory test for a controlled substance or a positive-test for blood-alcohol content, the employee will be referred to participate in the Employee Assistance Program of the Wisconsin Carpenters’ Health Fund. Strict adherence to the guidelines and recommendations medically recommended from that program will, for a first violation, avoid severe discipline or termination except where the employee was impaired at the time he was involved in an accident involving a serious injury, or substantial damage to property, or where the employee was involved in theft and conviction of property from the Contractor or a Contractor’s customer.
6.	If an employee who tested positive for substance abuse enters any required recommended aftercare program, a negative test within thirty (30) days will make the employee eligible for immediate reinstatement provided the Employer has work available and the employee continues and successfully completes the required or recommended aftercare program.
7.	If an employee refuses to be tested for substance abuse, he will remain on the suspension for a maximum of thirty (30) days. A negative test in this thirty (30) days will make the employee eligible for reinstatement providing he or she continues and successfully completes any required or recommended aftercare program. Continued refusal to submit to drug screening after the thirty (30) day period, if recommended by an E.A.P. counselor, will subject the employee to severe disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Ill	COUNSELING OR TREATMENT
A.	Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc. and the Union shall develop and maintain a list of appropriate alcohol and drug abuse treatment centers, counseling centers, and/or medical assistance centers.
B.	If the employee is qualified and eligible, a portion of the expenses the employee incurs in consultation and treatment under this program shall be borne by the applicable fringe benefit fund referred to in the Agreement pursuant to and to the extent provided in schedules, terms, and requirements as the Trustees of said Fund shall prepare and have available schedules of benefits or reimbursements available to employees participating in such programs.
C.	If an employee participating in the treatment program prescribed does not comply with the recommendations, advice or schedules established by the counselor or counseling agency, the counselor or counseling agency shall immediately advise the Contractor and the Union. The foregoing section shall not apply to an employee who voluntarily seeks assistance pursuant to paragraph IV “Rehabilitation”.
D.	Prior to the test, the applicant or employee must be given an opportunity to sign a consent and release form authorizing and agreeing to the test. The consent and release are to be in the form of Exhibits I and II to this policy. The drug test will consist of a urinalysis drug screen and, if a drug screen is positive, a follow-up confirmatory test as per Post-Employment Test item 3. These tests shall be at the Contractor’s expense.
E.’ The parties recognize that drug testing may reveal information concerning individual employees of a highly personal and private nature unrelated to the employment of the employee or any other legitimate concern of outside parties; therefore, to protect the employee’s rights any test results shall be disclosed only to the employer, employee, authorized union agent, or the testing lab.
37
F.	Within three (3) working days of notification by certified letter or hand delivered with receipt of a positive test result, an employee may request that the laboratory re-test the original sample at his expense. If the re-test is negative, the Contractor shall reimburse the employee for the cost of the re-test.
IV	REHABILITATION
Any employee who feels that he or she has developed an addiction or dependence to alcohol or drugs is encouraged to seek assistance. Requests for assistance will be handled in strict confidence through the E.A.P.
V	MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
A.	Contracting agencies may require certain Contractors to establish and maintain written drug awareness programs with certain minimum provisions. In the event that a Contractor becomes obligated to comply with such a program, the Contractor may do so only pursuant to the terms herein.
B.	An appropriate notice to employees concerning the existence of this program, the treatment, and counseling available as well as the penalties described above shall be communicated to employees under the Agreement.
C.	Neither the Associated General Contractors of Wisconsin, Inc., nor the Union shall be liable for any activities or conduct engaged in pursuant to this program.
VI	CONCLUSION
This program and policy statement is intended to protect the Contractor’s most valuable asset, namely its employees. The health and safety of all employees and the general public is of the utmost concern. The above presented program will help insure a safe work place for all.
