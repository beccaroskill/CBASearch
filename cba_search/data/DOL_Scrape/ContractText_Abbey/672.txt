A Message from Local 27 President, Buddy Mays
This contract is provided for you so that you can become familiar with the language and conditions it sets forth. Please take the time to read it through completely at least once.
It is extremely important for you to know what your rights are under this agreement. While it is your union's job to police the contract, it is up to you to let us know that violations are occurring. We will take it from there.
We apologize for the time it took to get a printed full document to you. We did everything possible to speed up the process, but unfortunately there were several major disagreements on language changes that had to be worked out.
In Solidarity,
Buddy Mays
President, UFCW Local 27

Collective Bargaining Agreement : How it Works
When you join a Union, you gain the right to have a voice in decisions about your work life - wages, benefits and working conditions. The collective bargaining process puts you across the table from management, as an equal.
Bargaining is compromise. Neither the Union nor management gets everything they want.
How do Union negotiators know what issues are most important to the membership? You tell us! Before bargaining begins, the Union surveys all members in the bargaining unit to determine priorities. An employee advisory committee provides a constant check for the bargaining team.
In addition, Local 27 representatives and shop stewards are in the facilities almost every day, speaking to members about grievances, problems and needs. They have a hands-on sense of what the problems are.
Our collective bargaining department monitors trends in the industries where we bargain, looking at wage and benefit settlements. We have a good idea what is transpiring around the country, which means our negotiators can cite examples elsewhere to support our bargaining goals.
When rhe give-and-take of contract negotiations is finished, management presents its final offer. The Union brings that offer to the membership. All contracts are approved or rejected by majority vote of those attending the meeting from the bargaining unit.

BENEFITS
UFCW Local 27's aggressive organizing activities in the Baltimore Metropolitan area throughout its jurisdiction have given us the strength to negotiate good salaries for our members. But we know you have concerns that go beyond your weekly paycheck - and that's why the benefit's package in this contract is so important to you and your family. This extensive total compensation package, the best in the industry, is also made possible by the strength of your Union at the bargaining table.
A prime example is your health care package. The astronomical rise in health care costs have forced some Unions to make concessions to management, to allow the company to shift part of the insurance premiums to their employees. But your contract contains a health package which is mostly funded by Safeway.
You'll also find that your health care package includes some very special benefits that can prove invaluable to you and your family, such as:
■	Optical benefits
■	Dental Care
■	Prescription drugs at	low-cost
■	Employee Assistance	Program for counseling in family
problems, retirement planning, stress, obesity, smoking cessation, etc.
And keep in mind you are eligible for these benefits as both a full-time and part-time UFCW Local 27 member at Safeway. (In some instances, eligibility may depend upon individual qualifications under the collective bargaining agreement).
s
Paid Vacations
A paid vacation is something that is an outright necessity to every worker in America. To assure that your quality of life is continually up to par, you need paid time off to go to the beach, to visit relatives in other parts of the country, or just to break they everyday routine of the workplace. This is exactly why we have negotiated an extensive vacation schedule for every full and part-time UFCW member at Safeway. Depending on your seniority with the company, you can be eligible for up to five weeks of paid vacation time per year. (Article 11)
Personal Davs
Vacation days are of great help, however, for meetings, medical appointments and attending to family-related matters, in addition to your regular vacation schedule, we have negotiated a number of "personal days" which you can use for any purpose that you choose. Depending on seniority with the company you are eligible for up to five of these days off a year. (Article 12.2)
Holidays
Holidays are perhaps the best means to spend time with your family members and friends. Throughout the year, you will be paid for the following days to enjoy the company of your loved ones: (Article 12.1J
New Year's Day Memorial Day Independence Day
Labor Day
Thanksgiving Day
Christmas Day
To assure that you do not miss out on a paid vacation day, we have made it possible that when a holiday falls on one of your scheduled days off, you shall be given another day off during the week or you will receive an additional day's pay. (Article 11.5)
6
Funeral Leave
If the unfortunate occurrence arises where you lose an immediate family member, UFCW Local 27 has made certain that you will receive time off to grieve and attend the funeral. You will be given up to three days of leave with pay to take care of such matters. (Article 13.2, 13.3)
Leaves of Absence
Very often an employee may need to leave the workplace for an extended period of time to attend to personal affairs or health matters. As a UFCW member at Safeway, you are eligible to take a leave of absence without pay if you so choose. If this does occur, we have assured that you will NOT lose any of the seniority you have accrued. (Article 13.1)
Sick Leave Benefits
Times of illness and disability are, needless to say, very unpleasant. Whether you treatyour illness at home or in the hospital, the UFCW has arranged for a sick leave plan that will make the experience as easy as possible. Depending upon your position and seniority, with Safeway, you are entitled to a disability plan. Under several plans offered through the contractyou will be entitled to between 16 and 39 weeks of paid disability. (Article 17, and Plan I and Plan X - FELRA and UFCW Health & Welfare booklets)
Retirement Plan
After dedicating your working life to Safeway, you deserve a generous compensation plan so that you may spend your latter years in comfort and security. The UFCW has therefore negotiated a valuable retirement plan to fulfill your needs after your departure from the working world. As your seniority advances in youryears at Safeway, you are credited with an ever-increasing benefit package. (Article 18 FELRA and UFCW Pension Plan booklet)
7
Of special interest to you, in this mobile world of ours where workers move around a lot, is pension portability. Local 27 has arranged for pension reciprocity with other plans in the Baltimore metropolitan area, as well as the Atlantic, Philadelphia, and the UFCW Internationa! Union -Industry Pension plan.
Life Insurance
To guarantee that you have life insurance as a UFCW member of Safeway, you are eligible for life insurance coverage through the FELRA and UFCW Health & Welfare Fund. (FELRA and UFCW Health & Welfare plan booklet)
Protections
Providing outstanding wages, vacation time, and insurance are only a part of what the UFCW does for its members. We also have negotiated with the company to guarantee that a certain level of respect, safety, and security are provided for every single one of our members.
The guidelines of our contract assure that Safeway will provide a safe working environment, a reasonable working schedule, overtime wages, and a seniority system that establishes certain rights for employees. The UFCW realizes that these issues are very important to each and every Union members. That is exactly why we have worked to provide a contract that protects the welfare of our members.
Grievances and Arbitration
This contract is a guarantee of rights and benefits the Union has negotiated on your behalf. Still, in any workplace situation, events
8
can occurthataffectyouadversely-and they may be in violation of that contract. Let your Union representative know about it, so that your problem can be reviewed and necessary grievance action be recommended.
Article 21 of your contract is quite clear: Grievances may be filed and you and your representative can meet with management to assure you are treated fairly. And you are guaranteed prompt action - discussion to resolve your problem must begin within three days of notification.
If your grievance cannot be resolved, then it can go to an independent arbitrator.
Seniority
The UFCW recognizes that loyal, experienced, and long standing employees are very valuable to a company. We subsequently have bargained for increasingly better benefits, wages, and protection for employees who have the most seniority with Safeway. As you accrue more seniority, you become eligible for additional vacation time, a higher salary, and have a greater chance for being promoted within the company. Those who have dedicated their lives to working for Safeway deserve to be duly rewarded. Our seniority system assures that this occurs. (Article 5)
Working Conditions
Without a safe and comfortable work environment, it is virtually impossible for an employee to fulfill his/her job duties in a productive manner. According to our collective bargaining agreement, Safeway has the responsibility to provide working conditions that are in full compliance with requirements set forth in the contract. Experts within our Union actively monitor the work site to ensure that all rules and regulations are being followed. If the UFCW observes that your health and safety are in danger, the proper authorities are notified and action is taken. (Article 10 & Schedule "H")
9
Overtime
In order to spend time with your family and pursue recreational hobbies, you need to maintain a reasonable work schedule. If such a need arises when you are called to work more than eight hours in a day or forty hours in a week however, you will be paid one and one half times your regular rate. Only members covered by a Union contract enjoy the negotiated benefit of daily overtime. Federal Wage and Hour Laws only give workers weekly overtime. UFCW has also assured that no employee will have to work split shifts. [Article 6)
Juiy Puty
Jury Duty is a responsibility that every American citizen may eventually have to fulfill. Very often court cases run weeks or months at a time and it is likely you will miss a substantial amount of work. The UFCW has made it possible for you to serve your community in this manner with financial penalty. You will be granted time off and paid the difference between the amount of your regular rate of pay and the amount received for your jury duty. (Article 14)
Legal Services
Given the ever-increasing costs of legal services, UFCW Local 27 has arranged for a legal benefits trust fund for most of our members. These services may be used to provide additional security for you and your family. The benefit is paid for by your employer and the legal services provided are for the most part at no cost. (Article 17 and UFCW and FELRA Legal Benefit Plan Booklet)

3.5	The Employer shall notify the Union thirty (30) days prior to a store closing. The Employer shall negotiate the effect on employees of the store scheduled to be closed.

16
in status from part time to full time or full time to part time.
ARTICLE 5	- SENIORITY
5.1	Seniority for the purpose of this Agreement shall be calculated by
continuous service from the last date of employment except otherwise provided. Seniority list for all full time Grocery Department employees and a separate list for all part time Grocery Department employees, also a seniority list for all full time Meat Department employees and a separate list for all part time Meat Department employees shall be set up by the Employer and shall be furnished to the Union upon request. Seniority areas governing this Agreement are outlined in Schedules "F" and "G" attached hereto and made a part hereof. In connection with layoffs and store closings, seniority will first apply to store, then geographic area and last the jurisdiction of this Agreement. (Schedule "G" applies to layoffs, store closings and promotions only and Schedule "F" applies to all other purposes). In layoff situations involving involuntary movement either day to night or night to day the Employer agrees to review said movement within thirty (30) days and make all adjustments by seniority in accordance with Schedule F.
5.2	The Employer recognizes the principle of seniority by classification as being one in which the movement of an employee from one job to another or from one location to another through promotion, layoff, recall after layoff, or permanent transfer, shall be governed by the length of service of the employee, provided said employee has a satisfactory work record. In connection with such movement the Employer may take into consideration, as to each employee involved, his ability to perform the work if said employee fails to qualify within a reasonable amount of time, defined as no less than thirty (30) days. In certain layoff situations, the employee's ability to perform the work will be considered and the above will not apply. In the Meat Department temporary transfers from one store to another shall be executed in accordance with seniority with consideration to job classification.
5.3	Full time employees to be laid off by classification shall have the option of part time employment, and shall be placed at the top of the part time seniority list, or may take a complete layoff. They shall have the right of recall on any full time opening, provided they can do the work and further that if an employee is laid off or reduced to part time out of seniority, the matter must be brought to the attention of the Personnel Department within thirty (30) days of said reduction or layoff. Full time
17
employees reduced from full time to part time through no fault of their own will retain full time Health and Welfare and Pension coverage for a period of twelve (12) months. The Employer will continue the full time Health and Welfare and Pension contribution for said period of time. When a full time employee is involuntarily reduced to part time, he shall continue to accrue seniority as though he was still full time. When a full time employee voluntarily reduces himself in writing, his part time seniority is dated from the original date of hire. For a reduction in work force and recall purposes only, Meat Apprentice, Weigher and Wrapper, Delicatessen and Seafood personnel will be considered one classification and also First Cutter and Journeyman will be considered one classification. Where the application of the provision creates a hardship or operational problem the Union and Employer agree to discuss and resolve the problem. Any employee affected by this provision shall have the right to refuse their bump into another classification and take a complete layoff.
5.4	Seniority and the employee's ability to perform the work shall be given consideration in regard to promotions within the bargaining unit. If the employee fails to qualify within a reasonable time for the upgraded positions, he shall be afforded the opportunity to return to his former classification without loss of seniority. The Employer will notify the Union of all promotions to Department Head classification.
5.5	Part time employees desiring full time work and lower classified food employees desiring to upgrade in classification shall be given preference for such work in accordance with the following procedure. (The Employer will maintain a separate bid list for the Grocery Department and the Meat Department for those employees who desire upgrade in status.) Employees who bid and receive an upgraded position within another seniority list shall suffer no loss in wages, unless such position is a lesser classified position, and further shall use their original employment date for all purposes other than available hours, reductions and layoffs.
A.	Employees who have completed their probationary period and who desire an upgrading as described above shall notify the Employer, in writing, with a copy to the Union, during the periods March 1 st to March 2 i st, and September 1 st to September 21 st each year. Such letters shall remain valid for eighteen (18) months. The March bid list will be effective from April 1 I th through October I I th and the September bid list will be effective from October 12th
18
through April 1 Oth. The Union and the Employer agree to exchange the bid list no later than April 11 th and October 12th of each year.
B.	The first consideration for any such vacancies shall be given to employees with a current request in order of the employee's seniority with ability to do the work to be considered. However, full time Night Crew employees will be given priority consideration for available full-time day vacancies within the Food Clerk classification.
C.	Only requests for permanent classification change shall be valid and failure to be available thereafter for such work for a period of ■ twenty-six (26) weeks after obtaining such status, except for reasons beyond the employee's control, shall bar the employee from future requests for a period of twelve fl 2) months.
D.	Failure to accept an offer of such work in any of the Employer's stores within a seniority area shall result in removal of the employee's request for the balance of that six (6) month period, but it shall not bar the employee from future requests. Any employee who declines a full time night crew position will not be removed from the list for the balance of the active bid.
E.	Part time employees who are promoted to full time will receive credit for time worked on the basis of forty (40) hours being equivalent to one (1) week and the employee's full time seniority date will be adjusted accordingly.
5.6	Employees laid off due to the store closing or reduction of employment shall be laid off by order of the most recent hired and shall be rehired in the reverse order of the layoff, with due consideration given to Job classification. Employees laid off and subsequently recalled within twelve (12) months will retain their former seniority. The Employer agrees to go beyond the seniority areas in the case of full time layoffs in distressed areas. However, the Employer will decide what store to transfer the employee to. There shall be no bumping by seniority. If the available opening for a part time employee who is recalled is outside of the seniority area the employee may refuse the opening without prejudice to future recall within the same seniority area.
5.7	The Employer agrees to give a week's notice or a week's pay in lieu of a week's notice to full time employees with six (6) months service
19
and three (3) days notice or three days pay to part time employees with twelve (12) months service who are laid off due to lack of work. All employees likewise shall give a week's notice prior to intended resignation. It is mutually agreed that after termination notice has been given by either party, no new request for sick benefits shall be granted.
5.8	Any employee transferred into the Meat Department or Grocery Department from any other part of the Company shall retain their last employment date for the purpose of computing the effective date of their benefits, but their seniority date shall be established as the date they commenced working in the Bargaining Unit.
5.9	The Union shall be notified of all full time openings.
5.10	Employees involuntarily transferred from one seniority area to another as a result of store closing or layoffs, will be afforded the opportunity to return to their original seniority area before a permanent employee of the same job classification is hired in said seniority area. Said transfer opportunity shall exist for a period of twelve (12) months.
5.11	A. Before a Journeyman Meat Cutter can be reduced to part time or laid off within the seniority area, all apprentices must be laid off within the seniority area. Where the application of this provision creates a hardship or operational problem, the Union and the Employer agree to discuss and resolve the problem.
B. For Meat Department employees that are to be reduced from full time to part time, the Employer shall, where practicable, by combining existing part time assignments within the areas described in Schedule "D" provide regular fuli time employment.
ARTICLE 6 - HOURS AND OVERTIME
6.1 A The guaranteed basic work week for all full time employees shall be forty (40) hours per week, consisting of five (5) eight (8) hour days.
B.	The Employer may institute a four (4) day work week consisting of ten (10) hours per day. Such scheduling will not be instituted until notification and agreement with the Union.
6.2	For the purpose of this Agreement the basic work week shall be
20
from Monday through Saturday, inclusive.
6.3	Sunday work shall be isolated and shall not be part of the basic work week.
6.4	All time worked by an employee in excess of eight (8) hours in any one (1) day, five (5) days in one (I) week, or forty (40) hours in any work week, or in excess of thirty-two (32) hours in any week in which one of the specified holidays fall, shall be deemed overtime. Such overtime work shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (I'/z) the employee's regular rate of pay, - but the employee shall not be compensated for both daily and weekly overtime. Hours which qualify for Sunday premium pay as provided in Paragraph 6.3 of this Article shall not be included in computing weekly overtime.
