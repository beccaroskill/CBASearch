a.	Regular Temporary Employees.
The name and company seniority of each temporary employee regularly assigned to buildings in Downtown/Century City, as well as the employee’s corresponding building name and address.
b.	Extra Temporary Employees.
The name and company seniority of each temporary employee not assigned to a building in Downtown/Century City.

3.	Temporary Job Assignment.
a.	Buildings in Downtown/Century City.
i.	Buildings in Downtown/Century City will have a sufficient number of temporary employees determined by the Employer, regularly assigned to them by the Union, according to seniority. These will be referred to as ‘Regular Temporary Employees.’
ii.	Building Supervisors in this area will offer temporary job assignments only to the Regular Temporary Employees assigned to their specific building. Assignments will be offered by seniority.
iii.	If a building in this area requires a temporary employee assigned to it on a regular basis, the Employer will notify the Union in writing and the Union will offer the position to the most senior employee on the Extra Temporary Employee list. If the most senior employee chooses not to accept the position, the Union will offer it to the next most senior and follow the same procedure. The Union will then notify the Employer in writing of which employee will fill that position.
b.	Record Keeping.
i.	The Employer is responsible for calling the employee at least two hours before the beginning of the shift, or
682207.10
8
REVISED
4-06-09
as soon as the Employer becomes aware of the need for temporary coverage.
ii.	The building supervisor, or other representative of the Employer, will keep a written record of the time and date that an offer was made and the response by the temporary employee to each job offer. This information will be available fore review by the Union or building shop steward, upon request.
4.	Long Term Temporary Job Assignments.
Long-term temporary job assignments will be offered in the same manner that regular temporary coverage is offered: by seniority. If a long-term temporary coverage is needed in this area, the Employer shall offer it by seniority to its Regular Temporary Employees.

parties to the dispute receive additional time to deliberate on the matters presented but in no case shall the decision be delayed beyond the forty-eight (48) hours following the close of the hearing.
D.	Arbitrator’s Decision. The Arbitrator shall orally advise the parties of his/her decision with a brief explanation of the basis thereof.

advise the other in writing of its desire to proceed to arbitration under the provisions of Article XXV of this Agreement, wherein the parties are not limited to representation by any person of their choice.

B.	Trust Fund. The Employer agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the California Service Employees Health and Welfare Trust Fund, and any plan documents or summary plan description thereof, as each of these may from time to time be amended by the Board of Trustees, and hereby acknowledges prior receipt of a copy thereof. The Employer shall comply with the provisions of the California Service Employees Health and Welfare Trust, and shall maintain, as required by applicable law, furnish and make available for audit such data and records as the Trustees may require, as provided in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust of the California Service Employees Health and Welfare Trust.
C.	Coverage. The Employer shall provide Health and Welfare coverage for employees covered by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of coverage contained herein.

For each employee receiving such Health and Welfare coverage, the Employer shall pay initially to the Trust Fund, a base premium of $541.80 (five hundred forty-one dollars and eighty cents) per month.
3.	Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 above, if the Employer acquires a location at which employees have different benefits in excess of those provided herein, the Employer shall maintain these benefits at rates required by the Plan for the life of this Agreement.
D.	Eligibility for Benefits. Eligibility and qualifications for all employees provided with benefits under this Article are:
1.	Employees must have completed one thousand forty (1,040) worked hours before qualifying for coverage. Coverage shall begin on the first day of the
682207.10
48
REVISED
4-06-09
calendar month following the calendar month in which said requirements have been met and contributions have been paid and received by the Trust Fund.
2.	Qualifying hours for all locations will be one hundred ten (110) hours or more per month to provide Health and Welfare coverage the following month after payment has been received by the Trust Fund. Paid vacation, paid holidays and paid sick leave shall be included in computing qualifying hours in the month in which the employee would have normally worked such hours. Paid vacation also shall be included in computing qualifying hours with the following exception. If the employer has paid to an employee at the employee’s request accrued vacation pay in advance of the month or months in which the employee takes the corresponding vacation time, such pre-paid vacation pay shall not count in computing the qualifying hours of the employee for the month or months in which it is paid, including for the purpose of determining employer overpayments or underpayments. At the employee’s written request such vacation hours shall be credited toward eligibility for the month(s) that the employee actually takes time off from work. The employee shall inform the Employer, in writing, as to when they shall actually take time off from work. Vacation and Sick Leave cash-outs are also to be included in computing qualifying hours.

It is also agreed that the employee benefits established hereunder shall be maintained for the life of this Agreement, including pre-impasse periods after the expiration of this Agreement. If the amount of the contributions required by the Board of Trustees is modified during the term of this Agreement, including pre-impasse periods after the expiration of this Agreement, then the Employer agrees to pay as follows:
2.	The premium costs of $541.80 in effect with May 2008 work hours shall constitute the “base premium” for purposes of this Section E. In the event that the Trustees of the Trust (“Trust”) referred to in Section A above determine
682207.10
49
REVISED
4-06-09
that it is necessary to increase premiums above the base premium in order to maintain the benefits which were in effect with May 2008 work hours, or which may be adopted hereafter by the Employer and the Union, the Employer shall, during each anniversary year of this Agreement, commencing with May 2009 work hours, pay up to 9% of any such premium increase over the base premium. Except as provided below, the Employer’s share of said increased premium shall not exceed $590.56 effective with May 2009 work hours, $643.71 effective with May 2010 work hours, and $701.65 effective with May 2011 work hours.

Any premium increase in excess of 15% over the base premium in any contract anniversary year shall be shared equally between the Employer and affected employees through payroll deductions as permitted by Section 224 of the California Labor Code. No portion of the contribution shall be paid directly by the employee to the Trust Fund. It is the sole responsibility of the Employer to transmit the entire contribution to the Trust Fund. The Employer is hereby authorized to make the payroll deduction necessary to make the required contribution to the Trust Fund, as authorized by California Labor Code Section 224. Failure by the Employer to make a payroll deduction does not relieve the Employer’s obligation to transmit to the Trust Fund the entire contribution amount for eligible employees.
F.	Dental Plan. Effective May 2011 work hours, the Employer shall make additional contributions to California Service Employees Trust Fund to add the Liberty Dental Plan to the existing medical, prescription and life insurance plan.

The Employer is hereby authorized, if necessary, to make the payroll deduction necessary to make the required contribution to the Trust Fund, as authorized by California Labor Code Section 224.
