27
Article Vllt - Seniority (continued)
the event they become so eligible. The employee can list specific options or state "any" or "none".
(2)	Employees who elect to utilize the preference sheet will be responsible for calling their department to obtain their resulting overtime schedule.
(3)	Employees who do not elect to use the preference sheet will be contacted in the order of their eligibility. Each employee is responsible for providing supervision with a reasonable means of contact.
i.	Once an employee accepts an overtime assignment, there will be no further option to refuse the assignment unless approved by supervision. In departments where overtime is scheduled and when employees are permitted to decline said assignments, employees must refuse said assignments by 10:00 a.m. Friday.
j.	An employee who requests and is granted a day(s) off will not be offered overtime on said day(s) but will be charged for refusal(s) if he would have been otherwise eligible. For the purpose of this provision, a day is defined as a 24-hour calendar day.

During the period, an employee may return or be returned to his former position and seniority status if such
28
Article VW • Seniority (continued)
promotion proves unsatisfactory to the employee or, if, in the Company's judgement, he has failed to perform satisfactorily the duties of the position to which he shall have been promoted. This trial period does not apply to automatic promotions from job level to job level within a line of progression. However, a 14 calendar day trial period will be applicable to such promotions when an employee has not previously worked that job a minimum of five turns within the past 12 months.
2.	Any employee who declines a promotion or is not promoted due to his inability to perform the job ahead of him, will not be permitted to contest the seniority of the employee who takes the promotion; or any other employees then ahead of the promoted employee so far as future promotions are concerned (within his line of progression) but will retain his seniority on his own job in case of cutbacks. However, if such employee is later permanently promoted to level hand on a job with employee(s) who so advanced around him, he will then reestablish his full seniority rights in the case where future promotions are concerned.
3.	Each time an employee is entitled to a permanent promotion he shall be offered and assigned such promotion and if he declines, he shall sign a new Waiver Card indicating such refusal. It shall be the responsibility of the employee's foreman to secure a signed Waiver Card in each such case. If an employee, declining a promotion, refuses to sign a Waiver Card, his foreman shall prepare such card, annotate the card that the employee has refused to sign and have the card noted by an appropriate Union Representative. Copies of the signed waiver to be distributed as indicated on Waiver Card.
4.	When it is practical to do so, the application of seniority will be considered in cases of emergency. It is recognized and agreed, however, that under emergency situations decisions must often be
29
Article VtU - Seniority (continued)
made which prevent the application of seniority. In such situations, the Company shall have a reasonable tolerance in such emergency conditions including the consideration of the need for scheduling overtime. It is further provided that after a period of 48 hours following the occurrence of the emergency, any further acknowledgement of the original emergency shall cease to exist and employees will be assigned in accordance with the principles of this Article, unless the emergency period is extended by mutual agreement of the parties. It is agreed that the hours worked by an employee out of seniority order in an emergency will not be considered as establishing any prior right to any permanent position at the time an opening occurs at a later date.
Section E - Probationary Employees
1.	A new employee shall be considered as a probationary employee for a period of the first 520 hours of actual work, during which period no continuous service credit will be received. A probationary employee may file grievances under this Agreement but may be laid off or discharged as exclusively determined by the Company; provided that this will not be used for purposes of discrimination because of race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, or because of membership in the Union. If a new employee is continued in the employ of the Company after completion of the probationary period, the employee shall receive any seniority service credit which would have otherwise become applicable during such probationary period.
2.	Where a probationary employee is relieved from work because of lack of work and his employment status terminates in connection therewith, and he is subsequently rehired at the same plant within one year from the date of such termination, he will be given credit for his hours of actual work in the
30
Article VID • Seniority (continued)
period immediately preceding such termination but his continuous service date shall be from the date of Iasi hire. If, however, such employee is rehired within two weeks of his last termination from employment, his continuous service date will be the date of hire for his prior employment.
Section F * Temporary Vacancies
1.	A temporary vacancy is one created by sickness, leave, vacation, or other temporary condition.
a.	Such vacancies will be filled by the temporary promotion of employees scheduled on the turn on which the vacancy occurs, provided, that qualified employees are available on the turn. Article VIII-H-3 will be applicable when such employees are not available and if it remains necessary to fill the vacancy.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this para* graph, employees who are scheduled on turn via any overtime provisions will not be permitted to temporarily promote until all eligible employees who are scheduled as part of their normal 40-hour workweek are first offered the temporary promotion.
b.	The length of time during which such vacancies shall be filled in accordance with paragraph a above, will be determined by agreement between supervision and the Union Representatives for each of the various seniority departments and shall be set forth in each department's supplemental agreement.
c.	Temporary vacancies that exceed, or reasonably can be expected to exceed the length of time provided for in paragraph b above, shall be classified as Extended Temporary Vacancies and shall be filled by the procedure (administrative means) utilized for filling permanent vacancies (excluding permanent waivers).

Resulting entry level vacancies in the department shall be filled on a plant-wide basis (the third step of competition).
b.	Permanent vacancies on resultant entry level jobs classified as Zone 4 and below that are filled on a departmental or plant-wide basis shall be filled among qualified employees in order of length of Company Continuous Service, except as provided otherwise for filling permanent vacancies in apprenticeships.

32
Article Vin - Seniority (continued)

Similarly, for craft jobs which are not filled by the promotion or assignment of apprenticeship graduates, permanent vacancies in the noncraft jobs which, in fact, lead to such craft jobs shall be filled on a ptant-wide basis from among qualified bidding employees.
d.	The word "qualified", as it applies to Paragraph c above, shall be interpreted as follows: The Company may require applicants for craft jobs or apprentice positions to be qualified to perform or to learn to perform, as the case may be, the craft job in question.
2.	a. An employee who has the qualifications to perform the job on which a vacancy exists who transfers at the third step of competition shall have the right to return to the department, unit, or line from which the employee transferred within a 35 calendar day period commencing with Sunday of the first week of assignment to the vacant job. Furthermore, if the Company should return the employee to that employee's department, unit, or line because the employee cannot meet the requirements of the job to which such employee has been assigned, such return shall be made within such 35 calendar day period. In either event, the employee’s return to that employee’s former department, unit, or line within such 35 calendar day period shall be without loss of such employee's seniority standing.
b.	The rights set out in 2a above shall also apply in cases where an employee transfers from one seniority unit to another in the same department but is limited to a 21 calendar day period rather than 35 days.

33
Artlcte Vm - Sanlorfty (continued)
c.

d.	Any employee who requests transfer to Employment Reserve shall, in the event the request be granted, immediately upon leaving, forfeit all rights to his former seniority department, unit, or line.
e.	Any Reserve employee who transfers at the third step of competition shall have the right to return to Reserve within the 35 day calendar period commencing with Sunday of the first week of assignment to the vacant job.

Section H - Employment Reserve Assignment Procedure
1.	In order to make the Employment Reserve operate to the highest degree of efficiency, it is recognized that the more senior employees should have the opportunity for assignment to higher-rated or more continuous jobs out of the Employment Reserve. An employee so available will work as assigned on various jobs throughout the Works, according to seniority.
2.	Assignments out of the Employment Reserve will be based on seniority of all employees assigned to the Employment Reserve. It is the responsibility of employees assigned by the Employment Reserve to obtain their schedules from the Employment Reserve no later than 4:00 p.m. on the Friday before the week to be worked.
3.	The Company will not be required to make changes in schedules in the Employment Reserve after 12:00 noon Friday. In the event job assignments occur after 12:00 noon Friday, these assignments will be made on the following basis:
a.	The Company agrees to fill necessary vacancies by: first, matching the turn with the senior employee from "Job Group D"; second,
40
Article Vffl - Seniority (continued)
assigning the senior employee on a straight-time basis, who is cut back to Employment Reserve, but did not rate a normal work schedule, provided a minimum of three days employment, including his original schedule, if any, is available; third, going to department overtime and, after exhausting the overtime roster, forcing the least senior department employee working the previous turn and/or assigning a less senior qualified employee from Employment Reserve working in the department to the overtime; and fourth, by taking any measures necessary as provided for in the Basic Agreement to obtain a qualified employee.
b.	When employee(s) are utilized from 'Job Group D," said employee(s) may be replaced at the Company's discretion, through the Labor Pool on a matching turn basis. It is further understood that the Company may assign additional employees to the Labor Pool subsequent to Employment Reserve's schedule posting time for the week tn question utilizing the same means, and subject to the same conditions, contained in and relevant to the second step of this procedure.
c.	The same procedure cited above will be utilized to fill vacancies requiring trained individuals with the exception that the Company will assign the senior qualified employee in all cases.
d.	Employees assigned to partial work schedules will be given first consideration for additional work up to 40 physical hours, provided such assignments can be made on a straight-time basis and that said employees are the more senior of those eligible. During a holiday week, the 40 physical hours will be reduced to conform with the scheduling concept (3 + 2 or 4 + 1) being utilized by Employment Reserve.
41
Article VID - seniority (continued)
e.	it is understood that the second step of this procedure will not be applicable after Wednesday of the week in question, except for those employees who have an original schedule of three or more days.
4.	Employees unable to work a full week in their own department due to a work reduction or a breakdown of equipment will be referred to the Employment Reserve for further assignment based on seniority.
5.	In the application of the foregoing paragraphs of this section, employees who are being assigned through Employment Reserve may be displaced, assigned and re-assigned where necessary to provide work for employees with greater seniority.
Section I - Force Reduction and Furlough
1.	Nothing in this Article shall deprive employees with greater seniority of the opportunity for regular work assignments in the event of force reductions in preference to employees with less seniority; when conditions so warrant, the Company shall remove a sufficient number of employees with less seniority from their regular work assignments or their regular seniority departments, if necessary, to provide regular work assignments for employees with greater seniority. The employees so displaced shall be referred to the Employment Reserve in an effort to give them available work elsewhere in the Plant. Such employees shall hold their seniority in their regular department until regular work to which they are entitled becomes available, but shall forfeit such seniority if they do not report back to their regular seniority department for the next scheduled week when notified by the Company that regular work is available. Regular work, as it applies to this section of the agreement, is a full scheduled week in the department in which an employee has seniority rights.
42
Article Vin ■ Seniority (continued)
2.	In making force reductions in a department, the employees affected and the appropriate District Union Representatives shall be given, whenever possible, one week advance notice.
3.	When departmental force reductions are in effect, the Company shall monitor the work assignments anticipated to be available through the Employment Reserve in an effort to avoid a situation where there are Reserve employees (employees cut back from their regular seniority departments) without work assignments who are more senior than other employees who, by virtue of their incumbency rights, continue to work in their regular seniority departments. When conditions so warrant, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably possible, establish a plant-wide displacement date in order to designate the employees necessary to be displaced (furloughed) from their regular seniority departments so as to open up work opportunities for the more senior Reserve employees.
4.	An employee cut back to the Employment Reserve in accordance with the above procedure (Paragraph 3) will be returned to his own seniority department when his displacement date is rescinded and provided work is available.
5.	In the application of the provisions of Paragraph 3 of this Section, the Company will discuss with and provide to the Rules Committee the date established for furlough displacement purposes and a list of the employees involved.
Section J - Layoff
1.	When the Company reduces forces and gives notice of layoff, it shall establish a layoff date as provided for in Paragraph 4 of this Section. Employees shall be laid off and recalled in accordance with their seniority except such action shall not require at one time the displacement of employees in any seniority department(s) when the
43
Article VIII - Seniority (continued)
extent of such displacement would result in undue dilution of experienced employees in such seniority department(s). When such an exception is necessary, the Company shall promptly notify the Union Rules Committee as to the individual(s) involved and the reasons applicable thereto. Furthermore, the Company shall not rely on said exemption privilege beyond the time reasonably needed to train a replacement(s) (except in those cases where such training would be unreasonable due to the extent required).
2.	During a period of layoff, an employee so affected shall retain his relative seniority status in his regular seniority department, unit, or line; however, such an employee (unless excepted by Paragraph 1 above) will not be eligible for any type of work assignment until the layoff displacement date is rescinded.
3.	If jobs are available in a newly established department, unit, or line, or if jobs are available in an already established department, unit, or line, laid off employees having employment rights shall be recalled in the order of their seniority before new employees are hired, with such rights of recall being limited by the provisions of Section L, Paragraph 3.
4.	In the application of the provisions of this Section, the Company will discuss with and provide to the Rules Committee the date established for layoff displacement purposes and a list of the employees involved.

68
Article XI - Rates of Pay (continued)
Section C - Rate Establishment and Adjustment
1.	In the change of a job or in the creation of a new occupation which requires the establishment of a base hourly wage rate, the Company shall determine the appropriate rate zone for such job by the use of The Evaluation Plan for Hourly Paid Production, Maintenance and Service Jobs for AK Steel-Butler Works dated January 1, 2000. In any event, the evaluation of the job shall be property related to the evaluations of other jobs in the department or of similar jobs in other departments of the Company's plants. If the new base hourly wage rate is considered to be inequitable, it may be the subject of a grievance and be adjusted under the grievance procedure. Any adjustment of the base hourly wage rate that is made as a result of a grievance shall be retroactive to the respective dates of assignment of employees to the new occupation.
2.	a. The base hourly wage rate being paid on any job may be increased or decreased by the Company from time to time because of any substantial change in the content of the job which may occur as the result of changes in equipment, changes in processes or methods of manufacture, and changes in products manufactured. Such changes in base hourly wage rates, if alleged to be inequitable by a regularly assigned incumbent of the job may be adjusted under the Grievance Procedure set forth in this Agreement.
b. It is recognized and agreed by the parties hereto that a base hourly wage rate inequity settlement was affected under date of April 22, 1946, as directed and approved by the War Labor Board. It is also recognized and agreed that those rates commonly known as "red circle' rates were not adjusted downward at that time; the parties agreed that no base hourly
69
Article XI - Rates of Pay (continued)
wage rate inequities existed, except for the above mentioned "red circle’ rates. Further it is agreed that no grievance alleging a base hourly wage rate inequity on rates in effect at the time of the inequity settlement is to be processed unless resulting from substantial change in job content.
3.	Job descriptions will be maintained by the Company and will be made available at reasonable times for the information of the appropriate Union Representatives.
4.	To the fullest extent practicable, all new and revised base hourly wage rates shall be reviewed with the individual or crew affected and the appropriate District Union Representatives before being placed in effect. The failure of an employee so affected or his District Union Representatives to attend a meeting held for this purpose shall not constitute cause for delay in applying the base hourly wage rate involved. A grievance alleging that a substantial change in job content, necessitating a base hourly wage adjustment has occurred shall be filed within 30 days of the date that the change occurred.
Section D - Wage Incentive
1.	The existing Incentive Plans shall be retained and the Company will make a continuing effort to instruct the employees with respect to such plan as it applies to their particular job.
a.	Departmental Supervision shall review all new and revised standards, at least seven days before they are put into effect, unless a shorter time is agreed upon, with the appropriate District Union Representatives and with the individuals or crew affected. The failure of an employee so affected or his District Union Representatives to attend a meeting held for this purpose shall not constitute cause for delay in applying the standard or standards involved.
70
Article XI - Rate* of Pay (continued)
b.	Copies of the incentive standards currently in effect for any operation shall be made available at all times for the information of the District Union Representatives for such operation.
c.	The Company shall at the request of the Union Representatives review with them the data and computations upon which any incentive standard is based.
2.	a. The existing incentives will be continued in effect unless replaced in accordance with Section D, Paragraph 2j of this Article or changed by agreement or until changed because of changed conditions such as changes in equipment, methods, processes, procedures, quality or materials.
b.	The Company, at its discretion, may establish incentive standards for new jobs and jobs not presently covered by incentive applications. The Company shall revise incentive standards to reflect any change in conditions. If such new or revised standards are alleged by a regularly assigned incumbent to be unrepresentative of the conditions under which they were established, or to improperly reflect the change in conditions on which the revision was based, they may be made the subject of a grievance.
c.	When the Company revises or replaces an incentive application, the rate of straight time average hourly incentive earnings for any job shall not be less than the rate of such earnings during the fast 13 weeks preceding the revision or replacement provided the average performance of the 13-week period, as related to the changed conditions, is maintained.
(1)	With respect to the administration of Article XI-D-2-c of the Basic Agreement, the parties agree that if earnings on a job show wide disparity between crews during the 13 weeks prior to the changed
71
Article XI - Rates of Pay (continued)
condition, the BAIU Rate and Incentive Chairman and the Plant Industrial Engineer will meet to consider how to determine an appropriate interim rate(s) to apply. (A crew may be one employee at times.)
d.	Any adjustment of new or revised standards as a result of the processing of a grievance shall be retroactive to the assignment to such standards of any employee who then holds seniority rights under this Agreement.
e.	It is recognized that delays in revising standards to reflect current conditions are undesirable. It is the intention that such revisions shall be made as soon as practicable after the occurrence of the changed conditions.
f.	It is further agreed that new applications covering units not now covered, will be discussed first with the Union before the Company proceeds with such an application.
g.	It is recognized by the parties that situations will arise where it becomes necessary (because of changed conditions) to discontinue the application of incentive standards for a temporary period pending the development of revised standards. In such situations the Company will apply an interim period incentive for the group or unit affected by such discontinuance effective with the discontinuance of the prior incentives. Such interim period incentive payment shall be uniformly applied to each individual in the respective checking groups and shall be based on the average of the percentage of all straight time incentive earnings to all straight time base earnings on which the incentive earnings were applied in the 13 payroll weeks excluding weeks not worked immediately preceding the changed conditions.
72
Article XI - Rates of Pay (continued)
During such period, individual performance shall be maintained at a rate reasonably equivalent to that of past performance as related to the changed conditions. The interim period incentives shall be terminated and the new incentives shall be applied as soon as practicable and within a period of not more than six months.
h.	When operations on a production basis are started on a new facility for which it has been decided to establish incentives, but such incentives are not ready for application, a uniform percentage interim incentive shall be determined and paid as follows:
(1)	The straight time percentage incentive of the employees initially assigned to the new operation who were on incentive assign* ments prior to such assignment, shall be averaged by a calculation on the basis of their work time incentive earned during the 13 payroll weeks prior to their respective dates of assignment.
(2)	60 percent of such average percentage of incentive shall be the incentive rate applicable for the interim period following the start of operations on a production basis.
(3)	The interim incentive rate determination initially made in accordance with the foregoing shall apply without change during the interim period to all employees in the appropriate incentive groupings.
(4)	The interim period incentive shall be terminated upon the effective date of the installation of the new incentive.
i.	After such interim period incentives, referred to in paragraphs g and h above are terminated and new incentives are made effective, the
73
Article XI - Rate* of Pay (continued)
Company shall promptly, but no later than 60 days, pay retroactively to all employees affected, any difference over the interim payment due the employees which is earned by application of the new incentives to the production of the interim period calculated and paid for each checking period separately.
(1)	With respect to the administration of Article XI-D-2-i of the Basic Agreement, the parties agree that new incentive standards will be applied to each checking period (turn, week, or month) as specified in the incentive standards for the entire interim period. Any net difference above the interim rate, as determined by adding/ subtracting all interim checking periods, will be paid to each affected employee.
j.	The following pertains to the development of incentive plans for newly covered operations and to the development of incentive plans to replace existing incentive plans. Incentive plans to replace plans in existence on August 1, 1971, will be installed when developed by the Company to improve such existing plans, in addition to those occasions required by contract obligations. Plans developed by the Company tor the purpose of improving the existing plans must satisfy the existing contractual obligations between the parties and shall meet the following criteria for earnings opportunity for the jobs covered by such plans.
(1)	Direct Category:
Direct category incentive jobs include those jobs which can directly and to a substantial degree positively affect the rate of output or the attainment of optimum equipment utilization. Such direct category incentive jobs shall have the oppor
74

APPENDIX B
Exhibit 1
BUTLER AND ZANESVILLE WORKS PROFIT SHARING PLAN
A.	Purpose
The purpose of this plan is to establish a basis for improved cooperation and teamwork between employees and management by providing a method for represented employees to share in the profits of the Butler and Zanesville Works.
This plan enables all hourly employees to share in the profits. The plan provides the opportunity for employees to earn additional dollars based on this operation's ability to pay. This opportunity to share begins with the first dollar of profit generated by the Butler and Zanesville Works. There is no cap on how much profit can be shared with the employees.
Effective January 1, 1997, and terminating December 31, 2006, the profit sharing pool for hourly employees will consist of an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the profits as defined in Section C below.
B.	Plan Features
1.	The Butler and Zanesville team recognizes that every employee’s contribution is vital to the future of AK Steel.
2.	This plan provides a single percentage of compensation for covered hourly employees.
3.	This plan provides quarterly earnings distributions to correspond with positive quarterly and annual results.
C.	Profit Sharing
Profits will be shared on an annual basis. There will be four pay periods, three stand alone quarterly payments and a fourth payment that is the annual adjustment. All four quarterly payouts
118
Appendix B (continued)
will be calculated using wages earned in that quarter. The amount to be shared is the profit sharing amount. This profit sharing amount is determined from the Quarterly Profit/Payout curve for the three quarterly payments and from the Annual Profit/Payout curve for the fourth payment. "Profits" will be that amount reported as pretax operating profit plus all cumulative profit sharing accruals. Pretax operating profit is reported in the Financial and Operating Results for the Butler and Zanesville Works. The cumulative profit sharing accrual is an item in the general ledger.
D.	Eligibility for Participation
1.	All full-time employees are participants in the plan.
2.	Hourly employees who are summer workers are not eligible to participate and their wages will not be used in the profit sharing calculation.
3.	Participation in the plan begins with the first regular pay of any eligible employee. Any employee no longer actively employed and leaving the regular payroll ceases to remain as a participant. Retirees and employees who terminate their employment share in the last quarter they are paid base wages but do not participate in payments for subsequent quarters.
4.	Each eligible employee's share is determined by his actual base wage. Base wages for the purposes of this plan include hourly base rate, vacation pay, holiday pay, premium pay, overtime pay, jury duty pay, military reserve duty pay, and others authorized by management. Excluded are payments for incentive earnings, non-incentive add-ons, Sickness and Accident benefits, Supplemental Unemployment Benefits, and other-like payments from insurance or benefits for time not worked.
119
Appendix B (continued)
E.	Payment
The profit sharing amount is divided by the total participant base wages paid in the quarter to determine percentage to be paid. The distribution will be calculated to four decimal places and rounded to three, as in the following example: 0.0685 (6.85%) would be rounded to 0.069 (6.9%) 0.0684 (6-84%) would be rounded to 0.068 (6.8%) Quarterly profit sharing payments will be made about four weeks following the end of each of the first three quarters. After the official annual calculation is made, the three quarterly advances (excluding safety or customer assurance add-ons) will be subtracted from the annual amount, and the final payment will be made on or about February 15 of the following year. When an employee terminates active employment due to retirement or death, he is paid for the last quarter in which he earns base wages as defined in Section D, paragraph 4.
Profit sharing payments will be included in the calculation of earnings for pension purposes.
F.	information Confidentiality
In order to protect the confidential nature of AK Steel's financial results, certain restrictions must be recognized. Specific financial information will be shared with union personnel who are bound by secrecy agreements (and their CPA, if requested). Payment results will be communicated, as available, to all employees.
G.	Changes in the Plan
It is not anticipated that any change will need to be made in any features of the plan.

Exhibit 2
BUTLER AND ZANESVILLE WORKS CUSTOMER ASSURANCE PLAN
A quarterly add-on of ten (10) percent of the quarterly profit sharing payout is available tor outstanding performance in customer assurance. Outstanding performance for customer assurance is ‘net manufacturing claims" less than 0.4 percent of "net sales plus net manufacturing claims". This quarterly add-on is not part of the annual calculation.
Exhibit 3 BUTLER WORKS
SAFETY PERFORMANCE PLAN
A.	A quarterly add-on of ten (10) percent of the quarterly profit sharing payout is paid tor outstanding safety performance in a quarter. Outstanding safety performance is zero major injuries tor the Butler Works for one million safe man-hours attained in a quarter. No more than one add-on payment will be made in a quarter.
B.	If an add-on payment is earned during a quarter, no credit will be granted for the next one million sate man-hours attained during that quarter. Accumulation for the next one million safe man-hours without a major injury will commence with the first man-hour after the one million man-hours for which no credit was earned, the occurrence ol a major injury, or the first man-hour after the one million safe man-hours for which payment was made if one million safe man-hours are not earned during the same quarter tor which payment was made. This
121
Appendix B (continued)
quarterly add-on is not part of the annual calculation except as stated below.
C.	On occasion it is necessary to re-classify injuries as lost workday cases for various reasons. The following actions will apply to the safety bonus as related to such a re-classification.
1.	In the event that an injury is re-classified as a major injury, that is, a lost workday injury is reclassified back into a one million safe manhours worked period that was otherwise majoraccident free, the safety bonus will not be paid for that particular period, provided it has not already been paid at the time of the reclassification.
2.	If the safety bonus has already been paid for a one million safe man-hours worked period such as that described in item 1 above, the safety bonus will be recouped in the fourth quarter (year-end adjustment) payout for that quarter. If, in this situation, the fourth quarter payout is insufficient in order to recoup the safety bonus payout from a prior quarter of that year, then only those dollars available will be recouped by the Company.
3.	If the re-classified injury occurred in a one million safe man-hours worked period in the fourth quarter and the safety bonus checks have already been issued for that quarter, then no recoupment will take place. If, in this case, the safety bonus checks have not been distributed, the payment will be negated.
4.	In the event that an injury is re-classified as a major injury and the re-classified injury occurred in a one million safe man-hours worked period other than the period described in paragraph C.3. above, eligibility for an add-on payment following the date of the re-classified injury will be recalculated in accordance with sections A and: B above commencing with the first man
T22
Appendix 8 (continued)
Appendix C
hour after the occurrence of the re-ctassified injury. The adjustment for any add-on payment which should be paid or recouped as a result of this redetermination will occur in the fourth quarter in accordance with the provisions of section C above.
APPENDIX C
I.	EMPLOYMENT SECURITY PLAN
This Employment Security Plan (hereinafter, the "Plan") shall become effective as of October 1, 2001 and shall continue in full force and effect through and including the last day of the term of the Agreement, as set forth below.
A. Employment Security Guarantee
1.	For the purposes of this Plan, Employment Security during the term of this Basic Agreement and any extension thereof, is defined as a guarantee that no eligible plan employee will be laid off and each will be given the opportunity for 40 hours of work during each workweek. Hours paid but not worked (such as vacation, holidays, bereavement, and jury duty) and other hours not worked in any week due to employee action or discipline for cause will count toward the 40-hour work opportunity.
2.	Each member of the BAIU bargaining unit as it exists on October 1,2001 is eligible for Employment Security, except as provided in Paragraph A-5 below, or for any period of disability during which the member is disabled and cannot be reasonably accommodated by the Company without undue hardship, within the meaning of the Americans With Disabilities Act.
3.	Employees hired on or after October 1, 2001, will not become eligible for the
123
Appendix C (continued)
employment security coverage under the Employment Security Plan until they have accrued 24 months of continuous service with the Company; however, such employees will be counted from their date of hire in calculating the Base Force number.
4.	Employee(s) eligible for Employment Security may lose eligibility by reason o1 discharge for just cause and due consideration as set forth in Article IX of the Basic Agreement but only after exhaustion of any rights under Article VI, Article VII, and/or Article IX of the Basic Agreement, or by reason of retirement, quit, death, or application of Paragraph A-5 below.
5.	Employment Security for eligible employees shall continue unless and until one of the following events occurs:
a.	A natural disaster, act of God, or governmental order which interferes with the continued operation of the department, facility or operation of the plant in which the employee is assigned, in such event, the Company may suspend Employment Security for those employees directly and immediately affected by the natural disaster, act of God, or governmental order. The Company shall return the affected employees to Employment Security eligibility upon restart of the department, operation or facility.
b.	After the filing of a petition in bankruptcy for reorganization or liquidation, if and only if the Court issues a final order allowing or directing the rejection of the Employment Security Plan. The Employment Security Plan shall remain
124
Appendix C (continued)
in full force and effect pending the final decision of the Court, and any appeal therefrom, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
c.	In the event of severe financial difficulty short of bankruptcy, this Plan may be suspended, but only for the duration of such severe financial difficulty. Such severe financial difficulty must represent a clear and present danger to the Company's viability. Severe difficulty under this paragraph may include default on a loan agreement, or significant deterioration of equity in the Company. Suspension of the Employment Security Plan under this Paragraph 5-c can occur only by mutual agreement of the Company and the Rules Committee of the BAIU, or as a result of an arbitrator's decision that such severe financial difficulty exists. If a dispute arises regarding whether a severe financial difficulty exists, the parties will immediately convene arbitration pursuant to Section III. The Employment Security Plan shall remain in full force and effect pending the decision of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Employment Security may only be suspended for the duration of the severe financial difficulty, or as limited by agreement of the parties, or by an arbitrator's decision.
d.	The permanent shutdown or closure of a department in the Butler Works or of a substantial portion thereof, in accordance with Article XX of the Basic Agreement, provided that, in such event, the Base Force established in
125
Appendix C (continued)
Section IJ-A shall be modified only by the actual number of employees directly and immediately affected by the said shutdown or closure, and provided further that only the number of employees directly and immediately affected by the permanent shutdown or closure shall be subject to layoff. The parties explicitly recognize that an occurrence as described in this paragraph shall not suspend or negate the Employment Security guarantee for any eligible employees not directly and immediately affected by the permanent shutdown or closure.
e.	In the event of a strike or work stoppage by employees covered by the Basic Agreement, the Plan shall be suspended, but only for the duration of any such work stoppage.
II.	BASE FORCE PLAN
A.	Base Force Guarantee
1.	For purposes of the Plan, the Company guarantees that it shall maintain a Base Force defined as the total number of hourly bargaining unit employees employed by the Company. The Company guarantees it shall maintain a Base Force of 1855 hourly bargaining unit employees for the duration of this Basic Agreement.
2.	The Base Force established by this Plan may only be reduced to the extent equal to the number of permanent jobs eliminated by:
a.	the events listed in Section l-A-5 above, or
b.	the net number of jobs eliminated as a result of an addition of a new operation,
126
Appendix C (continued)
facility or new technology at the Butler Works after the effective date of the Basic Agreement, or
c.	a job combination/elim [nation as otherwise provided for in the Basic Agreement.
3.	Unless a reduction in the Base Force occurs pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 2 above, the Company may only reduce its current work force as of October 1, 2001, to the Base Force level through attrition arising solely as a result of death, discharge, quit, retirement, or voluntary transfer.
4.	The Company shall increase the Base Force by the net number of any permanent jobs gained as a result of an addition of a new operation, new technology or facility at the Butler Works after the effective date of the Basic Agreement.
5.	The Company guarantees a minimum trade or craft Base Force equal to no less than 32% of the number of active hourly bargaining unit employees or 32% of the Base Force, whichever yields the greater number of trade or craft employees. The guarantee in this paragraph is subject to the conditions of the Plan previously stated.
B.	Base Force Compliance
1.	The parties will immediately establish an Optimization Plan Oversight Committee, which shall consist of three members appointed by the BAIU and three appointed by the Company. These members shall include the BAIU President and the Manager-Industrial Relations, AK Steel-Butler Works (or functional equivalents) who shall serve as co-chairs of the committee.

129
Appendix D (continued)
October 1, 1996 Settlement Agreement, and other agreements inconsistent with the provisions below.
The following specific rules shall govern the application of this Agreement:
A.	Management shall have the right to utilize employees of outside contractors to perform all work involving major new construction, including major installation, major replacement and major reconstruction of equipment and production facilities. A project shall be deemed major if it is of a grander scale than normally performed by bargaining unit employees. Management may utilize outside contractor employees for any work of the type that craft Base Force employees are not capable of performing. Capability will be determined taking into account factors such as the skill level of Base Force employees and whether the work can be reasonably segmented.
In addition, whenever all of the available employees included in the specific craft for a full week are fully utilized, as defined in Exhibit 1, Management may utilize outside contractor employees for the performance of any work of the type that has historically been performed by the specific craft employees.
B.	In order to promote more of a sense of equipment ownership and in order to perform work more efficiently, craft employees may be assigned within their department to perform any work within their capabilities, and work that has been performed by employees within a specific craft may be performed by employees of other shops and/or employees of assigned maintenance departments except during a week when such employees are cut back.
C.	Except for breakdowns or other matters beyond the control of the Company, Base Force employees who are cut back or laid off by the Company from their incumbent job while employees of an outside contractor are performing work in violation of this
130
Appendix D (continued)
Agreement shall be made whole for any lost earnings resulting to them during their cutback or layoff period because of the performance of such work by the outside contractor if the affected Base Force employees could have reasonably performed such work during their cutback or layoff period.
D.	Craft Machinists, Ironworkers. Electric Construction. and Central Maintenance/Pipe Fitters may be assigned and dedicated to support specific Assigned Maintenance Units in the performance of maintenance and repair work on the operating units.
1.	Management shall determine the number of assignments within each of the above crafts to be assigned and dedicated to the specific Assigned Maintenance Units. The total number of craft incumbents dedicated to the specific Assigned Maintenance Units shall not exceed 84 such employees.
2.	The Company will post within each of the above craft units the number of dedicated assignments in each identified Assigned Maintenance Unit. Craft incumbents will be provided the opportunity to bid for their preferred dedicated assignment, and assignments shall be made on the basis of Company continuous service. If there is an inadequate number of bidders, Management will make such assignments beginning with the least senior qualified affected craftsmen.
3.	Craft employees assigned as dedicated craftsmen pursuant to this Paragraph D shall be scheduled, supervised, and assigned work by the Section Manager in the affected Assigned Maintenance Unit.
4.	The crafts assigned to specific Assigned Maintenance Units shall be considered as a separate overtime group and vacation scheduling unit within their respective crafts.
131
Appendix 0 (continued)
E. The parties agree to promptly process all contracting out grievances filed on or after October 1, 2001, and any grievance alleging a violation of the preceding paragraphs of this agreement as follows: Such grievances will be filed at Step III of the Grievance Procedure, promptly processed at Step III, and, if appealed to arbitration, must be docketed, scheduled and heard within 60 days of the date of appeal. Should the parties agree to prehearing briefs, the arbitrator shall render his decision within 48 hours of the conclusion of the hearing; otherwise, the parties will submit briefs within six weeks of the hearing, and the arbitrator will render his decision within 14 days of receipt of the parties' post-hearing briefs.

Exhibit 1
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
“WORKLOAD OF BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES” AS IT APPLIES TO ARTICLE XXIII, SECTION B-CONTRACTING OUT
In order to define the term “workload of bargaining unit employees" as it applies to Article XXIII, Section B -Contracting Out, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Basic Agreement and without affecting the other existing rights and obligations of the parties, it is hereby agreed that affected employees who are eligible to receive the trade or craft or apprentice additive, together with any non-trade and craft employees who normally provide a specific service that is required, will be considered to be “fully utilized" (at maximum workload) during any week(s) that such affected employees are offered the opportunity to work forty-eight (48) physical hours at their respective trade, craft, apprentice, or service jobs during non-maintenance outage week(s) or provided
132
Appendix 0 (continued)
Appendix E
the opportunity to work seventy-two (72) physical hours during maintenance outage weeks. For purposes of this paragraph, a maintenance outage week is a calendar week in which the department is scheduled down for maintenance or repairs for five or more days.
The parties agree that the appropriate forty-eight (48) hours or seventy-two (72) hours per week, as defined above, will be considered the maximum workload of the bargaining unit for the purpose of constructing appropriate remedies, if any, for contracting out grievances filed after October 1,2001.
In addition, nothing herein shall be deemed to modify either the rights of the Company or the Union with respect to the contracting out of work under Article XXIII-B where the issue is the practicability of assignment of such work to the bargaining unit.

APPENDIX F
MEMORANDUM QF_UNDER?TAND|HG HOLIDAY SCHEDULING
This memorandum confirms the understanding relative to scheduling procedures during holiday weeks. At the same time, the parties also recognize the need to maintain and provide for scheduling flexibility. Consequently, the procedures as outlined below are designed to disrupt work schedules as little as possible. The terms of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be consistently applied throughout the plant and will prevail over any existing practice or Supplemental Agreement writing to the contrary. These procedures also cancel all prior holiday scheduling procedures memoranda in effect, including but not limited to, Appendix E of the 1996 Basic Agreement and its source documents.
The procedure is as follows:
1.	For seniority units using a four-tum (crew) work roster:
a.	The work schedule should be prepared as if it were a non-holiday week.
b.	Jobs which will not be scheduled on the holiday will then be deleted. The employee whose job is deleted will not be reassigned to work regardless of the employee's seniority relationship to other employees.
134
Appendix F (continued)
c.	II is recognized that such scheduling, in some instances, may create overtime conditions; however, such work assignments will not involve more than two consecutive turns [up to sixteen (16) hours] in a 24-hour period.
, 2. For seniority units using a three-turn (crew) work roster:
a.	The seniority rights of employees to regular work in a department as defined in Article XII, Section C are satisfied as long as five (5) days of pay (4 + 1 / 3 + 2 or 40 hours) are received by employees for the work week.
b.	There is no preference by seniority that may be advanced by employees in a department within the five (5) days referenced in 2-a above as to the number of days of physical work or the number of paid but unworked holidays scheduled in a holiday week.
c.	Historical or normal methods of scheduling employees are not applicable during a holiday week.
d.	It is recognized that such scheduling, in some instances, may create overtime conditions; however, such work assignments will not involve more than two consecutive turns [up to sixteen (16) hours] in a 24-hour period.
3. For all seniority units:
a.	Following the posting of the work schedule should it become necessary to fill a vacant tum(s) or add assignments during a holiday week in which a 4 + 1 and/or a 3 + 2 holiday concept applies:
1)	In a one holiday week, the most senior employee will be afforded the first opportunity to achieve forty (40) hours of physical work. The remaining openings will be offered on the same basis to employees in order of their eligibility on the seniority
135
Appendix F (continued)
roster. It is recognized that such scheduling, in some instances, may create overtime conditions; however, such work assignments will not involve more than two consecutive turns [up to sixteen (16) hours] in a 24-hour period.
2)	In a two holiday week, the most senior employee will be afforded the first opportunity to achieve thirty-two (32) hours of physical work. The remaining openings will be offered on the same basis to employees in order of their eligibility on the seniority roster. If there are openings after all employees have been afforded the opportunity of thirty-two (32) hours of physical work, then the procedure to achieve forty (40) physical hours will be followed as in 3-a-1 above. It is recognized that such scheduling, in some instances, may create overtime conditions; however, such work assignments will not involve more than two consecutive turns [up to sixteen (16) hours] in a 24-hours period.
b.	Notwithstanding the entitlement provisions of this agreement, the parlies recognize that some employees prefer to be off on the holiday(s). As such, it is not the intent of this agreement to preclude such employee from being off by permission. If the tum(s) are not filled as set out in 3-a above, and all other employees are excused from working, the least senior and available employee will be assigned to work.
c.	Qualified employees being scheduled through Employment Reserve may be utilized to supplement departmental forces provided that no employee will be assigned tram Employment Reserve to work more turns in a department than the least number of turns offered to any qualified incumbent of that department.
136
Appendix F (continued)
Appendix G
d.	“Reduced" schedules in a holiday workweek will not lead to an increase in the "contracting out” of bargaining unit work. A holiday paid for but not worked shall not be counted for the purpose of determining the Company's obligation under the “Workload of the Bargaining Unit" as it refers to contracting out.
e.	The parties recognize that the inapplicability of the "down" and “not down" concept according to the initial paragraph of this procedure nullifies Arbitration Decision BU-79-17 concerning the Locomotive Shop and other like seniority units.
The parties agree that this procedure will be first applicable to the holidays scheduled November 22 and 23, 2001, in order to provide sufficient time for discussion concerning holiday scheduling at the department level if so desired by the appropriate representatives of the parties. It is also understood that nothing in this procedure is intended to cause or result in the scheduling of more hours than management determines is necessary to perform required work.

APPENDIX G
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ARTICLE VII), SECTION H
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article Vlll-H of the Basic Agreement, employees may waive their right to be scheduled according to their seniority through the following procedure:

137
Appendix G (continued}
Appendix H
willingness to be scheduled on Job Group D (zone 1) work assignments in return for special scheduling consideration. Once this option has been exercised, it will continue until an employee elects to cancel said option during the periods of time designated above.
2.	This agreement will be applicable only to such work assignments which are scheduled prior to 12:00 noon on Friday of the preceding week.
3.	No additions or deletions to the Reserve Waiver Sheet will be permitted until the next sign-up period.
4.	Employees who do not elect this option may be given special scheduling consideration only for emergency situations or medical appointments.

APPENDIX H
SPLIT-WEEK VACATION OPTION PROCEDURE
1.	Employees with five (5) years or more of Company Continuous Service as of December 31 of the vacation year are permitted to elect the Split-Week Vacation Option (K-week) for that vacation year.
2.	Once a K-week has been designated on the vacation election form, it cannot be rescinded during the vacation year.
3.	A vacation day (K-day) shall be paid at a rate equal to one-fifth of the vacation pay applicable to a vacation week.
4.	A K-day paid for but not worked shall be counted as a day worked for the purpose of determining overtime liability for subsequent work days under the provisions of Article XIII, Section B.
5.	K-weeks will be included in the 2.25% calculation to determine the number of vacations permitted per calendar week; however, they will not be counted • as weeks for assignment purposes.
138
Appendix H (continued)
Appendix I
6-	No more than tour (4) K-days can be taken as time off in any given week.
7.	If an employee has not scheduled all five K-days by September 1, he shall be assigned days of vacation as mutually agreed upon by the Company and the employee during the month of September for the balance of the year. In the event the parties are unable to reach agreement by September 30, then the Company will have the sole discretion to assign the unscheduled day(s) in the fourth quarter of the year.
8.	K-days may be taken on scheduled days of work only. Once a K-day is approved and scheduled, no work will be assigned to that employee on that day.
9.	No retroactively approved (post-dated) K-days are permitted.
10.	To schedule each K-day, the employee must notify department supervision by Tuesday of the week in which the schedule is being prepared of his requested K-day. When unforeseen circumstances arise, this notice requirement may be waived by mutual agreement between the requestor and department supervision,
11.	Exercising the Split-Week Vacation Option cannot and will not create a short-week benefit obligation for the Company pursuant to the S.U.B. Plan.
APPENDIX J
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYMENT RESERVE ASSIGNMENT WAIVERS
This agreement, as herein provided, is a supplement to Section H (Employment Reserve Assignment Procedure) and Section 1 (Force Reduction & Furlough) as contained under Article VIII of the Basic Agreement between Armco Advanced Materials Corporation and the Butler Armco Independent Union. It is intended to provide eligible employees, as defined below, with the
139
Appendix I (continued)
option of waiving work assignments through the Employment Reserve in the event said employees are displaced from their incumbent departments for one or more full weeks, subject to the following conditions:
1.	To be eligible to elect the "Waiver of Assignment Option", an employee must have obtained five (5) or more years of Company Continuous Service and have established a permanent incumbency in a department.
2.	In order for an employee to exercise such "Waiver of Assignment Option", he must have given appropriate advance notice to the Employment Reserve Office in accordance with the following procedure:
a.	"Waiver of Assignment Forms" will be provided by the Company and will be available in the Employment Reserve Office.
b.	Completed "Waiver of Assignment Forms' received by the Employment Reserve Office 72 or more hours prior to the schedule posting time shall be effective for the following week and thereafter, except as further provided.
c.	The "Waiver of Assignment Option" shall, in any given week, be inoperative to the extent that it would make unavailable the necessary number of employees to satisfy the work requirements of the Employment Reserve.

APPENDIX J MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING OVERTIME ASSIGNMENT
Effective January 1, 1987, all employees will be entitled to compete for overtime assignments in their incumbent departments when on letter of loan, apprenticeship roving assignments, or cutback to the Employment Reserve for reasons other than a plantwide furlough.
The assignment procedure is as follows:
An employee who wants to be considered for overtime in his incumbent department and is absent from such as described above, for all or part of a scheduled week, must notify his incumbent department by 1:00 p.m. Friday prior to the scheduled week. Said notification must include: the department to which he is assigned, days scheduled, turns scheduled, and starting and quitting times.
It is the intent of this memorandum that the aforementioned overtime assignment procedure be applied consistently throughout the plant, unless otherwise provided by formal agreement of the local parties. If such an agreement is reached, copies will be forwarded to the Union Office and Industrial Relations.
From the date of agreement of this memorandum, there will be a six-month lag period before implementation. This time period will be utilized by both parties for informational and possible local agreement purposes.

The parties hereby agree to supplement the Butler Works' scheduling procedures as follows:
1.	Return everyone to their respective relative positions or extended temporary positions, whichever is applicable (weekly).
2.	Fill, where necessary, temporary known vacancies.
3.	Cut back, if necessary.
It is understood that this procedure is applicable only to those employees who are not on furlough or layoff status.
In regard to 2 above, it is agreed that employees will have the right to work assignments on their relative position job levels in preference to employees who hold permanent incumbency rights on job levels below said employees, Article VIII, Section F, Paragraph 1-a of the Basic Agreement notwithstanding.
It is, however, agreed that vacancies arising after the weekly scheduling deadline will be governed by Article VIII, Section F, Paragraph 1-a of the Basic Agreement.
