Article I:	Recognition
Section 1. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 763 of the Acts of 1965 of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Weston Educational Administrative Assistants Association, hereinafter called “the Association” or “WEAAA”, is recognized by the Weston School Committee, hereinafter called “the Committee” as the exclusive bargaining agent on questions of wages, hours, and other conditions of employment for individuals represented for the purposes of collective bargaining by the Weston Educational Administrative Assistants Association, including: accounting personnel, bookkeepers, administrative assistants, and all referred to in this Agreement as “Employee”; but not including: confidential administrative assistants to the Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction, Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations and Human Resources Director, nor temporary hourly personnel, clerical aides, instructional aides, library aides, study hall supervisors, audiovisual aides, nurses, cafeteria personnel, custodians and maintenance personnel, noon (lunch) aides, paraprofessional personnel, and bus drivers.
Section 2. Agency Fee. The Employer agrees to require, as a condition of employment, that all employees in this unit, except those certified as members to the Employer by the Association, pay annually by payroll deduction to the Association, any agency service fee which shall be commensurate with the cost of collective bargaining and contract administration as determined solely by the Association, and which amount shall be certified annually to the Employer by the Association.
Article II:	Compensation
Section 1.	As part of this Agreement, Appendix "A" (Salary Schedule) is attached hereto setting forth the salary schedule for full-time Employees. Positions are placed in categories by application of the Factor Chart for Job Classification (1/19/83) - attached with Memorandum of Agreement. Job Categories are attached as Appendix "D".
The parties recognize that significant temporary or permanent changes in responsibilities of a position may not warrant a category change. The parties agree that such circumstances may require intermediate, temporary measures of recognition and/or compensation. Proposed recognition and/or compensation shall be communicated to the WEAAA Executive Committee in timely fashion.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit the School Committee's sole discretion to decide upon changes in the composition of the work force.
Page 2 of 22
Section 2.	As a part of this Agreement, Appendix "B" is attached hereto setting forth the job category, step, assignment, and date of continuous employment of each Employee in the bargaining unit.
Section 3.	Additional Compensation shall be paid to Employees for completion of continuous, permanent employment in the schools, said compensation to be added to the annual base salary, during the year of completion. For part-time Employees, the compensation shall be in the proportion that the hours per year of the Employee bear to the hours per year of a full-time Employee covered by this Agreement. Compensation for full-time Employees is as follows:
More than 7, but less than 10 years' service	$700
More than 10, but less than 15 years' service	$800
More than 15, but less than 20 years' service	$900
More than 20, but less than 25 years' service	$1,025
More than 25	$1,150
Section 4.	If an Employee or an Administrator thinks a position should be reclassified, the following procedure should be followed:
a)	the Employee should write a complete description of the current duties;
b)	the Employee should specify why the position should be reclassified;
c)	the Administrator should review the description of duties and attest to its accuracy;
d)	the request for reclassification along with the job description, as well as any additional supporting data, should be submitted to the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations, who shall render a decision within fifteen (15) working days of his receipt of the request;
e)	if the decision in step (d) is not satisfactory to the Employee the matter should be referred to an ad hoc job evaluation committee consisting of two appointees of the administration and two appointees from the Association, excluding, however, the requesting parties. The members of this evaluation committee should familiarize themselves with job evaluation techniques and shall, as a body, render a decision on the matter within fifteen (15) working days of their date of organization. The decision of this committee shall be in writing and directed to the requesting party, the Association, and the Superintendent of Schools.
f)	the use by an Employee of the procedure outlined above shall be in lieu of all other remedies, including the grievance procedure, arbitration, and legal action, and shall not constitute a waiver of the School Committee's right to define job expectations at its sole discretion.
Section 5.	Service Increment. An Employee who retires after completing continuous employment in the Weston Public Schools in a position covered by this Agreement (See Article III,
Page 3 of 22
Section 5 for additional clarification) for at least twelve (12) years but less than sixteen (16) years shall have the employee's terminal year's salary increased by 15%. An Employee who retires after completing continuous employment in the Weston Public Schools for sixteen (16) years or more shall have the employee's terminal year's salary increased by 20%. An employee who resigns after completing continuous employment in the Weston Public Schools for twenty (20) years or more shall have the employee's terminal year's salary increased by 20%. The employee may notify the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations at the beginning of or during the employee's terminal year so that the amount so computed, based upon the anniversary date of the Employee, may be divided among the remaining checks of the employee's terminal year. To be eligible for the additional service increment, notification of resignation or retirement must be made to the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations at least one month in advance. If the notification occurs a month before the resignation or retirement date, the employee will receive the same amount in a lump sum (less normal deductions) at the conclusion of the employee's employment and, if possible, as part of the employee's final salary check.
Section 6.	An Employee whose employment is terminated as a result of the elimination of the employee's position by the School Committee shall be entitled to severance pay of half a month's salary provided the employee has been employed in a position covered by this Agreement for at least two (2) continuous years; and of one (1) month's salary after ten (10) years.
Section 7.	Payday for employees shall be the 2nd and 4th Thursday of each month.
Section 8.	Ten-month employees shall have a choice of salary payments in twenty or twenty-four
equal installments per fiscal year.
Section 9.	The Administrative Assistant to the High School Principal shall receive an annual stipend of $2,500 as additional compensation for work related to annual graduation activities.
Article III: Year and Hours of Work
Section 1.	Except as specified below, full-time Employees will be employed for a twelve-month year; they will work a thirty-five hour week. These hours do not include daily lunch periods.
An Employee will occasionally work an extra half-hour on any day on which the employee's administrator so requests. This will be for no additional compensation, provided that it falls within the normal workweek that prevailed prior to the 1981 reduction from 37.5 hours per week to 35 hours per week. It is the intent of the parties that these extra amounts of time, at no additional compensation in any form, should constitute the exception, rather than the rule.
The parties agree that additional compensation will be made when an Employee is requested by the employee's administrator to schedule work more than 35 hours per week.
Page 4 of 22
The parties further agree that by mutual agreement between the Employee and the employee's administrator the compensation for work scheduled in excess of 35 hours per week may be in the form of pay or compensatory time.
Subject to mutual agreement between an Employee, the Employee’s current supervisor, and the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations, a twelve-month Employee may elect to work an eleven-month year, with all pay and benefits pro-rated accordingly. The request to exercise this option must be communicated in writing to the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations by February 1 of the year before the contract year for which the reduction is requested. Exercise of this option is considered a year-to-year decision and no employee will thereby surrender twelve-month employment rights; permanent changes in work year shall continue to be subject to Section 6 in this Article and Section 6 in Article IX.
Section 2.	Overtime compensation at the rate of one and one-half times the Employee's regular rate of pay will be paid for services actually performed on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, or for services actually performed in excess of 40 hours in a week. For purposes of computing overtime compensation, the Employee's regular hourly rate of pay shall be determined by dividing the employee's then applicable annual salary by the annual number of hours comprising the employee's regular assignment. (Full-time equals 1820 hours).
Section 3.	Part-time Employees are defined as those who staff a position approximately equal to regular full-time Employees except that by mutual agreement they work less time per day, per week, or per year than full-time Employees. Each part-time Employee shall receive in writing a statement showing the portion of full-time status for which the employee has been employed and which will be applied to the full-time salary schedule for purposes of determining the employee's annual salary. Except as specified to the contrary, part-time Employees are entitled to all the salary, rights and benefits, and conditions of full-time Employees under the terms of this Agreement in the proportion that the part-time Employee's hours bear to the hours per year of a full-time Employee covered by this Agreement.
Section 4.	A part-time Employee shall advance one full step on the full-time salary schedule for each year they serve as a part-time Employee.
Section 5.	A part-time Employee or a school aide who has worked half-time or more per week for a ten-month year and who accepts a full-time position, shall transfer years of service in their former position in the Weston Public Schools to the new position for computing longevity and retirement eligibility, provided the service is continuous service. The rate of two years of part-time service equals one year of full-time service and shall be credited retroactively.
Section 6.	In the event of a proposed change in the hours or days of a position, or a proposed change in the number of positions covered by this Agreement, the proposed change shall be communicated to the WEAAA Executive Committee in timely fashion.
Nothing in this Article shall be construed to limit the School Committee's sole discretion
Page 5 of 22
	to decide upon changes in the composition of the work force.
Article IV:	Vacations
Section 1.	A full-time Employee -- as defined in Article II, Section 1 -- shall be eligible for vacation with pay each fiscal year according to the length of continuous service in a position covered by this Agreement as of June 30 of that fiscal year. Vacation length eligibility is displayed in Appendix C. As of June 30th of any year, no employee may have more than one (1) year of accumulated vacation balance to carry into the next fiscal year. Any accumulated vacation balance from Vacation 1 in excess of one (1) year’s worth shall be forfeited at the end of the day on June 30th (“use it or lose it”). Employees who were paid accrued Vacation 2 days during the 2013-2016 contract period shall be paid the difference between the amount paid and the current rate at the time of resignation or retirement. Employees with remaining Vacation 2 days will provide six (6) months notification prior to retirement and/or resignation so that the district can plan for the financial impact. The district will have up to six (6) months to pay out Vacation 2 balances should an employee not provide timely notification. All part-time Employees shall be eligible for vacation pay in the proportion that the parttime Employee’s hours bear to the hours per year of a full-time Employee covered by this Agreement.
Section 2.	The parties agree that the scheduling of vacations shall be subject to approval by the administration.
Section 3.	A part-time administrative assistant or a school aide who has worked half-time or more per week for a ten-month year and who accepts a full-time administrative assistant position, shall transfer years of service in the employee's former position in the Weston Public Schools to the new position for computing vacation eligibility, provided the service is continuous service. The rate of two years of part-time service equals one year of full-time service and shall be credited retroactively.
Section 4.	Upon an Employee's resignation, retirement or death, the Employee (or the employee's primary beneficiary if termination is caused by death) shall receive vacation pay proportionate to the time worked since the employee's last previous vacation year.
Section 5.	Each Employee shall receive notice of their accumulated vacation leave no later than September 1st of each year.
Article V:	Holidays
Section 1.	The following days shall be considered to be paid holidays for full-year Employees if schools are not in session. Ten-month Employees shall be paid for as many of these holidays as fall within the Employee's work-year. New Year's Day	Labor Day Washington's Birthday	Columbus Day

Should any of the above holidays fall on a Sunday, the following Monday shall be considered to be a paid holiday; should any of the above holidays fall on a Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be considered to be a paid holiday, with a full day's pay at the employee's regular rate, except, however, that such days may be rescheduled by mutual agreement of the Employee and their immediate Administrator; in the event of disagreement, the final decision will be rendered by the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations. By mutual agreement with their supervisor, an Employee may chose to substitute the first day of Rosh Hashanah (if on a weekday) or the day of Yom Kippur (if on a weekday) in place of the listed day of Good Friday; in other words, Employees may choose one of these three days of low attendance as a holiday (Good Friday, Rosh Hashanah, or Yom Kippur).
Sick Leave
All full-time Employees shall accrue sick leave on an annual, fiscal year basis at the rate of 1-1/2 days of sick leave per month worked during the year, with unlimited accumulation of sick leave. Part-time Employees shall be entitled to sick leave in proportion to their term of employment, with unlimited accumulation of sick leave. The annual sick leave entitlement will be issued on a fiscal year basis, July 1 through June 30.
Sick leave is available for use only for cases of actual illness and/or disability of the Employee.
Each Employee shall receive notice of their accumulated sick leave no later than September 1st of each year.
An Employee shall be notified by the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations when their absences exceed the employee's accumulated sick leave. Additional sick leave may be awarded, upon application of the Employee and the recommendation of the Superintendent, by the decision of the School Committee at its sole discretion.
In case of an absence from work which is caused by an accident or injury occurring while the Employee was actively at work under this agreement, the School Committee shall make up the difference between the Employee's regular wages and the amount received under Workers' Compensation, and days absent because of such accident or injury shall not be charged against the accrued sick leave of the Employee. The Employee is obligated to reimburse the Town of Weston promptly for any duplicate payments arising out of delays in Workers' Compensation remittances.
Maternity Leave
Employees covered by this Agreement shall be eligible for childbearing leave in
Page 7 of 22
accordance with the provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act.

Time off with pay for immediate family events/situations such as serious illness; bereavement; serious accidents; weddings; commencement exercises; and the like; shall be allowed upon request and at the discretion of the Employee's administrator, with right of appeal to the Superintendent, whose decision shall be final.
For the purposes of this section and all other relevant portions of this Agreement, "immediate family" shall be defined as the Employee's parent, spouse, child, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, parent of spouse, and grandchild(ren).
Section 2.	Time off with pay for attendance at funerals, for moving days, religious obligations, legal obligations, and the like, shall be requested from and may be allowed by the Employee's administrator, with right of appeal to the Superintendent, whose decision shall be final.

Section 4.

The Employee shall promptly furnish to the Administrator documents related to compensation for jury duty.
Article IX:	Seniority and Vacancies
Section 1.	Seniority means the length of continuous employment by the School Committee in a position covered by this Agreement. An Employee will acquire seniority after completing a ninety-day probationary period in such position, and their seniority shall then date from the beginning of the employment period in such a position.
Section 2.	Whenever a vacancy -- professional or non-professional -- is to be filled, it will be adequately publicized at least ten (10) working days before the final date that applications must submitted:
1.	All postings will be sent to all employees over email from Human Resources to all@weston.org.

Section 7.
Vacancy notices shall set forth the location, specifications, qualifications, and compensation for the position as well as the date by which applications shall be filed with the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations.
In filling positions covered by this Agreement in the Weston Public Schools by promotions and voluntary transfers, employee's training, quality of previous work performance, experience, ability and suitability for the new position, and seniority shall be considered by the School Committee at its sole discretion. Initial placement on a salary schedule shall be decided at the sole discretion of the School Committee. Reasonable effort will be made to award credit for previous comparable experience equitably for all new Employees.
Any Employee temporarily filling a vacancy of a higher classification because of illness, resignation or leave-of-absence, shall be paid at the higher rate after one month of such employment until such time as the vacancy has been filled.
Such temporary assignment shall be deemed to be in effect only following written notice to the administrative assistant by the Assistant Superintendent for Finance and Operations; similarly, termination of temporary assignment shall require written notice to this administrative assistant.
If the number of positions now covered by this Agreement is reduced, the School Committee will seriously consider seniority as well as training, quality of previous work performance, experience, ability and suitability for another position when determining, at its sole discretion, which Employee will be laid off.
In the event of a layoff or elimination of position, all affected Employees shall be eligible for recall to fill vacancies. No new permanent Employee shall be hired until such time as every Employee on the recall list has been given an opportunity to apply in writing to fill the vacancy.
a.	The recall list will include affected, but not retired, Employees; beginning and ending dates of continuous service in the Weston Public Schools; name, address and telephone number. It is the affected Employee's responsibility to furnish current information and updated resume to the Personnel Office.
b.	An Employee's name shall be maintained on the recall list for a maximum of two years after the effective date of layoff or elimination of position.
1.	Persons on the recall list are encouraged to notify the Personnel Office if they no longer wish to be considered for recall.
2.	An individual who refuses a job offer will be dropped from the recall list except when the refusal is for a verified medical reason. Medical reasons do not extend the recall period.

recall list.

e.	If the recall occurs within the same contract year, compensation will be at the same level as prior to layoff or elimination of position.
If the recall occurs in the subsequent year, the compensation will be one step higher on the salary schedule.
Article X: Grievance Procedure
Section 1.	A grievance is defined as an allegation by an Employee or group of Employees or the
Association that one or more express terms or provisions of this Agreement have been violated or a dispute concerning the interpretation, meaning or application or any express term or provision of this Agreement.
Section 2.	Any Employee covered by this Agreement shall have the right to present a grievance,
individually or in concert with other Employees, and have it promptly considered on its merits. The initiation of a grievance by an Employee shall not cast any reflection upon the employee's standing in the Weston Public Schools. If an Employee so elects, the Association may represent the grievant at any stage of the grievance procedure.
Section 3.
Grievance Levels:
Step I: Any Employee who has a grievance shall discuss the matter with his/her immediate Administrator within ten (10) school days after the Employee had, or reasonably should have had, knowledge of the event leading to the grievance. Every effort for an informal resolution shall be made, in a good faith attempt to resolve the problem.
Step II: If, in the estimation of the Employee, the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved in Step I, the grievant may, within five (5) school days after Step I discussion, present the grievance to the Superintendent of Schools or superintendent's designee for consideration. This presentation shall be in writing and shall include, at least, the following information:
a.	Name, job title, and category level of grievant;
b.	Brief statement of facts;
c.	Remedy requested;
d.	Immediate Administrator's (Step I) disposition;
e.	Signature(s) of grievant(s).
Page 10 of 22
The Superintendent or the superintendent's designee within five (5) school days after receipt of the written grievance shall render their decision thereon. The Superintendent or the superintendent's designee may discuss the matter with the grievant and immediate Administrator. Whenever the Superintendent or the superintendent's designee has such discussion with the immediate Administrator, the grievant or, if the grievant chooses, the Association shall be provided with a similar opportunity.
Step III: If the Employee is yet aggrieved by the decision rendered in Step II, the grievant may refer the grievance, in writing, to the Chairman of the School Committee within five (5) school days after receipt of the Step II decision. The School Committee, or a subcommittee thereof, shall meet with the grievant as soon as possible and will render a written decision to the grievant and the Association not later than its next regular meeting after the end of the discussion of the grievance.
Step IV: If the decision of the School Committee is unsatisfactory, the Association may refer the grievance to Arbitration by giving written notice of such intent to the Superintendent of Schools and to the Chairman of the School Committee within ten (10) school days after receipt of the Step III decision.
If the Committee and the Association cannot agree within seven (7) school days after written notice specified above of the intention to arbitrate, then the party demanding arbitration shall within three (3) school days thereafter request a panel consisting of one member of the School Committee, one member of the Association, and one neutral person mutually selected by the Committee and the Association who will render within ten (10) school days a written decision which shall be final and binding. The panel shall be without power, authority, or jurisdiction to alter, add to or detract from the provisions of this Agreement, or to make any decision which changes or modifies any decision as to which the School Committee has sole discretion under the express terms of this Agreement. The panel's authority shall extend only to finding whether an Employee has been deprived of right or benefit included in the express terms of this Agreement.
Section 4. If any grievance is not filed at any step within the time limit specified, the grievance shall be deemed settled on the basis of the most recent disposition and shall not be eligible for further processing; and failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decisions of a grievance within the specified time limits to the grievant and to the Association shall permit the grievant to proceed to the next step. Time limits may be extended by mutual agreement.
Article XI: Insurance and Annuity Plans
Section 1.	Employees may, at their request, participate in a tax-sheltered annuity plan.
Section 2.	For employees working more than twenty (20) hours per week, the School Committee
will pay:
A.	50% of a two-thousand ($2,000) dollar term life insurance policy.
B.	50% of the indemnity individual or family health care insurance coverage, whichever
Page 11 of 22
applies in the particular case;
C.	80% on the non-indemnity individual or family health care insurance coverage, whichever applies in the particular case;
The above pertains to all plans presently in effect and such plans as may be mutually agreed upon.
Section 3.	If the Town of Weston increases the percentage of payment of the cost of insurance for other Town employees, the same percentage rate shall apply to those Employees covered by this Agreement.
Section 4.	Stipends will be added to the regular pay of those employees who were employed by Weston Public Schools as of July 1, 2007 and who choose non-indemnity health insurance as part of their Weston benefit package. The annual stipend amount will be divided equally by the number of pay periods. Upon the transfer into the Commonwealth of Massachusetts GIC, the applicable FY 2009 stipend amount, as set forth below, shall be fixed (“grandfathered”) as the stipend amount for the eligible employee, subject only to the agreed-upon base wage cost of living increases set forth in Appendix A, provided the eligible employee maintains health insurance coverage with the Town and the same type of coverage (i.e. individual or family). The stipend level will change to match coverage levels selected during the enrollment period for the coming year; e.g. switching individual coverage to family coverage will be accompanied by a change from the individual stipend to the family stipend then in effect.
The stipends amounts are:
	FY’17	FY’18	FY’19
	1.50%	1.25%	1.00%
	Increase	Increase	Increase
Former Blue Cross/Blue Shield Family	$2,346.33	$2,375.66	$2,399.42
Individual	$869.97	$880.84	$889.65
Former Harvard Pilgrim Family	$2,127.09	$2,153.68	$2,175.22
Individual	$782.03	$791.80	$799.72
If an eligible employee elects to opt out of health insurance for a given year, no stipend will be paid. If an employee opts into health insurance, and is eligible for the stipend according to this section, the employee shall receive the former Harvard Pilgrim stipend amount corresponding to the selected family or individual plan. If an eligible employee previously had health insurance with the Town, opted out and then later opted back in, that employee will receive the former Harvard Pilgrim stipend amount regardless of the employee’s prior plan.
Page 12 of 22
It is the intent of the School Committee to continue the provisions of Section 4 throughout the length of the employee’s continued employment within the Weston Education Administrative Assistants Association bargaining unit.
The execution of this Agreement is without waiver of any of the Town’s management rights and does not serve as any precedent for future actions of the Town.
Article XII: Tuition Reimbursement
Section 1.	An Employee is entitled to reimbursement up to $1,200 annually of tuition paid for approved college, university, or business school courses which are related to job proficiency, and which have been completed successfully, subject to having received prior approval of the employee's Administrator and the Superintendent or the superintendent's designee.
Section 2.	Application for tuition reimbursement must be made to the Superintendent or the superintendent's designee and approved prior to registration for the course(s).
Section 3.	Reimbursements for approved courses are payable in full subject to approval of the reimbursement claim.

Section 1. Employees required to use their motor vehicles in the performance of their assignments exclusive of commuting to and from work shall, upon approval of expense vouchers, be reimbursed at the rate per mile in force in accordance with the most recent vote of the Weston Board of Selectmen.
Article XIV:	Meal Reimbursement for Evening Work
Section 1. When an Employee is required to work overtime beyond 6:30 p.m., the employee shall be compensated for the cost of any required meal up to the amount of $7.50, upon approval of expense vouchers.
Article XV:	Miscellaneous - Weather Conditions
Section 1.	School Administrative offices will only close if Town Hall is closed or at the decision of the Superintendent. To be placed on the Town’s robo call list, employees must provide all applicable phone numbers to the Business Office by September 1st of each year. The list will be updated each September. If changes to phone numbers occur during the course of the year, it is an employee’s responsibility to notify the Business Office to request an update to the robo call list.
Section 2.	An emergency or unusual difficulty which causes an Employee to be absent from work after a reasonable effort to report had been made, may be allowed to use a vacation day, or a portion thereof, without loss of pay at the discretion of the Superintendent or his designee.
Page 13 of 22
Section 3.	Employees who are unable to report to work due to unusual circumstances related to weather emergencies are responsible for informing their supervisors as soon as possible on that day.
