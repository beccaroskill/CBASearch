Salary Continuation Benefits during Short Term Disability
Employees are eligible to receive this benefit, upon date of hire, provided they are eligible to participate in the benefit programs provided by MoMA.
Salary continuation benefits are available whenever a non-work related illness or injury results in an employee’s incapacity to perform work for more than seven consecutive days (including weekends).
Employees must submit medical proof of disability satisfactory to MoMA and the insurance administrator within eight days of the onset of the illness or injury in order to receive benefits.
The employee must be under the care of a licensed physician during the course of their disability. The first five working days of absence are recorded as sick days. As of the eighth consecutive day of continuous disability, the benefit is paid as follows:
Length of Service
Less than 1 year 1-9 years 10 years or more
Salary Continuation Benefit state disability
50% of pay up to 26 weeks* 60% of pay up to 26 weeks*
‘Employees are eligible to accrue sick days up to a maximum of 60 days. (Please refer to the Sick Day policy). Employees must use their accrued sick days in order to be paid at 100% of their salary during the course of their approved short term disability. In addition, employees may also use their accrued vacation days at their own discretion in order to be paid at 100% of salary during an approved short term disability.
If an employee’s disability lasts more than 26 weeks, the employee may file for disability benefits under MoMA’s long term disability program. The employee will need to contact Human Resources for the appropriate application.
To the extent that employees receive salary continuation benefits due to illnesses or injuries that constitute serious health conditions under FMLA, the period of absence during which such benefits are received are counted towards and run concurrently with FMLA leave.
The employee is required to notify their supervisor and Human Resources when he/she can return to work. A written authorization from the attending physician is required for the employee to return to work and resume normal work duties.
C Y d
The Museum is committed to workplace diversity. The Museum shall make good faith efforts in the areas of recruitment, hiring, and promotion to foster career development consistent with this commitment. The Museum seeks to improve upon the diversity of its workforce, particularly in the higher job grades. In this connection, the Museum shall meet, upon reasonable request, with the union for the purpose of review.
