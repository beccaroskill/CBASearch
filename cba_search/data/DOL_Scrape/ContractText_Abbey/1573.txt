Such employers may hereinafter be referred to as the “Employer.”
It is understood and agreed that the Laborers’ District Council of Ohio, as an entity, separate and apart from the Local Unions of which it is comprised, shall not be liable hereunder for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, acts of Local Unions which are members of the Laborers’ District Council of Ohio.

PREAMBLE
The construction industry is engaged in furnishing services essential to the progress and well being of the general public. Both of the parties to this Agreement recognize that they have a high degree of responsibility to the public to service its needs without interruption.
Therefore, it is desirable to promote harmonious relations between the parties in the interest of the public and in the interest of the parties as well.
By the execution of this Agreement it is the intent of the parties to stabilize employment in the construction industry, establish an orderly procedure for the settlement of misunderstandings, grievances or disputes, agree upon wage rates, fringe benefits, hours and conditions of employment and to eliminate strikes, boycotts, lockouts and stoppages of work to the end that Employers are assured continuity of operation and the employees of the Employers are assured continuity of employment.
ARTICLE I
NON-DISCRIMINATION
It is mutually agreed that the Employers and the Union will not discriminate against or limit the employment opportunities of any individual, employee, applicant for employment, or applicant for Union membership or training and upgrading for reasons of race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin. Every Employer and the Union agree to abide by all laws, regulations, rules and executive orders, regarding equal employment opportunity whether state or federal applicable to employment and the Union membership in general or as applied to specific jobs or projects. When any duly constituted public authority shall lawfully direct an Employer as a condition of bidding
2
within the specifications of a project to carry out any program or requirement for equal job opportunity upon any job, the Union will meet such programs or requirements upon request of the Employer. The words, he, him, men, workmen, etc., when used herein shall include both singular and plural number and masculine, feminine and neuter gender, as may be appropriate.
ARTICLE II
UNION RECOGNITION AND RIGHTS
Section 1.	The Contractor recognizes and acknowledges that the Laborers’ District Council of Ohio of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, AFL-CIO, is the sole representative of all employees in the classification or work under its jurisdiction covered by this Agreement, for the purposes of collective bargaining.
Section 2.	Subject to the provisions and limitations of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, all present employees who are members of the Union on the effective date of this Agreement shall continue their membership in the Union for the duration of this Agreement to the extent of paying an initiation fee and membership dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union. All employees who are not members of the Union and all persons who hereafter become employees shall become members of the Union on the eighth (8th) day following the beginning of their employment or on the eight (8th) day following the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, and shall remain a member of the Union, to the extent of paying an initiation fee and the membership dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union, whichever employed under and for the duration of this Agreement.
3
Section 3.	The Union may notify the Contractor in writing of any default on the part of an employee to pay his initiation fee and membership dues, and if the employee has not paid his initiation fee and/or membership dues within three (3) days from the receipt of written notice, the Contractor shall discharge such employee, provided membership was available under the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members or applicants.
Section 4.	Hiring Hall Procedures. The parties agree to provide an efficient, competent, and safe system of production in the construction industry to eliminate the evils of casual employment, thereby securing a fair distribuiiujj of employment and a jiving wage to those workers who must gain their livelihood from the industry to which they contribute their labor and productivity, and to provide an orderly procedure of referral of applicants for employment and hereby establishing the following principles and plan of referral for job applicants:
A. In the employment of workmen for all work covered by this Agreement the following principles and provisions shall govern:
1.	This Union shall maintain a facility at which it shall establish and maintain open and non-discrimiiiatory employment lists for the use of applicants of employment in the geographical area serviced by that facility. Such facility shall comply with all laws, executive orders and court rulings both state and federal. Local Union 423 will maintain regular dispatch hours on Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:00 p.m. through 3:00 p.m. excluding contractual holidays. All applicants are admonished that they must be available to answer their telephones during these normal dispatch hours. A single instance of unavailability occurs when an
4
applicant cannot be reached by telephone after two separate calls, each lasting ten rings and placed sixty (60) seconds apart during these regular dispatch hours on the same day. An applicant will be considered unavailable if he or she cannot be reached after three (3) separate instances of unavailability on different days during regular dispatch hours.
2.	Applicants shall be entitled to registration on, and dispatching from, the employment lists, but subject otherwise to the provisions of this Article.
An applicant’s registration of availability for referral shall be in effect for thirty (30) days. An applicant must again register his or her availability before the expiration of that period to retain his or her position on the out-of-work list. Applicants will be required to register their availability every first Monday of each month to retain their positions on the out-of-work list for the next month. If the first Monday of the month falls on a legal holiday as set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, then it will be automatic check-off for the month meaning the same position will be retained from the prior month.
3.	Applicants who have been registered on the employment lists in the order of time and date of registration shall be in groupings in the out-of-work lists as described herein. Each applicant for employment shall be required to furnish such information as shall be considered necessary to the operation of said employment lists. Each applicant shall complete prior to registration, an approved form to record such information as shall be submitted to him. Applicants shall list any special skills which they may possess.
4.	When the Employer calls the Union for workers, the Union shall immediately dispatch from the lists the
5
number of qualified and competent workers requested. The Union shall dispatch workmen strictly in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
5.	It shall be the responsibility of the Employer when ordering workers to give the Union pertinent information regarding the prospective employment.
6.	The Union shall furnish, in accordance with the request of the Employer, such qualified and competent workers, by use of a written identification slip, and this slip shall state information pertinent to the prospective employment. The selection of workers for dispatching to jobs shall be on a non-discriminatory basis and shall not be based on, or in any way, affected by Union membership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspects or obligations of Union membership, policies or requirements. The Union will not be held responsible for the acts, tortuous or otherwise, or failure to act, of those it refers.
7.	Dispatching of applicants or workers for employment will be as follows:
a.	Applicants or workers whom an Employer requests by name provided they have been employed by the Employer during the preceding twelve (12) months and are in compliance with the Hiring Hall rules and regulations.
b.	Other applicants or workers whose names are registered in “Group A.’’
Group A. All applicants who have worked as building and construction Laborers for the past three (3) years; and have been employed for a period of at least six (6) months within the past three (3) years by Employers signatory to a collective bargaining agreement with the
Union, by Employers signatory to an Agreement with the Union not containing discriminatory referral provisions.
Group B. All applicants who have worked as building and construction Laborers for the past two (2) years or more.
Group C. All applicants for employment who have worked as building and construction Laborers for less than two (2) years or who have had no prior construction experience.
The Union shall maintain each of the separate groups lists set forth above which shall list the applicants within each group in the order they registered as available for employment.
8.	The Union shall refer applicants to the Employer by first referring applicants in “Group A” in the order of their places on said list, and then referring applicants in the same manner successfully from the lists in “Group B,” and “Group C”. Applicants who are rejected by the Employer shall be returned to their appropriate place within their Group and shall be referred to another Employer in accordance with the position of their Group and their place with the Group. Upon registrants being referred for employment and actually employed on a job more than ten (10) days worked, such registrant names shall be removed from the list until such time as their employment has been terminated, at which time, they shall be registered at the bottom of the appropriate list under which they are entitled to be registered. However, after receiving three (3) short-term job referrals consecutively or accumulating more than ten (10) days in three (3) short-term referrals or less, that applicant must again register in order to be included on the out-of-work list and will be placed at the bottom of the out-of-work list at the time of registration.
7
9.	Any member who refuses or is unavailable for two (2) consecutive referrals shall be moved to the bottom of the out-of-work list. A member will be considered unavailable if he or she cannot be reached after three (3) phone calls have been placed to the telephone number provided by the member, unless the member has given the Local Union notice in writing of unavailability for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, which notice can be given no more than twice in a calender year.
10.	When ordering workers, the Employer will give notice to the Local Union or its Agents. The Employer agrees to give at least twelve (12) hours notice to the Union in order to permit it to furnish the employees needed. In the event that, after such notice, the annrnnriaie Local Union or its Agents shall not furnish such workers, the Employer may procure workers from any other source or sources. However, it will be the responsibility of the Employer to notify this Union, or its representative, of such workers by name.
11.	Applicants who accept referrals and then fail to appear at the job site without reasonable cause will be removed from the out-of-work list for sixty (60) days.

ARTICLE V
WAGES & CLASSIFICATIONS FRINGE BENEFIT CONTRIBUTIONS HAZARDOUS PAY
Section 1.	Wages and Classifications: The wage rates and classifications that follow have been established and agreed to for the duration of this Agreement.
Wage increases will be effective the first full pay period after the effective date shown in this Agreement.
Section 3 of this Article refers to wage classifications for Hazardous Waste Removal & Lead Abatement Workers.
13
Section 2.	Fringe Benefit Contributions: Contributions referenced in this Article for Health rand Welfare (H&W), Pension, Training and Upgrading (T&U), and LECET, are those fringe benefits referred to in Articles XIV and XVI. The contribution for the Construction Advancement Program of Central Ohio (CAPCO) is that contribution referred to in Article XVII.
Articles VII and XIV govern how fringe increases shall be diverted from the wage package, if necessary.
Section 3.	Hazardous Waste Removal & Lead Abatement Workers: For Laborers working in an exclusive or “hot” area with toxic or hazardous materials, one of the following personal protective equipment ensembles will be required for necessary protection against toxic contaminants. All of the ensembles increase the risk of certain types of worker-related injuries.
Level A: (Wage Group 1) To be worn only in established “safe zones” may consist of, from normal work clothes to normal skin protection such as gloves, face shields, goggles, coveralls, and occasionally respiratory protection.
Level B:(Wage Group 2) Protective equipment includes a protective suit and an Air Purifying Respirator (APR) with the appropriate filter canisters. The ensemble is used when contaminants are reliably known not to be hazardous to the skin and not IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) and correct filter protection is available. This ensemble offers adequate protection for many jobs. Heat stress may be a problem due to the suit, and respiration is more difficult due to the inherent restrictions to breathing in an APR. Also, normal job related injury risk will be nearly as high as for Level C equipment.
14
Level C: (Wage Group 3) Protective equipment includes a chemically resistant splash suit and a SCBA or Airline Respirator. This ensemble is required when the situation is very hazardous, such as oxygen deficient atmospheres, IDLH atmospheres, or confined space entries, but the risk of skin exposure is not as great as in Level D situations. The Level C ensemble gives the second highest level of protection, but also puts physical stress on the worker; primarily heat stress, reduced vision, dexterity and mobility directly attributable to wearing of the protective equipment. Therefore, in addition to the hazardous material, the hazard of normal job related injuries is greatly increased.
Level D: (Wage Group 4) Protective equipment is required when the area has been known to contain extremely toxic contaminants or contaminants unknown but may be expected to be extremely toxic and/or Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH). This ensemble includes a fully encapsulated chemical suit (moon suit), Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), or Airline Fed Respirator, and various types and numbers of boots and gloves; cool vests and voice activated radios are optional equipment sometimes worn. Level D ensembles provide the highest level of protection from contaminants but places the greatest physical and mental stress on the worker. The claustrophobic environment of the moon suit causes anxiety in most people, which greatly increases the already inherent heat stress problems. Also, this ensemble reduces vision, mobility, dexterity, and communication capacity, all of which increases the risk of normal job related injuries; ie., slips, falls, caught between, etc.
15
Section 4.	Hazardous Pay: Hazardous pay shall be at the rate of twenty-five cents ($.25) per hour added to the classification rate shown in Article V for the following classes of work:
A.	All scaffolds at fifty feet (50') or more above the foundations or grade level, whichever is higher.
B.	Caisson work and tunnel work of fifteen feet (15') depth or deeper.
C.	“Hot Pay” - When Laborers complement another craft and that craft is receiving a premium rate of pay, the Laborers will also receive premium pay for this “hot” type of work.

The Employer shall have the right to discharge any employee for failure to comply with safety requirements and failure to use equipment provided by the Employer to meet the standards imposed under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Construction Safety Act of 1970 and the Safety Code of Ohio, including revisions.
Section 3.	The Contractor is to be the sole judge as to the satisfactory performance of work by an employee, and may discharge for just cause, any employee whose work is unsatisfactory or who fails to observe the safety precautions, substance abuse policies, or other rules and regulations, prescribed by the Contractor for health, safety and protection of his employees. However, no employee shall be discharged for defending the rights of any employee under the terms of this Agreement.
DRUG/ALCOHOL TESTING. The Employer and the Union are committed to a policy that promotes safety in the work place, employee health and well being. In consideration of this policy, the Union and the Employer agree that any employee found to be under the influence of, in possession of, or engaged in the distribution of drugs or alcohol on the job site shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.
29
Within two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new Laborer may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a prescription drug which may impair mental or motor function shall inform their supervisor in writing of such drug use.
Employee involvement with drugs and alcohol can adversely affect job performance and employee morale. In the Construction Industry the consequences of drug or alcohol use or influence while on the job site can be disastrous. The Employer and the Union, therefore agree to the following policy to insure all employees a safe and efficient job site free from the effects of drug and alcohol use or influence.
Any job site is subject to massive and random drug screening. Any employee who is involved in an on-the-job accident resulting in an injury to a person or property or whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion of probable cause or illegal drug or alcohol use impairment while on the job site, may be required, as a condition of continued employment, to submit to a test for alcohol and/or illegal drug use which impairs the employee’s ability to safely perform his/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a sampling of the employee’s urine, blood or breath. Any employee who is asked to submit to such a test will be required to sign a consent form. If an employee who is asked to submit to a test refuses to do so, or refuses to sign the consent form, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
All testing will be done by a reliable, established laboratory. If this initial test screen result indicates positive findings, further testing of the same sample must be done to confirm the original findings, before the laboratory can report a positive finding. The confirmation
30
test will be conducted by an independent accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of American Pathology Laboratory and will utilize the more scientific Gas Chromatography I Mass Spectrometry examination (GC/MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential between the employee, the Employer and the Union. The employee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wage and fringes for time required for drug testing provided the results are negative.
If the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee shall be granted a leave of absence for up to thirty (30) days for the purposes of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible, such rehabilitation programs are covered under the Health and Welfare Plan, providing the employee confines his/her self to a twenty-four (24) hour licensed rehabilitation medical facility.
The employee shall be removed from the Employer’s job site. Upon presentation of certification of the employee’s successful completion of the drug/alcohol rehabilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her original job with the Employer.
If the employee was reinstated, he/she shall for the next succeeding twelve (12) month period, present to the company representative monthly certification of negative drug/ alcohol test results. Failure to do so will result in denying the employee the right to maintain his/her availability to be sent to a job site or if working, to be removed from work.
Applicants who are eligible to be referred to a job, and are informed, prior to the referral, of the Employer’s requirement to pass a drug test, and accept the referral and subsequently fail the test, will be barred from resigning the list until the applicant submits proof of a
31
“negative” drug test, administered by a designated accredited lab, before he or she can again be placed on the out-of-work list. The test will be at the applicant’s own expense.
ARTICLE XI GRIEVANCES, DIFFERENCES AND ARBITRATION
In the case of grievances, misunderstandings, differences or disputes upon any job or should the Union and the Association differ as to the meaning and application of provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no work shmpaue.s or lockouts on account of Sucli matters.
