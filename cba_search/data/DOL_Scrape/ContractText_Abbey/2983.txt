Probationary, exempt, conditional, and regular part-time employees shall continue to be governed in all respects by the Code of Miami-Dade County, Florida, Personnel Rules, Pay Plan and other regulations in effect prior to the execution of this Agreement and there shall be no applicability of this contract or change in any of the wages, benefits, hours, or terms and conditions of employment of such employees as a result of this Agreement unless such applicability or changes are specifically stated in this Agreement with reference to such employees.
3.	It is agreed that if and when new position classifications are created by action of the Board of County Commissioners, the questions of inclusion or exclusion within the Bargaining Unit shall be settled in accordance with state law.
ARTICLE 5	NONDISCRIMINATION
It is agreed that there shall be no discrimination against an employee covered under this Agreement by the Union or the County because of race, color, sex, creed, national origin, marital status age, disability, political affiliation, religion, membership in the Union, or for engaging in any lawful Union activities.
This Article is intended solely to comply with the criteria enumerated above and applicable Federal and State statutes.
ARTICLE 6	CHECK OFF

The Union will notify the County, in writing, at least ninety (90) days prior to the date any uniform assessment will be deducted.

An employee may upon thirty (30) days written notice to the County and the Union revoke his dues deduction. Notice to the County alone shall not be sufficient. Should Chapter 447.303 Florida Statutes be amended, the amendment will supersede the applicable sections of this Article.

The Department Director shall respond to the employee with a copy to the Union within seven (7) calendar days.
5.	Failure by the employee or the Union to observe the time limits for submission of a grievance at any step will automatically result in the grievance being considered abandoned. Failure by the County to respond to a grievance within the prescribed time limits will automatically move the grievance to the next step.
6.	Each party shall be allowed one (1) extension of time, not to exceed seven (7) calendar days. This extension can be used only once during the grievance. The other party must be notified of the requested extension.
7.	The parties acknowledge that as a principle of interpretation, employees are obligated to work as directed while grievances are pending.
8.	All responses required in steps 2, 3, and 4 above shall be directed to the aggrieved employee with a copy furnished to the Union. In class grievances, copies will be directed to the Union only. A rejection of a grievance on any step of the procedure must contain the reasons for the rejection.

4.	The Employee Relations Department Director’s decision shall be final, subject to review by the County Manager.
ARTICLE 10 JOB DESCRIPTION AND APPEAL
1.	No employees covered by this Agreement shall be required to do work outside their job classifications, except under emergency conditions as declared by the County Manager or his authorized representatives.

If the Union is not satisfied with the proposed change, it may, in writing, within five (5) days of the conclusion of the discussion, stated in paragraph 2 above, request a hearing before the Employee Relations Department Director. This hearing shall be held at a mutually agreeable time, within thirty (30) days.
4.	It is understood by the parties, that the duties enumerated in job descriptions are not always specifically described and are to be construed liberally. Within present job descriptions, the County may assign tasks and duties which involve minor and occasional variation from the job descriptions to employees as long as the tasks and duties assigned fall within skills and other factors common to the classification.
5.	It is understood by the Parties, the duties to be added in the proposed change in the job description shall bear a reasonable relationship to the duties and responsibilities currently contained therein. Changes proposed by the County, other than the addition of new duties, shall be reasonable under the circumstances.
6.	Compliance with the requirements of this provision shall be the issue in the hearing. Testimony shall be taken from employees affected, who desire to give such testimony, provided that Union and County will agree on a representative number of employee witnesses to insure a full hearing on the merit of the issues. Appropriate County Management shall appear in support of the proposed changes. The decision of the Employee Relations Department Director shall be final, subject to review by the County Manager.

Resolution of specific matters clearly covered by the contract will be in accordance with the procedures elsewhere described in the contract. Matters relating to the quality and effectiveness of the career public service will be considered to be within the jurisdiction of the Labor-Management Committee structure. The Committee may discuss any topics of mutual concern but shall not be used as a collective bargaining forum to amend or abridge the specific terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Career employment opportunities for regular part-time employees, training, and cross-training programs, discussion of proposed job classifications, joint discussions of job certifications, and employees required to be on-call are examples of potential subjects for this committee’s review.
The Committee may also be involved in matters that affect the efficiency and availability of services provided to the community. Experienced employees, labor and management, may serve on special committees that are responsible for the purchase of sensitive new technology, equipment and supplies; that are considering the reorganizing of space and methods of providing service; that may review the hours of operations, and other vital factors that may contribute to the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the service.
Recommendations emanating from the committee must be approved by the Employee Relations Department and the County Manager before being implemented.

The Employee Relations Department Director shall rule as to whether the circumstances constitute abandonment of position. Only facts concerning the alleged abandonment shall be considered by the Employee Relations Department Director. The Employee Relations Department Director’s findings and rulings shall be in writing. The Employee Relations Department Director's decision shall be final and binding.

The Union's choice between the grievance procedure or the Code provision under Section 2-47, once made, shall not be subject to change.
In the case where the Union does not timely notify the County or chooses not to select the grievance procedure, then the disciplinary appeal provisions under 2-47 of the Code of Miami-Dade County shall prevail and be utilized if a timely appeal is requested. In the event the Union selects the option to appeal a disciplinary action under the grievance procedure then the provisions of 2-47 of the Code will not be applicable.
A suspension appeal through the grievance procedure may be filed by the Union directly at Step 3 or 4 of the Grievance Procedure contained in this Agreement.
The concerned Department at their sole discretion, may offer to an employee the option of forfeiting accrued annual or holiday leave in lieu of serving a disciplinary suspension.
