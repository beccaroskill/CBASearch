(A)	The City shall promptly notify CMAGE/CWA of its decision to create any new classifications pertaining to work of a nature performed by employees in the bargaining unit. The City, through the Civil Service Commission (CSC), may create, modify, or merge classifications and place abolished classifications in moratorium. The CSC will provide CMAGE/CWA with copies of proposed classification specifications, whether newly created, merged or modified at least fourteen (14) days before the Commission meeting where the proposed classification specifications will be on the Commission agenda.
(B)	If the new classification is a successor title to a classification covered by the Agreement and the job duties are not significantly altered or changed, the new classification shall automatically become a part of this Agreement.
(C)	If the new classification consists in significant part of the work now being done by any of the classifications covered by this Agreement, or its functions are similar to those of employees in this bargaining unit, and CMAGE/CWA notifies the City of a desire to meet within fourteen (14) calendar days of its receipt of the City's notice, the parties will then meet to review the proposed classification, and if unable to reach agreement as to its inclusion or exclusion from the unit, the City shall be free to implement its decision and CMAGE/CWA shall be free to challenge that decision through the SERB'S unit clarification procedure.

The Department of Human Resources will determine a proposed pay range for the affected classifications and shall notify the Union. Should the Union dispute the proposed pay recommendation of the City it shall request to bargain. Negotiations shall not exceed thirty (30) days.

ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY AND RIGHTS

The City will deduct from each employee's pay in the second pay period of each month the regular monthly Union dues for each employee in the bargaining unit who has fled with the City a payroll deduction authorization in the form attached hereto as Appendix C. The City will honor all executed payroll deduction authorization forms received not later than fifteen (15) working days (i.e., days the City's administrative offices are open) prior to the next deduction date.
Total deductions collected for each calendar month shall be remitted by the City to the Treasurer of CMAGE/CWA together with a list of employees for whom deductions have been made not later than the tenth (10th) of the following month. The City will also provide to the CMAGE/CWA Treasurer, in spreadsheet format, a copy of the list of deductions for the current month. The spreadsheet copy shall include: name, pay rate, pay range, department/division, classification, and social security number. CMAGE/CWA agrees to refund to the employee any amounts paid to the Union in error on account of this dues deduction provision.
Dues shall be withheld and remitted to the Treasurer of the Union unless or until such time as the City receives a notice of an employee's death, transfer from covered employment, termination of covered employment, or when there are insufficient funds available in the employee's earnings after withholding all other legal and required deductions.
Information concerning dues not properly deducted under this Section 3.1 shall be forwarded to the Treasurer of the Union, and this action will discharge the City’s only responsibility with regard to such cases; there will be no retroactive deduction of such dues from future earnings. Deductions shall cease at such time as a strike or work stoppage occurs in violation of Article 9 (No Strike-No Lockout).
The actual percentage dues to be deducted shall be certified to the City Auditor by the Treasurer of the Union. The Union will give the City a forty-five (45) day notice of any change in the percentage of dues to be deducted.
CMAGE/CWA agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders, or judgments for monetary damages brought or issued against the City as a result of any action properly taken or not taken by the City under the provisions of this Section 3.1.

Upon resignation from the Union a bargaining unit member shall immediately pay the fair share fee as provided in Section 3.3. The payment of dues and assessment is uniformly required of the membership for the duration of this Agreement.
Section 3.3	Fair Share Fee
Any present employee who is not a member of the Union and all employees hired or entering the bargaining unit, after the effective date of this Agreement and who have not made application for membership shall, commencing sixty-one (61) days after appointment to a classification in the bargaining unit or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, so long as they remain non-members of the Union, pay to the Union each month their fair share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and Agreement administration measured by the amount of dues and other financial obligations uniformly required by members of the Union. Such fair share payments shall be deducted by the City from the earnings of such non-member employee(s) once each month, and paid to the Union in accordance with Section 3.1. The Treasurer of the Union shall certify to the City the amount that constitutes said fair share that shall not exceed the dues and financial obligations uniformly required by members of the Union.
The Union agrees to comply with its legal obligations to fair share fee payers. Further, it is agreed that any dispute concerning the amount of the fair share fee and/or the responsibilities of the Union with respect to fair dnare fee payers shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement.
Section 3.4.	Union Communications.
The City recognizes that CMAGE/CWA has a responsibility to communicate with bargaining unit members. To facilitate this purpose, it is agreed that CMAGE/CWA may make reasonable use of e-mail, telephone, inter-office mail and fax machines to communicate with individual members (no mass communications), so long as the use does not unduly interfere with City work. The City will continue to permit CMAGE/CWA to use bulletin board space in appropriate and accessible locations approved by the Appointing Authority and will consider requests for changes or additions to such locations where appropriate. The Union will limit the posting of Union notices to such bulletin boards.

Items specifically prohibited from this process include those that are derogatory, inflammatory, or disrespectful of individuals or organizations.
Items that are neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited may be submitted to the Appointing Authority or designee for prior approval.
Citywide items or items not approved by the Appointing Authority may be submitted to the Chief Negotiator for the City, or designee for review. Problems arising under this Section shall be discussed between the Chief Negotiator for the City and the Union.
ARTICLE 4	- UNION REPRESENTATIVES
Section 4.1.	President’s Authority.
The President of CMAGE/CWA may appoint one (1) representative per department as listed below for the purpose of representing bargaining unit members at investigatory interviews to provide advice, provided that the representation is limited to the work location. All other representation will be scheduled through the President or Vice President, when acting in the place of the President. This will not preclude the ability of a representative to be contacted by a bargaining unit member for information.
Section 4.2.	Representatives Authority.
These representatives will not have the authority to deliver or file a grievance. Only the President or Vice President may actually file, deliver, or process a grievance or represent bargaining unit member(s) at a grievance or disciplinary hearing. In their absence the President or Vice President may specifically designate another elected Union official to attend meetings when requested by the City. Ordinarily the President or Vice President will represent bargaining unit members at disciplinary or grievance hearings, except both may attend, subject to the approval of the Chief Negotiator or designee, after CMAGE/CWA offers reasons for having both present at such hearings.

Vacation accrual rates are based on "total City service" as defined in Article 1, except for employees (1) who were employed in the bargaining unit as of March 30, 1994 (the effective date of Ordinance No. 262-94), (2) whose most recent date of hire was prior to July 5, 1987, and (3) who requested recognition of periods of full-time service with the State of Ohio and its political subdivisions prior to the beginning of the pay period ending September 24, 1994 (employees who were otherwise eligible but failed to request recognition for periods of full time service with the State of Ohio prior to the beginning of the pay period ending September 24, 1994 have forfeited any rights to receive credit for such prior service). For employees who meet these three criteria, total City service for purposes of vacation accrual is defined to be the total of all periods of full-time employment with the City, the State of Ohio and any political subdivision of the State. However, any employee not employed in the bargaining unit as of March 30, 1994 and any employee who has retired from the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions including the City, and is reemployed or hired by the City on or after June 24, 1987, shall not have prior service with the City, the State or Ohio or any of its political subdivisions recognized for purposes of determining the vacation accrual rate.
Any periods of interruption of service (including but not limited to resignation, layoff, or discharge for cause) as well as any periods of time in unpaid status of more than eight (8) hours (except for military leave without pay) will not be included in the computation of City service for the purpose of this Section 11.2.
The provisions of this Paragraph shall be in lieu of any prospective or retrospective application of Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code. For all purposes herein, the parties agree that Section 9.44 of the Ohio Revised Code does not apply to this Agreement or to any employees in the bargaining unit.
Section 11.3.	Eligibility.
No vacation credit shall be allowed for any 80-hour pay period in which a full-time employee does not receive compensation for at least forty (40) "hours of work”; the term "hours of work" for this purpose means actual work time plus paid holidays, vacations, sick leave, injury leave, military leave as provided in Section 14.1, CMAGE/CWA release time as provided in Section 8.5, jury duty and compensatory time off (no other paid or unpaid absences from duty shall be counted as "hours of work").
22
Section 11.4.	Approval by Appointing Authority.
All vacation leaves shall be taken at such time as may be approved by the Appointing Authority or designee. Vacation leave may be taken in increments as small as one-tenth (1/1 Oth) of an hour with the approval of the Appointing Authority. Any employee having unused vacation leave prior to the effective date of this Agreement shall be credited with such unused vacation leave for the purpose of this Agreement within the maximum limits indicated in Section 11.2.
Section 11.5.	Payment upon Separation from City Service.
An employee with vacation accrual who is about to be separated from City service through resignation, discharge, retirement, or layoff and who has unused vacation leave to his/her credit, shall be paid at the employee's hourly rate of pay at the time of separation in a lump sum or, at the employee's option, subject to approval by the Auditor's Office, the employee may elect in writing (at a time specified by the Auditor's Office for processing terminal leave pay) to receive three (3) equal installments - one-third (1/3) at the time of separation, one-third (1/3) one year later, and the final one-third (1/3) two years after separation (less applicable withholding) for each hour of unused vacation leave, less any amounts owed by the employee to the City, provided, however, that such payment shall not exceed the maximum number of vacation hours outlined in Section 11.2.
However, an employee who is involved in a layoff or certification termination and who has unused vacation leave to his/her credit at the time the layoff is effective, may choose, in lieu of a lump sum cash payment for such unused vacation credit, to leave such vacation credit on account to be restored to his/her credit upon reemployment, provided such reemployment occurs within thirty-five (35) calendar days. If the reemployment does not occur within thirty-five (35) calendar days, then any unused vacation leave left on account will be paid in lump sum to the employee, as provided for in this Section 11.5.
Section 11.6.	Payment upon Death.
When an employee dies, any and all accrued, unused vacation leave to his/her credit shall be paid to the surviving spouse. In the event that the employee has no surviving spouse, said unused vacation leave shall be paid to the employee's estate. Such payment shall be paid at the employee's hourly rate of pay at time of death in a lump sum (less applicable withholding), less any amounts owed by the employee to the City.
23
ARTICLE 12-	HOLIDAYS
Section 12.1.	Holidays Observed.
The legal holidays observed by the City and for which full-time non-seasonal employees are to be compensated shall be as follows:
(1)	New Year's Day, January 1
(2)	Martin Luther King's Birthday, the third Monday in January
(3)	President's Day, the third Monday in February
(4)	Memorial Day, the last Monday in May.
(5)	Independence Day, July 4
(6)	Labor Day, the first Monday in September
(7)	Columbus Day, the second Monday in October
(8)	Thanksgiving Day, the fourth Thursday in November
(9)	Christmas Day, December 25
(10)	Any other holidays proclaimed by the Mayor
(11)	Employee's Birthday - If the employee's birthday falls on an above-named holiday, the employee shall be granted and compensated for one additional holiday which shall be the nearest workday to the holiday either before or after the holiday. The Appointing Authority will allow the employee to take his/her birthday holiday within a year (365 days) from when the employee's birthday occurs. If the employee's birthday falls on February 29, the holiday for the purpose of this Section shall be considered as February 28 unless otherwise authorized by the Appointing Authority.
Section 12.2.	Eligibility and Pay.
(A)	When a holiday falls on the first day of an employee's regularly scheduled days off, it shall be celebrated on the previous day and when a holiday falls on the second day of an employee's regularly scheduled day off, it shall be celebrated on the following day, except that at the time of a shift change which necessitates more than a two-day weekend, a holiday which falls on either of the first two days shall be celebrated on the last previous workday, and a holiday which falls on any other day of such weekend shall be celebrated on the next subsequent workday.
(B)	For each holiday observed (including the employee's birthday), a full-time non-seasonal employee shall be excused from work for eight (8) hours on such day at the discretion of the Appointing Authority or designee. If a full-time non-seasonal employee is working a flexible or alternative work schedule (i.e., anything other than eight (8) hours per day), his/her work schedule for the week shall be adjusted so that the time off on the holiday is equal to eight (8) hours. If one of the holidays mentioned in Section 12.1 occurs while an employee is on vacation leave, such day shall not be charged against vacation leave. Part-time and seasonal employees will only be compensated for time actually worked on holidays.
24
(C)	When a full-time ron-seasonal overtime (D-level) eligible employee works on a day celebrated as a holiday (in accordance with Section 12.2(A) above), other than the employee's birthday, he/she shall be paid eight (8) hours at straighttime rates as holiday pay, plus time and one-half for all hours actually worked.
(D)	To be eligible for holiday pay an employee must have worked the full workday before and the full workday after the holiday, in addition to the full holiday when scheduled as part of the employee's normal work schedule, unless the employee was on an approved vacation leave, jury duty, military leave as defined in Section 14.1 or compensatory time off. The "workday before" refers to the employee's last regularly scheduled workday before the day on which the holiday is celebrated. The "workday after" refers to the first regularly scheduled workday following the day on which the holiday is celebrated. If an employee takes sick leave for all or part of either the work day before or the work day after a holiday, his/her absence from work on the holiday shall be presumed to be due to illness or other circumstance qualifying as sick leave under Section 13.7, and will, therefore, be paid for the holiday from his/her sick leave bank instead of holiday pay. If the sick leave is used as part of a disability waiting period the employee will receive holiday pay. If the sick leave is used for an extended illness as defined in Section 13.8, and the employee provides physician verification of the illness, the employee will receive holiday pay. If a D-level employee has no sick leave available under these circumstances, he/she shall be in unpaid status for the holiday.
(E)	For the purposes of administering the provisions of this Article 12, holiday time shall apply to the shift beginning on the day that is celebrated as a holiday.
ARTICLE 13	- SICK LEAVE
Section 13.1.	Sick Leave Plan.
(A)	Employees Entering the CMAGE/CWA Bargaining Unit. A City employee, who moves into a CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit during the term of this Agreement, shall be subject to the terms of the CMAGE/CWA collective bargaining Agreement with regard to provisions of Article 13, Sick Leave as provided below. An employee's sick leave balances shall be converted at the date and pay rate in effect upon entering the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit or as otherwise provided below.
(B)	Terminology
(1)	Old "Frozen" Bank - Sick leave account balance prior to March 31, 1987 having been valued at the employee’s rate of pay as of March 31, 1987.
25

(3)	CMAGE "Old Bank" - For employees entering the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit on or after the effective date of this Agreement, this bank shall be created by converting the Old Frozen Bank [(B)(1)], if any, and the Pre- CMAGE/CWA Current Bank [(B)(2)], if four hundred (400) hours or more before applicable conversion, per Section 13.2(E)(2)(a), and in the case of a city employee entering an E-level position from outside of the bargaining unit, fifty percent (50%) of his/her Pre-CMAGE/CWA Current Bank. The CMAGE Old Bank shall be paid out in ten annual installments, or as otherwise indicated herein.
(4)	CMAGE/CWA Current Bank - Sick leave accrual bank commencing on the first day of the month following the month in which an employee enters the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit, and any Pre- CMAGE/CWA Current Bank of less than four hundred (400) hours, before applicable conversion, per Section 13.2(E)(2)(b).
(5)	Sick - Other Agency - This bank contains sick leave transferred into the City from other political subdivisions or other governmental units.
(6)	"Hours of Work" - The phrase "Hours of Work" as used in this Section means actual work time plus vacation, jury duty, paid holidays, compensatory time, and military leave as defined in Section 14.1 (no other paid or unpaid absences from duty shall be counted as "hours of work").
Section 13.2.	Sick Leave Conversion.
(A)	No interest will be paid by the City on any sick leave bank at any time, upon conversion, or separation of employment of an employee from the City.
(B)	Employees who have sick leave accruals earned from Sick - Other Agency shall remain in effect and shall not be converted for any reason.
(C)	Employees who have previously had their sick leave converted and have an Old Bank, previously converted under the "ten year" pay out provision, will not have this bank converted.
(D)	Employees entering CMAGE/CWA from the MCP unit are exempt from any conversions. All time and banks will be transferred to CMAGE/CWA without conversion.
26
(E)	Sick leave shall be converted, where applicable, as follows:
(1)	An employee’s Old Frozen Bank shall be converted by:
(a)	Multiplying the bank hours by the employee’s rate of pay as of March 31, 1987.
(b)	Dividing this value by the rate of pay at which the employee enters the CMAGE/CWA Unit.
(2)	An employee’s Pre-CMAGE/CWA Current Bank shall be converted as follows:
E - Level positions
(a)	Any City employee entering an E-level position from outside of the bargaining unit shall have fifty percent (50%) of the hours transferred to the employee’s CMAGE/CWA Old Bank and fifty percent (50%) of such sick leave shall be forfeited without compensation.
D - Level positions
(b)	An employee who has fewer than four hundred (400) hours shall have 50% of the hours transferred to the employee’s CMAGE/CWA Current Bank and the other fifty percent (50%) of such sick leave hours shall be forfeited without compensation.

1 hour for every 3 hours
1 hour for every 2 hours
1 hour for every 1 hours
The hours credited shall then be valued at the employee’s rate of pay prior to entering the CMAGE/CWA unit and then adjusted by the rate of pay at which the employee will be paid upon entering the CMAGE/CWA unit.
(F)	Once an employee enters the CMAGE/CWA unit and has a CMAGE/CWA Old Bank, this bank will remain until one of the following is met:
(1)	The bank has been paid out under the ten year payout schedule; or
(2)	The bank is depleted by usage; or
27
(3)	The employee experiences a break in continuous City service as provided in Section 13.3(C).
Section 13.3.	Usage of and Payment for " CM AGE Old Bank".
The CMAGE Old Bank as defined in Section 13.1 (B)(3) shall be paid out and subject to usage in accordance with the following:
(A)	Annual Automatic Cash Distributions. Ten percent (10%) of the initial cash value of the CMAGE Old Bank will be paid out each year, until the CMAGE Old Bank is fully depleted. The pay-out shall be paid at the same time annual sick leave reciprocities are paid. If there is less than 10% of the initial cash value of the CMAGE Old Bank remaining in the year of final payment, such lesser amount shall be paid as the final distribution. If the value of an employee's CMAGE Old Bank is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), then the entire value of the CMAGE Old Bank, less applicable withholding, shall be paid to the employee at the time annual sick leave reciprocities are paid. A city employee coming into the CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit after January 1, 1995, shall receive the 10% annual cash distribution until the Old Sick Leave Bank is depleted.
(B)	Use of CMAGE Old Bank for Sick Leave. After an employee has exhausted all of his/her CMAGE/CWA Current Bank as defined in Section 13.1(B)(4) the employee may charge additional time off for permissible sick leave purposes against their CMAGE/CWA Old Bank. Such time off shall be charged dollar-for-dollar against their CMAGE Old Bank. Such usage of the CMAGE Old Bank will not diminish the 10% annual pay-out referenced in Paragraph (A) of this Section 13.3, but instead will simply accelerate the depletion of the CMAGE Old Bank.
(C)	Separation Pay for CMAGE Old Bank. An employee who experiences a break in continuous City service through retirement, resignation or layoff shall receive pay for his/her CMAGE Old Bank in lieu thereof, may elect to transfer such sick leave to another governmental unit. If the employee elects payment, the employee must elect one (1) of the following options:
(1)	immediate payment in a single lump sum; or
(2)	two (2) equal installment payments, the first to be paid at the time of retirement or separation and the second to be paid one (1) year thereafter; or
(3)	three (3) equal installment payments, the first to be paid at the time of retirement or separation, the second to be paid one (1) year thereafter, and the third to be paid one (1) year after the second payment.
However, the City must approve those employee elections that provide for payment in other than a single lump sum. All such lump sum payments are subject to applicable withholding and deduction for sums owed by the employee to the City. All elections referred to in this Section 13.2 shall be made in writing at a time specified by the Auditor's Office for processing terminal leave pay.
2§
Section 13.4.	"Current Year Sick Leave".
On the first pay period of each calendar year, each full-time, non-seasonal employee employed on that date who had at least 1250 hours of work during the preceding calendar year shall receive seventy-two (72) hours of sick leave with pay (hereinafter referred to as Current Year Sick Leave) for the remainder of that calendar year, except that full-time, non-seasonal employees hired during the preceding calendar year shall be credited with a full year's sick leave benefit on the first pay period of the new calendar year without regard to the 1250 hours of work requirement. Any employee not hired during the preceding calendar year who has fewer than 1250 hours of work during the preceding calendar year shall receive a pro-rata sick leave benefit, computed as follows: 72 multiplied by a fraction which has the employee's hours of work as defined in this Section 13.4 for the preceding calendar year as the numerator and 1250 as the denominator.
Each full-time non-seasonal employee hired on or after the first pay period of each year shall, on the date of hire receive his/her current sick leave with pay for the remainder of that calendar year computed, as follows: six (6.0) hours for each calendar month in the calendar year of hire, commencing with the month following the month in which the employee was hired. However, for each full calendar month in which an employee is in unpaid status for any period of time, six (6.0) hours shall be deducted from his/her paid sick leave entitlement. When an employee is required to report to work and does so report but is denied work because of circumstances beyond his/her control, absence from work under these circumstances shall not be considered as unpaid work status for purposes of this Paragraph (unless and until the employee is actually laid off). Should an employee move from full-time non-seasonal status to part-time or seasonal status during a calendar year in which he/she was eligible for sick leave, six (6.0) hours shall be deducted from his/her paid sick leave account for each full calendar month in which the employee is in part-time or seasonal status.
Any employee who has been advanced additional sick leave time by action of City Council and who has thereby agreed to have amounts deducted from his/her sick leave account, shall on the first pay period of each year have an amount, not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours, deducted from his/her sick leave account. In no circumstance shall an employee's yearly sick leave account be reduced by more hours than the aggregate yearly amount as set forth in the ordinance authorizing said advancement. Except as herein written, all provisions of the original ordinance advancing sick leave shall remain in effect.
Section 13.5.	“CMAGE/CWA Current Bank” Cap.
Under no circumstances will an employee's CMAGE/CWA Current Bank be allowed to accumulate over 320 hours of sick leave. No interest shall be paid by the City on this account.
Section 13.6.	Usage of and Payment for Sick Leave Banks.
Payment of Annual Sick Leave Reciprocity. During January of each year, each employee shall be paid, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time, for any unused sick leave hours awarded during the preceding calendar year, up to a maximum of 72 hours, on a one-for-one basis, or at the employee's option, may carry over all unused sick leave hours to the next year in the employee's CMAGE/CWA Current Bank. Any hours of sick leave taken during the payroll year shall be deducted from the maximum amount of annual sick
29
leave reciprocity (i.e., 72 hours) prior to calculating the annual sick leave reciprocity payment.
If an employee uses five (5) days or less of injury leave (regardless of the number of claims) during the year, this leave shall not be considered sick leave taken for computing sick leave reciprocity. If an employee uses more than five (5) days of injury leave, all injury leave used during the year will be considered hours of sick leave taken in computing sick leave reciprocity.
In addition to the option of either depositing all unused current year sick leave in an employee's CMAGE/CWA Current Bank or taking all of such unused sick leave in the form of annual sick leave reciprocity, employees with at least (16) sixteen hours of current year sick leave remaining as of the end of the last pay period ending in the month of December are eligible to "split" on a 50/50 basis unused current year sick leave between annual reciprocity and banking to their CMAGE/CWA Current Bank. Those with less than sixteen (16) hours will have their time automatically credited to their CMAGE/CWA Current Bank (unless this would make their Current Bank exceed the maximum of 320 hours, in which case the hours over 320 will automatically be paid out as annual reciprocity).
The following procedures and limitations will govern the election to "split" unused Current Year Sick Leave for eligible employees between annual reciprocity and deposit to the CMAGE/CWA Current Bank:
(1)	Employees will be asked by their payroll clerk to sign a register no later than November 15 of each year indicating their election for the allocation of their remaining unused current year sick leave if they have at least sixteen (16) hours of current year sick leave as of the end of the last pay period ending in December. Options available to employees will be limited to the following:
(a)	100% to the employee's CMAGE/CWA Current Bank (this will be the
default rule in the event an employee does not sign the register by November 15);
(b)	100% to be received as annual sick leave reciprocity;
(c)	Split on a 50/50 basis (rounded to the nearest 1/10 of an hour) the remaining current year sick leave, with one-half (1/2) going to the employee's CMAGE/CWA Current Bank and one-half (1/2) being paid out in annual sick leave reciprocity.
(2)	In no event will employees be allowed to credit sick leave hours to their CMAGE/CWA Current Bank if this would increase that Bank above 320 hours; any election that would have the effect of doing so will automatically be adjusted accordingly so that the CMAGE/CWA Current Bank will be 320 hours at the start of the new year.
Section 13.7.	Dispensation of Sick Leave Balances upon Separation from City Employment.
(A)	Separation Pay for Current Year Sick Leave. For an employee who is separated
30
from City service through resignation, retirement or layoff on or before December 31, the following provision shall apply with regard to separation pay for current year sick leave as defined in Section 13.4: the number of current year sick leave hours which that employee has to his/her credit at the time of separation shall be reduced by the number of paid sick leave hours used plus six (6.0) hours for each calendar month remaining in the calendar year following the month of separation. If, after such calculation, the employee has any unused CMAGE/CWA Current Bank hours, the employee shall be paid, at the time of separation, for such unused current year sick leave hours, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time, less applicable withholding and any amounts owed by the employee to the City. If, after such calculation, the employee has used more sick leave hours than that to which he/she was entitled, an amount shall be deducted from his/her final paycheck for such hours, at his/her regular straight-time hourly rate in effect at that time.
For any employee who moves from full-time non-seasonal status to part-time or seasonal status on or before December 31 of any calendar year and who has used more sick leave hours than that to which the employee was entitled, the value of such hours shall be deducted first from the employee's CMAGE/CWA Current Bank and then Old Bank, and/or the value of such hours shall be deducted from earned and unused vacation accruals to the employee's credit, and if funds are still owed, then in that case, the employee shall negotiate with the City for a schedule to repay the funds out of any subsequent bi-weekly pay checks.
(B)	Separation Pay for New Sick Leave Bank. An employee who experiences a break in continuous service through resignation, retirement, or layoff may elect to receive pay for his/her CMAGE/CWA Current Bank (excluding current year entitlement), or to transfer said sick leave to another governmental unit, if such transfer is acceptable to other governmental unit. If an employee elects to receive payment, said payment shall be computed by dividing the number of accumulated unused hours by two (2) and multiplying those hours by the employee's hourly rate of pay at time of separation. All such lump sum payments are subject to applicable withholding and deduction for sums owed by the employee to the City. All elections referred to in this Paragraph (B) shall be made in writing at a time specified by the Auditor's Office for processing terminal leave pay.
(C)	Sick Leave Hours Transferred from Another Governmental Entity. Hours transferred from another governmental entity after March 31, 1987 will not be compensable at time of separation.
(D)	Separation Caused by Death. If an employee dies, his/her unused sick leave account balances as defined herein shall be paid to his/her surviving spouse. In the event that the employee has no surviving spouse, said balance shall be paid to the employee's estate. The employee's sick leave account balances shall be valued at the time of death in accordance with the applicable Sections of this Article.
34
Section 13.8.	Terms and Conditions for Taking Sick Leave with Pay.
Except as provided by discretionary action of the City Council, sick leave cannot be taken before it is credited to an employee's sick leave account. Sick leave with pay will be at an employee's regular straight-time hourly rate and shall be allowed to full-time non-seasonal employees in one-tenth (1/1 Oth) of an hour increments only in the following situations:
(A)	Illness of, or injury to, the employee, whether at work or non-work related.
(B)	Physical, dental, or mental consultation or treatment of the employee by professional medical or dental personnel, whether work or non-work related.
(C)	Sickness of a spouse, child, stepchild, and upon prior approval of the Appointing Authority, a family member who is dependent upon the employee for his/her health and well being.
(D)	Quarantine because of contagious disease. Appointing Authority or designee shall require a certificate of the attending physician before allowing any paid sick leave under this Subsection.
(E)	Death in the employee's immediate family, as that term is defined in Article 1, Definitions, of this Agreement.
(F)	Maternity and Adoption Leave.
Any leave which is granted under this Section 13.8 for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave as provided in Section 14.9 shall be charged as an FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve-week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
In cases of extended illness (three (3) or more consecutive work days or frequent intermittent use of sick leave) or suspected abuse, as determined by the Appointing Authority or designee, the Appointing Authority or designee may require evidence as to the adequacy of the reason(s) for an employee's absence during the time for which sick leave is requested. For the purpose of this Section 13.8, evidence as to the adequacy of the reasons for an employee's absence (both for illness of the employee, or his/her immediate family) is defined as a certificate acceptable to the Appointing Authority or designee stating date(s) of treatment and the diagnosis, prognosis and expected return to work date from a licensed physician or other appropriate medical professional; provided, however, that falsification of either a written signed statement of the employee or a physician's certificate shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including dismissal, as well as grounds for denial of sick leave. Any sick leave improperly used by the employee shall be repaid to the City. The Appointing Authority or designee may also require a certification that the employee is able to return to duty at the conclusion of a sick leave.
The Appointing Authority or designee may require the employee to be examined by a licensed physician or other appropriate medical professional identified by the Appointing Authority or designee. Failure to submit to the examination shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action as well as grounds for denial of sick leave.
Section 13.9.	How Sick Leave Usage is Charged.
32
Sick leave with pay, if available, shall be used in increments of one-tenth (1/1 Oth) of an hour. Sick leave shall be used for the purposes outlined in Section 13.8 in the following order:
(A)	Current year sick leave as defined in Section 13.4;
(B)	Once current year sick leave is exhausted, sick leave shall be withdrawn from the New Sick Leave CMAGE/CWA Current Bank as defined in Section 13.1(B)(4).
(C)	Once current year sick leave is exhausted, sick leave shall be withdrawn from the Old Sick Leave Bank on a dollar-for-dollar basis as provided in Section 13.3(B). An employee shall withdraw from the Old Bank the sums necessary to compensate the employee at not greater than his/her current regular straight-time hourly rate for approved sick leave time.
(D)	Once an employee has exhausted all of the above, an employee shall withdraw on a dollar-for-dollar basis Sick Leave Transferred From Other Political Subdivisions as defined in Section 13.7(C), only to the extent that such time has not been consolidated with one of the other sick leave banks referenced above. Such sick leave time shall be charged dollar-for-dollar for usage purposes based on its value at the time the employee terminated employment with the other political subdivision. An employee shall withdraw from his/her Sick Leave Transferred From Other Political Subdivisions the sums necessary to compensate the employee at not greater than his/her current regular straight-time hourly rate for approved sick leave time.
Section 13.10.	Sick Leave Transferred From Other Political Subdivisions.
Employees who have been employed in the classified or unclassified Civil Service or as teachers, school employees, firefighters, peace officers, or state highway patrol officers of the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions shall be credited with any certified, unused and unpaid balance of accumulated sick leave earned in such service when such persons are employed in the classified or unclassified Civil Service of the City on or after April 1, 1987, provided employment with the City occurs within ten (10) years after leaving his/her prior position when such action occurs after January 1, 1972. Such unused balance shall then be subject to all other provisions of this Article. Such unused balance shall not be subject to any compensation upon termination of employment and will not be credited toward the 400 hour minimum for purposes of the Old Bank as provided in Section 13.2(E) and will not be counted for purposes of a D-level employee's contribution to the Current Bank as provided in Section 13.2E(2)(b).
ARTICLE 14	- OTHER LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 14.1.	Military Leave.
(A)	Full-time non-seasonal employees who are members of the Ohio National Guard, U.S. Air Force Reserve, U.S. Army Reserve, U.S. Marine Corps
33
Reserve, U.S. Naval Reserve or U.S. Coast Guard Reserve shall be granted military leave of absence with pay when ordered to temporary active duty (e.g., active duty for training or annual training) for a maximum of twenty-two (22) eight (8) hour work days (176 hours), days, whether or not consecutive, during each calendar year. Active duty does not include inactive duty training (e.g., unit training assemblies). In the event that the Chief Executive Officer of the State of Ohio, or the Chief Executive Officer of the United States declares that a state of emergency exists, the employee, if ordered to active duty for purposes of that emergency, shall be paid pursuant to this Section 14.1 for a maximum of an additional twenty-two (22) eight (8) hour work days (176 hours), whether or not consecutive, during each calendar year.

Section 14.6.	Personal Leave.
Employees who have completed their probationary period may be granted personal leave of absence without pay by the Appointing Authority for good cause but employment other than with the City will not be considered grounds for such leave. Such leave may not exceed sixty-(60) calendar days; however, extensions may be granted under the Civil Service Rules, if such need arises. Any such leave which is granted for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave as provided in Section 14.9 shall be charged as an FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve-week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
Section 14.7.	Educational Leave.
Employees may be granted a leave of absence without pay by the Appointing Authority for educational purposes. Such leave shall initially be limited to sixty (60) calendar days with possible extensions up to one (1) year provided such further educational pursuits are related to the operations of the City.

Section 14.8.	Injury Leave.
(A)	On-The-Job Injuries. All employees shall be allowed injury leave with pay up to a maximum of sixty (60) workdays per calendar year for on-the-job injuries, not to exceed a total of one hundred twenty (120) workdays per injury.

35
Injuries must be reported to the employee's immediate supervisor no more than two (2) working days after such injury is known. If an employee who has been granted injury leave does not begin receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation by the time the injury leave has been exhausted, and the employee has a claim filed under the Ohio Workers' Compensation laws for such payment, then the City shall continue to pay the employee seventy-two percent (72%) or sixty-six and 2/3 percent (66 2/3), whichever is applicable, of his/her wages until such time as payments from the Bureau are received or the claim is denied by the Industrial Commission of Ohio. In any instance of double payment by both the City and the Bureau for the same day or days, the employee shall provide full reimbursement to the City in a prompt manner.
(B)	Determination by the Department of Human Resources.
(1)	Report of Injury. All then available medical documentation, supporting documentation, and a report of the cause of all injuries, both original or recurrent, must be submitted by the employee to the employee’s immediate supervisor within fourteen (14) days from the date the injury is known. Signatures of the employee’s immediate supervisor, the Division Administrator, and the Appointing Authority are required thereafter. Claims are to be submitted to the Human Resources Department within a total of twenty-eight (28) days from the date the injury is known (provided, however, that an employee’s eligibility for injury leave shall not be prejudiced by a delay in filing caused by supervisors if the employee has complied with his/her fourteen (14) day filing deadline). Except that the Director of Human Resources or designee, may grant additional time if the doctor fails to provide additional information that has been timely requested.
(2)	Actual Performance of Duties. Injury leave with pay shall be granted to an employee only for original or recurrent injuries determined by the Director of Human Resources or designee as caused by the performance of the actual duties of his/her position. Whenever an employee is required to stop working because of an injury or other service connected disability, he/she shall be paid for the remaining hours of that day or shift at his/her regular rate, and such time shall not be charged to leave of any kind. The City may require an independent medical examination for any employee requesting injury leave, at the City's expense.
(3)	Written Authorization and Return to Work. No employee shall be granted injury leave with pay unless the Appointing Authority has in his/her possession written authorization signed by the Director of Human Resources or designee indicating the approximate length of the leave. No employee on injury leave shall be returned to work without the written approval of an attending physician. If there is a recurrence of a previous injury, the Appointing Authority must request approval of injury leave for each recurrence. If, in the judgment of the Director of Human Resources
36
or designee, the injury is such that the employee is capable of performing his/her regular duties or light duties during the period of convalescence, he/she shall so notify the Appointing Authority in writing and deny injury leave with pay.
(4)	Continued Contact with Division and Return to Work Notification. An employee on injury leave shall maintain oral biweekly contact with the division personnel officer or designee during the period of time he/she is injured. This requirement may be modified in writing by the personnel officer for extended leaves.
(5)	Ninety (90) Day Fitness Hearing. After ninety (90) days, the City may conduct a hearing to determine the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of his/her classification.
(6)	Outside Employment. No injury leave payments shall be made to any employee who is working for another employer: (1) during the employee's regular City shift, or (2) where such work involves or requires the performance of the same or similar duties as those regularly performed by the employee for the City, or (3) where such job involves duties and/or physical demands the performance of which would conflict with the injury/medical condition allowed.
(7)	Limitation on Recreational Activities. No injury leave payment shall be made to any employee engaged in recreational activities where the physical demands of such activities conflict with the injury/medical condition allowed.
(8)	Fraudulent Claims. Fraudulent actions automatically preclude employees from receiving injury leave benefits and if any benefits are paid pursuant to a fraudulent claim, they shall be repaid immediately and/or may be withheld from an employee's final pay upon termination. Fraudulent actions are subject to disciplinary action where appropriate.
(9)	Leave Pending Decision. Pending a decision by the Director of Human Resources or designee, an employee applying for injury leave may be carried on sick leave or vacation leave with pay, in that order, which shall be restored to his/her credit upon certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. However, when an employee is applying for injury leave, exclusive of apparent heart attack cases, and the Division Administrator can establish that the injury occurred during the employee's hours of work for the City, then the employee may be carried on injury leave with pay pending certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. In no case may the employee be carried on injury leave for a period of time in excess of the employee's amount of accumulated sick leave and vacation leave prior to certification by the Director of Human Resources or designee that injury leave has been approved. If injury leave is not certified by the Director of Human Resources or
37
designee, the employee will be charged sick leave, and vacation leave, in that order, for the time used.
(10)	Appeal to Board of Industrial Relations. Any injured employee may appeal the decision of the Director of Human Resources or designee by written notice to the Board of Industrial Relations within ten (10) days of notification that injury leave has been denied. The Board of Industrial Relations, at the City's expense, may require an employee to be examined by a physician of the Board's choice.
(C)	Time Off for Examination and Treatment. Pursuant to rules established by the Director of Human Resources or designee, time off for the purpose of medical examination, including examinations by the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, and/or treatments resulting from injury occurring during any period of time an employee was in paid status and performed services for the City required by his/her employment shall be charged to injury leave. Actual time spent, not to exceed four (4) hours of injury leave shall be allowed per scheduled physician's appointment and/or treatment resulting from an on-the-job injury (including travel time). The Director of Human Resources or designee may approve an employee's request for injury leave of greater than four (4) hours for a scheduled physician's appointment or for treatment resulting from an on-the-job injury if the Director of Human Resources or designee determines that such request is supported by medical documentation. However, such medical documentation must be submitted to and in a form acceptable to the Director of Human Resources or designee by the employee prior to such appointment and/or treatment in order to be considered.
(D)	Accrual of Other Benefits. While an employee is on approved injury leave with pay, PERS contributions and all employee benefits (except sick leave, vacation and holidays, as provided elsewhere in this Agreement shall continue uninterrupted and the City shall maintain applicable insurance benefits for the employee until such time as the employee returns to duty or is terminated from employment. Upon proof that an employee is receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, applicable insurance benefits shall continue uninterrupted until the employee returns to duty or is terminated from employment. In all cases where insurance benefits are continued, the employee must make arrangements to pay their share of insurance premiums monthly in advance.
(E)	Administration by Director of Human Resources or Designee. The provisions of this Section 14.8 shall be administered by the Director of Human Resources or designee who shall make necessary rules, devise forms, keep records and investigate cases subject to the approval of the Industrial Relations Board.
(F)	Deadline for Application for Disability Following Denial of Injury Leave. In the event the employee has been denied all remedies through injury leave and Workers' Compensation, the employee has thirty (30) days to file for short-term disability benefits.
38
(G)	If the Physician of Record indicates an employee is medically eligible to participate in vocational rehabilitation, the employee shall agree to participate in the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation voluntary vocational rehabilitation program. In the event the employee chooses not to participate, the Appointing Authority will be notified in writing and injury leave with pay will be denied.
Section 14.9.	Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave.
(A)	Full-time bargaining unit employees who have worked for the City for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked for at least 1,250 hours over the twelve (12) month period preceding the leave, shall be eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave per twelve (12) month period for the following:

(2)	"Child" means a child either under eighteen (18) years of age, or eighteen (18) years or older who is incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability. An employee's "child" is one for whom the employee has actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes a biological, adopted, foster or stepchild or the child of one standing in loco parentis.
(3)	"Parent" means a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child. This term does not include parents "in law."

39
(5)	The City retains the option of choosing a uniform method to compute the twelve (12) month period, including a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date leave is used.
(C)	For the purposes of Sections 14.9(A)(3) and (4), a "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or a physical or mental condition that involves:
(1)	In-patient care (e.g., overnight stay in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility);
(2)	Any period of incapacity requiring absence fom work, school, or other regular daily activities of more than three (3) calendar days and that involves two (2) or more times of treatment by a health care provider, or treatment on one (1) occasion resulting in continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider;
(3)	Any period of incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition that requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, continues over an extended period of time, and may cause episodic rather than continuing periods of incapacity, e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy;
(4)	Any period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective, e.g., Alzheimer's, severe stroke, terminal illness, so long as the employee or family member is under the continuing supervision of a health care provider;
(5)	Any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a health care provider either for restorative surgery after accident or surgery, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3) days in the absence of medical intervention, e.g., cancer (chemotherapy, radiation), severe arthritis (physical therapy) or kidney disease (dialysis); or
(6)	Prenatal care by a health care provider.
(D)	Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only when medically necessary to treat serious health conditions, or the serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child or parent.

(E)	Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee shall be returned to the position held prior to the leave or an equivalent position.
4Q
(F)	The City shall maintain insurance benefits for the duration of FMLA leave at the level and under the same conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in active work status for the duration of the leave.

(H)	All accrued sick leave benefits, and disability leave benefits when applicable, must be utilized for any FMLA leave taken for any FMLA-qualifying reason. All accrued vacation leave benefits must be substituted for all or part of any unpaid FMLA leave taken for any reason after sick leave benefits have first been exhausted except the employee may at the employee’s request, retain a vacation balance not to exceed forty (40) hours when exhausting family medical leave, sick leave and vacation.
(I)	The following notice and scheduling requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Employees must give thirty (30) days notice to the City before taking FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must notify the City as soon as is practicable (normally no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the need for the leave becomes known).
(2)	If an employee has actual notice of the notice requirement stated in 14.9(l)(1) above, (this requirement of actual notice is fulfilled by posting a notice at the work-site), and fails to provide the City with thirty (30) days notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the City may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the employee provides notice.
(3)	Employees shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the City aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The City may inquire further of the employee if it is necessary to have more information about whether FMLA leave is to be taken.
(4)	If an employee takes leave based on the serious health condition of the employee or to care for a family member, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as to not unduly disrupt the City's operation.
(J)	The following medical certification requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
44
(1)	Employees who request leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member shall be required to provide a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee's family member on a form acceptable to the Human Resources Director or designee. For the employee's own medical leave, the certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee's position and a statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for the condition by the health care provider (including estimated number of visits, nature, frequency and duration of treatment). For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include a statement that the patient requires assistance for basic medical, hygiene, nutritional needs, safety or transportation, or that the employee's presence or assistance would be beneficial or desirable for the care of the family member, and an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to provide care.
(2)	The City shall give employees requesting FMLA leave written notice of the requirement for medical certification.
(3)	In its discretion, the City may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the City, at its own expense, may obtain the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the employee and the City.
(4)	Employees must provide the requested certification to the City within the time frame requested by the City, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The City must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the City's request for certification.
(5)	In most cases, the City shall request that an employee furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the employee requests leave or soon after the leave is requested, or in the case of unforeseen leave, soon after the leave commences. The City may request certification or re-certification at some later date if the City has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration.
(6)	Certification shall be submitted using a form approved by the Human Resources Director for use by employees consistent with the FMLA.
(7)	All employees who take FMLA leave because of their own serious health condition shall be required to provide medical certification of their fitness to report back to work. The City may seek fitness for duty certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave.
42
(K)	The City may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work. A FMLA leave will not be granted to permit an employee to accept gainful employment elsewhere, including selfemployment. If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return, the City's obligations under FMLA to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee cease.
(L)	Leaves that are granted under any other provision of this Agreement, whether paid or unpaid, for purposes which are covered under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall be charged as FMLA Leave and shall be subject to the twelve-week per year limitation for the length of a FMLA leave.
(M)	The City, in its discretion, may modify the provisions of this Section 14.9 in accordance with any Department of Labor final regulations that may be in effect under the FMLA from time-to-time.
Section 14.10.	Transitional Return to Work.
The City agrees to make reasonable efforts to provide transitional return to work assignments for all employees who have sustained an occupational injury or illness or a re-occurrence/exacerbation of a pre-existing condition or, in some cases, are returning from short-term disability leave. This Section 14.10 is not to be construed as requiring the assignment of transitional return to work in any case, but only that reasonable efforts to do so will be made. This will be done in accordance with the following:
(A)	During the time an employee is in a transitional return to work program, the employee will be assigned duties which the employee is capable of performing based upon the recommendation of the employee’s attending physician. Such assignment shall not exceed ninety (90) days. Duties will be reviewed not less than every thirty (30) days and may be discontinued at any time.
(B)	Upon request of the City, employees must participate in the transitional return to work program unless precluded from participation by their attending physician.
(C)	A transitional return to work assignment may be to a classification in a lower pay range and the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay will not be reduced
(D)	The terms of the transitional return to work arrangements shall be reduced to writing including the instructions of the employee’s attending physician.
Section 14.11.	Reopener.
The parties agree that Article 14 will be reopened if either of the following two actions occur:

(B)	The Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (BWC) changes its rating methodology in such a way as to negatively impact the injury leave program.
43
Negotiations shall not exceed thirty (30) days. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, they shall submit unresolved issues through arbitration pjrsuant to Section 8.2, Step 3, of this Agreement, except that the parties shall share the expenses equally.
ARTICLE 15	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 15.1.	Application of Article.
This Article is intended only as a basis for calculating overtime payments for overtime eligible (i.e., only D-level) employees and to generally describe the parameters for employees' work schedules, and nothing in this Article or Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per shift, per week, or any other period.
Section 15.2.	Normal Work Period and Workday.
Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, the current normal work period for employees shall be seven (7) days. The normal workday shall be eight (8) hours of work, plus an unpaid lunch period scheduled near the middle of an employee's shift, subject to operating requirements. The current normal work schedule consists of five (5) eight (8)-hour workdays in a seven (7)-day work period. The City reserves the right, however, to establish or approve alternate work schedules in its discretion, and to determine the beginning and ending of the seven (7)-day work period, scheduled days off and the beginning and ending time of all work shifts in a day.
Section 15.3.	Changes In Normal Work Schedule, Work Period and Workday.
Should it be necessary in the interest of efficient operations to establish schedules departing from the normal or established work schedule, work period, workday or shifts, the Appointing Authority or his/her designee will give at bast forty-eight (48) hours notice where practicable of such change to the individuals affected by such change.
Section 15.4.	Overtime Pay.
(A)	Employee Eligibility. Employees whose job classifications are listed in Appendix B, E-level classifications, of this Agreement are not eligible to receive compensation for overtime worked. Employees whose job classifications are listed in Appendix B, D-level classifications, of this Agreement are eligible to receive payment in cash or compensatory time off for overtime worked as provided in this Section 15.4.
(B)	Overtime Eligibility and Pay. When any D-level employee works between forty (40) and forty-eight (48) hours in a seven (7)-day work period, he/she shall be paid at a rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times his/her regular straight-time hourly rate of pay for each overtime hour worked. Overtime worked beyond forty-eight (48) hours in a seven (7) day work period shall be paid at double time his/her regular straight time hourly rate. Overtime pay shall be received in one-tenth (1/1 Oth) of an hour segments. For purposes of this Article, time worked shall include only that time spent on duty as provided by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), plus time compensated but not actually worked for jury
44
duty and holidays, but shall not include any other uncompensated periods or time which is compensated but not actually worked, including but not limited to vacations, sick leave, injury leave, compensatory time-off, or any other paid or unpaid leave of absence. All overtime shall be paid on the basis of a regular straight-time hourly rate calculated by dividing an employee's annual salary by 2080.
(C)	Authorization of Overtime. It shall be the policy of the City to avoid overtime work except in emergency conditions as determined by the Appointing Authority or designee. Overtime work may only be performed on the authorization of the Appointing Authority or designee. Employees who are requested to work emergency overtime shall be informed prior to the overtime work as to whether the overtime has been expressly approved. The City reserves the right to require overtime work.
(D)	Overtime Distribution. Employees shall be canvassed annually to determine if they want to be offered overtime opportunities outside of their regular hours of work. Overtime eligibility list shall be established based on seniority and the initial opportunities shall be offered based upon seniority. Thereafter, insofar as practicable, overtime shall be equitably distributed on a rotating basis by overtime hours worked among those who normally perform the work. Specific arrangements for implementation of these overtime provisions shall be worked out at the department level. Overtime roster shall be purged at least every twelve (12) months. Such arrangements shall recognize that in the event the City has determined the need for overtime, and if a sufficient number of employees is not secured through the above provisions, the City shall have the right to require the least senior employee(s) on a rotating basis who normally performs the work to perform said overtime. The overtime distribution policy shall not apply to overtime work which is specific to a particular employee's work load or specialized work assignment or when the incumbent is required to finish a work assignment. An employee who is offered but refuses an overtime assignment shall be credited on the roster with the amount of overtime worked by the employee who accepted the overtime opportunity. An employee who agrees to work overtime and then fails to report for said overtime shall be credited with the amount of overtime hours accepted and the employee shall be considered absent without approved leave, unless the employee can prove that extenuating circumstances prevented the employee from reporting. In such cases the employee will be credited as if the overtime opportunity was refused. In the event of an emergency as determined by the City, the Appointing Authority or designee may assign someone to temporarily meet the emergency requirements, regardless of the overtime distribution roster.
Section 15.5.	Compensatory Time.
(A)	Eligibility. A compensatory time account may be established for hourly full-time non-seasonal employees whose job classifications are listed in Appendix B, D-level classifications, of this Agreement.
45
(B)	Compensatory Time Calculation. Compensatory time may only be earned at the applicable rate as established in Section 15.4(B) in lieu of cash payment for authorized time worked on an overtime basis. By mutual agreement of the employee and the Appointing Authority or his/her designee, an employee shall receive compensatory time off in lieu of overtime payment at the applicable rate for time worked on an overtime basis. Compensatory time account balances shall be maintained in units of hours.
(C)	Conditions Governing Use and Accumulation. Compensatory time off shall be taken by the employee at such time or times as may be approved or established by the Appointing Authority. Any compensatory time account balance above eighty (80) hours shall be paid off at the employee's hourly rate as of the end of a pay period established by the Appointing Authority for each Division within the Appointing Authority's jurisdiction. The cut-off time established pursuant to this section shall be set no less than six (6) months in advance of the pay period selected. Notice of the date of the end of the selected pay period shall be posted within the Division and shall be sent to the City Auditor. No interest is to be paid by the City on any compensatory time account. Except for employees engaged in a public safety activity, emergency response activity or seasonal activity, employees who have accrued two hundred forty (240) hours of compensatory time, shall be paid for any additional overtime hours of work over two hundred forty (240). For employees working in a public safety activity, emergency response activity or seasonal activity, who have accrued four hundred eighty (480) hours of compensatory time shall be paid for any additional overtime hours of work over four hundred eighty (480).
(D)	Payment upon Separation from City Service or Death. An employee separated from City service for any reason or who dies while still employed shall be paid for any unused compensatory time account balance to his/her credit upon separation or death (less applicable withholding), less any amounts owed by the employee to the City. In the event of death, the payment shall be made to the employee's surviving spouse or to the employee's estate in the event there is no surviving spouse. Such payment shall be calculated by multiplying the employee's regular hourly straight time wage rate at the time of separation or death by the number of hours in his/her compensatory time account balance.
Section 15.6.	Call-Back Pay.
Callback pay applies only to full-time non-seasonal employees in a D-level classification as provided in Appendix B. A call-back is defined as an unscheduled work assignment that does not immediately precede or follow an employee's scheduled work hours. When an eligible employee is called back by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee to report to work after he/she has been relieved of duty upon the completion of his/her regular schedule and he/she does so report, he/she shall be paid for a minimum of four (4) hours or the actual hours worked, whichever is greater, at one and one half (1 % ) the employees straight time rate, or if applicable double (2) time rates as provided in Section 15.4(B), unless the time extends to his/her regular work shift or unless the individual is called back to rectify his/her own error (in these latter two situations, the four (4) hour minimum shall not apply, but the employee shall be paid for actual time worked at applicable rates. If an employee is called back to work he/she will be paid from the time he/she leaves his/her home until the time they
46
report in up to one (1) hour. This Section 15.6 does not apply in cases of overtime authorized as an extension of a regular shift.
Section 15.7.	Report-In Pay.

Disability forms must be returned to the City no later than forty-five (45) days from the commencement of disability; failure to comply will result in a denial of disability benefits. The disability benefit shall be eighty-one percent (81%) of the employee's regular straight-time biweekly gross pay (in no event more than eighty (80) hours of pay at straight-time rates), less applicable withholding. The employee may, if he/she so desires, elect to use all, or part of, his/her accumulated but unused sick leave in order to make up any difference between one hundred percent (100%) of his/her gross wages and the amount which he/she receives under the disability program, provided that all new (current year) sick leave accruals are exhausted before an employee may use the available balance in his/her Old Sick Leave Bank. If an employee exhausts all sick leave benefits, other approved leave may be granted by the Appointing Authority. During the period in which an employee receives such payments, he/she shall suffer no reduction in his/her paid sick leave entitlement set forth in Article 13 of this Agreement, as applicable. If, while receiving such payments, the employee performs work for the City or another employer, the amount of payment under the disability program, shall be reduced by the compensation which he/she receives during that time period.
(B)	While an employee is paid disability benefits pursuant to this Section, vacation accruals shall cease. Holidays shall be paid at the disability benefit rate as set forth in Paragraph (A) of this Section.
(C)	The City shall implement the following program changes in the disability program:
(1)	The disability waiting period for employees shall provide for payment to employees from the twelfth (12) day of accident or illness for a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks, per disability per calendar year.
(2)	Employees must complete one (1) year of continuous City service before gualifying for disability; such benefits will become available at the first of the month following the month in which they complete one (1) year of continuous service.

ARTICLE 24 - TRIAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESSES
Section 24.1	Statement of Principle
The City and the Union are mutually committed to a trial for the life of this Agreement to promote continual improvement of quality City provided services through a joint partnership involving union leaders and staff and the bargaining unit members they represent, City directors, and their management staff at all levels of their organization. This partnership of union and management shall be known as the Continuing Quality Improvement Process CQIP (CQIP). The principles of the Article shall apply in all quality improvement processes utilized in the City with CMAGE/CWA bargaining unit employees. CQIP will be jointly developed, implemented, and monitored. It is recognized by the parties that CQIP is a separate process from the normal collective bargaining and agreement administration procedures.
66
The purpose of CQIP will be to establish a quality work culture and environment which allows for a collaboration of management and bargaining unit talents through use of the quality processes and procedures to develop and deliver quality services through union and management teamwork and employee involvement and empowerment. As a result of their mutual commitment to improving quality services, the parties agree that quality outcomes and improvements resulting from CQIP will not be used as the basis or rationale for layoffs.
Section 24.2.	Scope of Activities
No strategic operations team or problem solving team will have the authority to discuss, change, modify or infringe upon issues, which are related to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment. Whenever a matter covered by a collective bargaining agreement is raised in a strategic operations team, or problem solving process team, the matter shall be suspended until the members of the Citywide Labor Management Committee have expressly agreed to continued involvement by the strategic operations team or the labor management team. The following represent general examples of items or issues, which may or may not be worked on by the strategic operations team:
Off Limit Activities
Wages
Grievances
Union Agreement Interpretations
Benefits
City Policy and Working Conditions
Classification
Discipline
Working Hours
Acceptable Activities
City Quality Service or City Product
Work Environment Safety
Reduction in Paperwork
Savings in Time, Effort or the Handling of Materials
Improvement in Process, Methods or
Systems
Improvements in Facilities, Tools or
Equipment
Elimination of Waste of Materials and
Supplies
Reductions in Hazards to People or
Property
Whenever there is a discussion over off-limit activities as stated above, or other matters which are normally reserved to the collective bargaining process, no final decision or action shall be taken except through the grievance or collective bargaining process agreed to by the parties.
Section 24.3.	Strategic Operations Team (SOT)
CQIP will be directed by a Joint City/Union Strategic Operations Team (SOT) composed of an equal number of management appointees and representatives of each union representing City employees, which choose to participate. The parties may mutually agree to add members to the committee. Each shall also have a Joint City/Union SOT. All CMAGE/CWA representatives shall be selected by the CMAGE/CWA president.
Time spent on authorized CQIP matters shall be considered time worked. Whenever possible, SOT meetings will be held during working hours of the employer. Employees may have their regular schedule adjusted to coincide with such meetings.
67
SOT at each level will have the responsibility for the development of plans and activities for the implementation of principles and processes described in Section 2, as well as the review of plans developed by subordinate SOT’s and the oversight of CQIP activities within their jurisdiction. CQIP issues and matters, which are not resolved at the SOT level, may be referred to the next higher SOT level for assistance and advice.
Section 24.4.	Training
Training for all managers, supervisors, employees and Union leaders and staff in the concepts, skills and techniques of the CQIP will be conducted at the City’s expense. It is the intent of this Agreement that insofar as it is practical, bargaining unit leadership and their exempt counterparts (e.g., local Union President, Officers, City Directors, Assistant and Deputy Directors) will attend the same training. Whenever possible, the training in CQIP matters will be presented by a joint union/management team, members of which will be designated by each party. The training will consist of the training offered or authorized through the City Office of Quality, as authorized by the Joint Labor/Management Committee.
Section 24.5.	Employment Security Assurances
Quality outcomes and improvements resulting from CQIP will not be used as the basis or rationale for layoffs. If, as the result of the CQIP actions or recommendations, CMAGE/CWA classifications are changed or altered, jobs are abolished, or positions eliminated, management shall attempt to find other suitable employment with the CMAGE/CWA employee’s job family. If that position is at a pay level less than the employee is presently receiving, the employee’s salary shall be frozen until such time as the new employee’s new pay schedule catches up to the frozen salary. CMAGE/CWA employees shall not be subjected to loss of pay or layoff pending suitable placement under this Section.
No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the City from exercising its rights provided in this Agreement or in law to layoff bargaining unit employees or abolish bargaining unit positions for reasons other than outcomes and improvements resulting from CQIP.
ARTICLE 25-TIME DONATION PROGRAM
Section 25.1.	Purpose.
Effective ninety (90) days after the effective date of this Agreement, a time donation program will be established to assist full-time employees, eligible to earn accruals, who have exhausted all accumulated paid leave and all disability leave benefits available as a result of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related. This program neither supersedes nor replaces other disability programs covered by this Agreement.
Section 25.2.	Conditions.
An employee may utilize the time donation program only if all of the following conditions are met:
6§
(A)	Prior to requesting approval for donation of vacation leave, the employee must have exhausted all paid leave and disability leave benefits available to him/her; and
(B)	The employee shall submit an application requesting donation of vacation leave from other bargaining unit employees in the same division to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. The application shall include acceptable medical documentation of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related, including diagnosis and prognosis. The injury or long-term illness must require the employee to be away from work for at least two (2) full pay periods. This application shall be on a form mutually agreed to by the City and the Union; and
(C)	The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee shall determine that the injury or long-term illness is catastrophic in nature and that the employee is eligible to receive vacation leave donations from other bargaining unit employees in the same division; and
(D)	The approved application shall be forwarded to CMAGE/CWA. The Union shall post a notice on the Union bulletin boards to other bargaining unit employees in the same division that the eligible employee may receive donations of vacation leave; and
(E)	If the eligible employee is in a probationary period, the probation will be extended by the number of days the employee is off duty receiving leave donations. The Civil Service Commission must be notified of an extension of any probationary period; and
(F)	Donated leave shall be considered sick leave but shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
Section 25.3.	Employees Donating Vacation Time.
(A)	An employee desiring to donate vacation leave shall submit a completed time donation form to the Division payroll office.
(B)	It is understood that all vacation leave donations are voluntary and once vacation leave is donated, it will not be returned to the donating employee.
(C)	All donated vacation leave shall be paid at the regular hourly rate of the employee receiving and using the donated leave, not at the regular hourly rate of the employee donating the leave.
(D)	Vacation leave may be donated in increments of at least four (4) hours.
This is a completely voluntary program. A decision made by the City regarding implementation, acceptance or rejection of an application for donations shall be final and the same shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
69
ARTICLE 26 - ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement supersedes all prior practices and agreements, whether written or oral, unless expressly stated to the contrary herein, and constitutes the complete and entire agreement between the parties, and concludes collective bargaining for its term.
The parties acknowledge that, during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter within the scope of bargaining as defined by State law, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, except as specifically provided in Sections 2.3 the City and CMAGE/CWA, for the duration of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter, whether or not referred to or covered in this Agreement, including the impact or effects of the City's exercise of its rights as set forth herein on salaries, fringe benefits or terms and conditions of employment, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Agreement. It is expressly agreed that the City may unilaterally make and implement decisions consistent with the City's rights as set forth in Article 4, even though the exercise of such rights may involve subjects or matters not referred to or covered in this Agreement; provided only that the City's exercise of its management rights shall be subject to employees' individual rights (i.e., those derived from sources other than this Agreement and the collective bargaining relationship which produced it) as provided in Section 5.1.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 21 of this Agreement and other provisions of Article 26 of this Agreement, the parties agree that CMAGE/CWA may notify the City in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to August 24, 2003 and or at least sixty (60) days prior to August 24, 2004, that the Union desires to modify Article 17, Section 17.1 of this Agreement pertaining to annual wage increases. In the event such notice is given, negotiations shall begin no later than forty-five (45) days prior to the anniversary date. All of the provisions of ORC 4117 pertaining to bargaining successor collective bargaining agreements shall apply except that the issue of the negotiations shall be limited to modification of Section 17.1 pertaining to annual wage increases. In the event that the parties are unable to reach an agreement regarding the annual wage increases in 2003 or 2004 the resolution of such dispute shall be subject only to the fact-finding process outlined in ORC 4117.14.
70
ARTICLE 27 - DURATION OF AGREEMENT

Columbus, Ohio 43229
Re: 2002 - 2005 City of Columbus CMAGE/CWA Local 4502 Agreements (Check-off for CMAGE/CWA-Sponsored Voluntary Legal Insurance Plan)
Dear Carnell:
This letter will confirm and document certain understandings and representations of the parties in connection with the settlement of the 1994-97 collective bargaining agreements (the “Agreement”) between the City of Columbus, Ohio and the Columbus Municipal Association of Government Employees, Communication Workers Of America (CMAGE/CWA). Specifically, CMAGE/CWA is desirous of providing a voluntary group legal services plan to full-time members of the City bargaining units with the premiums to be paid entirely by participating members of those bargaining units and, to that end, has requested that the City grant it one payroll deduction slot for the voluntary deduction of monthly premiums from participating bargaining unit members’ wages. As part of the resolution of the parties’ Agreement, the City has agreed to provide CMAGE/CWA with a payroll deduction slot for this purpose, in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
1.	The group legal services plan sponsored by CMAGE/CWA will be the complete and sole responsibility of CMAGE/CWA to process, administer and monitor.
2.	The City will provide CMAGE/CWA access to an available payroll deduction slot (one deduction slot for use by the CMAGE/CWA City bargaining units) and will facilitate enrollment by eligible bargaining unit members of CMAGE/CWA in individual City departments by agreeing to have payroll clerks process the payroll deduction authorizations for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan.
3.	All monies deducted monthly for participation in tie group legal services plan will be forwarded to the Treasurer of CMAGE/CWA in one aggregate amount by a warrant separate and apart from the warrant provided to CMAGE/CWA for dues deducted under Section 3.1 of the Agreement. All funds transmitted to CMAGE/CWA pursuant to the payroll deduction authorization for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan shall be the sole responsibility of CMAGE/CWA to administer and disperse.
4.	The actual amount to be deducted each month for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan shall be certified to the City Auditor by the Treasurer of the Union, and shall be based on a uniform amount for each employee in order to ease the Employer’s burden of administering this agreement. This amount will not be changed more than once each fiscal year during the life of this agreement. The Union will give the City forty-five (45) days’ notice of any such change in the monthly amount to be deducted.
5.	Deductions shall be made during one (1) pay period each month; if any participation bargaining unit member’s pay for the period is insufficient to cover the deduction for the plan after withholding all other legal and required deductions (including CMAGE/CWA dues, if any), no deduction will be made for such employee for that month. Information concerning amounts properly not deducted under this paragraph shall be forwarded to the Treasurer of the Union, and this action will discharge the
110
City’s only responsibility with regard to such cases; there will be no retroactive deduction of such amounts from future earnings. Deductions shall cease at such time as a strike or work stoppage occurs in violation of Article 6 (No Strike—No Lockout).
6.	Total deductions collected for each calendar month shall be remitted by the City to the Treasurer of CMAGE/CWA together with a list of employees for whom deductions have been made not later than the tenth (10th) of the following month. CMAGE/CWA agrees to refund to the employee any amounts paid to the Union in error on account of this dues deduction provision.
7.	It shall be CMAGE/CWA’s sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the group legal services plan, including solicitation and distribution off information related to enrollment or participation in the plan. The City’s role will be solely clerical in nature, that is, to process the amount of the payroll deduction for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan and to transmit the monies deducted from the payroll to CMAGE/CWA.
8.	Only full-time bargaining unit members who have properly executed the required payroll deduction authorization card for the group legal services plan ) a copy of which is attached hereto as Appendix D) shall be eligible to participate in the payroll deduction plan for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan.
9.	An annual enrollment period during the month of February each year is hereby establish, during which interested eligible bargaining unit members may sign a payroll deduction card for the plan. Payroll deduction authorization cards received by the City on or after March 1 of each year shall be deemed invalid. In any event, the City shall not be obligated in any way to honor the payroll deduction authorization cards for the CMAGE/CWA-sponsored group legal services plan until such time as CMAGE/CWA presents to the City, in a timely manner (i.e., during the month of February) a minimum of 50 properly executed payroll deduction authorization cards evidencing the desire of at least 50 eligible bargaining unit members to participate in the payroll deduction program for the CMAGE/CWA sponsored legal services plan.
10.	The City shall continue to make the appropriate monthly deduction from the pay of a participating bargaining unit member until such time as the City receives a written revocation of the authorization for payroll deduction during the month of February signed by the participating member, or notice of an employee’s death, transfer out of the bargaining unit, or termination of City employment.

Re: 1994-97 City of Columbus CMAGE/CWA Agreement (Separate Supplemental Agreements
Regarding Golf Professionals and Golf Program Managers)
Dear Bill:
This letter will confirm and document certain understandings and representations of the parties in connection with the settlement of the 1994-97 collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”) between the City of Columbus, Ohio and the Columbus Municipal Association of Government Employees (CMAGE/CWA). Specifically, negotiators for the parties have become aware of the fact that certain terms and conditions of employment for Golf Professionals and Golf Program Managers exist which are not reflected in the parties’ Agreement, and that such conditions of employment historically have been worked out directly between the City and the individuals involved. These conditions of employment include such things as arrangements for the operation of golf pro shops, individual and group lessons and the rental of equipment. The parties agree that the Agreement does not alter or affect these pre-existing arrangements, and that such conditions of employment for these individual employees shall continue to be established by individual agreements with the employees involved, which agreements will not require the ratification or approval of CMAGE/CWA. Such individual agreements shall not reduce any benefit set forth in the Agreement.
Please sign this letter in the space provided below if the foregoing accurately reflects the understandings of the parties.
Very truly yours,
Robert C. Long Chief Negotiator, City of Columbus
Agreed and accepted on
Behalf of CMAGE/CWA

Re: Discussion of Hours of Work for CMAGE/CWA Employees
Dear Carnell:
This letter is to document the agreement of the parties that the hours of work for CMAGE/CWA employees is an appropriate topic for discussion at labor/management committee meetings. The labor/management committee may agree to appoint sub-committees.
Discussions may be held in labor/management sub-committee meetings established to address specific concerns mutually identified by the parties. The sub-committees shall meet at least monthly to explore possible ways to address concerns until the issues are resolved or either party communicates to the other that it believes that no further progress can be made.
