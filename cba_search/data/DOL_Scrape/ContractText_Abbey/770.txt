THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between SCREEN ACTORS GUILD, INC., a California non-profit corporation, hereinafter called the "Union" or "SAG," and the ALLIANCE OF MOTION PICTURE & TELEVISION PRODUCERS, hereinafter also referred to as the "AMPTP" or "Alliance,” acting on behalf of Producers who have authorized said Alliance to act on their behalf, a list of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, all of which constitute a multi-employer bargaining unit, each hereinafter called "Producer" and collectively referred to as "Producers."
WITNESSETH:
In consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter contained, it is agreed as follows:
GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	RECOGNITION AND SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
A.	Recognition
The Union is recognized by Producer as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for performers in the production of motion pictures in the motion picture industry within the territorial limits of the United States of America. The term "performer" means those persons covered by the terms of this Agreement and includes performers, professional singers, stunt performers, airplane and helicopter pilots, dancers covered under Schedule J of this Agreement, stunt coordinators, puppeteers and body doubles. Background actors are not considered "performers."
The Union is also recognized by Producer as the exclusive bargaining agent for background actors covered by the terms of this Agreement and employed in the production of motion pictures in the motion picture industry in the Hawaii, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento Zones, as defined in Schedule X, Part I and Schedule X, Part II.
The term "motion pictures," as used herein and in all prior Agreements between the parties, means and includes, and has always meant and included, motion pictures whether made on or by film, tape or otherwise, and whether produced by means of motion picture cameras, electronic cameras or devices, tape devices or any combination of the
foregoing or any other means, methods or devices now used or which may hereafter be adopted.
(I)	When Producer has its base of production in the United States or any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States, the Basic Contract shall apply, excluding the Union Security provisions in Alaska or any commonwealth, territory or possession of the United States until the Union establishes a Branch in such area.
(2)	When Producer has its base of production as provided in (1) above and goes on location in Canada, the Basic Contract, excluding the Union Security provisions, shall apply to all performers hired by Producer at such location.
(3)	When Producer employs a performer in the United States and transports him anywhere outside of the United States for a motion picture, the terms of tire Basic Contract shall apply. If a performer whose services are utilized is a permanent resident of the United States but is temporarily resident abroad and negotiations are carried out in the United States by the performer’s attorney, agent or other representative (including the Union) in the United States, such agreement for the services of the performer shall be within the scope and coverage of this Agreement. The foregoing test of coverage shall be met as long as the representative, agent or attorney of the performer is in the United States when the agreement is negotiated even if it is negotiated by telephone with, or mailed or cabled to a representative of the Producer who is not within the United States during all or any part of said negotiation.
(4)	Only the provisions of Schedule X, Part I shall apply to the employment of background actors in the Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco and Hawaii Zones. Only the provisions of Schedule X, Part H shall apply to background actors employed in the New York Zone.

A. Every performer hereafter employed by any Producer, whether by contract or otherwise, or who acts before the camera, or who makes sound track within the Union's jurisdiction, for any Producer, shall be a member of the Union in good standing. As defined and applied in this Section, the term "member of the Union in good standing" means a person who offers to pay (and, if the Union accepts the offer, pays) union initiation fees and dues as financial obligations in accordance with the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act
-2-
B.	Each Producer shall give the Union full opportunity to check performance by such Producer of its agreement under this Section / including access to sets, but the Union's checking shall be done in such a manner as not to interfere with production. The Union agrees that it will accept as a member of the Union any performer the Producer wishes to , employ, but the Union may refuse such admission or, if it sees tit, admit on terms, performers suspended or expelled by the Union or by any branch of the Associated Actors and Artistes of America or by any other performers' union. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the Union to discipline, suspend or expel a member or to refuse to re-admit him. The Union agrees, however, that if it suspends or expels a member who is under contract to a Producer, or if a member resigns, the suspension, expulsion or resignation shall not affect the performer's obligation to perform any existing contract or contracts with such Producer or such Producer's right to demand performance, unless the Producer otherwise ' consents. Subject to the qualifications hereinafter set forth, the Producer agrees that in every future contract it enters into with a performer, the performer shall agree that the performer shall be a member of the Union ' in good standing and shall remain so for the duration of the contract. Any non-member of the Union and any suspended or expelled member whom the Producer may be lawfully entitled to employ under this
s	shall be paid the same minimum salary and shall be given the
same working conditions as are provided in this Agreement No breach by a member of the Union of his obligation to the Union shall give such
, member a defense to any Producer’s right to enforce an existing contract against such member.
C.	The foregoing subsections A. and B., requiring as a condition of employment membership in the Union, shall not apply until on or after fee thirtieth day following the beginning of such employment or fee effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; fee Union and the Producers interpret this sentence to mean that membership in the Union cannot be required of any performer by a Producer as a condition of employment until thirty (30) days after his first employment as a ' performer in the motion picture industry; "first employment" meaning the first employment as a performer in the motion picture industry on or after August 10,1948. The foregoing sentence shall be deemed ' inoperative if any of the following events shall occur: (a) if the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 is repealed; or (b) if the provision of such Act to which the foregoing sentence has reference is repealed or / modified so the foregoing sentence is unnecessary to comply with such Act; or (c) if such Act or such provision is held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Producer shall not be held to , have violated this paragraph if it employs a performer who is not a member of the Union in good standing, if the Producer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the Union was not available to z such performer on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to
-3-
other members, or if Hie Producer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership in the Union was denied to such performer or such performer’s membership in the Union was terminated for reasons other than the failure of the performer to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union; provided, however, the Producer shall not be deemed to have such reasonable grounds for believing until it has made inquiry of the Union as to the facts. The preceding sentence shall be deemed inoperative if any of the following events shall occur (a) if the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 is repealed; or (b) if the provision of such Act to which the preceding sentence has reference is repealed or modified so the preceding sentence is unnecessary to comply with such Act; or (c) if such Act or such provision is held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States.
D.	The Producer agrees to report to the Union, in writing, within fifteen (15) days of the first employment of a non-member of the Union, (or within twenty-five (25) days of the first employment of a non-member of the Union on an overnight location), giving the Don-member’s name, Social Security number and Iris first date of employment An inquiry by any Producer to the Union as to the first date on which a performer has been employed in the industry shall be answered by the Union, and its answer shall bind the Union, and the Producer, if it acts in good faith, shall not be liable for acting on such answer, but the Producer who foiled to report shall be liable to the Union for such failure to report. The inquiry provided for in the preceding sentence may be made before, on or one (1) business day after the date of employment
E.	The interpretation contained in the first sentence of subsection C. of this Section 2 has been approved by an advisory opinion of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. If such approval of such sentence is changed by a ruling of such General Counsel, then the new ruling of such General Counsel shall prevail, until the same is overruled by the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction shall change said ruling in a proceeding in which the Union is a party, then the new ruling or opinion shall prevail, until the same is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
F.	The Producer shall pay to the Union as liquidated damages
for each employment of a performer in violation of the provisions of this Section 2 the sum of $500, it being agreed that the actual damages suffered by the Union for such breach would be incapable of ascertainment.
-4-
G.	The Union agrees that it will not impose unreasonable dues or assessments. If Producer claims a violation by the Union of the provisions of this subsection G., such question shall be handled by conciliation and, if necessary, by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 hereof. It is the intention of the parties to prevent the Union from closing its books so as to prevent any person who wishes to act in motion pictures from joining the Union. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall limit the right of the Union to discipline or suspend or expel a member or to refuse to re-admit him.
H.	It is agreed that children under four (4) years of age are not subject to the Union Security provisions of this Agreement

With respect to theatrical motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced after October 6,1980 and released to free television anywhere in the world, Producer agrees to pay to SAG a deferred compensation, for rateable distribution to toe performers appearing in such pictures, equal to six percent (6%) of the worldwide total gross receipts from the distribution of such pictures on free television, after deducting a flat amount of forty percent (40%) of such total gross receipts for distribution fees and expenses. Said compensation shall include pension and health contributions. Such pension and health contributions shall be at the rate provided in and subject to the ceiling and other provisions of Section 34 hereof or of the "Pension and Health Plans" provision of the Agreement under which such picture was produced, whichever is applicable.
When the Producer does not itself so distribute such picture, but effects its distribution through another distributor, the percentage paid shall be based on such distributor’s gross receipts from such distribution of such picture on free television, after deducting said flat amount of forty percent (40%) from such total gross receipts, payable only after they are received by the Producer, and after such forty percent (40%) deduction. When Producer is paid advances by a distributor, the above percentage shall likewise be payable on the amount of such advances. When Producer sells outright the right to exhibit on free television, SAG shall be paid promptly the above percentage on the gross amounts actually received by Producer for such free television exhibition rights, after deducting a flat amount of ten percent (10%) of such gross amounts so received by Producer from such outright sale of free television exhibition rights, for sales commission and expenses of sale.
If any such outright sale shall include both free television exhibition rights and other rights with respect to one or more pictures, the Producer shall allocate, to the free television exhibition rights covered by such sale, a fair and reasonable portion of the sale price (but only for the purpose of determining the percentage payment due hereunder) based on the sale of free television exhibition rights in comparable pictures. If SAG shall contend that the amount so allocated in any such outright sale for free television exhibition rights was not fair and reasonable as aforesaid, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration as herein provided. In the event the arbitrator shall find that
1 The Screen Actons Guild was on strike against the Producers during the period July 22, 1980 through and including October 5,1980. The terms of an interim agreement may be applicable to performers who were employed in motion pictures produced during Oist period.
-8-
such allocation was not reasonable and fair as aforesaid, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated. When the sale is of the free television exhibition rights only in a group of pictures, Producer shall likewise make an allocation of a portion of the sale price to each picture. If SAG contends that allocation is not fair and reasonable, the matter may be similarly submitted to arbitration, as above provided. In the event the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, as aforesaid, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated.
The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not apply to any sale of free television exhibition rights only in a single picture.
The term "performer" means those persons covered by this Agreement and includes performers, professional singers, stunt performers, airplane and helicopter pilots, dancers,2 stunt coordinators3 and puppeteers, but excludes body doubles.

(c)	No more than ten (10) salary units may be credited to any performer.
(3)	Computation
Each performer shall be credited with the sum of time and salary unite as computed above, and each performer will receive that rateable proportion of the monies as the performer's number of unite bears to the total number of unite for the entire cast
C.	With respect to such pictures made outside of the United States, when part of the cast is composed of performers subject to this Agreement and part of the cast of performers is not subject to this Agreement, then sums payable hereunder shall be prorated based on the proportion which the salaries and the time worked payable to the performers subject to this Agreement bear to the total performers' salaries and time worked for the picture. If records reflecting time worked are not reasonably available, then the aforementioned proration may be based on salaries alone.
D.	Application to Pictures Initially Released Theatrically
The provisions of tins Section 5 regarding additional compensation for free television exhibition apply only to a theatrical motion picture which is exhibited on free television after it has had a bona fide theatrical release. Such motion picture exhibited on free television that has not had a bona fide theatrical release shall be governed by the Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement then in effect, but only with respect to the provisions relating to additional compensation for reruns and foreign telecasts, or as may otherwise be agreed upon between the Producer and the Union.

Compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the performer.
(1)	Network
Except as provided in Section E.(3) below, with respect to network television exhibition, in the event Producer shall fail to pay such additional compensation when and as the same becomes due and payable, the Producer shall pay a late payment charge in die amount provided in Section 31.B. hereof until such additional compensation is paid.
(2)	Syndication and Foreign Telecasting
Except as provided in Section E.(3) below, with respect to syndication and foreign telecasting, in the event Producer fails to pay such additional compensation within ten (10) days from the date of a notice in writing to Producer from the Union, a late payment penalty shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1 %) per month from the date of delinquency.
(3)	The late payment charges set forth in Section E.(l) and (2) shall not apply:
(a)	To motion pictures produced by Qualified Residual Payors, Qualified Distributors and Qualified Buyers, and motion pictures, the residuals for which are guaranteed or assumed by a Qualified Residual Payor, Qualified Distributor or Qualified Buyer. These motion pictures shall continue to be subject to the rules on payment of liquidated damages set forth in the 1995 Agreement;
-11 -
(b)	To residuals payable in connection with the purchase of libraries. The Producer shall give notice to the Union in such cases. The Producer shall assist the Union in its endeavor to obtain compliance with any residual obligations which accrued prior to the date of the purchase. The Union shall cooperate with the Producer in furnishing records or verifying previous payments to enable the Producer to begin making residual payments accruing on and after the date of the purchase as expeditiously as possible;
(c)	To performers omitted from the final cast list As to these performers, the Producer shall investigate and respond to a claim from the Guild that a performer has been omitted from the cast list with a final position within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of tiie claim from the Guild. I£ as a result of its investigation, the Producer determines that the performer is owed the residual payment, payment shall also be made within said thirty (30) day period. If payment is due and the Producer fails to pay within the thirty (30) day period, then late payment liquidated damages shall accrue as of the date of the original notice from the Guild initiating the claim.
(d)	In the event of bonafide disputes. In such event, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute provided that the Producer pays the undisputed amount on time.
In no event shall the total late payment penalty with respect to any performer exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the amount owing to such performer.
As used herein, the term "network exhibition" shall mean the telecasting of such picture over the network facilities in the United States of ABC, CBS, Fox Broadcasting Company (“FBC”) and NBC, or any other entity which qualifies as a network under Section 73.662(f) of tiie rules of the Federal Communications Commission, unless the FCC determines that such entity is not a network for purposes of such Section.

(4)	The foregoing provisions shall not preclude the Producer from recovering an erroneous payment. If there is a dispute over tiie amount due the performer, and Producer pays tiie undisputed amount on time, or if there is a bona fide dispute as to tiie Producer’s liability therefor, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute.
-12-
F.	Effect of Performer's Individual Contract
When compensation is payable to any performer in connection with any such picture released to free television, pursuant to an individual contract between such performer and Producer, and such compensation is based, in whole or in part, upon a percentage of Producer’s gross receipts, then such percentage compensation may be credited against such performer's share of the monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder or, on the other hand, such performer's share of the monies payable hereunder may be credited against the percentage compensation due under the performer’s personal service contract, depending upon which such payment was made first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any compensation payable to such performer under an individual contract under which such compensation is a specified sum of money commonly known as a "deferment," as distinguished from a participation in the gross of a picture, may not be credited against the monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder.
G.	Reporting
Producer shall furnish to the Guild, with respect to each motion picture produced covered under this Section 5, a complete cast list of actors covered by this Agreement including the name of each actor, Social Security number, type of employment contract, length of employment and the payments for free television exhibition which will become payable to or for the account of each actor with respect to such motion picture. Such cast list shall be furnished to the Guild one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of principal photography or ninety (90) days after completion of each such motion picture, whichever is sooner. Producer will thereafter furnish a revised or final list when necessary.
Producer shall furnish to SAG written reports showing the gross receipts from the sale, lease, license and distribution of such picture on free television (whether distributed by the Producer or through another distributor) with respect to which the Producer is required to make payments hereunder. Such reports shall be furnished at least quarterly during each calendar year, except in the case of an outright sale. No such report need be furnished by Producer as to any such picture until such Producer shall have first exhibited such picture on free television. Concurrently with the furnishing of such report, the Producer shall pay the percentages due. Producer shall also make available for inspection by SAG all distributors' statements delivered to Producer, insofar as they relate to such gross receipts. SAG shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer as to such gross receipts pertaining to such distribution of such pictures. Producer also agrees that any agreement entered into by it for
-13-
the lease, license or distribution of any such pictures on free television shall contain a provision made expressly for the benefit of SAG and the performers involved in such pictures, by which such lessee, licensee or distributor agrees to assume and pay the percentage amounts payable hereunder to SAG when and as the same become due; and copies of all such provisions contained in such agreements, with a statement of the name and address of the Producer and the lessee, licensee or distributor and the date of execution shall be delivered to SAG promptly upon the execution thereof. In the event any lessee, licensee or distributor executes such assumption agreement and a copy thereof is delivered to SAG as above provided, Producer shall be relieved of any further obligation or liability with respect to such payment on condition that SAG has approved, in writing, the financial responsibility of such lessee, licensee or distributor.
An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this Section 5 shall not constitute a default by Producer hereunder, provided said failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Screen Actors Guild is received by Producer. Producer hereby authorizes television stations to make available to representatives of the Guild their station logs to verify the station plays of theatrical motion pictures. Regarding a possible system of coding product which appears on television, a joint Producer-Guild Committee will be established to consider any workable system when it is available, and such committee shall investigate and make recommendations, which will be given consideration by the Producers.
H.	Advances
A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in "worldwide total gross receipts" when a theatrical motion picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable."
(1)	Such theatrical motion picture is "available" when the first of the following occurs:
(a)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(b)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement
(2)	Such theatrical motion picture is "identifiable" when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market
-14-
(3)	The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(a)	the advance is for one theatrical motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(b)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in the "worldwide total gross receipts" for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "worldwide total gross receipts" which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If such theatrical motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Guild with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in "worldwide total gross receipts" no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
An advance received by a Producer’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
1.	Eavorgd Union-Clause
If, during the term of this Agreement, any union, through its collective bargaining agreement negotiated with the Producers, obtains an increase in its present percentage "participation of the gross" for television exhibition of theatrical motion pictures, then, in such event, the Union will be entitled to a comparable increase in the rates provided for in this Section.
J.	Release Without Exhibition
In the event the Producer actually receives payment for the release of a theatrical motion picture hereunder for exhibition on free television, the applicable fees provided hereunder shall be payable whether or not such motion picture is in fact exhibited on free television.
- J5-
This provision shall not apply in the case of a license of films when a picture is "dropped out" of such license.
K.	SAG shall not be entitled to payments hereunder with respect
to blocked foreign revenue except by transfer of blocked funds and then only if permission for such transfer can be obtained by SAG from local fiscal authorities. Blocked funds shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of "first in, first out," unless allocated to specific periods by local fiscal authorities. Allocation of unblocked funds, as between the revenue due hereunder and other revenue, shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local fiscal authorities. Accounting shall be on the basis of net funds remitted or converted to exportable properties.

The term "performer" means those persons covered by this Agreement and includes performers, professional singers, stunt performers, airplane and helicopter pilots, dancers,5 stunt coordinators6 and puppeteers, but excludes extra performers and body doubles. The provisions of this Section 5.2 shall not apply with respect to any performer in connection with use in Supplemental Markets if no part of the performer's performance is used in the film as released in Supplemental Markets.
B.	Distribution Formula
The amount received by Screen Actors Guild under the formula set forth in Paragraph A. above shall be distributed as follows:
Units will be assigned to performers entitled to participate as follows:
(1)	Time Units
With respect to each performer, units for time worked shall be computed as follows:
Each day = one-fifth (1/5) unit Each week = one (1) unit
No more than five (5) time units may be credited to any performer.
(2)	Salary Units
With respect to each performer, units for total compensation received from the film shall be credited as follows:
(a)	Day Performer: Each multiple of daily scale equals one-fifth (1/5) unit A fraction of daily scale when more than one-half (16) shall be credited as another one-fifth (1/5) unit.
5 Only dancers employed under Schedule J of thia Agreement are entitled to participate in Supplemental Markets monies.
• Stunt coordinators employed under thia Agreement are entitled to participate in Supplemental Markets monies. All compensation paid for stunt coordinating services and any other services covered by this Agreement shall be combined in calculating salary units under this provision.

(c)	No more than ten (10) salary units may be credited to any performer.
(3)	Computation
Each performer shall be credited with the sum of time and salary units as computed above, and each performer will receive that rateable proportion of the monies as the performer's number of units bears to the total number of units for the entire cast.
C.	With respect to such pictures made outside of the United States, when part of the cast is composed of performers subject to this Agreement and part of the cast of performers is not subject to this Agreement, then sums payable hereunder shall be prorated based on the proportion which the salaries and the time worked payable to the performers subject to this Agreement bear to the total performers' salaries and time worked for the picture. If records reflecting time worked are not reasonably available, then the aforementioned proration may be based on salaries alone.
D.	Definition of Supplemental Markets
The term "Supplemental Markets," as used in this Agreement, means: The exhibition of theatrical motion pictures by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection D.), or Pay Television, as those terms are hereafter defined in this subsection D.
(1)	Cassettes
For the purposes of this Section, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including, without limitation, cassette, cartridge, phonogram or other similar audio-visual device now known or hereafter devised, containing a theatrical motion picture (recorded on film, disc, tapes or other material) and designed for replay through a television receiver or comparable device. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a television receiver or comparable device in the home or in closed-circuit use, such as in hotel rooms, constitutes "Supplemental Markets" for the purposes of this provision, insofar as cassettes are concerned.
-19-
(2)	Pay Television
The term "pay television," as used in this Section, shall mean exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on a television screen by means of telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite to home or CATV, for which substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests:
(a)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
(b)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
(c)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
The term "pay television," as used in this Section, shall also include the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures through a television receiver or comparable device by means of a telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite or CATV for which the viewing audience (whether by the individual viewer or by the hotel, motel, hospital or other accommodation where the viewer is) pays to receive the program by making a separate payment for such specific program. Exhibition in theatres or comparable places by such means is theatrical exhibition and shall not be considered pay television.
The term "Supplemental Markets" does not include the exhibition of a theatrical motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition and, for this purpose, "theatrical exhibition” includes the educational market, the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on any commercial carrier (referred to herein as "in-ftight"), such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses, and other uses which have been traditionally considered
-20-
theatrical exhibition of theatrical motion pictures, other than the specific home use hereinabove defined as "Supplemental Markets" for cassettes.
'	Whenever reference is made in this Section to Pay
Television, such reference shall be deemed to include only those uses of theatrical motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the
' subscriber for the program viewed, or for which the subscriber has the option, by additional payment, to receive special programming over one or more special channels. When no program charge or special channel charge is made to the subscriber in addition to the general charge, the transmission of theatrical motion pictures by the CATV or television facility, including programming originated by die CATV or television facility, is free television exhibition for the purposes of this Agreement, and such exhibition shall not be considered Supplemental Markets exhibition.
The Producers have agreed to the inclusion of Pay Television in the "Supplemental Markets" because, under the present pattern of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, Pay Television is supplemental to the primary theatrical market. The Producers reserve the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that Pay Television is no longer a Supplemental Market but constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, and that therefore no additional payment should be made with respect to the release of theatrical motion pictures (including ' those covered by this Agreement) in said markets. Nothing herein shall limit the scope of negotiations on said subject.
' E.	Definition of Distributor’s Gross Receipts
(1)	In applying the formula set forth in subsection A. of Section 5.2, Distributor's gross receipts from the Supplemental Markets (if applicable) shall be included in the formula at one hundred percent (100%) of the Distributor's gross received from Supplemental Markets after June 30,1979.
(2)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Market fees due under this Section 5.2 arising from the distribution of theatrical motion pictures to "Pay Television," as defined above," the term "Distributor's gross receipts" shall mean the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by die Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit such picture on "pay television," as defined above; provided, however, that in the case of any such picture which is produced outside of the z United States, if such picture is subject to this Agreement and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor
-21 -
provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of such picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of such picture in Supplemental Markets, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in "Distributor's gross receipts" except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Producer or to the distributor of such picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
If the distributor of such picture does not distribute such picture directly in Supplemental Markets, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute such picture, then the "Distributor's gross receipts" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture in Supplemental Markets. In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights,, shall be the "Distributor’s gross receipts." If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Distributor's gross receipts." In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets or exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Union shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be allocated. If the outright sale includes Supplemental Markets distribution rights to more than one (1) motion picture, Producer shall likewise allocate to each such picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the Supplemental Market; and if the Union contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as provided herein. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each such picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only Supplemental Markets distribution rights in a single such picture shall be subject to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Producer to the Guild as having been received by tiie Producer on such outright sale
-22-
is less than the amount actually received by the Producer on such outright sale.
'	(3) For purposes of calculating Supplemental Markets fees
due under this Section 5.2, arising from the distribution of theatrical motion pictures on "cassettes,'1 as defined above, the term "Distributor's ' gross receipts" is defined as follows:
(a)	If the Producer is die Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Distributor's gross receipts" derived from die distribution of such picture by "cassettes" shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be "Distributor’s gross receipts." The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration and, in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence.
(b)	If the Distributor is not the Producer and is not owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Distributor's gross receipts" shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Producer from licensing the right to distribute such picture by
' cassette.
(c)	In the case of any such picture which is produced , outside of the United States, if such picture is subject to this Agreement and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or , distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of such picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of such picture in Supplemental Markets, then no monies from any such distribution in any foreign territory shall be included in "Distributor's gross receipts" except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Producer or to the distributor of such picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
(d)	In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or ' country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Distributor's gross receipts.” If any such outright sale shall include
-23-
Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Distributor's gross receipts." In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market vahie of Supplemental Markets or exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
(4)	The "Distributor's gross receipts," as that term is used herein, shall not include:
(a)	Sums realized or held by way of deposit as
security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
(b)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(c)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by tire Producer or such other distributor, but there shall not be excluded from "Distributor’s gross receipts" any net income tax, franchise tax, or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;
(d)	Frozen foreign currency until the Producer shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency or Producer or Distributor has the right to transmit to the United States to Producer or Distributor such foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs.
(5)	Such gross income realized in foreign currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars at the prevailing market rate of exchange at the close of such reporting period, except that when such gross income has actually been transmitted to the United States, it shall be deemed converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such foreign currency was actually so transmitted.
-24-
Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of "first-in, first-out," unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds, 7 as between revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder and other revenue shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities.
/
(6)	If any agreement for distribution on free television or (if applicable) in Supplemental Markets or for such foreign territorial sale includes more than one motion picture, the Producer shall allocate a portion of the monies payable under such agreement to each motion picture covered by such agreement. If any distribution agreement or foreign territorial sale agreement includes any two (2) or more of free television rights, Supplemental Markets rights and other rights, the Producer shall allocate a portion of the monies payable under such agreement to each of the rights covered by such agreement. Such allocations shall be for the purpose of determining payments due hereunder, shall be made in good faith and, if so made, shall be binding and conclusive for purposes of this Agreement. If the Union contends that such allocation has not been made in good faith, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration under Section 9 hereof.
For determination as to the proper allocation, the provisions of this Section 5.2 E.(6) shall not apply to any such agreement relating only to the free television exhibition rights or to ' Supplemental Markets rights in a single motion picture.
(7)	A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in / "Distributor’s gross receipts" when a theatrical motion picture subject to the Supplemental Markets provisions of this or any prior Codified Basic Agreement is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the
/ advance payment is "ascertainable."
(a)	Such theatrical motion picture is "available" when . the first of the following occurs:
(i)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(ii)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
'	Such theatrical motion picture is "identifiable"
when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a
-25-
given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
(b)	The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(i)	the advance is for one theatrical motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(ii)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in the "Distributor's gross receipts” for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "Distributor's gross receipts" which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If such theatrical motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Guild with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in "Distributor's gross receipts" no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
An advance received by a Producer's parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
F.	The provisions of this Section 5.2 shall not apply to the
exhibition in Supplemental Markets of trailers or advertising a motion picture by shots, etc., substantially in the nature of a trailer, subject to the limitations provided in Section 18 hereof.
G.	Time and Method of Payments
With respect to the initial payment due hereunder for Supplemental Markets use, such payment shall be due and payable within four (4) months after initial exhibition of such motion picture in Supplemental Markets.
-26-
All such payments hereunder shall be made by check, payable to the order of the performer entitled thereto, and delivered to the Union for forwarding to such performer. Producer shall make all ' Social Security, withholding, unemployment insurance and disability insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation provided for in this Section 5.2. Compliance herewith z shall constitute payment to the performer.
In the event Producer fails to pay such additional compensation within ten (10) days from the date of a notice in writing to Producer from the Union, a late payment penalty shall accrue at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of delinquency, except:
(1)	For motion pictures produced by Qualified Residual Payors, Qualified Distributors and Qualified Buyers, and motion pictures, the residuals for which are guaranteed or assumed by a Qualified Residual Payor, Qualified Distributor or Qualified Buyer. These motion pictures shall continue to be subject to the rules on payment of liquidated damages set forth in the 1995 Agreement;
(2)	For residuals payable in connection with the purchase of libraries. The Producer shall give notice to the Union in such cases. The Producer shall assist the Union in its endeavor to obtain compliance with any residual obligations which accrued prior to the date of the purchase. The Union shall cooperate with the Producer in furnishing
7 records or verifying previous payments to enable the Producer to begin making residual payments accruing on and after the date of the purchase as expeditiously as possible;
(3)	For performers omitted from the final cast list As to these performers, the Producer shall investigate and respond to a claim z from the Guild that a performer has been omitted from the cast list with a final position within thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of the claim from the Guild. If, as a result of its investigation, the Producer f determines that the performer is owed the residual payment, payment shall also be made within said thirty (30) day period. If payment is due and the Producer fails to pay within the thirty (30) day period, then late payment liquidated damages shall accrue as of the date of the original notice from the Guild initiating the claim.
(4)	In the event of bona fide disputes. In such event, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute provided that the Producer pays the undisputed amount on time.
'	In no event shall the total late payment penalty with respect
to any performer exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the amount owing to such performer.
-27-
The foregoing provisions shall not preclude the Producer from recovering an erroneous payment If there is a dispute over the amount due the performer, and Producer pays the undisputed amount on time, or if there is a bona fide dispute as to the Producer's liability therefor, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute.
H.	Effect of Performer's Individual Contract
When compensation is payable to any performer in connection with any such picture released in Supplemental Markets, pursuant to an individual contract between such performer and Producer, and such compensation is based, in whole or in part, upon a percentage of Producer’s gross receipts, then such percentage compensation may be credited against such performer's share of the monies pay able,by Producer to SAG hereunder or, on the other hand, such performer's share of the monies payable hereunder may be credited against the percentage compensation due under the performer's personal service contract, depending upon which such payment was made first. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any compensation payable to such performer under an individual contract when such compensation is a specified sum of money commonly known as a "deferment," as distinguished from a participation in the gross of a picture, may not be credited against the monies payable by Producer to SAG hereunder.
I.	Reporting
Producer shall furnish to the Guild with respect to each motion picture produced, covered under this Section 5.2, a complete cast list of actors covered by this Agreement including the name of each actor, Social Security number, type of employment contract, length of employment and the payments for Supplemental Markets use which will become payable to or for the account of each actor with respect to such motion picture. Such cast list shall be furnished to the Guild one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of principal photography or ninety (90) days after completion of each such motion picture, whichever is sooner. Producer will thereafter furnish a revised or final list when necessary.
Producer shall furnish to SAG written reports showing the gross receipts from the sale, lease, license and distribution of such picture in Supplemental Markets (whether distributed by the Producer or through another distributor) with respect to which the Producer is required to make payments hereunder. Such reports shall be furnished at least quarterly during each calendar year, except in the case of an outright sale. Concurrently with the furnishing of such report, the Producer shall pay the percentages due. Producer shall also make
■28'
available for inspection by SAG all distributors* statements delivered to Producer, insofar as they relate to such gross receipts. SAG shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer as to such gross receipts pertaining to such distribution of such pictures. Producer also agrees that any agreement entered into by it for the lease, license or distribution of any such pictures in Supplemental
' Markets shall contain a provision made expressly for the benefit of SAG and the performers involved in such pictures, by which such lessee, licensee or distributor agrees to assume and pay the percentage amounts payable hereunder to SAG when and as the same become due; and copies of all such provisions contained in such agreements, with a statement of the name and address of the Producer and the lessee, licensee or distributor and the date of execution, shall be delivered to SAG promptly upon the execution thereof.
An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this Section 5 shall not constitute a default by Producer hereunder, provided said failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Screen Actors Guild is received by Producer.
J.	Reopening Rights
If the member companies of the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers make a "better deal" with the Directors Guild of America, Inc. or the Writers Guild of America, west, Inc., with reference ' to payments for the release to "Supplemental Markets" of theatrical motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced prior to July 1,1971, the Union shall have the right to reopen this Agreement ' with respect to that subject (i.e., payment for the release of such theatrical motion pictures to the Supplemental Markets) or to accept the "better deal" on that subject. Any dispute as to whether or not a ,rbetter / deal" has been made on that subject with either of said Unions shall be subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 9 hereof. In the event that no agreement is reached in such negotiations within a period of thirty (30) , days after such reopening, either the Union or the Alliance, on behalf of all its members, may, upon a thirty (30) day written notice to the other party, terminate this Agreement.

If the Guild is required by legal process to disclose information obtained in a residuals audit, the Guild shall provide prompt written notice to the Producer to permit the Producer to object or to seek an appropriate protective order.
At the election of the Producer, die auditors and other Guild representatives shall be required to sign an agreement duplicating the confidentiality provisions in the preceding paragraphs of this Section, but without any modifications to these provisions unless consented to by the Guild.

If all or a portion of the exclusivity/hold/option money is creditable against the fee due for acting services and the option is exercised, the amount so creditable shall be applied toward the $200,000 ceiling on contributions, computed as above provided. If the exclusivity/hold/option money is not creditable against the fee due for acting services and the option is exercised, then up to one-half (!4) of the exclusivity/ hold/option money, not to exceed $20,000, shall be applied against the pension and health contribution ceiling.

If the performer's individual employment contract . contains a restriction on the number of theatrical pictures he may do in the period to which the restriction applies, then his total compensation
-95-
for such period divided by that number determines his gross compensation per picture.
If there is no limitation on the number of pictures the performer may be required to do in the current contract term, then his total compensation for such term divided by the number of pictures in which he actually performed determines his gross compensation per picture.
If, on the expiration of any contract term, the performer is engaged in performing services in a picture and the Producer does not extend such current contract term, but exercises an option for the succeeding term and completes the production of such picture during such succeeding term, them, for the purpose of computing gross compensation paid to the performer for such picture, all gross compensation paid to the performer during the period such services are rendered in the completion of such picture shall be deemed to have been paid the performer during such contract term, and such picture shall be deemed to have been completed during such current contract term.
If the performer does not perform in any theatrical picture during any contract term, then there is no ceiling with respect to such contract term.
In each instance in which a "contract term" is referred to in this subparagraph (2), the same shall be deemed to include all extensions thereof.

By the saee token, the provision was not intended, nor should Lt be construed, to expand the jurisdiction of the Screen Actors Guild over dialogue replacenent work.

Dear Ken:
/During the 1992 negotiations, the parties agreed that rehearsal would not trigger consecutive enploynent for perforator! employed on long-fom television progress or theatrical notion pictures provided certain conditions are net. One of those conditions is that the perforser be paid for rehearsal at the sane rate as for ^photography.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no implication should be drawn ' fros the parties' agreenent on this subject as to the propriety yof paying perfomers for rehearsal and photography at different rates. Both parties have expressly reserved their positions on that issue. The Guild's position is that rehearsal and photog-'.raphy nay not, consistent with the parties' collective bargaining agreenent, ba paid at different rates, while the Producers* posi-^tion is that the collective bargaining agreenent docs not require the sane rate of pay for rehearsal and photography and, further, that SAG has valved its position by its past conduct.

Dear Ken:
During the 1992 negotiations, the Screen Actors Solid and the AMPTP dlsagreed-on the Interpretation of Section 39 of the Basic Agreowoat. The parties ( agreed to retain Section 39 In the Basic Agreewent of 1992 without prejudice^ to the position of either party as to its Interpretation and as to whether that Section can bo lawfully Interpreted to restrict the Build's bargaining rights and obligations.
The AMPTP agrees in concept that Section 39 will not be Interpreted nor applied to preclude SAG free continuing its past practice of negotiating with independent producers as to various forws of security and lions for the pay-^ went of direct compensation, fringe benefits and residuals. The AMPTP Uka-f wise agrees tn concept that Section 39 will not be Interpreted to prevent SAu from refusing to enter Into an agroewont with an independent producer, the principal(s) of which is (are) also the principal(s) of any fonaer or existing entity which 1s delinquent in its obligations under any SAG Codified Basic r Agreewont for wages, fringe benefits or residuals.
SAG and the AMPTP agree that precise language reflecting the foregoing understandings will be drawn up by a Joint SAG-AIVTP legal Coanittoo, following a, thorough review of the issues involved. That language will be included in c sidolettor to be attached to the Basic Agreewont.	<

Dear Ken:
As part of the recant Her 3 negotiations which established ten and conditions. > euploywont for stunt coordinators, the Screen Actors Guild and the Producers represented fey the ARPTP agreed upon certain now rules for the reuse of stunt footage. Ono area In which the parties More enable to reach agrocant relates to the rour'"''f stunt footage In coanorclals which pronto a notion picture In conjunction with, different product.
In the course of those discussions, the Producers expressed the view that the rem of stunt footage In such ccMsrclals advertises or exploits the notion picture , therefore, can be done without negotiation with or paynont to the stunt perfornk^) appearing therein.
The Screen Actors Guild took the position that such rouses nay, under sone clrcr" > stances, advertise or exploit the notion picture within the rnaning of Section . J the Codified Basic Agreenent or Section 36 of the Screen Actors Guild Television Agreenent, but do not Invariably do so. Whether or not the reuse so advertises or exploits the notion picture will depend upon all of the facts and circunstancesx-~x surrounding the reuse in the context of the cnunorrlal. In the Guild's view, r ) reuse does not so advertise or exploit the notion picture, the Producer is oblig^ ✓ to pay the applicable coMorcial session fee and residuals.
Because the parties were unable to reach agreenent on the appropriate treatment/' stunt footage reused in this nnnner, each of us has agreed to enter into this s. , letter for the purpose of reserving our respective positions on this issue. If two foregoing coaports with your understanding, please so Indicate by executing this sidolettor in the space below reserved for your signature.

Re: Staffing of Stunt Coordinator!
Dear Ken:
s Reference Is made to our agreement relating to stunt coordinators. The sub-z ject of staffing of stunt coordinators 1s addressed In our agreenent by the
following language:
. the addition of the stunt coordinator classification to those covered under the Agreements Is not Intended, nor shall 1t bo construed, either to require the employment of stunt coordinators under the Agreements tn circumstances In which persons other than stunt coordinators are presently or have heretofore performed the functions of stunt coordinators nor to diminish the employment of stunt coordinators by assigning stunt coordinating work to persons In positions In which such work has not customarily been performed.*
This sideletter Is entered Into for the purpose of setting forth the background underlying the parties* agreement on this subject and providing a context for application of the foregoing language.
During the course of the parties* discussions on this subject, the Producers refused to agree to a mandatory staffing provision, citing a nimber of situa-- tlons In which duties which might be associated with stunt coordinators had been performed by others. By way of example, the Producers pointed out that z athletic coaches and Instructors (e.g., football and hockey coaches, fencing instructors), horse trainers, race car experts, martial arts Instructors and coordinators of aerial sequences, among others, had heretofore been utilized tn Heu of stunt coordinators. The Producers also indicated that stunt coor-/ dinators had not been utilized for certain stunts in which the stunt performers themselves did whatever coordination work was necessary (e.g., two stunt performers engaged In a fight; stunt performer who falls down, etc.) nor In ~ situations in which a member of the production staff with prior experience in
Sideletter No, 15 - Page 149
Sidelettcr No. 15 Page Two
coordinating stunts, such as a Diractor, Second Unit Director, Unit Producto Manager or Assistant Director, was assigned responsibility for coordinating the stunt.
The Producers further stated that they desired to continue their practice o^ j hiring such persons without treating then as stunt coordinators. In adopting the above-quoted language, the Guild and the Producers acknowledged such practices and agreed that the Producers would not be required to engage stunt coordinators in situations such as those described In the foregoing axaaple

Re:	Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via the Internet
Dear Peter:
This Sideletter confirms the understanding of tbe Screen Actors Guild ("the Guild") and die . Producers (collectively "the parties") concerning the application of the 2005 Producer-Screer^ Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement and Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement to the
exhibition of covered theatrical motion pictures, tbe principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1,1971, and covered television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 20,1952, on or by means of the Internet or other similar delivery systems ("Internet").
1. License for Limited Period or Fixed Number of Exhibitions. When the subscriber pay^X for the program either on a subscription or per-picture basis, and when the payment is in exchange for the right to view tbe motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or a fixed number of exhibitions, die Producer shall pay to die performers) an aggregate sum equal to three and six-tenths percent (3.6%) of die license fee paid by the licensee for thc^\ right to exhibit such picture on tbe Internet.*	'
When the Producer's receipts from the licensing of such exhibition are received from an entity which acts as the exhibitor and in which tbe Producer has a financial interest, the reasonableness of the fee received by the Producer from the licensing of such exhibition
As bargaining history, this language is based upon die following model: studio licenses to Moviefly the right to transmit die motion picture on the Internet to die viewer who pays Moviefly on a subscription or per-picture basis. Such payment would enable the viewer to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time limited number of exhibitions. For example, if Columbia Pictures, through Cohimbia-TriStar Home Entertainme^ y licenses to Moviefly the right to exhibit a Columbia Pictures film, the residuals shall be based upon 100% of the license fee paid by Moviefly to Coiumbia-TriStar Home Entertainment for such picture.

\ y shall be determined by the exhibitor's license fee payments to unrelated entities for comparable motion pictures.
x The parties agree that the residuals due to performers under this paragraph 1 shall be y payable in the same manner and to the same extent as applicable to pay television and pay-per-view as provided in the following provisions in the Codified Basic Agreement or
x Television Agreement, as applicable (subject to conforming changes as necessary):
Z * Sections 5.2.E.(4Xd), 5.2.E.(5) and 5.2.E.(7) of the Codified Basic Agreement and Sections 2O.(bX3)d) and 2O.(bX5) of the Television Agreement (with respect "	to supplemental markets exhibition of motion pictures, foe principal photography
y	of which commenced after 7/1/52, but prior to 7/21/80) (foreign receipts and non-

Section 21 of the Television Agreement (financial responsibility); and
■ Section 5.1. of the Codified Basic Agreement (supplemental markets distribution x	of motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced after 6/30/71

y	forth above.
2. Other Exhibitions. For all other Internet-transmitted exhibitions ("other exhibitions"), including a sale or license of the right to view the motion picture for an unlimited time, the ■ J parties acknowledge that the markets for such other exhibitions are evolving, and that the
basis for payment of residuals shall be determined at a later time. Accordingly, in the event the AMPTP negotiates a residual formula with the DGA with respect to other exhibitions of covered motion pictures, either: (a) the Guild shall have the right to elect the entire

agreement reached with the DGA with respect to the licensing of such other exhibitions, a^ y only such entire agreement, but with appropriate equivalent adjustment for performers for provisions peculiar to directors; or (b) alternatively, the Guild may reopen this agreement as to such other exhibitions on or after December 1,2002.
The parties reserve all of their respective legal positions with respect to such other exhibitions.
With respect to theatrical and television motion pictures, the Producer has agreed to a separate payment for this use on the Internet because Internet exhibition is at this time outside the primary market The Producer reserves the right in future negotiations to < contend that the pattern of release has changed so that this use constitutes or is apart of th^ J primary market of distribution of theatrical or television motion pictures, and that therefore, no additional payment pursuant hereto should be made with respect to the exhibition of theatrical or television motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) on thc<~''' Internet The Guild reserves the right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and^> further to assert that regardless of whether other exhibitions are or have become part of the primary market, payment provisions for performers employed on motion pictures so	.
exhibited should be improved.

Issues of security and access should be discussed. The Guild agrees to discuss	J

-182-
Schedule A
intervening time, if at the time of performer's original employment, performer is given a firm start date for such subsequent call. Performers engaged by the day on episodic television series (including pilots) at a salary of at least two (2) times the day performer minimum may be recalled once without payment for the intervening time if, at the time of performer's original employment, performer is given a firm start date for
7 such subsequent call. (The preceding sentence shall not apply to any performer who meets the definition of a "major role performer.")
'	With respect to any performer recalled by Producer as a
freelance performer, Producer and performer may agree that performer shall be recalled on or after such recall date. For purposes of this
/ provision, "on or after" shall mean the time on the date specified or a time within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter.

If, within fourteen (14) days10 after termination of performer's engagement, Producer recalls performer for any purpose other than those s hereinafter in Section 28 referred to, the performer's compensation shall nevertheless be paid for the intervening period between the date of such earlier termination and the date of recall; provided, however, that if at any time when the Producer attempts to recall the performer, the y performer is ill or otherwise incapacitated, or is employed, or is committed to other employment, or for any other reason is unavailable, then the Producer's obligation to pay compensation for such intervening ' time shall terminate when the Producer so attempts to recall the performer. Furthermore, if, during such intervening period, the performer is ill or otherwise incapacitated or employed, no
/ compensation shall accrue to the performer during such period of illness, incapacity or employment. With respect to day performers, if a firm date for recall is not given and if the performer is recalled subsequent to / fourteen (14) days10 after termination, compensation shall be paid to the performer for the intervening period between the date of such earlier termination and the date of recall. The Producer shall be entitled to
z avoid payment for intervening time with respect to a recall subsequent to two (2) weeks after earlier termination only once for the same performer in the same photoplay.
IU With respect to domestic production of theatrical motion pictures and features made primarily for first exhibition on television. this period shall be ten (10) days.
- 183 -
Schedule A
apply:
The foregoing consecutive employment provisions do not
(1)	to body doubles, except that body doubles shall be paid for intervening days on an overnight location when required to remain at such location by the Producer;
(2)	to days off during a break of up to two (2) weeks, which break includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays;
(3)	to performers employed on more than one part of a multi-part closed-end series in connection with a day (or days) intervening between workdays on one part for which the performer is otherwise employed or paid for work on another part of the multi-part closed-end series;
(4)	to performers employed to perform voice-over work on animated theatrical motion pictures. The Producers shall continue the current practice of accommodating the schedules of those performers;
(5)	to performers employed on more than one episode of a series for days intervening between workdays on one episode for which the performer is otherwise employed or paid for work on another episode of the series. In no event will die application of this subparagraph (5) reduce the guarantee of employment for either episode.
The application of this exception is reflected in the following examples:
(a)	Application to Day Performers
(i)	Suppose that a performer employed by the day works on both Episode 1 and Episode 2 of a series on Monday and Wednesday and is off on Tuesday.
		Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Friday	PERFORMER RECEIVES
Episode 1	Daily	Wort	Hold	Wort			3 Days
Episode 2	Daily	Work	T11J 1JUIU	Wort			2 Days
Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would be paid for Tuesday on Episode 1, as a day intervening between work days, but would not be paid for Tuesday on Episode 2 since, even though it is an intervening day
-184-
Schedule A
between workdays, the performer is otherwise being paid for that day on another episode of the series.
Thus, the performer would receive three (3) days of pay for Episode 1 and two (2) days of pay for Episode 2, for a total of five (5) days of pay.
(ii)	Suppose that a performer employed by the day works on Episode 1 on Monday and Wednesday, and works on Episode 2 of the same series on Tuesday and Wednesday.
		Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Friday	PERFORMER RECEIVES
Episode 1	Daily	Work	Hold	Work			2 Days
Episode 2	Daily		Work	Work			2 Days
Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would not be paid on Episode 1 for Tuesday, even though it is an intervening day between workdays, because he is otherwise being paid for that day on Episode 2.
Thus, the performer would receive two (2) days of pay for Episode 1 and two (2) days of pay for Episode 2, for a total of four (4) days of pay.
(b)	Application to Performers Employed on Both a Daily and Weekly Basis on Different Episodes of a Series
(i)	Suppose that a performer is employed on a weekly basis on Episode 1 and on a daily basis on Episode 2. The performer works Monday through Wednesday and on Friday on Episode 1 and works on Thursday on Episode 2.
		Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Friday	PERFORMER RECEIVES
Episode 1	Weekly	Work	Work	Work	Hold	Work	1 Week
Episode 2	Daily				Work		1 Day
Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would be paid for Thursday on Episode 1, even though he is otherwise being paid for that day on Episode 2, because failure to do so would reduce the minimum guarantee of employment (/. e., one (1) week) on Episode I.
- 185 -
Schedule A
Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) day of pay for Episode 2, for a total of six (6) days of pay.
(ii)	Suppose that a performer is employed on a weekly basis on Episode 1 and on a daily basis on Episode 2. The performer works Monday through Friday on Episode 1 and works on Tuesday and Thursday on Episode 2.
		Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Friday	PERFORMER RECEIVES
Episode 1	Weekly	Work	Work	Work	Work	Work	1 Week
Episode 2	Daily		Work	Hold	Work		2 Days
Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would not be paid for Wednesday on Episode 2, since he is otherwise employed on that day on Episode 1.
Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (5 (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and two (2) days of pay for Episode 2, for a total of seven (7) days of pay.
(iii)	Suppose a performer is employed on a daily basis on Episode 1 and on a weekly basis on Episode 2. The performer works on Monday and Friday on Episode 1, and works on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on Episode 2. The performer is off on Tuesday.
		Monday	Tuesday	Wednesday	Thursday	Friday	PERFORMER RECEIVES
Episode 1	Daily	Work	i a_t j HULU	HoM	HoM	Work	2 Days
Episode 2	Weekly	Work	Hold	Work	Work	Work	1 Week
Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would not be paid for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday on Episode 1 because he is being paid for Tuesday on Episode 2 as part of his weekly guarantee, and he is otherwise employed on Episode 2 on Wednesday and Thursday.
Thus, the performer would receive two (2) days of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 2, for a total of seven (7) days of pay.
(6)	to a "major role" performer for days intervening between overnight location work and days worked during a "major role"
- 186-
Schcdulc A
engagement when the "major role" performer is employed either prior to or after completion of his/her "major role" engagement on out-of-sequence photography on an overnight location for the same series, provided that the following conditions are met:
(a)	Overnight Location Work Following the Performer's "Major Role" Engagement
(i)	The "major role" performer must be paid
his/her entire "major role" guarantee at the time of the "major role" engagement. Additional overnight location days shall be paid pro rata based on the performer's "major role" guarantee.
(ii)	At the time of the engagement, Producer may give performer an "on or about" start date for the overnight location work, in which case the performer shall make himself/herself available for work on the "on or about" date. "On or about," as used herein, shall allow a latitude of twenty-four (24) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, either prior to or after the date specified in the contract, as the commencement date of the overnight location work.
If the performer is not given an "on or about" date at the time of the engagement, then the additional day(s) for the overnight location work shall be subject to the performer's professional availability.
(iii)	Except as specified herein, Schedule A terms shall be applicable to the overnight location work.
(b)	Overnight Location Work Prior to Performer’s "M^jor Role" Engagement
(i)	The performer shall be paid not less than pro rata based on his/her major role guarantee for the overnight location work. Such overnight location day(s) shall be paid separate and apart from the performer's major role guarantee.
(ii)	Producer may give performer an "on or about" date for the overnight location work at the time of engagement, and the performer shall make himself/herself available for work on the "on or about” date. "On or about," as used herein, shall allow a latitude of twenty-four (24) hours, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, either prior to or after the date specified in the contract, as the commencement date of the overnight location work. If the performer is not given an "on or about" date at the time of the engagement, then the additional day(s) for the overnight location work shall be subject to the
- 187-
Schedule A
performer's professional availability. In no event shall fewer than five (5) days intervene between the conclusion of the overnight location work and the start of the performer’s "major role" engagement.
(iii)	Except as specified herein, Schedule A terms shall be applicable to the overnight location work.
B.	Neither tests, auditions, fittings, publicity stills, pre-production stills, nor pre-recordings, after employment but before the starting date of such employment, shall start the consecutive days of employment of day performers.
Rehearsal shall not start the consecutive days of employment under the circumstances described in Section 21.E. of this Schedule A.
7.	CONVERSION TO WEEKLY BASIS
At any time whatsoever, either before or after the day performer commences work, the Producer shall have the option of converting such engagement to a weekly engagement on the terms specified in the Screen Actors Guild Minimum Contract for Freelance Performers, at the weekly salary specified at the time the engagement was entered into if such a weekly salary was so specified. Such conversion may be made at any time, but shall be effective only for a period commencing with the effective date of the notice of conversion. Notice of conversion by the Producer must be in writing and may be given to the performer personally or by telegraphing or mailing the same to the address furnished the Producer by the performer. If the notice is delivered personally to the performer by noon, or if a telegraphic notice is delivered to the telegraph office by noon, the date notice is delivered to performer shall be deemed the first day of the performer’s weekly engagement. However, the performer shall be paid for such day, including overtime, as a day performer. If notice is delivered personally to the performer or to the telegraph office after noon or, if sent by mail, the conversion to a weekly engagement shall not be effective until the performer’s next workday. Overtime hours on the day of conversion shall not count towards weekly overtime hours.
8.	HOURS PER DAY
The salary agreed upon shall be compensation in full to the day performer for eight (8) hours of work, but such compensation, if otherwise due, shall be paid to the performer even though eight (8) hours of work is not required of the performer by the Producer.
-188-
Schedule A
If the performer is working at midnight of any day, then his hours of work for such day shall be computed until the performer has been dismissed subsequent to midnight, subject to all exceptions and deductions provided for in this Schedule. Hours of work for the following day shall, except as otherwise provided in this Schedule, be computed from the time die performer, after having been so dismissed subsequent to midnight, is required to and does report.
9.
QYEK


A.	A day performer shall receive time and one-half for the ninth z and tenth hours of work time, and double time thereafter, except that day performers receiving more than two (2) times the day performer minimum rate per day shall receive time and one-half instead of double / time after the tenth hour. For the purposes of such calculations, the maximum daily rate shall be two (2) times the day performer minimum rate.
B.	To illustrate the application of the foregoing:
z	A day performer receiving $716.00 per day (the applicable
day performer rate as of 10/1/05) is called for make-up, hairdress, or wardrobe at 7:30 a.m. He spends one (1) hour in such activities. He waits thirty (30) minutes, and his call on the set is 9:00 a.m. He works until 1:00 p.m., and is off an hour for lunch. He works again from 2:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. No time is spent in traveling. His overtime pay is calculated as follows:
Total continuous day............. 11 hours
Overtime.......................... 3	hours
Pay for overtime
(1)	Two hours at time and one-half..... $268.50
(2)	One hour at double time............	179.00
Total overtime......................... $447.50
C.	Overtime pay for day performers shall be computed on the
basis of one-tenth (1/10) hour units. To the extent that any overtime of any day performer is caused by travel time, whether at the beginning or at the end of the day, pay for such overtime shall be computed and paid pursuant to the provisions of Section 32 relating to travel time.
D.	Whenever a performer receives overtime or an additional day of pay pursuant to the provisions of this Schedule, such overtime or
- 189-
Scbedule A
additional day of pay shall not be deemed to reduce such performer’s guaranteed employment or compensation.
10.	REST PERIOD
A.	Twelve (12) Hour Rest Period
The performer shall be entitled to a twelve (12) hour consecutive rest period from the tune he is finally dismissed until his first call thereafter, whether for make-up, wardrobe, hairdress or any other purpose. However, for a performer employed on an overnight location on a theatrical motion picture, the rest period may be reduced to eleven (11) hours on any two (2) non-consecutive days in an overnight location workweek.
B.	Thirty-Six (36) Hour Rest Period
The performer shall be entitled to one rest period in each week of thirty-six (36) consecutive hours; provided, however, that if ihe performer is not required to work on the twenty-four (24) hours constituting the first day of any workweek and has not worked for Producer during the twelve (12) hours immediately preceding such day, or if the performer is not required to work on the twenty-four (24) hours constituting the last day of any workweek and does not work for the Producer during the twelve (12) hours immediately succeeding such day, then the thirty-six (36) hour rest period requirement shall be satisfied regardless of foe fact that twelve (12) hours thereof may be in foe preceding or succeeding week. When foe performer works on seven (7) days in any week and is paid, in addition to his base pay, an extra day of pay therefor, the performer need not be given a thirty-six (36) hour rest period for such week, but must continue to receive his twelve (12) hour rest periods.
C.	Fifty-Six (561 Hour Rest Period
When the performer is given two (2) consecutive days off during a studio workweek, foe thirty-six (36) consecutive hour rest period shall be increased to fifty-six (56) consecutive hours. However, when there is night shooting consisting primarily of exterior photography and the performer's call is not earlier than 3:00 p.m. and he is dismissed in foe studio at or before midnight on foe fifth day of foe designated studio workweek, such fifty-six (56) hour rest period, if otherwise applicable, may be reduced to fifty-four (54) hours.
- 190-
Schedule A
In lieu of tiie fifty-six (56) hour rest period, the performer may be given a fifty-four (54) hour rest period when the call time for the first day of the new workweek following the rest period is not earlier than 6:00 a.m.
D.	The above provisions regarding the rest period shall be subject to the following exceptions:
(1)	When the Producer is photographing on a location other than an overnight location, the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period may be reduced to ten (10) hours if exterior photography is required on such location on tiie day before and tiie day after such reduced rest period. When such reduction is allowed on any day by reason of exterior photography on a nearby location, it may not be again allowed until after three (3) consecutive days have intervened.
(2)	When a performer arrives at his place of lodging on an overnight location after 9:00 p.m. and does not work that night, the rest period with respect to the first call following such arrival may be ten (10) hours instead of eleven (11) or twelve (12) hours, but the first call must be at the place of lodging.
(3)	When more than one (1) night of travel (by ordinary means of transportation) is required to reach a location and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train for each night of traveling, the time spent in such traveling, to or from such location, shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period.
(4)	When an overnight trip to or from a location is required, and the same takes at least seven (7) hours to reach, and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train, or if the performer elects to travel by first-class plane accommodations, the time spent in such traveling to or from such location shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period.
(5)	The first call at the lodging for work (including makeup, hairdress, wardrobe or travel) determines the time of first call for the next day for the purpose of computing the rest period.
E.	The performer may waive the rest period without the Union's consent, but if he does so, he shall be entitled to one (1) day of pay, or $900, whichever is the lesser sum. The performer may be required to waive the rest period if the violation, in case of the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period, is not over two and one-half (2l/z) hours, or on an overnight location not over two (2) hours. The performer may, in any
-191 -
Schedule A
case, be required to waive the thirty-six (36) hour rest period. The above payment of one (1) day of pay or $900, whichever is the lesser sum, shall be automatically incurred in any case in which the performer waives either rest period. The payment may not be waived without the consent of the Union.
F.	Whenever it is provided in this Schedule that there shall be no compounding of any premium pay and the payment for breach of the thirty-six (36) hour rest period, it is expressly understood that the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period between calls, and the payment for violation thereof, remains in effect.
G.	Any performer who is required to travel by air in excess of four (4) scheduled hours to a location may not be called for work without a ten (10) hour rest period. The ten (10) hour rest period shall commence from the time of arrival at the hotel, provided the performer goes directly to the hotel designated by the Producer. Failure to provide such ten (10) hours constitutes a rest period violation.
11.	MAKE-UP. HAIRDRESS. WARDROBE
A.	The Producer may require any performer to report made up, with hairdress, and in wardrobe, without assistance from the Producer and, in such case, any time spent by the performer therein prior to the performer's first call shall not be work time for any purpose, but the Producer may not have the performer do any such preparation at any place designated by the Producer.
Any performer to whom Producer supplies the services of a make-up artist for make-up, or hairdresser for hairdressing, shall be considered to have a call for make-up or hairdress, as the case may be, and the time so spent shall be work time.
The mere fact that a dressing room is furnished the performer, to which he is not directed to report, is not a designation of a place for preparation. In the case of wardrobe, for this Section to apply, the performer must be either allowed to take home the wardrobe or must be furnished a dressing room and the wardrobe must be available to the performer in the dressing room. Any call by the Producer for make-up, hairdress or wardrobe is a call to work and not within the exception made within this Section.
B.	When the performer has reported pursuant to the direction of Producer for make-up, hairdress or wardrobe, the time so spent shall be work time. When other than ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe
-192-
Schedule A
requires assistance in the removal thereof, such removal time shall be work time.
When performer is not otherwise on compensable work time, performer shall be compensated for up to fifteen (15) minutes of time spent in the removal of ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe at the applicable overtime rate. Such compensation shall be based on actual time and shall not trigger additional hourly increments of pay. Such removal time shall not be considered in computing rest period violations or other premiums or penalties.
C- If any special hairdress necessitating an expenditure is required by Producer, Producer shall either furnish such hairdress or Producer may designate facilities for the procurement of such hairdress and reimburse performer for amounts expended.
D.	When performer supplies his or her own wardrobe at the request of Producer, Producer shall pay, as a cleaning allowance and reimbursement, the following amounts:
Formal wear	$ 17.00
All other wardrobe (per outfit) 11.50
Payment of the foregoing cleaning allowance and reimbursement shall be made at the same time as payment for performer’s services for such week and shall be separately identified. Such wardrobe allowance shall be paid to performer for each calendar week in which the performer is employed on the production.
Wardrobe supplied by the performer, which is damaged in the course of employment, shall either be repaired by Producer, or repaired at the expense of Producer at the facilities designated by Producer, provided that notice of such damage is given to Producer prior to the termination of the performer’s employment.
Producer will supply performer with a copy of a wardrobe allowance voucher indicating the number of outfits provided to Producer, which voucher shall be supplied whenever he or she is signed off each week.
E.	There shall be a voucher provided at all wardrobe fittings to be signed by the performer indicating time in and time out.

12.	WORK TIME - DEFINITION AND EXCE1
S

A.	For the purpose of ascertaining and computing hours of work, the rest period and overtime, the period from the time the performer is required to and does report, as directed, until the time such performer is finally dismissed for the day, shall constitute work time, continuously and without interruption, except as follows:

25.	WEATHER-PERMITTING CALLS
Weather-permitting calls are allowable for day performers subject to the following limitations and conditions:
A.	Weather-permitting calls to day performers receiving $750 per day or less shall not be issued for stages in studios. The Union has heretofore, upon request, issued waivers permitting the giving of weather-permitting calls for work on certain stages, such as the so-called "Phantom Stage" at Universal City Studios where rain, wind or hail rendered sound recording unusable. Similarly, waivers have been granted authorizing weather-permitting calls when caused by fog, wind, rain or hail on uncovered, tarpaulin-covered or open structures. It is agreed that weather-permitting calls within the limits provided by this Agreement may be given to performers on such or similar stages and on open or uncovered structures where the making of usable sound track is rendered impossible because of rain, wind or hail, or where usable photography on an uncovered structure is rendered impossible by fog, wind, rain or hail. Disputes which may arise hereunder are subject to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
B.	A day performer receiving $750 per day or less shall be paid a half C/z) check upon the cancellation of any weather-permitting call. This check shall entitle the Producer to hold the day performer for not
-205-
Schedule A
exceeding four (4) hours. The day performer shall receive a half 04) check for each additional four (4) hours, or portion thereof, during which he is held by the Producer. During this waiting period, the Producer has the privilege of putting day performers into costumes, rehearsing or making other use of their services. If, however, any recording or photographing is done, whether still pictures or otherwise, the day performer shall be paid the agreed daily wage.
C.	Weather-permitting calls may not be issued to a day performer after the commencement of his photography, and the fact that a weather-permitting call or calls have been issued before the commencement of photography shall not cause the continuous employment provisions of day performer rules to come into effect "Photography," as used herein, does not refer to such photographing as is referred to in Section 28 hereof.
26.	SCRIPT LINES
A.	The Producer agrees that all script line parts shall be played by performers hired directly, and not by background actors adjusted on the set, except when a performer has been hired to play the part and for any reason is unavailable or unable to portray the part properly.
Except as above provided, no background actor hired as such may be employed for script lines on location; and no background actor hired as such may be employed for script lines for work at the studio on the same day as the day on which he was employed as a background actor.
Non-script lines are defined as lines which are not preplanned or preconceived and which are not deliberately omitted for tiie purpose of evading these provisions.
B.	A background actor hired as such may speak non-script lines,
in which case the background actor shall be signed off as a background actor and employed as a day performer. The performer so adjusted may be closed and signed off as a day performer and be re-employed in the same photoplay to perform background actor work, but not in the same part for which he was adjusted. If such a person is again adjusted to perform day performer services in a different part in the same photoplay, he shall not be entitled to continuous or consecutive days of employment between the time when he is first signed off as a day performer and the time when he is again adjusted. If a background actor has been adjusted to perform day performer work, the Producer may retake the scene with a different day performer, without any penalty for failure to recall such
-206-
Schcdule A
background actor. A background actor adjusted for non-script lines shall not be entitled to day performer pay for any day or days before he was adjusted.
C.	The compensation due for the day to a performer hired as a background actor, whether by the day or the week, and adjusted for day performer work, including services as a background actor and as a day performer shall be computed as follows:
(1)	He shall receive his full day of pay as a background actor.
(2)	In addition thereto, he shall receive his full day of pay as a day performer.
'	(3) The Producer shall be entitled to a credit against the
sum payable under (2) of that portion of the sum payable under (1) as represents the part of the day from and after the time the performer is y signed off as a background actor, computed in units of tenths of an hour.
Overtime, if any, shall commence to accrue after the performer so adjusted has rendered eight (8) hours of work as a day performer.
To illustrate the application of the foregoing rule:
A background actor starts work at 9:00 a.m. and works until 10:07 a.m. At 10:07 a.m., he is signed off as a background actor and employed as a day performer. He thereafter works seven and one-half (7 !4) hours as a day performer. Under subparagraph (1), he receives eight (8) hours of pay as a background actor; under subparagraph (2), he receives eight (8) hours of pay as a day performer; under subparagraph (3), the Producer is entitled to a credit of six (6) hours and forty-eight (48) minutes pay at his background actor rate. Assume the performer's / background actor rate is $122.00 per day (the applicable rate for the period 7/1/05 through 6/30/06) and his day performer rate is $716.00 (the applicable rate for the period 10/1/05 through 6/30/06); the
/ performer would receive $734.30.
z 27. STUNT ADJUSTMENT
Unless otherwise bargained for at the time of his engagement, a day performer shall receive ah adjustment of an additional applicable ' daily stunt performer's minimum on any day on which he performs a stunt. In no event shall the day performer ever receive less than the stunt
-207-
Schedule A
performer's day minimum on the day the performer does the stunt Overtime compensation on such day shall be based on the performer’s aggregate compensation for such day.
28.	RETAKES. ADDED SCENES, LOOPING, ETC.
A.	As an exception to the consecutive employment requirements
of Section 6 hereof, compensation for services in connection with retakes, added scenes, sound track, process shots, transparencies, trick shots, trailers, changes and foreign versions shall be paid to the day performer only for the days on which the performer is actually so employed. If such services are commenced within four (4) months (six (6) months for theatrical motion pictures, pilots or long-form television motion pictures (including multi-part, closed-end series)) after the prior termination of employment, compensation therefor shall be at the daily rate originally agreed upon, except in case of conversion to the weekly basis, in which latter event the compensation shall be prorated on the weekly rate originally agreed upon.
Performer may be recalled to loop (record sound track) after completion of principal photography at one-half (’/z) of the performer's pro rata daily salary for a four (4) hour looping session. If the session exceeds four (4) hours, a foil day of pro rata salary shall be payable.
The Producer may bargain with any day performer earning $5,000 or more per day to include one (1) prepaid looping day in his compensation. The performer’s employment contract shall contain a separate provision to that effect and a box must be provided next to the prepayment provision for the performer to initial to indicate acceptance.
B.	Close-ups
The Union will freely grant waivers of continuous employment for the making of close-ups made after the completion of the Director's first rough cut of the photoplay, so that the performer shall be paid only for the day or days upon which he renders such services.
29.	OVERLAPPING ENGAGEMENT

-208-
Schedule A
(1)	because of any unanticipated delay in production or bona fide mistake, or
(2)	because of any failure of such performer to disclose his other engagements at the time of accepting any engagement, or
(3)	when, as an accommodation to such performer, such performer is permitted to work currently in two pictures,
it is agreed as follows: For any day or days on which such performer 'enders his services for the Producer of the picture in which he has first rendered his service, he shall receive compensation from such first Voducer. For any day or days on which such performer renders services ar the Producer of the second picture in which he has rendered his
'services, he shall be compensated by the Producer of such second
> picture. For any day or days on which the performer does not render his services either for the first Producer or for the second Producer, he shall
. be compensated by the second Producer, unless the first and second Producers agree between themselves (and notice thereof is given to the performer) that compensation for such additional day or days shall be
, paid by the first Producer. The compensation to be paid by the first Producer shall be paid at the rate specified in the performer's contract with the first Producer, and the compensation to be paid by the second Producer shall be at the rate specified in the performer's contract with the second Producer; provided, however, that if the rate paid by the first Producer is less than the rate specified in the performer's contract with the second Producer, the difference shall be paid by the second Producer and, provided further, that for any day or days on which the performer does not render services either for the first or for the second Producer, he shall be compensated at the rate of compensation which is the higher of the two. This paragraph does not affect such performer’s right to receive compensation from both Producers when the performer, while employed by one Producer, makes retakes, added scenes, etc., for the other Producer after the expiration of his term of employment with such other
' Producer, in any case in which the performer is otherwise entitled thereto. Nothing in this paragraph contained shall be deemed or construed in any way to limit or prejudice any right or remedy of any z Producer, either with respect to any of the contingencies hereinbefore specified or otherwise. A freelance performer may be required to state on his contract the starting date of his next engagement, by inserting such date in the following statement, which may be endorsed or printed on such contracts:
"The starting date of the performer's next engagement is."

Any day performer living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is outside such area when he is recalled by the Producer for any of the purposes specified in Section 28 hereof (including performers who are entitled to the provisions of the following paragraph), shall be provided with transportation or reimbursed for the cost of transportation only, from the place where he is when recalled to the place designated by the Producer, by the particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the performer may actually use. Return transportation shall be furnished or the performer shall be reimbursed for such return transportation, as above set forth, only if the performer shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
Any day performer living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is at a place beyond a radius of one hundred fifty (150) miles from the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega, Los Angeles, California, when he is recalled by Producer for any of the aforesaid reasons, shall be placed on salary as of the day he is directed to z and does report to the place designated by Producer, and shall remain on salary each day until dismissed, except for the provisions relating to seventh days in the workweek and holidays. If, after dismissal, the performer remains in this locality or delays his return, unless by the Producer’s request, and is again recalled by the Producer, he shall not be entitled to any payment for the time intervening between his dismissal
-211 -
Schedule A
and his recall. The performer shall be entitled to travel time compensation based on the same rate paid for his principal engagement for tiie period of time, and only for the period of time, that is required in traveling to and from the said place designated by the Producer by the particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the performer may actually use. Such travel time compensation shall be computed in accordance with the travel time allowance provisions for day performers as provided in this subsection E. The said travel time allowance for the day performer's return to the place of original departure shall be paid only if the performer shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
If the Producer designates the mode of transportation and the day of departure and the performer follows such directions, there shall be no lapse in payment for days intervening between end of travel and commencement of work.
In the event the Producer does not specify the mode of transportation, then the travel time allowance shall be based upon the most expeditious mode of transportation possible, including travel by commercial airlines. The performer need not fly, but if he elects not to fly when requested to do so, it shall not increase the travel time allowance as specified above.
There shall be no duty on the Producer to procure return transportation for the performer so long as Producer pays for the same.
To illustrate the foregoing, a performer, a resident of Los Angeles, is temporarily in San Francisco.

The performer elects to travel by train. He departs from San Francisco on Wednesday night, arriving at Los Angeles Thursday morning and reports at 11:00 a.m. The Producer dismisses the performer at 2:00 p.m. on the same day. The performer elects to return to San Francisco by train. The performer shall be entitled to one (1) day of pay at the same rate as was paid for his original engagement, plus the cost of transportation by commercial airline.
In the foregoing example, if the performer had been dismissed at 6:00 p.m. with an hour off for lunch (six (6) hours work, four (4) hours travel), the performer would have been entitled to pay for one (1) day plus two (2) hours at time and one-half. The performer shall not be entitled to a travel allowance of more than eight (8) hours in any
-212-
ScbcduleA
period of twenty-four (24) hours; and the performer shall not be entitled to any travel time allowance for a period of travel for which he is otherwise paid.
When principal photography takes place in New York, the provisions of this subsection E. of Schedule A shall apply to performers living in New York and absent therefrom, and shall be applied to other cities in the same manner by analogy.
An out-of-state performer who is recalled for any of the purposes specified in subsection E. of this Schedule A shall not be required to remain in this locality after dismissal unless he is carried on salary during the period he is so required to wait.
Transportation shall mean first-class transportation.

Whenever a performer is paid for a day or days not worked by reason of consecutive employment rules (a "hold day”) in a week during which the performer also works, the performer shall be considered to have worked on the "hold day(s)" for purposes of determining whether the performer is entitled to premium pay for a sixth or seventh day worked. As an example, if the sum of the number of hold
-239-
Schedule B
.S S
days and the number of days worked by the performer in a studio workweek equals six (6), then the sixth day (whether worked or a hold day) shall be paid as a sixth day worked.

If the Producer otherwise shifts the workweek such that the new workweek invades the preceding workweek, the Producer shall pay the premium for the sixth and/or seventh day worked of the preceding workweek.

Overtime in such case shall be paid at the same rate as for the first eight (8) hours.
G.	No Compounding
There shall be no compounding of the foregoing premiums and the penalty or premium prescribed by Section 15 insofar as the same relates to the thirty-six (36) or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period, or Section 27, it being understood that, if, for example, a performer works seven (7) days in a studio workweek, he shall be

Daily overtime shall only commence to accrue after ten (10) hours of work time, as more particularly provided in Section 13 hereof.
12.	DAILY RATE OF COMPENSATION: PRORATING

-241 -
Schedule B

This is exclusive of any overtime or premium pay, if any, due in such performer's workweek.
Weekly overtime shall not be prorated except on a firactional week at the end of the performer's engagement; weekly overtime shall only be computed on the basis of performer's week, as folly set forth in Section 13, "Overtime."

(a)	With respect to performers on a studio five (5) day, forty-four (44) hour workweek, one and one-half (I’/a) times the straight time rate for time worked in excess of forty-four (44) hours in the week of such performer.
(b)	With respect to performers on an overnight location, six (6) day, forty-eight (48) hour workweek, such workweek shall include an additional four (4) hours overtime (4/44) at the straight time hourly rate, whether worked or not Weekly overtime shall be paid at one and one-half (1V4) times the straight time hourly rate for hours worked in excess of forty-eight (48) in such workweek.

ScbeduleB
(3)	Travel Time
To the extent that any weekly or daily overtime is caused by travel time at the beginning or at the end of the day, such overtime shall be computed as provided in Section 44 relating to Travel Time.
B.	Units of Overtime and Computation
All overtime shall be computed in one-tenth (1/10) hour units.
For the purpose of accumulating the number of hours worked during any week, the number of hours worked each day during such week shall be accumulated on the basis of six (6) minute units; there shall be excluded all time during such week for which any daily overtime compensation shall be payable to such performer. For the purpose of computing such overtime, such performer's week in each instance shall commence on the day of the week on which such performer is first placed on salary. In case of any suspension or interruption of such performer’s employment at any time for seven (7) consecutive days or more, for any reason whatsoever, such performer's week shall thereafter commence on the day of the week when he is again placed on salary.
C.	Partial Workweek
When compensation is payable for less than a full workweek, the number of hours worked shall be prorated on a forty-eight (48) hour basis when performer is on an overnight location six (6) day week and shall be prorated on a forty-four (44) hour basis when performer is on a studio five (5) day week. To illustrate the foregoing, if the final fractional week of a performer's employment on an overnight location six (6) day week consists of Thursday, Friday and Saturday, overtime shall be computed only as to the period beyond twenty-four (24) hours. As a further illustration, on such six (6) day basis, if the final fractional week of a performer's employment consists of Friday, Saturday and Sunday, overtime shall be computed only as to the period beyond twenty-four (24) hours; provided, however, that for work on the seventh day worked in a workweek or holidays, the time worked shall be used in computing overtime only to the extent and in the manner provided by Section 9.C.(3)(b) hereof, as the same may be applicable.
-243-
Schedulc B
D.	Effect of Error in Computation
Any failure through error to pay all or any part of overtime compensation shall give the performer no right except to collect the amount so unpaid.
E.	Date When Due
The overtime accruing under the provisions of this Section shall be payable not later than the studio pay day of the calendar week next following the expiration of the performer’s week in which such overtime accrues.
F.	Guaranteed Employment not Affected
Whenever a performer receives overtime or an additional day's pay pursuant to the provisions of this Schedule, such overtime or additional day's pay shall not be deemed to reduce such performer’s guaranteed employment or compensation.
14.	REST PERIOD
A.	Twelve (12) Hour Rest Period
The performer shall be entitled to a twelve (12) hour consecutive rest period from the time he is finally dismissed until his first call thereafter, whether for make-up, wardrobe, hairdress or any other purpose. However, for a performer employed on a theatrical motion picture, the rest period may be reduced to eleven (11) hours on any two (2) non-consecutive days in an overnight location workweek.
B.	Thirtv-Six (36) Hour Rest Period
The performer shall be entitled to one rest period in each week of thirty-six (36) consecutive hours; provided, however, that if the performer is not required to work on the twenty-four (24) hours constituting the first day of any workweek and has not worked for Producer during the twelve (12) hours immediately preceding such day, or if the performer is not required to work on the twenty-four (24) hours constituting the last day of any workweek and does not work for the Producer during the twelve (12) hours immediately succeeding such day, then the thirty-six (36) hour rest period requirement shall be satisfied regardless of the fact that twelve (12) hours thereof may be in the preceding or succeeding week. When the performer works on seven (7) days in any week and is paid, in addition to his base pay, an extra day's
-244-
SchedulcB
pay therefor, the performer need not be given a thirty-six (36) hour rest period for such week, but must continue to receive his eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest periods.
C.	Fifty-Six (56) Hour Rest Period
When the performer is given two (2) consecutive days off during a studio workweek, the thirty-six (36) consecutive hour rest period shall be increased to fifty-six (56) consecutive hours. However, when there is night shooting consisting primarily of exterior photography and the performer's call is not earlier than 3:00 p.m. and he is dismissed in the studio at or before midnight on the fifth day of the workweek, such fifty-six (56) hour rest period, if otherwise applicable, may be reduced to fifty-four (54) hours.
In lieu of the fifty-six (56) hour rest period, die performer may be given a fifty-four (54) hour rest period when the call time for the first day of the new workweek following the rest period is not earlier than 6:00 a.m.
D.	The above provisions regarding the rest period shall be subject to the following exceptions:
(1)	When the Producer is photographing on a location other than an overnight location, tiie eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period may be reduced to ten (10) hours if exterior photography is required on such location on tiie day before and the day after such reduced rest period. When such reduction is allowed on any day by reason of exterior photography on a nearby location, it may not be again allowed until after three (3) consecutive days have intervened.
(2)	When a performer arrives at his place of lodging on an overnight location after 9:00 p.m. and does not work that night, the rest period with respect to the first call following such arrival may be ten (10) hours instead of eleven (11) or twelve (12) hours, but the first call must be at the place of lodging.
(3)	When more than one (1) night of travel (by ordinary means of transportation) is required to reach a location and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train for each night of traveling, the time spent in such traveling to or from such location shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period.
(4)	When an overnight trip to or from a location is required, and the same takes at least seven (7) hours to reach, and the performer is
-245-
Schedule B
given a berth on a boat or train, or if the performer elects to travel by first-class plane accommodations, the time spent in such traveling to or from such location shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period.
(5)	The first call at the lodging for work (including makeup, hairdress, wardrobe or travel) determines the time of first call for the next day for ihe purpose of computing the rest period.
E.	The performer may waive the rest period without the Union's consent but, if he does so, he shall be entitled to one (1) day of pay or $950, whichever is the lesser sum. A performer may be required to waive the rest period if the violation, in case of the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period, is not over two and one-half (2l/a) hours or, on an overnight location, not over two (2) hours. The performer may, in any case, be required to waive ihe thirty-six (36) hour or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period. In any case in which the performer waives either rest period, the payment of one (1) day of pay, not exceeding $950, shall be automatically incurred. The payment may not be waived without the consent of the Union.
F.	Whenever it is provided in this Schedule that there shall be no compounding of any premium pay and the payment for breach of the thirty-six (36) hour or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period, it is expressly understood that the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period between calls, and the payment for violation thereof, remains in effect
G.	Any performer who is required to travel by air in excess of four (4) scheduled hours to a location may not be called for work without a ten (10) hour rest period. The ten (10) hour rest period shall commence from the time of arrival at the hotel, provided the performer goes directly to the hotel designated by the Producer. Failure to provide such ten (10) hours constitutes a rest period violation.
15.	WORKTIME
A.	The provisions of this Section shall apply only to television freelance performers whose weekly guaranteed salary is $4,400 or less per week and who are guaranteed less than $28,500 per television picture and to freelance performers whose weekly guaranteed salary is $5,500 or less per week and who are guaranteed less than $45,000 per theatrical picture.
-246-
ScheduleB
B.	For the purpose of ascertaining and computing hours of work, the rest period and overtime, the period from the time the performer is required to and does report, as directed, until the time such performer is finally dismissed for the day, shall constitute work time, continuously and without interruption, except as follows:
(1)	Allowable meal periods, as provided by Section 17;
(2)	Tests, auditions, wardrobe tests and interviews, as provided by Section 19;
(3)	Fittings, as provided by Section 20;

(9)	Travel time, to the extent provided by Section 44.
C.	Any period during which the performer fails or refuses or is unable because of disability to render services, and any period during which the performer at his own request is excused from rendering services, shall not be work time for any purpose.
D.	After the freelance performer has been employed and after the starting date of such employment, none of the provisions of this Section shall break the continuous days of employment of such freelance performer, except as provided in subsection C. above and in Section 25.D. of this Schedule B.
The foregoing consecutive employment provisions do not apply:
(I)	to body doubles, except that body doubles shall be paid for intervening days on an overnight location when required to remain at such location by the Producer;
-247-
Schedulc B
(2)	to days off during a break of up to two (2) weeks, which break includes the Christmas and New Year's holidays;
(3)	to performers employed on more than one part of a multi-part closed-end series, in connection with a day (or days) intervening between workdays on one part for which the performer is otherwise employed or paid for work on another part of the multi-part closed-end series;
(4)	to performers employed to perform voice-over work on animated theatrical motion pictures. The Producers shall continue the current practice of accommodating the schedules of these performers;
(5)	to performers employed on more than one episode of a series for days intervening between workdays on one episode for which the performer is otherwise employed or paid for work on another episode of the series. In no event will the application of this subparagraph (5) reduce the guarantee of employment for either episode.
The application of this exception is reflected in the following examples:
(a)	Application to Performers Employed on Both a Daily and Weekly Basis on Different Episodes of a Series
(i)	Suppose that a performer is employed on a weekly basis on Episode 1 and on a daily basis on Episode 2. The performer works Monday through Wednesday and on Friday on Episode 1 and works on Thursday on Episode 2.

Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would be paid for Thursday on Episode 1, even though he is otherwise being paid for that day on Episode 2, because failure to do so would reduce the minimum guarantee of employment {i.e., one (1) week) on Episode 1.
Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) day of pay for Episode 2, for a total of six (6) days of pay.

Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and two (2) days of pay for Episode 2, for a total of seven (7) days of pay.
(iii)	Suppose a performer is employed on a daily basis on Episode 1 and on a weekly basis on Episode 2. Hie performer works on Monday and Friday on Episode 1, and works on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on Episode 2. The performer is off on Tuesday.

Thus, the performer would receive two (2) days of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 2, for a total of seven (7) days of pay.
(b)	Application to Weekly Performers
(i)	Suppose that a weekly performer is employed on two episodes of the same series in the same week. The performer works on Episode 1 on Monday through Wednesday and Friday and works on Episode 2 on Wednesday and Thursday.

Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 2, for a total of two (2) weeks of pay.
(ii)	Suppose that a weekly performer is employed on two episodes of the same series over a two (2) week period or that a "major role" performer employed on a one-half hour show is employed on two episodes of the same series over a two (2) week period. During the first week, the performer works Monday through Friday on Episode 1 and does not work at all on Episode 2. During the second week, the performer works on Episode 1 on Wednesday through Friday and works on Episode 2 on Monday through Friday.

The performer would receive payment for one (1) week and three (3) days for Episode 1 and for one (1) week on Episode 2, for a total of two (2) weeks and three (3) days of pay.
(iii)	Suppose a "major role" performer is employed on two episodes of a one-hour series over the course of three (3) weeks. During the first week, the performer works on Episode 1 from Monday through Friday and does not work on Episode 2 at all. During the second week, the performer works on Episode 1 on Wednesday through Friday and works on Episode 2 on Monday through Friday. During the third week, the performer does not work on Episode 1 at all, but works on Episode 2 on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

Any performer to whom Producer supplies the services of a make-up artist for make-up, or hairdresser for hairdressing, shall be z considered to have a call for make-up or hairdress, as the case may be, and the time so spent shall be work time.
The mere fact that a dressing room is furnished the performer, to which he is not directed to report, is not a designation of a place for preparation. In the case of wardrobe, for this paragraph to apply, the performer either must be allowed to take home the wardrobe or must be furnished a dressing room and the wardrobe must be available to the performer in the dressing room. Any call by the Producer for make-up, hairdress or wardrobe is a call to work and not within the exception made within this subsection.
B.	When the performer has reported pursuant to the direction of Producer for make-up, hairdress, wardrobe or fittings, the time so spent shall be work time. When other than ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe requires assistance in the removal thereof, such removal time shall be work time.
When performer is not otherwise on compensable work time, performer shall be compensated for up to fifteen (15) minutes of time spent in the removal of ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe at the applicable overtime rate. Such compensation shall be based on actual time and shall not trigger additional hourly increments of pay. Such removal time shall not be considered in computing rest period violations or other premiums or penalties.

Such wardrobe allowance shall be paid to performer for each workweek in which die performer is employed on die production.
Wardrobe supplied by the performer, which is damaged in the course of employment, shall either be repaired by Producer, or repaired at the expense of Producer at the facilities designated by Producer, provided that notice of such damage is given to Producer prior to the termination of the Performer's employment.

There will be a twelve (12) minute grace period, which is not to be a scheduled grace period, prior to imposition of any meal penalty, provided that the six (6) hour period between meals has not been extended as permitted by the following sentence. If, upon the expiration of such six (6) hour period, the camera is in the actual course of photography, it shall not be a violation to complete such photography. If, on location or while
-254-
ScheduleB
traveling to or from location, the delay is not due to any fault or negligence of the Producer or its agents or persons employed by it to render the catering service by contract, or if delay is caused by common carriers such as railroads, there shall be no penalty for violation of the above provisions. If the caterer is chosen carefully, and is delayed in reaching the location beyond the required time for commencing a meal ' period, there shall be no penalty for the violation; but if such delay shall continue beyond one-half fA) hour, work shall cease, and the time intervening between such cessation of work and the meal period shall be work time.
The performer shall be entitled to a non-deductible meal ' appropriate to the time of day of fifteen (15) minutes in duration within two (2) hours of the performer's call time, during which performer will be freed of all activity. If the performer is given a non-deductible meal, z a notation indicating the start and finish time of that meal shall be made on the production report. The first deductible meal period shall commence within six (6) hours of the end of such non-deductible meal.
If, by reason of a long make-up, wardrobe or hairdress period of a performer, application of the rule would require calling a meal z period for such performer at a time earlier than that required for the rest of the set, Producer shall not be required to call such meal period if food, such as coffee and sandwiches, is made available to such performer before the time for his set call, it being understood that no deduction shall be made from work time for such period; it is further understood, however, that such performer shall be given a meal period within six (6) hours from the time such food is made available to the performer.

(1)	A performer employed under this Schedule B shall not be kept waiting for an interview or audition for more than one (1) hour
' after the time scheduled for the interview or audition. The type of interview or audition referred to is an interview or audition for a specific picture, not a general or get-acquainted type of interview. If the
7 performer is more than five (5) minutes late, the above rule shall not be applicable. It is not the intent of this provision to limit the duration of the interview or audition itself. If a performer is detained for more than ' the permitted period, he shall be compensated for the excess time he is required to wait at his straight time hourly rate in one-half (!6) hour units.

-279-
SchcduleB
T. Travel Pursuant to Recall for Added Scenes, etc.
Any freelance performer living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is outside such area when he is recalled by the Producer for any of the reasons set forth in Section 30 hereof (including performers who are entitled to the provisions of the following paragraph), shall be provided with transportation or reimbursed for the cost of transportation only, from the place where he is when recalled to the place designated by the Producer, by the particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the performer may actually use. Return transportation shall be furnished or the performer shall be reimbursed for such return transportation, as above set forth, only if the performer shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
Any performer living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is at a place beyond a radius of one hundred fifty (150) miles from the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega, Los Angeles, California, when he is recalled by Producer for any of the aforesaid reasons, shall be placed on salary as of the day he is directed to and does report to the place designated by Producer, and shall remain on salary each day until dismissed, except for the provisions relating to the sixth or seventh days in the workweek and holidays. If, after dismissal, the performer remains in this locality or delays his return, unless by the Producer's request, and is again recalled by the Producer, he shall not be entitled to any payment for the time intervening between his dismissal and his recall. The performer shall be entitled to travel time compensation based on the same rate for his principal engagement for the period of time, and only for the period of time that is required in traveling to and from the said place designated by the Producer by the particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the performer may actually use. Such travel time compensation shall be computed in accordance with the travel time allowance provisions for day performers as provided for in Schedule A. The said travel time allowance for the performer’s return to the place of original departure shall be paid only if the performer shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
If the Producer designates the mode of transportation and the day of departure and the performer follows such directions, there shall be no lapse in payment for days intervening between end of travel and commencement of work.
In the event the Producer does not specify the mode of transportation, then the travel time allowance shall be based upon the most expeditious mode of transportation possible, including travel by
-280-
ScheduleB
commercial airlines. The performer need not fly, but if he elects not to fly when requested to do so, it shall not increase the travel time allowance as specified above.
There shall be no duty on the Producer to procure return transportation for the performer so long as Producer pays for the same. /
To illustrate the foregoing, a performer, a resident of Los Angeles, is temporarily in San Francisco. Within three (3) months from z the close of his principal engagement, he is recalled by the Producer as follows: On a Monday, the Producer directs the performer to report at the Los Angeles studio of Producer at 11.00 a.m. on the following z Thursday for retakes. The performer elects to travel by train. He departs from San Francisco on Wednesday night, arriving at Los Angeles Thursday morning, and reports at 11:00 a.m. The Producer / dismisses the performer at 2:00 p.m. on the same day. The performer elects to return to San Francisco by train. The performer shall be x entitled to one (1) day of pay at the same rate as was paid for his original y engagement, plus the cost of transportation by commercial airline.
s	Transportation shall mean first-class transportation.
In the foregoing example, if the performer had been dismissed at 6:00 p.m. with an hour off for lunch (six (6) hours work, four (4) hours travel), the performer would have been entitled to pay for one (1) day plus two (2) hours at time and one-half. The performer shall not be entitled to a travel allowance of more than eight (8) hours in any period of twenty-four (24) hours and the performer shall not be entitled to any travel time allowance for a period of travel for which he is otherwise paid.
When principal photography takes place in New York, the provisions of this subsection T. of Section 44 of Schedule B shall apply to performers living in New York and absent therefrom and shall be / applied to other cities in the same manner by analogy.
Any out-of-state performer who is recalled for any of the purposes specified in Section 30 hereof shall not be required to remain in this locality after dismissal unless he is carried on salary during the period he is so required to wait.
U.	Engagement of Performer - Other Areas
(1)	If a performer, residing or working in any area in which SAG maintains a branch, is brought to Producer's base or distant location in a different area of the United States for any purpose, the
-281 -
Schedule B
performer shall receive transportation and a $75 per day allowance from the time he commences travel at Producer’s request until the time his salary commences.
(2)	If Producer is photographing on a location in the United States and brings a performer to such location from anywhere in the United Stales, such performer shall be provided transportation to and from such location.
(3)	Except as otherwise provided in (1) and (2) above, nothing herein contained shall prevent a Producer from engaging a performer outside of California (if such performer has not gone out of California for the purpose of evading this rule) to report in California or to report at any location and, in any such case, the Producer shall not be required to pay for or provide transportation of such perfonner to the place of reporting or to pay such performer for any time spent in traveling thereto; nor shall the Producer be required to pay for or provide transportation of such performer at the end of the engagement back to the place where such performer was engaged, or to pay such performer for any time spent in traveling back to the place where such performer was engaged; such performer may be dismissed on location. This does not limit the second sentence of subsection B. hereof.
(4)	Performers shall not be held on a per diem longer than three (3) days.
V.	General
(1)	Nothing in this Section 44 shall be deemed to break the continuous employment of a freelance perfonner.
(2)	This Agreement uses the expressions "reasonable transportation" and "first-class transportation." The terms are intended to be synonymous. The type of transportation required can best be illustrated by examples: Bus transportation for a relatively short distance (Hollywood to Lake Arrowhead) meets these requirements; bus transportation for a long distance (Hollywood to San Francisco) does not. Pullman accommodations to San Francisco, or any other long distance, meet these requirements; deluxe transportation (e.g., Super Chief) is not required. Transportation on a commercial airline without sleeper accommodations is first-class transportation. First-class transportation shall be provided on commercial airlines when the performer is required to fly at the request of the Producer. The foregoing shall apply to jet flights as well as to prop-driven aircraft The foregoing shall not apply when first-class transportation is not available or six (6) or more of the company are being transported. Charter flights
-282-
Schcdule B
may be used which provide substantially equivalent accommodations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, first-class air transportation need not be provided with respect to auditions and interviews.

Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would be paid for Thursday on Episode 1, even though he is otherwise being paid for that day on Episode 2, because failure to do so would reduce the minimum guarantee of employment (i.e., one (1) week) on Episode 1.
Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) day of pay for Episode 2, for a total of six (6) days of pay.
(ii)	Suppose that a performer is employed on a weekly basis on Episode 1 and on a daily basis on Episode 2. The performer works Monday through Friday on Episode 1 and works on Tuesday and Thursday on Episode 2.

16.	MAKE-UP. HAIRDRESS. WARDROBE
A.	The Producer may require any performer to report made up,
with hairdress and in wardrobe, without assistance from the Producer and, in such case, any time spent by the performer therein prior to the performer’s first call shall not be work time for any purpose, but the Producer may not have the performer do any such preparation at any place designated by the Producer.
Any performer to whom Producer supplies the services of a make-up artist for make-up, or hairdresser for hairdressing, shall be considered to have a call for make-up or hairdress, as the case may be, and the time so spent shall be work time.
The mere fact that a dressing room is furnished the performer, to which he is not directed to report, is not a designation of a place for preparation. In the case of wardrobe, for this paragraph to apply, the performer must be either allowed to take home the wardrobe, or must be furnished a dressing room and the wardrobe must be available to the performer in the dressing room. Any call by the
-311 -
Schedule C
Producer for make-up, hairdress or wardrobe is a call to work and not within the exception made within this subsection.
B.	When the performer has reported pursuant to the direction of Producer for make-up, hairdress, wardrobe or fittings, the time so spent shall be work time. When other than ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe requires assistance in the removal thereof, such removal time shall be work time.
When performer is not otherwise on compensable work time, performer shall be compensated for up to fifteen (15) minutes of time spent in the removal of ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe at the applicable overtime rate. Such compensation shall be based on actual time and shall not trigger additional hourly increments of pay. Such removal time shall not be considered in computing rest period violations or other premiums or penalties.
C.	If any special hairdress necessitating an expenditure is
required by Producer, Producer shall either furnish such hairdress or Producer may designate facilities for the procurement of such hairdress and reimburse performer for amounts expended.
D.	When performer supplies his or her own wardrobe at the request of Producer, Producer shall pay, as a cleaning allowance and reimbursement, the following amounts:
Formal wear	$ 17.00
All other wardrobe (per outfit)	$11.50

Such wardrobe allowance shall be paid to performer for each workweek in which the performer is employed on the production.
Wardrobe supplied by the performer which is damaged in the course of employment shall either be repaired by Producer or repaired at the expense of Producer at facilities designated by Producer, provided that notice of such damage is given to Producer prior to the termination of the performer's employment.

There will be a twelve (12) minute grace period, which is not to be a scheduled grace period, prior to imposition of any meal penalty, provided that the six (6) hour period between meals has not been extended as permitted by the following sentence. If, upon the expiration of such six (6) hour period, the camera is in the actual course of photography, it shall not be a violation to complete such photography. If, on location or while traveling to or from location, the delay is not due to any fault or negligence of the Producer or its agents or persons employed by it to render the catering service by contract, or if delay is caused by common carriers such as railroads, there shall be no penalty for violation of the above provisions. If the caterer is chosen carefully, and is delayed in reaching the location beyond the required time for commencing a meal period, there shall be no penalty for the violation; but if such delay shall continue beyond one-half (!4) hour, work shall cease and the time intervening between such cessation of work and the meal period shall be work time.
The performer shall be entitled to a non-deductible meal appropriate to the time of day of fifteen (15) minutes in duration within two (2) hours of the performer's call time, during which performer will be freed of all activity. If the performer is given a non-deductible meal, a notation indicating the start and finish time of that meal shall be made on the production report. The first deductible meal period shall commence within six (6) hours thereafter.
If, by reason of a long make-up, wardrobe or hairdress period of a performer, application of the rule would require calling a meal period for such performer at a time earlier than that required for the rest of the set, Producer shall not be required to call such meal period if food, such as coffee and sandwiches, is made available to such performer before the time for his set call, it being understood that no deduction shall be made from work time for such period; it is further understood, however, that such performer shall be given a meal period within six (6) hours from the time such food is made available to the performer.

Any freelance performer living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is outside such area when he is recalled by the Producer for any of the reasons set forth in Section 27 hereof (including performers who are entitled to the provisions of the following paragraph), shall be provided with transportation or reimbursed for the cost of transportation only, from the place where he is when recalled to the place designated by the Producer, by the particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the performer may actually use. Return transportation shall be furnished or the performer shall be reimbursed for such return
-333-
ScheduleC
transportation, as above set forth, only if the performer shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
Any performer living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is at a place beyond a radius of one hundred fifty (150) miles from the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega, Los Angeles, California, when he is recalled by Producer for any of the aforesaid reasons, shall be placed on salary as of the day he is directed to and does report to the place designated by Producer, and shall remain on ■ salary until dismissed, except for the provisions relating to sixth or seventh days in the workweek and holidays. If, after dismissal, the performer remains in this locality or delays his return, unless by the ' Producer's request, and is again recalled by the Producer, he shall not be entitled to any payment for the time intervening between his dismissal and his recall. The performer shall be entitled to travel time z compensation based on the same rate for his principal engagement for the period of time, and only for the period of time, that is required in traveling to and from the said place designated by the Producer by the y particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the performer may actually use. Such travel time compensation shall be computed in accordance with the travel time allowance provisions for day performers as provided for in Schedule A. The said travel time allowance for the performer's return to the place of original departure shall be paid only if the performer shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
If the Producer designates the mode of transportation and the day of departure and the performer follows such directions, there shall z be no lapse in payment for days intervening between end of travel and commencement of work.
In the event the Producer does not specify the mode of transportation, then the travel time allowance shall be based upon the most expeditious mode of transportation possible, including travel by ✓ commercial air lines. The performer need not fly, but if he elects not to fly when requested to do so, it shall not increase the travel time allowance as specified above.
There shall be no duty on the Producer to procure return transportation for the performer so long as Producer pays for the same.
To illustrate the foregoing, a performer, a resident of Los Angeles, is temporarily in San Francisco. Within three (3) months from the close of his principal engagement, he is recalled by the Producer as follows: On a Monday, the Producer directs the performer to report at the Los Angeles studio of Producer at 11:00 a.m. on the following
-334-
Schedule C
Thursday for retakes. The performer elects to travel by train. He departs from San Francisco on Wednesday night, arriving at Los Angeles Thursday morning, and reports at 11:00 a.m. The Producer dismisses the performer at 2:00 p.m. on the same day. The performer elects to return to San Francisco by train. The performer shall be entitled to one (1) day of pay at the same rate as was paid for his original engagement, plus the cost of transportation by commercial airline.
Transportation shall mean first-class transportation.
In the foregoing example, if the performer had been dismissed at 6:00 p.m. with an hour off for lunch (six (6) hours work, four (4) hours travel), the performer would have been entitled to pay for one (1) day plus two (2) hours at time and one-half. The travel allowance contemplated by this paragraph shall entitle the performer to time and one-half. The performer shall not be entitled to a travel allowance of more than eight (8) hours in any period of twenty-four (24) hours; and the performer shall not be entitled to any travel time allowance for a period of travel for which he is otherwise paid.
When principal photography takes place in New York, the provisions of this subsection T. shall apply to performers living in New York and absent therefrom, and shall be applied to other cities in the same manner by analogy.
Any out-of-state performer who is recalled for any of the purposes specified in Section 27 hereof shall not be required to remain in this locality after dismissal unless he is carried on salary during the period he is so required to wait.
U.	Engagement of Performers - Other Areas
(1)	If a performer, residing or working in any area in which SAG maintains a branch, is brought to Producer’s base or distant location in a different area of the United States for any purpose, the performer shall receive transportation and a $75 per day allowance from the time he commences travel at Producer's request until the time his salary commences.
(2)	If Producer is photographing on a location in the United States and brings a performer to such location from anywhere in the United States, such a performer shall be provided transportation to and from such location.
(3)	Except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above, nothing herein contained shall prevent a Producer from
-335-
ScheduleC
engaging a performer outside of California (if such performer has not gone out of California for the purpose of evading this rule) to report in California or to report at any location and, in any such case, the Producer shall not be required to pay for or provide transportation of such performer to the place of reporting, or to pay such performer for any time spent in traveling thereto; nor shall the Producer be required to pay for or provide transportation of such performer at the end of the engagement back to the place where such performer was engaged, or to pay such performer for any time spent in traveling back to the place z where such performer was engaged; such performer may be dismissed
on location. This does not limit the second sentence of subsection B. of this Section 41.
V.	General
,	(1) Nothing in this Section 41 shall be deemed to break the
continuous employment of a freelance performer.
(2)	This Agreement uses the expressions "reasonable transportation" and "first-class transportation." The terms are intended to be synonymous. The type of transportation required can best be illustrated by example: Bus transportation for a relatively short distance (Hollywood to Lake Arrowhead) meets these requirements; bus transportation for a long distance (Hollywood to San Francisco) does not. Pullman accommodations to San Francisco, or any other long
' distance, meet these requirements; deluxe transportation (e.g, Super Chief) is not required. Transportation on a commercial airline without sleeper accommodations is first-class transportation. First-class
z transportation shall be provided on commercial airlines when the performer is required to fly at the request of the Producer. The foregoing shall apply to jet flights as well as to prop-driven aircraft. The foregoing shall not apply when first-class transportation is not available or six (6) or more of the company are being transported. Charter flights may be used which provide substantially equivalent accommodations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, first-class air transportation need not be provided with respect to auditions and interviews.
42.	COMMENCEMENT OF TERM OF EMPLOYMENT AT NEAR OR DISTANT LOCATION_____________________________
A.	If the services of the performer at the commencement of the
term of employment are to be rendered at a place which can be reached from the Producer's studio within twenty-four (24) hours of travel by ordinary means of transportation, then and in that event, compensation shall not begin to accrue to the performer until the performer's first
-336-
Schedule C
appearance before the camera at such place or until the performer is first put on call at such place; provided, however, that in any event, compensation must commence to accrue to the performer not later than twenty-four (24) hours after such place has been reached; and compensation shall accrue to the performer during the time reasonably required to return the performer to his proper place of dismissal. (Note Sections 41.U.(1) and (2) above.)
B.	If the services of the performer, at commencement of the term of employment, are to be rendered at a place which cannot be reached from the Producer's studio within twenty-four (24) hours of travel by ordinary means of transportation, then and in that event, compensation shall not commence to accrue to the performer during such travel period and prior to the performer's first appearance before the camera at such place, or prior to the time when the performer is first put on call at such place; provided, however, that in any event, compensation must commence to accrue to the performer not later than twenty-four (24) hours after such place has been reached; and compensation shall accrue to the performer during the time reasonably required to return the performer to his proper place of dismissal. (Note Sections 41.U.(1) and (2) above.)
43.	GUARANTEE NOT AFFECTED BY ADDITIONAL DAY OF
PAY____________________________________________________
Whenever a performer receives an additional day or days of pay pursuant to the provisions of this Schedule, such additional day or days of pay shall not be deemed to reduce such performer's guaranteed employment or compensation.
44.	INTERVIEWS AND AUDITIONS
A.	A performer employed under Schedule B or C shall not be kept waiting for an interview or audition for more than one (1) hour after the time scheduled for the interview or audition. The type of interview or audition referred to is an interview or audition for a specific picture, not a general or get-acquainted type of interview. If the performer is more than five (5) minutes late, the above rule shall not be applicable. It is not the intent of this provision to limit the duration of the interview or audition itself. If a performer is detained for more than the permitted period, he shall be compensated for the excess time he is required to wait at his straight time hourly rate in one-half (*A) hour units. If no salary has been agreed upon before the interview or audition, and if the performer and Producer cannot agree on the applicable salary, the salary
-337-
ScheduleC
rate at which such performer shall be compensated for such excess time shall be determined by conciliation and, if conciliation fails, by arbitration in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Basic Agreement.

CONTRACT PERFORMERS WHOSE WEEKLY GUARANTEED SALARY IS $4,400 OR LESS PER WEEK FOR TELEVISION MOTION PICTURES OR WHOSE WEEKLY GUARANTEED SALARY IS S5£00 OR LESS PER WEEK FOR THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURES
o j) a Kin
A contract performer is a performer employed under a contract for television motion pictures or theatrical motion pictures or both (in which latter case such contracts are sometimes referred to as "combination term contracts"), which contract is for a term of at least ten (10) out of thirteen (13) weeks and which may not specify any role, picture or series, unless otherwise requested by the performer and approved by the Union. The Union agrees it will liberally grant waivers in the event of such request. The Producer and the performer may agree on any overall term of hiring in excess of ten (10) guaranteed weeks, provided that the guaranteed number of weeks is in the same proportion to the overall period as "ten (10) out of thirteen (13).”
2.	CLASSIFICATIONS OF CONTRACT PERFORMERS -TERM CONTRACT______________________________________________
A.	When a performer is employed for two (2) or more pictures per year or other specified period (hereinafter referred to as the "employment period") and the contract is exclusive with respect to his services in the production of motion pictures, the performer shall be classified, for the purpose of this Agreement, as a "term contract performer" and his classification as a term contract performer with respect to "hours" shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:
The total guaranteed compensation of the performer shall be divided by the proportionate number of weeks in the employment period that forty (40) bears to fifty-two (52). For example: if the employment period is one year, the guaranteed compensation shall be divided by forty (40) weeks; if the employment period is six (6) months, the guaranteed compensation shall be divided by twenty (20) weeks, etc. If the resulting figure reflects a compensation of more than $4,400 per week for television motion pictures or more than $5,500 per week for theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule F shall apply to tiie
-348-
SchedulcE
employment. If the resulting figure is $4,400 per week or less for television motion pictures or $5,500 per week or less for theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule E shall apply to the employment.
When a performer who, under the above formula, has been classified so as to receive the provisions of Schedule E receives compensation in addition to his minimum guaranteed compensation, which additional compensation, when added to his total minimum guaranteed compensation and divided by the said proportionate number of weeks in the employment period, would raise the performer above the $4,400 breaking point for television motion pictures or above the $5,500 breaking point for theatrical motion pictures, then such performer, from that time forward, shall receive the provisions of Schedule F instead of Schedule E for the balance of the employment period in question. The so-called "breaking point" for a performer whose employment period is one (1) year shall be $100,000; for an employment period of six (6) months, $50,000; for an employment period of three (3) months, $25,000, etc.
B,	The employment period of ten (10) out of thirteen (13) weeks may not be used in the same term contract except during the first year; thereafter, the contract shall guarantee a minimum period of employment of twenty (20) out of twenty-six (26) weeks. This subsection is subject to Section 12(c) of the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement.
3.	SCHEDULE E INCLUDED IN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS
It is agreed that the terms, conditions and exceptions of this Schedule shall become a part of the contract of a contract performer while he is receiving $4,400 or less per week for a television motion picture or is receiving $5,500 or less per week for a theatrical motion picture.
W-4 forms shall be presented to performer no later than the first day of employment. A W-4 form may be given to performer on the set on the first day of employment.
W-4 forms shall be available on every set. It shall be the performer's responsibility to return a completed W-4 form to Producer in a timely manner. It is understood that when a performer fails to do so, there shall be no retroactive adjustments to the withholding required by law.

D.	Premium Days - Holiday Weeks - "Hold" Days
A Schedule E performer shall he treated as having worked six ' (6) days in a studio workweek (seven (7) days in an overnight location workweek), and shall be entitled to payment for the sixth day worked in a studio workweek (the seventh day worked in an overnight location workweek), whenever a holiday falls on a regularly-scheduled work day and the performer is required to work five (5) days in the holiday week in a studio workweek (six (6) days in the holiday week in an overnight / location workweek).	x
Whenever a performer is paid for a day or days not worked	✓

determining whether the performer is entitled to premium pay for a sixth \ or seventh day worked. As an example, if the sum of the number of hold days and the number of days worked by the performer in a studio workweek equals six (6), then the sixth day (whether worked or a hold day) shall be paid as a sixth day worked. Similarly, if the sum of the number of hold days and the number of days worked by the performer in the workweek equals seven (7), then the seventh day (whether worked or x a hold day) shall be paid as a seventh day worked.

Once during the production of a motion picture, or in the case of episodic television, once between hiatus periods (i.e.t between the z commencement or resumption of production and a cessation of principal	v
photography for the series for at least one week), the Producer may shift the workweek for performers without incurring extra costs, by adding	'
one (1) or two (2) days off consecutive with the sixth and/or seventh days off in the prior workweek and/or by shifting a workweek commencing on a Tuesday to a workweek commencing on a Monday, / provided that the intervening Sunday is a day off.
If the Producer otherwise shifts the workweek such that the	z
new workweek invades the preceding workweek, the Producer shall pay	k
the premium for the sixth and/or seventh day worked of the preceding workweek.	,
The performer shall be advised of any shift in the workweek prior to commencement of that workweek.
-358-
ScheduleE
F.	Time of Call
If the performer's first call on the set on the last day of the workweek (whether performer is on a studio five (5) day week or on an overnight six (6) day week), is 6:00 p.m. or thereafter, the work past midnight to time of dismissal shall not be counted as work on the sixth or seventh day, as the case may be, for the purpose of this Section, even though the performer may have been called earlier than 6:00 p.m. for travel, make-up, wardrobe, hairdress and the like.
G.	No Compounding
There shall be no compounding of the foregoing premiums and the penalty or premium prescribed by Section 12 insofar as the same relates to the thirty-six (36) or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period, or Section 26, entitled "Work on Holidays, or on Six (6) or Seven (7) Days in a Workweek;" it being understood that if, for example, a performer works seven (7) days in a studio workweek, he shall be entitled to only eight and one-half (8!6) days of pay plus overtime, if any.
H.	Union Branches
Any area in which the Union maintains a branch shall be deemed a five (5) day workweek area for performers employed in such area, when principal photography for a picture is substantially photographed in such area. The scope of such areas is defined in General Provisions, Section 14, entitled "Preference of Employment."
9.	HOURS PER DAY: WORKPAST MIDNIGHT
If the performer is working at midnight of any day, then his hours of work for such day shall be computed until the performer has been dismissed subsequent to midnight, subject to all exceptions and deductions provided for in this Schedule. Hours of work for the following day shall, except as otherwise provided in this Schedule, be computed from the time the performer, after having been so dismissed subsequent to midnight, is next required to and does report. Daily overtime shall only commence to accrue after ten (10) hours of work time, as more particularly provided in Section 11 hereof.
Subject to the overtime provisions, when the total engagement for any week of the performer's services is night work and when the last day of such week goes past midnight, the work past midnight does not count as an additional day. For this purpose, night work is defined as a call for
-359-
ScheduleE
4:00 p.m. or later. In any event, work past midnight into a premium day (i.e., work past midnight into the sixth or seventh day worked in the performer's workweek or a holiday) shall not require the payment of a premium.
10.	DAILY RATE OF COMPENSATION: PRORATING
Whenever it is necessary to prorate the workweek in order to determine an additional day of pay, such prorating shall be on the basis of one-fifth (1/5) of the performer's weekly base rate for either the studio or overnight location workweek; however, such proration shall not in any manner change the performer's weekly base rate for either the studio or the overnight location workweek.
With respect to prorating the performer's workweek for the purpose of paying the performer at the end of a payroll week, that portion of performer's studio workweek which is part of such payroll week shall be prorated on the basis of one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly base rate for each such day (excluding the sixth and seventh days) in that payroll week. This is exclusive of any overtime or premium pay, if any, due in such performer's workweek.
In any event, when a performer is guaranteed a fixed compensation on a picture or term basis, such fixed amount shall not be exceeded by reason of the amount of proration accruing in the final payroll week of the respective period or picture involved.
Weekly overtime shall not be prorated except on a fractional week at the end of the performer's engagement; weekly overtime shall only be computed on the basis of performer's week, as folly set forth in Section 11, "Overtime.”
11.	OVERTIME
A.	Rate
Except as otherwise provided by tiie provisions of this Schedule E:
(1)	Daily Overtime

-360-
ScheduleE
(2)	Weekly Overtime
(a)	With respect to a perfonner on a studio five (5) day, forty-four (44) hour workweek, one and one-half times the straight time rate for time worked in excess of forty-four (44) hours in the week of such perfonner.
(b)	With respect to performers on an overnight location, six (6) day, forty-eight (48) hour workweek, such workweek shall include an additional four (4) hours overtime (4/44) at the straight time hourly rate, whether worked or not. Weekly overtime shall be paid at one and one-half times the straight time hourly rate for time worked in excess of forty-eight (48) in such workweek.
(3)	Travel Time
To the extent that any weekly or daily overtime is caused by travel time at the beginning or at the end of the day, such overtime shall be computed as provided in Section 32 relating to travel time.
(4)	Make-up, Hairdress, Wardrobe, Fittings
For the purpose of computing premium pay for overtime, whether daily or weekly, to the extent that such overtime is caused by make-up, hairdress, wardrobe or fittings, it shall be paid for in hourly units, except to the extent and in the manner provided by Sections 8.B.(3Xiv), 8.C.(3Xc), and 26,B.(2) of this Schedule.
B.	Units of Overtime and Computation
All overtime shall be computed in units of one-tenth (1/10) hour.
For the purpose of accumulating the number of hours worked during any week, the number of hours worked each day during such week shall be accumulated on the basis of six (6) minute units; there shall be excluded all time during such week for which any daily overtime compensation shall be payable to such perfonner. For the purpose of computing such overtime, such performer's week in each instance shall commence on the day of the week on which such performer is first placed on salary. In case of any suspension or interruption of such performer’s employment at any time for seven (7) consecutive days or more, for any reason whatsoever, such performer's week shall thereafter commence on the day of the week when he is again placed on salary.
-361-
Schedule E
C.	Partial Workweek
When compensation is payable for less than a full workweek, the number of hours worked shall be prorated on a forty-eight (48) hour basis when performer is on an overnight location six (6) day week, and on a forty-four (44) hour basis when performer is on a studio five (5) day week To illustrate the foregoing, if the final fractional week of a performer's employment on an overnight location six (6) day week consists of Thursday, Friday and Saturday, overtime shall be computed only as to the period beyond twenty-four (24) hours. As a further illustration, on such six (6) day basis, if the final fractional week of a performer's employment consists of Friday, Saturday and Sunday, overtime shall be computed only as to the period beyond twenty-four (24) hours.
D.	Effect of Error in Computation
Any failure through error to pay all or any part of overtime compensation shall give the performer no right except to collect the amount so unpaid.
E.	Date When Due
The overtime accruing under the provisions of this Section shall be payable not later than the studio pay day of the calendar week next following the expiration of the performer's week in which such overtime accrues.
F.	Guaranteed Employment not Affected
Whenever a performer receives overtime or an additional day of pay pursuant to the provisions of this Schedule, such overtime or additional day of pay shall not be deemed to reduce such performer's guaranteed employment or compensation.
G.	Retakes. Added Scenes. Etc,
When a contract performer works more than ten (10) hours in a day, or more than forty-four (44) hours in a studio workweek or more than forty-eight (48) hours in an overnight location workweek, and during such day or week has performed services in retakes, added scenes or changes in a photoplay, then the provisions of this Section shall be construed with the provisions of Section 22 of this Schedule E.
-362-
ScheduleE
12.	REST PERIOD
A.	Twelve (12) Hour Rest Period
The performer shall be entitled to a twelve (12) hour consecutive rest period from the time he is finally dismissed until his first call thereafter, whether for make-up, wardrobe, hairdress or any other purpose. However, for a performer employed on a theatrical motion picture, the rest period may be reduced to eleven (11) hours on any two (2) consecutive days in an overnight location workweek.
B.	Thirty-Six (36) Hour Rest Period
The performer shall be entitled to one rest period in each week of thirty-six (36) consecutive hours; provided, however, that if the performer is not required to work on the twenty-four (24) hours constituting the first day of any workweek and has not worked for Producer during the twelve (12) hours immediately preceding such day, or if the performer is not required to work on the twenty-four (24) hours constituting the last day of any workweek and does not work for the Producer during the twelve (12) hours immediately succeeding such day, then the thirty-six (36) hour rest period requirement shall be satisfied regardless of the fact that twelve (12) hours thereof may be in the preceding or succeeding week. When the performer works on seven (7) days in any week and is paid, in addition to his base pay, extra pay therefor, the performer need not be given a thirty-six (36) hour rest period for such week, but must continue to receive his twelve (12) hour rest periods.
C.	Fifty-Six (56) Hour Rest Period
When the performer is given two (2) consecutive days off during a studio workweek, the thirty-six (36) consecutive hour rest period shall be increased to fifty-six (56) consecutive hours. However, when there is night shooting consisting primarily of exterior photography and the performer's call is not earlier than 3:00 p.m. and he is dismissed in the studio at or before midnight on the fifth day of the workweek, such fifty-six (56) hour rest period, if otherwise applicable, may be reduced to fifty-four (54) hours.
In lieu of the fifty-six (56) hour rest period, the performer may be given a fifty-four (54) hour rest period when the call time for the first day of the new workweek following the rest period is not earlier than 6:00 a.m.
-363-
Scbedule E
D.	The above provisions regarding the rest period shall be subject to the following exceptions:
(1)	When the Producer is photographing on a location other than an overnight location, the twelve (12) hour rest period may be reduced to ten (10) hours if exterior photography is required on such location on the day before and the day after such reduced rest period. When such reduction is allowed on any day by reason of exterior photography on a nearby location, it may not be again allowed until after three (3) consecutive days have intervened.
(2)	When a performer arrives at his place of lodging on an overnight location after 9:00 p.m. and does not work that night, the rest period with respect to the first call following such arrival may be ten (10) hours instead of twelve (12) hours, but the first call must be at the place of lodging.
(3)	When more than one (1) night of travel (by ordinary means of transportation) is required to reach a location and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train for each night of traveling, the time spent in such traveling, to or from such location, shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the twelve (12) hour rest period.
(4)	When an overnight trip to or from a location is required, and the same takes at least seven (7) hours to reach, and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train, or if the perfonner elects to travel by first-class plane accommodations, the time spent in such traveling to or from such location shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the twelve (12) hour rest period.
(5)	The first call at the lodging for work (including make-up, hairdress, wardrobe or travel) determines the time of first call for the next day for the purpose of computing the rest period.
E. The performer may waive the rest period without the Union's consent but, if he does so, he shall be entitled to an automatic penalty of one (1) day of pay or $950, whichever is the lesser sum. A perfonner may be required to waive the rest period if the violation, in case of die twelve (12) hour rest period, is not over two and one-half (21/?) hours or, on an overnight location, not over two (2) hours. The performer may in any case be required to waive the thirty-six (36) hour or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period. In any case in which die performer waives either rest period, the penally of one (1) day of pay, not exceeding $950, shall be automatically incurred. The penalty may not be waived without the consent of the Union.
-364-
ScheduJeE
F.	Whenever it is provided in this Schedule that there shall be no compounding of any premium pay and the penalty for breach of the thirty-six (36) hour or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period, it is expressly understood that the twelve (12) hour rest period between calls, and the penalty for violation thereof, remains in effect.
G.	Any performer who is required to travel by air in excess of four (4) scheduled hours to a location may not be called for work without a ten (10) hour rest period. The ten (10) hour rest period shall commence from the time of arrival at the hotel, provided the performer goes directly to the hotel designated by the Producer. Failure to provide such ten (10) hours constitutes a rest period violation.
13.	WORKTIME
A.	For the purpose of ascertaining and computing hours of work,
the rest period and overtime, the period from the time the performer is required to and does report as directed, until the time such performer is finally dismissed for the day, shall constitute work time, continuously and without interruption, except as follows:
(1)	Allowable meal periods, as provided by Section 15;
(2)	Tests and auditions, as provided by Section 17;
(3)	Study of lines or script, to the extent provided by Section 18;

-365-
Schedule E
(10)	Travel time, to the extent provided by Section 32.
B.	Any period during which the performer fails or refuses or is unable because of disability to render services, and any period during which the performer at his own request is excused from rendering services, shall not be work time for any purpose.
C.	After such a performer has been employed and after the starting date of such employment, none of the provisions of this Section shall derogate from his right to receive salary, except:
(1)	under the circumstances provided in subsection B. above;
(2)	if the performer is on layoff;
(3)	if the performer is under suspension;
(4)	if, pursuant to the provisions of his individual contract, he is otherwise not entitled to receive salary;
(5)	under the circumstances provided in Section 24.D. of this Schedule E;
(6)	for body doubles; however, body doubles shall be paid for intervening days or on overnight location when required to remain at such location by the Producer;
(7)	for days off during a break of up to two (2) weeks, which break includes the Christmas and New Year’s holidays;
(8)	in connection with a day (or days) intervening between workdays on one part of a multi-part closed-end series for which the performer is otherwise employed or paid for work on another part of the multi-part closed-end series;
(9)	to performers employed on more than one episode of a series for days intervening between workdays on one episode for which the performer is otherwise employed or paid for work on another episode of the series. In no event will the application of this subparagraph (9) reduce the guarantee of employment for either episode.
The application of this exception is reflected in the following examples:
-366-

Under the foregoing consecutive employment rules, the performer would be paid for Thursday on Episode 1, even though he is otherwise being paid for that day on Episode 2, because failure to do so would reduce the minimum guarantee of employment (i.e., one (1) week) on Episode 1.
Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) day of pay for Episode 2, for a total of six (6) days of pay.

Thus, the performer would receive one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 1 and two (2) days of pay for Episode 2, for a total of seven (7) days of pay.
(iii)	Suppose a performer is employed on a daily basis on Episode 1 and on a weekly basis on Episode 2. The performer works on Monday and Friday on Episode 1, and works on Monday,

Thus, the performer would receive two (2) days of pay for Episode 1 and one (1) week (five (5) days) of pay for Episode 2, for a total of seven (7) days of pay.
(b)	Application to Weekly Performers
(i)	Suppose that a weekly performer is employed on two episodes of the same series in the same week. The performer works on Episode 1 on Monday through Wednesday and Friday and works on Episode 2 on Wednesday and Thursday.

1.	DEFINITIONS
A.	Contract Perfonner
For the purpose of this Schedule F, a contract performer is a performer employed under a contract at a salary in excess of $4,400 per week for television motion pictures or in excess of $5,500 per week for theatrical motion pictures or both (in which latter case such contracts are sometimes referred to as "combination term contracts"), which contract is for a term of at least ten (10) out of thirteen (13) weeks and which may not specify any role, picture or series, unless otherwise requested by the perfonner and approved by the Union. The Union agrees it will liberally grant waivers in the event of such request The Producer and the performer may agree on any overall term of hiring in excess of ten (10) guaranteed weeks, provided that the guaranteed number of weeks is in the same proportion to the overall period as "ten (10) out of thirteen (13)."
When a performer is employed for two (2) or more pictures per year or other specified period (hereinafter referred to as the "employment period") and the contract is exclusive with respect to his services in the production of motion pictures, the performer shall be classified, for foe purpose of this Agreement, as a "contract performer" and his classification as a contract performer with respect to "hours" shall be determined in accordance with foe following formula:
-396-
ScheduleF
The total guaranteed compensation of the performer shall be divided by the proportionate number of weeks in the employment period that forty (40) bears to fifty-two (52). For example: If the employment period is one (1) year, the guaranteed compensation shall be divided by forty (40) weeks; if the employment period is six (6) months, the guaranteed compensation shall be divided by twenty (20) weeks, etc. If die resulting figure reflects a compensation of more than $4,400 per week for television motion pictures or more than $5,500 per week for theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule F shall apply to the employment. If the resulting figure is $4,400 or less per week for television motion pictures or $5,500 or less per week for theatrical motion pictures, the provisions of Schedule E shall apply to the employment.
When a performer who, under the above formula, has been classified so as to receive the provisions of Schedule E receives compensation in addition to his minimum guaranteed compensation, which additional compensation when added to his total minimum guaranteed compensation and divided by the said proportionate number of weeks in the employment period would raise the performer above the $4,400 breaking point for television motion pictures or above the $5,500 breaking point for theatrical motion pictures, then such performer, from that time forward, shall receive the provisions of Schedule F instead of Schedule E for the balance of the employment period in question. The so-called "breaking point" for a performer whose employment period is one (1) year shall be $100,000; for an employment period of six (6) months, $50,000; for an employment period of three (3) months, $25,000, etc.

However, when there is night shooting consisting primarily of exterior photography and die performer's call is not earlier than 3:00 p.m. and he is dismissed in the studio at or before midnight on Friday, such fifty-six (56) hour rest period, if otherwise applicable, may be reduced to fifty-four (54) hours.
In lieu of the fifty-six (56) hour rest period, the performer may be given a fifty-four (54) hour rest period when the call time for the first day of the workweek following the rest period is not earlier than 6:00 a.m.
D.	The above provisions regarding the rest period shall be subject to the following exceptions:
(1)	When the Producer is photographing on a location other than an overnight location, the twelve (12) hour rest period may be reduced to ten (10) hours if exterior photography is required on such location on the day before and the day after such reduced rest period. When such reduction is allowed on any day by reason of exterior photography on a nearby location, it may not be again allowed until after three (3) consecutive days have intervened.
(2)	When a performer arrives at his place of lodging on an overnight location after 9:00 p.m. and does not work that night, the rest period with respect to the first call following such arrival may be ten (10) hours instead of twelve (12) hours, but the first call must be at the place of lodging.
(3)	When more than one (1) night of travel (by ordinary means of transportation) is required to reach a location and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train for each night of traveling, the time spent in such traveling, to or from such location, shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the twelve (12) hour rest period.
(4)	When an overnight trip to or from a location is required, and the same takes at least seven (7) hours to reach, and the performer is given a berth on a boat or train, or if the performer elects to travel by first-class plane accommodations, the time spent in such traveling to or from such location shall not be work time or travel time for the purpose of computing the twelve (12) hour rest period.
(5)	The first call at the lodging for work (including makeup, hairdress, wardrobe or travel) determines the time of first call for the next day for foe purpose of computing foe rest period.
-417-
ScheduieF
E.	The performer may waive the rest period without the Union's
consent but, if he does so, he shall be entitled to one (1) day of pay or $950, whichever is the lesser sum. A performer may be required to waive the rest period ifthe violation, in tiie case of the twelve (12) hour rest period, is not over two and one-half (2!4) hours or, on an overnight location, not over two (2) hours. The performer may, in any case, be required to waive the thirty-six (36) hour or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period. In any case in which tiie performer waives either rest period, the payment of one (1) day of pay, not exceeding $950, shall be automatically incurred. The payment may not be waived without the consent of the Union,
F.	Whenever it is provided in this Schedule that there shall be no compounding of any premium pay and tiie payment for breach of the thirty-six (36) hour or fifty-six (56) (or fifty-four (54)) hour rest period, it is expressly understood that the eleven (11) or twelve (12) hour rest period between calls, and tiie payment for violation thereof, remains in effect.
G.	Any performer who is required to travel by air in excess of
four (4) scheduled hours to a location may not be called for work without a ten (10) hour rest period. The ten (10) hour rest period shall commence from the time of arrival at the hotel, provided the performer goes directly to tiie hotel designated by the Producer. Failure to provide such ten (10) hours constitutes a rest period violation:
10.	MEAL PERIODS
A.	Allowable meal periods shall not be counted as work time for any purpose. A meal period shall not be less than one-half (¥2) hour nor more than one (1) hour in length.

There will be a twelve (12) minute grace period, which is not to be a scheduled grace period, prior to imposition of any meal penalty, provided that the six (6) hour period between meals has not been extended as permitted by the following sentence. If, upon the expiration of such six (6) hour period, the camera is in the actual course of photography, it shall not be a violation to complete such photography. If, on location or while traveling to or from location, the delay is not due to any fault or negligence of the Producer or its agents or persons employed by it to render tiie catering service by contract, or if delay is caused by common carriers such as railroads, there shall be no penalty for violation of the above provisions. If tiie caterer is chosen carefully, and is delayed in

If the performer is given a non-deductible meal, a notation indicating the start and finish time of the meal shall be made on the production report. The first deductible meal period shall commence within six (6) hours of the end of such non-deductible meal.
If, by reason of a long make-up, wardrobe or hairdress period of a performer, application of the rule would require a meal period for such performer at a time earlier than that required for the rest of the set, Producer shall not be required to call such meal period if food, such as coffee and sandwiches, is made available to such performer before the time for his set call, it being understood that no deduction shall be made from work time for such period; it is further understood, however, that such performer shall be given a meal period within six (6) hours from the time such food is made available to the performer.
Outside the studio, when the crew is provided a meal or a meal allowance (as distinguished from per diem or penalty), the performers (other than those receiving a per diem allowance for meals on overnight locations) will be provided either a meal or a meal allowance when they have satisfied the same terms and conditions for entitlement to such meal or meal allowance as the crew.

When performer is not otherwise on compensable work time, performer shall be compensated for up to fifteen (15) minutes of time spent in the removal of ordinary make-up, hairdress or wardrobe at the applicable overtime rate. Such compensation shall be based on actual time and shall not trigger additional one-tenth (1/10) hourly increments of pay.

< _	-458-
Schedule H - Part 1
8.	OVERTIME
A.	A stunt performer shall receive time and one-half for the ninth and tenth hours of work time, and double time thereafter, except that stunt performers receiving more than two (2) times the day performer minimum rate per day shall receive time and one-half instead of double time after the tenth hour. For the purposes of such calculations, the maximum daily rate shall be two (2) times the day performer minimum rate.
B.	To illustrate the application of the foregoing:
A stunt performer receiving $716.00 (tiie applicable rate from October 1,2005 through June 30,2006) per day is called for make-up, hairdress or wardrobe at 7:30 a.m. He spends one (1) hour in such activities. He waits thirty (30) minutes and his call on the set is 9:00 a.m. He works until 1:00 p.m., and is off an hour for lunch. He works again from 2:00 pm. to 7:30 p.m. No time is spent in traveling. His
overtime pay is calculated as follows:
Total continuous day............ 11 hours
Overtime............................ 3	hours
Pay for overtime (a) Two hours at time-and-one-half....$268.50
(b) One hour at double time............. 179.00

D.	Whenever a performer receives overtime or an additional day of pay pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, such overtime or additional day of pay shall not be deemed to reduce such performer’s guaranteed employment or compensation.
-459-
Schedule H - Part I
9.	NON-SCRIPT STUNTS - ADJUSTMENT OF BACKGROUND ACTORS_______________________________
A.	The Producer agrees that all stunts called for by the script shall be performed by stunt performers hired directly.
B.	No background actor hired as such may be employed for
'■ script stunts on location, except for bonafide emergencies not within the \ y contemplation of Producer; and no background actor hired as such may be employed for script stunts at the studio if on that day he was
' employed as a background actor in the same production. "Emergency on \ y location," shall be defined as a situation on location in which a member of the cast (stunt performer) cannot perform because of unavailability for - - any reason. The Union, in its discretion, may grant waivers in light of x x other circumstances not expressly covered by such definition.
, C. A background actor hired as such may perform a non-script s	stunt, in which case the background actor shall be signed off as a
background actor and employed as a stunt performer. The performer so adjusted may be closed and signed off as a stunt performer and be re-employed in the same photoplay to perform background actor work.
A non-script stunt is defined as a stunt not called for or contemplated by the action in the script, and which is not pre-planned or s y preconceived and which is not deliberately omitted for the purpose of evading these provisions.
' D. The compensation due for the day to a performer hired as a background actor, whether by the day or week, and adjusted for
- '■ performing stunt work, including services as a background actor and as a \ s stunt performer, shall be computed as follows:
(1)	He shall receive his foil day of pay as a background K / actor.
(2)	In addition thereto, he shall receive his foil day of pay y as a stunt performer;
(3)	The Producer shall be entitled to a credit against the sum payable under (2) of that portion of the sum payable under (1) as represents the part of the day from and after the time the performer is signed off as a background actor, computed in tenths of an hour;
-460-
Schedule H - Part I
(4)	Overtime, if any, shall commence to accrue after the background actor so adjusted has rendered eight (8) hours of work as a stunt performer.
To illustrate the application of the foregoing rule:
A background actor starts work at 9:00 a.m. and works until 10:07 a.m. At 10:07 a.m., he is signed off as a background actor and employed as a stunt perfonner. He thereafter works seven and one-half (7%) hours as a stunt performer. Under subsection (1), he receives eight (8) hours of pay as a background actor; under subsection (2), he receives eight (8) hours of pay as a stunt performer; under subsection (3), the Producer is entitled to a credit of six (6) hours and forty-eight (48) minutes of pay at his background actor rate. Assume the performer's background actor rate is $122.00 per day and his stunt perfonner rate is $716.00. The perfonner would receive $734.30.
E.	Upon a written request from the Union, the Producer will
submit to the Union a report for the previous sixty (60) day period indicating whether, in that period, any background actor has been adjusted on one (1) day to the sum of $695.00 ($716.00 effective October 1,2005; $737.00 effective July 1,2006; and $759.00 effective July 1,2007) or more. Upon the written request of the Union, the Producer will also furnish a copy of the scripts involved and make the film available to the Union for viewing.
F.	For violations occurring under subsection B. of this Section, the following liquidated damages shall apply:
(a)	$250.00 for the first violation; and
(b)	$375.00 for the second and each succeeding violation thereafter.
These penalties shall not apply if there is a bona fide dispute as to whether the work is "hazardous" or "stunt work."
The foregoing Schedule shall be applicable on a per picture basis. When several violations occur in a single incident - for example, if six (6) persons are involved in one incident - if each were entitled to damages, each would be entitled to $250.00 only.

B.	Location Rates
	7/1/05 -9/30/05	10/1/05-6/30/06	7/1/06 -6/30/07	7/1/07 -6/30/08

W-4 forms shall be attached to day performer and three-day performer contracts.
The word "location," as used herein, shall mean any airport or air field where flying may actually be performed.
4.	RATE NOT SPECIFIED - EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS
ELYING_________________________________________________
The compensation hereinabove provided shall include all types of flying, excepting only that which has customarily been classified in the motion picture industry as extremely hazardous. For extremely hazardous flying, the pilot and the Producer shall agree upon the compensation to be paid to such pilot before the work is performed, if they may readily do so; however, it is expressly agreed that production shall not be delayed for the purpose of first determining the
-507-
Schcdulel
compensation for such work. In the event that the parties have not agreed upon the particular compensation to be paid for the work before the same has been performed, then the matter shall be settled by conciliation between the Producer and the Union by determining the compensation which has theretofore been customarily paid in the industry for such work. In the event that the matter cannot be settled by conciliation, the compensation will be determined by arbitration in the manner provided by Section 9 of the General Provisions hereof.
5.	OVERTIME
z A.

s works a total of ten (10) hours. His compensation for the first eight (8) hours is $1,353.20 (one-fifth (1/5) of $2,666.00, plus $820.00); his base rate per hour is $ 169.15; his compensation for overtime work is at the z rate of $253.73 an hour; total overtime compensation is $507.46, or a gross payment for the day in the example given of $ 1,860.66.
B.	When a pilot performs extremely hazardous work and is paid an additional sum therefor, such additional sum shall be included with his other compensation for the day for the purpose of computing the daily overtime. This provision is included for the reason that pilots do y not customarily expect or receive additional compensation over their stand-by and flight pay except in those unusual situations in which the flying is extremely hazardous.
6.	THE SEVENTH DAY IN THE WORKWEEK AND HOLIDAYS AND STUDIO SIXTH DAYS_
Compensation for holidays shall be at the rate of double time based x upon the pilot's hourly rate for such day.
Compensation for the sixth day worked in the performer's studio y workweek shall be at the rate of time and one-half based upon the pilot's hourly rate for such day.
Compensation for the seventh day worked in the performer's workweek shall be at the rate of double time based upon the pilot's hourly rate for such day.
-508-
Schedule I
7.	COMMERCIAL AIRLINERS, MILITARY AIRCRAFT, ETC.-WAIVERS________________________________________
Producer has requested the inclusion of a general exception in this Agreement which would automatically waive the foregoing provisions for the photographing of pilots operating commercial airliners, military aircraft, etc. The Union has refused to include such a broad and general provision; however, the Union does agree to issue waivers at the request of the Producer whenever it would be unreasonable to require the Producer to hire pilots who are members of the Union.

Schedule K - Part I
21. OVERLAPPING ENGAGEMENT
y In any case in which the engagement of a coordinator under a freelance contract extends into or overlaps any other engagement of such coordinator as a freelance coordinator or day coordinator
z	(1) because of any unanticipated delay in production or bona fide
mistake, or
s y (2) because of any failure of such coordinator to disclose his other engagements at the time of accepting any engagement, or

For any day or days on which the coordinator does not render his services either for the first Producer or for the second Producer, he s shall be compensated by the second Producer, unless the first and second
Producers agree between themselves (and notice thereof is given to the coordinator) that compensation for such additional day or days shall be paid by the first Producer. The compensation to be paid by die first v ' Producer shall be paid at the rate specified in the coordinator’s contract with the first Producer, and the compensation to be paid by the second ' ' Producer shall be at the rate specified in the coordinator's contract with x 7 the second Producer; provided, however, that if the rate paid by the first
Producer is less than the rate specified in the coordinator’s contract with the second Producer, the difference shall be paid by the second Producer v / and, provided further, that for any day or days on which the coordinator does not render services either for the first or for the second Producer, he ' shall be compensated at the rate of compensation which is the higher of x y the two. This paragraph does not affect such coordinator's right to receive compensation from both Producers when the coordinator, while , employed by one Producer, makes retakes, added scenes, etc., for the K y other Producer after the expiration of his term of employment with such other Producer, in any case in which the coordinator is otherwise entitled thereto.

y distance, meet these requirements; deluxe transportation (e.g, Super Chief) is not required. Transportation on a commercial airline without sleeper accommodations is first-class transportation. First-class
y transportation shall be provided on commercial airlines when the coordinator is required to fly at the request of the Producer. The
x	foregoing shall apply to jet flights as well as to prop-driven aircraft. The
foregoing shall not apply when first-class transportation is not available or six (6) or more of the company are being transported.

Scbedule K - Part n
T.	Travel Pursuant to Recall for Added Scenes, etc.
Any freelance coordinator living within the City of
Los Angeles or its environs, who is outside such area when he is recalled by the Producer for any of the reasons set forth in Section 21 hereof (including coordinators who are entitled to the provisions of the y following paragraph), shall be provided with transportation or reimbursed for the cost of transportation only, from the place where he is when recalled to the place designated by the Producer, by the particular s mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the coordinator may actually use. Return ' transportation shall be furnished or the coordinator shall be reimbursed z for such return transportation, as above set forth, only if the coordinator shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
Any coordinator living within the City of Los Angeles or its environs, who is at a place beyond a radius of one hundred fifty (150) y miles from the intersection of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega, Los Angeles, California, when he is recalled by Producer for any of the aforesaid reasons, shall be placed on salary as of the day he is directed to and does report to the place designated by Producer, and shall remain on salary each day until dismissed, except for the provisions relating to the sixth or seventh days in the workweek and holidays. If, after dismissal, the coordinator remains in this locality or delays his return, unless by the s Producer’s request, and is again recalled by the Producer, he shall not be entitled to any payment for the time intervening between his dismissal ' and his recall. The coordinator shall be entitled to travel time ' compensation based on the same rate for his principal engagement for the period of time, and only for the period of time that is required in traveling to and from the said place designated by the Producer by the z particular mode of transportation specified by the Producer, regardless of any other mode of transportation the coordinator may actually use. Such travel time compensation shall be computed in accordance with the z travel time allowance provisions for day coordinators as provided for in Schedule A. The said travel time allowance for the coordinator's return to the place of original departure shall be paid only if the coordinator s shall so return within one (1) week from the date of dismissal by Producer.
If the Producer designates the mode of transportation and the day of departure and the coordinator follows such directions, there shall be no lapse in payment for days intervening between end of travel and commencement of work.
-571 -
Schedule K-Part II
In the event the Producer does not specify the mode of transportation, then the travel time allowance shall be based upon the most expeditious mode of transportation possible, including travel by commercial airlines. The coordinator need not fly, but if he elects not to fly when requested to do so, it shall not increase the travel time allowance as specified above.
There shall be no duty on the Producer to procure return transportation for the coordinator so long as Producer pays for the same.
To illustrate the foregoing, a coordinator, a resident of Los Angeles, is temporarily in San Francisco. Within three (3) months from the close of his principal engagement, he is recalled by the Producer as follows: On a Monday, the Producer directs the coordinator to report at the Los Angeles studio of Producer at 11:00 a.m. on the following Thursday for retakes. The coordinator elects to travel by train. He departs from San Francisco on Wednesday night, arriving at Los Angeles Thursday morning, and reports at 11:00 a.m. The Producer dismisses the coordinator at 2:00 p.m. on the same day. The coordinator elects to return to San Francisco by train. The coordinator shall be entitled to one (1) day of pay at the same rate as was paid for his original engagement, plus the cost of transportation by commercial airline.
Transportation shall mean first-class transportation.
In the foregoing example, if the coordinator had been dismissed at 6:00 p.m. with an hour off for lunch (six (6) hours work, four (4) hours travel), the coordinator would have been entitled to pay for one (1) day plus two (2) hours at time and one-half. The coordinator shall not be entitled to a travel allowance of more than eight (8) hours in any period of twenty-four (24) hours and the coordinator shall not be entitled to any travel time allowance for a period of travel for which he is otherwise paid.
When principal photography takes place in New York, the provisions of this subsection T. shall apply to coordinators living in New York and absent therefrom and shall be applied, to other cities in the same manner by analogy.
Any out-of-state coordinator who is recalled for any of the purposes specified in Section 21 hereof shall not be required to remain in this locality after dismissal unless he is carried on salary during ihe period he is so required to wait
-572-
Schcdulc K - Part II
U.	Engagement of Coordinator - Other Areas
(1)	If a coordinator, residing or working in any area in which SAG maintains a branch, is brought to Producer's base or distant location in a different area of the United States for any purpose, the coordinator shall receive transportation and a $75 per day allowance from the time he commences travel at Producer's request until the time his salary commences.
■'	(2) If Producer is photographing on a location in the United
States and brings a coordinator to such location from anywhere in the United States, such coordinator shall be provided transportation to and y from such location.
(3)	Except as otherwise provided in (1) and (2) above, s nothing herein contained shall prevent a Producer from engaging a coordinator outside of California (if such coordinator has not gone out of California for the purpose of evading this rule) to report in California or y to report at any location and, in any such case, the Producer shall not be required to pay for or provide transportation of such coordinator to the . place of reporting or to pay such coordinator for any time spent in y traveling thereto; nor shall the Producer be required to pay for or provide transportation of such coordinator at the end of the engagement back to the place where such coordinator was engaged, or to pay such coordinator for any time spent in traveling back to the place where such ' coordinator was engaged; such coordinator may be dismissed on location. This does not limit the second sentence of subsection B. hereof.
(4)	Coordinators shall not be held on a per diem longer than three (3) days.
z
V.	General
z	(1) This Agreement uses the expressions "reasonable
transportation" and "first-class transportation." The terms are intended to be synonymous. The type of transportation required can best be y illustrated by examples: Bus transportation for a relatively short distance (Hollywood to Lake Arrowhead) meets these requirements; bus transportation for a long distance (Hollywood to San Francisco) does not. Pullman accommodations to San Francisco, or any other long distance, meet these requirements; deluxe transportation (e.g, Super Chief) is not required. Transportation on a commercial airline without sleeper accommodations is first-class transportation. First-class transportation shall be provided on commercial airlines when the
z	- 573 -
Schedule K - Part 11
coordinator is required to fly at the request of the Producer. The foregoing shall apply to jet flights as well as to prop-driven aircraft. The foregoing shall not apply when first-class transportation is not available or six (6) or more of the company are being transported. Charter flights may be used which provide substantially equivalent accommodations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, first-class air transportation need not be provided with respect to auditions and interviews.
28.	PROTECTION OF STUNT PER]

"First employment" shall be deemed to mean the first employment as a background actor in the motion picture industry in the Los Angeles Background Actor Zone, the Sacramento Background Actor Zone, the San Francisco Background Actor Zone, the Hawaii Background Actor
S	- 588 -
Schedule X - Part I
Zone, the Las Vegas Background Actor Zone or the San Diego Background Actor Zone on or after July 1,2005. The foregoing requirement of Union membership as a condition of employment shall be subject to the obligations of the parties under existing law.
As defined and applied in this Section, the term "member of the Union in good standing" means a person who offers to pay (and, if the Union accepts the offer, pays) union initiation fees and dues as financial obligations in accordance with the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.
The Producer agrees to report to the Union in writing within fifteen (15) days of its first employment of a non-member of the Union giving the non-inember's name, social security number, and his/her first date of employment by Producer. An inquiry by any Producer to the Union as to the first date on which a background actor has been employed in the industry shall be answered by the Union and its answer shall bind the Union; and the Producer, if it acts in good faith, shall not be liable for acting on such answer, but the Producer who fails to report shall be liable to the Union for such failure to report.
In the event that the interpretation of the phrase "first employment," as contained in the first paragraph of this Section 2, is changed by a ruling of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, then the new ruling of such General Counsel shall prevail until the same is overruled by the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction shall change such ruling in a proceeding in which the Union is a party, then die new ruling or opinion shall prevail until the same is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
The provisions of this Section 2 shall only apply to those background actors covered by this Schedule, as specified in Paragraph 1(c) and in the applicable respective "background actor zone," as above in Paragraph 1(d) defined by the parties, and no employment or use of a person as a background actor beyond the numbers specified in Section 1(c) or beyond such respective "background actor zone" shall be subject to this Section 2 or be considered as employment within the purview hereof.
Employment of individuals pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof shall not be construed to be "first employment" as a background actor in the motion picture industry, nor shall anything in this Schedule be construed as diminishing the rights of Producer under said Section 4.
-589-
ScheduleX-Parti
The Union agrees that it will not impose unreasonable initiation fees, and if the Producers claim a violation by the Union of the provisions of this sentence, such question shall be determined by ' arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions of this Schedule. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the Union to discipline or suspend or expel a member or to refuse to readmit him.
It is understood that it would be impossible to accurately fix the actual damages suffered by the Union by reason of a breach by the s Producer of the provisions of this Section. It is therefore agreed that in the absence of any other mutual agreement regarding damages, the ' Producer will pay to the Union, as liquidated damages, for breach by the / Producer of any of the provisions of this Section 2, the sum of $436.00 per person. Each continuous employment by a Producer of a person in - violation of the provisions hereof shall be deemed a single breach. As a x condition to the assessment of liquidated damages hereunder, the Producer shall be notified that an employee has failed to become a member of the Union as provided under this Section.
If the Union Security provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 are repealed, or so modified that it would be lawful for Producer to grant to the Union greater union security than is contained in this Section 2, or if the provisions of said Act with reference to union security are held unconstitutional in whole or in part by the Supreme Court of the United States, then and in either of said y events, either party hereto, by written notice served upon the other, may, within ten (10) days after such repeal or modification becomes effective, or the judgment of the United States Supreme Court becomes final, z reopen Sections 2 and 42 of this Schedule for further negotiations on the subjects of union security and preference of employment.

In the event of any dispute between the Union or any background actor employed under this Schedule and the Producer with regard to the proper application or interpretation of any of the provisions of this y Schedule, the procedure shall be as follows:
Step 1
An authorized representative of the Union and an authorized ' ' representative of the Producer shall immediately discuss the matter and x s attempt in good faith to effect a settlement of the dispute.
It is the policy of the Union and the Producers not to permit undue \ y delays in the presentation and processing of claims.
Step 2
x y
If the parties shall fail to settle the dispute in Step I within twenty (20) days after the matter has been brought to the attention of the other x s party in Step 1, the aggrieved party may refer the dispute to Step 2 by delivery to the other party of a written statement of the dispute stating the facts giving rise to the dispute. In the event the necessary film or tape or other necessary evidence is not available for examination in Step K y 1, then the twenty (20) day period may be extended to a period not to exceed ninety (90) days or, in the case of a feature film, to a longer period of time as may be agreed upon by the parties.
The dispute shall be submitted to a Grievance Committee which shall consist of two (2) representatives selected by the Union and two (2) x s representatives selected by the AMPTP. A hearing before such Grievance Committee shall, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, be ' ' held within ten (10) days following the written request to proceed to x y Step 2. The decision of the Grievance Committee shall be determined by a simple majority of the Grievance Committee and shall be final and binding on the Producer involved in the dispute, the Union and any
x z involved background actor.
s A Producer involved in the dispute who is not a member of the z AMPTP, nor amongst the Producers listed on Exhibit "A" of this
Agreement, may notify the Union and the AMPTP in writing, within ten (10) business days after receiving the written notice, to proceed to Step 2, advising the parties that such Producer will not be bound by a decision x	of the Grievance Committee and, in such event, the Union may bypass
-634-
Scbedule X - Part 1
Step 2 and proceed directly to arbitration as set forth in Step 3, by giving such Producer written notice to this effect
Step 3
In the event the Grievance Committee does not reach a decision and the dispute is not settled in Step 2, the aggrieved party may deliver to the other party a written demand for arbitration setting forth the facts and the issue(s) to be arbitrated. Within ten (10) days after receipt of such demand by the party being grieved, the parties shall jointly appoint an arbitrator who shall promptly proceed to hear the dispute. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then a list shall be obtained from the American Arbitration Association, from which the parties can select names. All grievance committee meetings and arbitrations relating to claims arising out of the employment of background actors under this Schedule shall be heard in Los Angeles, unless mutually agreed to otherwise by the parties.
The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing and shall be binding upon the Producer involved, the Union and any involved background actor. The arbitrator shall have the power to interpret and apply the provisions of this Schedule, but shall not have the power to modify, amend or add to any of its provisions, nor shall he/she have power to effect a change in its provisions. The arbitrator shall not have the power to determine jurisdictional disputes between the Union and any other labor organization. Fees and expenses of the arbitrator and a shorthand or court reporter, if any, shall be divided equally between the parties.
In the event it is necessary to exhibit film or tape in a proceeding under Step 2 or Step 3 of this grievance procedure, the direct labor costs of using a craft person and/or rental of equipment and/or space to exhibit such film or tape shall be divided equally between the Producer and the Union.

-635-
Schedule X - Part I
In the event that any provision of this Schedule relating to the
, amounts and payment of wages or other financial benefits is affected by x z any legislation, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, or governmental regulation in such manner so that such wages or other financial benefits would be increased over, or decreased under, the amount intended to be paid by the parties hereto at the time of the execution of this Agreement, then each of the parties hereto agrees that upon written notice from the other party setting forth the provisions to be negotiated, they will renegotiate for modification of such provisions so v y that such provisions will conform to such legislation, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulation, as the case may
' be, and will provide, as nearly as possible, for payment of wages or other y financial benefits, in the amount intended to be paid by the parties hereto at the time of the execution hereof. If the parties are unable to arrive at - an agreement within thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice, then v y such provisions in question shall be immediately submitted to an

following such thirty (30) day period provided above. This Arbitration x Committee shall promptly proceed to hear and settle such matter. The y authority of this Arbitration Committee to decide shall be limited solely to determining the appropriate modifications of such provisions so that such provisions will conform to such legislation, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, or governmental regulation, as the case may be, and will provide, as nearly as possible, for the payment of wages and other financial benefits in the amount intended to be paid by the parties at the time of execution of this Agreement. The terms and conditions of
K y such appropriate modifications, if any, by the said Arbitration Committee, shall be effective and operative as of the date on which the provisions, so modified accordingly, were so affected by any such
K y legislation, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulation, as the case may be, in such manner and to the extent as
' above-described and provided; the amounts and payments of wages, or v y other financial benefits contained in such appropriate modifications, if any, made by such Arbitration Committee, shall be computed and paid thereunder retroactive to the effective date of such modifications. In the x y event that no such modifications can be made, as above provided, because of any legislation, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulation, Producer shall not be liable for any
v y retroactive back-pay adjustments, or any other penalty, if any such modification is thereafter permissible. The decision of the said Arbitration Committee shall be final, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure in Section 55 above, but its authority to decide shall be limited to the issue and remedy herein provided. The above
-636-
Schedule X - Part I
procedure and conditions shall be the exclusive remedy for determining any dispute arising under this Section 56.
Upon written notice by such Arbitration Committee to the respective parties hereto, the modification of such provisions as determined by said Committee, as above provided, shall automatically become a part of this Agreement.

In such zone, it is agreed that for motion pictures not based in New York, only the minimum wage scales and working conditions of this Agreement shall apply.

The foregoing requirement of Union membership x as a condition of employment shall be subject to the obligations of the parties under existing law.
As defined and applied in this Section, the term "member of the Union in good standing" means a person who offers to pay (and, if the y Union accepts the offer, pays) Union initiation fees and dues as financial obligations in accordance with the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.
The Producer agrees to report to the Union in writing within fifteen (15) days of its first employment of a non-member of the Union, giving y the non-member's name, Social Security number, and his first date of employment by Producer. An inquiry by any Producer to the Union as ■ to tiie first date on which a background actor has been employed in the z industry shall be answered by the Union, and its answer shall bind the Union; and the Producer, if it acts in good faith, shall not be liable for acting on such answer, but the Producer who fails to report shall be z liable to the Union for such failure to report.
The interpretation of "first employment" contained in the first subparagraph of this numbered Section has been approved by an advisory opinion of the General Counsel of die National Labor Relations Board. If such approval of such sentence is changed by a ruling of such General Counsel, then the new ruling of such General Counsel shall y prevail until the same is overruled by the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction. If the Board or a court of competent jurisdiction shall
.	-655-
Schedule X, Part II
change such ruling in a proceeding in which the Guild is a party, then the new ruling or opinion shall prevail until the same is reversed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
As to motion pictures based in New York, such Union Security provisions shall apply only in the background actor zone described in Section l.A. above; as to motion pictures not based in New York, such Union Security provisions shall apply only in the zone described in Section 1 B.(l) above; and no employment or use of a person as a background actor beyond the applicable "background actor zone" shall be subject to this numbered Section or be considered as employment within the purview of this Schedule.
Employment of individuals pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 hereof, entitled "Waivers," shall not be construed to be "first employment as a background actor in the motion picture industry;" nor shall anything in this Schedule be construed as diminishing the rights of Producer under said Section 4.
The Union agrees that it will not impose unreasonable initiation fees, and if the Producers claim a violation by the Union of the provisions of this sentence, such question shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall limit the right of the Union to discipline or suspend or expel a member, or to refuse to readmit him.
It is understood that it would be impossible to fix accurately the actual damages suffered by the Union by reason of a breach by the Producer of the provisions of this Section. It is therefore agreed that in the absence of any other mutual agreement regarding damages, the Producer will pay to the Union, as liquidated damages, for breach by the Producer of any of the provisions of this numbered Section, the sum of $436.00 per person. Each continuous employment by a Producer of a person in violation of the provisions hereof shall be deemed a single breach.
If the Union Security provisions of the Labor-Management Act of 1947 are repealed, or so modified that it would be lawful for Producer to grant to the Union greater union security than is contained in Section 2 hereof, or if the provisions of said Act with reference to union security are held unconstitutional in whole or in part by the Supreme Court of the United States, then and in either of said events, either party hereto, by written notice served upon the other, may, within ten (10) days after such repeal or modification becomes effective or the judgment of the United States Supreme Court becomes final, reopen Sections 2 and 43 of
-656-

If the Union shall fail to do so, tiie Producer may proceed in a like manner as though the Union had issued a reviewable waiver, so notifying the Union in writing and with the same effect as in tiie case of a reviewable waiver.

43.	PREFERENCE OF EMPLOYMENT
In recognition of the services rendered to Producers by qualified background actors who have held themselves available for employment in the industry, it is agreed that the Producer shall give preference of employment in filling calls for background actor work to background actors carried on the rolls of those casting agencies designated by agreement of the Industry-Union Cooperative Committee. Such background actors are hereinafter referred to as "registered background actors." (Also see Section 56 of the General Provisions covering body doubles.)
Only in the event such registered background actors are unqualified, or are insufficient in number, or are not readily available according to the present general hiring practices of the designated agencies to meet the employment needs of the Producer may the Producer secure employees from any other source. Producer or the hiring agency will notify the Union prior to so securing employees to perform background actor work from other sources. If the Union claims that there are registered background actors, qualified, sufficient in number, and readily available in accordance with the present general hiring practice of the designated agencies, to meet the employment needs of the Producer, the Producer may nevertheless hire persons from other sources, but the Union may submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration procedure provided in Section 55 hereof.
It is further agreed that additional persons who have ability, talent or usability for background actor work hereafter may be registered by the agencies designated only in those instances when there is not readily
-692-
Schedule X, Part II
available under the present general hiring practices of the designated agencies an adequate supply of qualified background actors. Such persons who are registered during the term of this Agreement shall become entitled to the same preference of employment as background actors then registered.

In the absence of such protest, the registration will be deemed complete. When the Union protests within the time aforesaid, the matter will be settled by reference to a "special committee" composed of five (5) Producer representatives on the Industry-Union Cooperative Committee. The decision of the majority of such "special committee" as to the propriety of the registration of such person as a qualified background actor shall be final and binding on the parties.
Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to in any manner limit the Producer’s present exclusive right to cast background actors and reduce the number of registered background actors.
It is agreed that Producer will give preference in giving call-backs and making adjustments to registered background actors, except as to background actors who have been "established” in the scene concerned.
It is understood that it would be impossible to fix accurately the actual damages suffered by the Union by reason of a breach by the Producer of the provisions of this Section 43. It is therefore agreed that, in the absence of any other mutual agreement regarding liquidated damages for such breach, the claim shall be referred to the Industry-Union Cooperative Committee and its decision of such dispute shall be final and binding. If the Cooperative Committee is unable to mediate or adjust any complaint alleging a breach of this Section 43, the matter may be referred to binding arbitration.

B.	Producer shall cast background actors in accordance with the policy set forth in subparagraph A. above in all types of roles, having due regard for the requirement of and suitability for the role so that, for example, the American scene may be portrayed realistically.

Re:	Policy on Counting "No Shows" Toward Number of "Covered"
Extra Performers
Dear John:
Reference is made to the provisions of Section I.D. of Schedule X, Part II, which limits the number of "covered" extra performers on each call.
This will confirm that the practice of the Producers has been to include those registered extra performers who accept a call for work but who fail to report (i.e., "no-shows") tn the count for purposes of determining if the applicable numerical limit has been reached. This will confirm y that in changing the "Scope of Agreement" provisions during the 1998 negotiations, the parties did not intend to change the practice with regard to counting "no-shows" toward the applicable x numerical limit of "covered" extra performers.
