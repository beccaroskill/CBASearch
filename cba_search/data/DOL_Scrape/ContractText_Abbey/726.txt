EXHIBIT A
WAGE SCHEDULE ADMINISTRATION
SECTION A. Progression of increases within the wage schedule are to proceed according to “Interval To Increase''. An employee is to be paid at least the start rate but not in excess of the maximum rate of the wage schedule for their job classification. An employee's wage rate within the wage schedule is not necessarily determined by total service with the Company.
SECTION A.1. "Interval To Increase" is the required months of service between progression wage increases.
SECTION A.2. Progression increases for employees who have been granted wage credit shall proceed in accord with the interval to increase, or the remainder thereof, as designated by the position of the wage rate on the wage schedule.
SECTION A.2.1	. Part-time employees will achieve progression increases based on cumulative hours worked equivalent to the appropriate interval to increase.
SECTION A.3. In determining wage rate progression, excused absences not to exceed 30 calendar days a year (22 accumulative work days) and non-worked paid time shall be considered as time worked. Changes in rate of pay shall be effective on the first of each pay period. If the change would otherwise become effective during the first half of the pay period, it will be set forward, and if the change would otherwise become effective during the second half of the pay period, it will be deferred to the first day of the next pay period.
SECTION B. If an employee is changed to another job on a higher wage schedule, the employee's rate is to be adjusted to the rate on the higher wage schedule that is immediately above the employee's current rate. If an employee is displaced by reason of force reduction and subsequently returns to his/her previous classification within two (2) years or less the employee will be returned to the same position on the wage schedule previously held. Subsequent progression increases will proceed from the date of the previous progression increase.
SECTION B.1.	Employees on incentive plans otherthan the Team Performance Award will receive a wage adjustment to the next higher rate on the higher wage schedule, which results in a minimum increase of no less than seventy-five ($.75) per hour.
SECTION B.2.	If an employee is changed to another job on a lower wage schedule, the employee's rate is to be adjusted to the rate on the lower wage schedule that is the same as or immediately below the
46
employee's current rate. Subsequent progression increases will proceed from the date of the previous progression increase.
SECTION B.3.	If an employee is changed to another job on the same wage schedule, there will be no change in rate. Progression increases will proceed from the date of the previous progression increase.
SECTION C. Employees placed in-charge shall be paid $.75 an hour as a differential for each hour served in that capacity.

COMPENSATED AVAILABILITY
In selected classifications and locations, where business needs exist, Compensated Availability will be established.
1.	The election to participate in Compensated Availability will normally be voluntary on the part of the employee. However, where business needs exist, management may assign an employee(s) to Compensated Availability.
2.	Compensated Availability may be utilized for after-hours call-outs involving critical or emergency services. Compensated Availability may also be offered to cover anticipated high activity levels. Employees on after-hours Compensated Availability shall be excused from normal overtime assignments. An employee who is unable to complete a regularly scheduled tour because the employee did not obtain sufficient rest the previous night due to working on "compensated availability" will not have such failure to complete a regularly scheduled tour held against them in any way.
3.	Such "Compensated Availability" shall be rotated among those qualified employees in the selected classifications and locations by seniority with volunteers and if assigned the selection of the rotated assignments shall be by inverse seniority recognizing previous volunteer assignments in the rotation. This rotation shall begin and end with each calendar year. The Compensated Availability schedule shall be posted in the appropriate location and reporting center.
4.	Compensation shall be $125.00 for a calendar week assignment (week assignments will include Saturday and Sunday of the same weekend). Single assignments shall be compensated at $15.00 per day and $25.00 per non-scheduled day.
5.	Primary contact to the employee will be via the regular telephone switch network. In such areas where other technology may be available to supplement the contact (pagers, etc.) Such will be used at Company
60
discretion.
6.	If work is performed, the employee shall receive the minimum compensation referenced in Article 6, Section 6.6, for each instance that they are called from home. In addition, the employee shall be paid overtime computed from the time the employee leaves home until returning home. The employee shall receive a minimum/maximum of one (1) hour pay at the overtime rate if the work performed is cleared remotely from the employee's home.
7.	This practice does not supersede normal call-out procedures if additional employees are required to work.
8.	Employees assigned to such duty must be available and accessible during the term of assignment in order to receive compensation.
9.	When assigned "Compensated Availability" the employee may be granted permission where practical to take a Company vehicle home if not already participating in Home dispatch. The employee shall exercise reasonable care for the security and safety of the vehicle and tools. It is understood the vehicle and tools are not available for personal use.
10.	If "Compensated Availability" assignments conflict with the employees personal calendar, he or she will be afforded the opportunity to trade days or weeks with supervisory approval. Solicitation of the trade will be the responsibility of the employee.
11.	It is not the intent of this agreement to circumvent vacation or holiday
scheduling, payment, premiums or overtime provisions.
This Memorandum of Agreement shall become effective on October 27,2002 and shall expire on October 22,2005. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement, including Compensated Availability, shall also terminate on October 22,2005. If the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers believes that the assignment of Compensated Availability is being abused, the parties agree to meet and discuss the situation.

2.	It is not the intent of the policy to require a drug/alcohol screen as a result of a performance problem(s), in and of itself, without the presence of indicators that would cause a "reasonable person" to conclude that the individual could be under the influence of a drug or alcohol. This is to say that a single indicator that could be the result of many different conditions would not be the sole factor that would result tn a requirement for a drug/alcohol screening.
3.	The Company acknowledges that employees will have the right to union representation, as provided by the Weingarten decision, during the screening process. The Company has not agreed to representation that is beyond that provided in Weingarten.
4.	At the time the specimen is collected, the employee will be provided the opportunity to have a split specimen. The 2nd specimen will be properly sealed and maintained as to be available for retest at the request of the employee and/or union.
5.	The Company agrees that the employee who tests positive on both the screen and the confirmation test will have the option to request the second part of the original specimen to be released to a NIDA certified lab to be retested. The Company's responsibility for the chain of custody ends when the specimen is released at the direction of the second testing lab. This request must be made by the Union or the employee within ten (10) work days from the date toe original test result is provided to the employee. The employee will notify the Verizon Medical Review Officer
75
and the Regional Labor Relations Director of his/her intention to have a confirmatory retest. Upon request, the employee will arrange for the retest. The employee is responsible for all additional costs. The results of this retest will be forwarded to the Company as soon as the results are available for the Company's consideration. .
If the second test is negative the Company will reimburse the employee for all costs of such test.
6.	In the case of a ''positive'' test result, the employee shall be so advised by the Company’s medical review officer or designee on a confidential basis, prior to the reporting of the results to the employer, and the employee shall have the right to discuss and explain the results, including the right to advise the employer's medical review officer or designee of any medication prescribed by his/her own physician, which may have affected the results of the test.
7.	The Company agrees to delete the portion of the consent form that reads "I hereby release Verizon, its employees and any such designated institution or person from any liability resulting from the medical procedures outlined below".
8.	The Company agrees to hold harmless and indemnify the Union against liabilities resulting from the implementation and administration of the Company's Drug and Alcohol Policy.
9.	The Company agrees to provide information to employees concerning the Employee Assistance Program and/or availability of public and private drug counseling, rehabilitation and other drug and alcohol abuse treatment programs.
10.	It is understood that a decision to discipline as a result of a positive test
as determined by the GCMS method would depend on all circumstances surrounding the particular situation and would be based on established just cause standards.
11.	It is agreed that an employee who tests positive on the first occasion will not be terminated as a result of this first test, unless surrounding the incident that resulted in the requirement for the test there are other performance or behavior problems that warrant discharge.
12.	The Company agrees that an employee will not be subject to unannounced testing beyond one year as a result of the post-treatment provisions of the Policy.
13.	It is not the intent of the Policy to require drug or alcohol screening after an accident (in which no death occurs) as a result of behavior which can clearly be attributed to the accident alone.

In order to lessen the economic impact upon regular employees who become surplus due to technological change, the Company and the Union agree to establish the INCOME SECURITY PLAN (the Plan).

'Technological change" shall not include layoffs or force realignments caused by business conditions, variations in subscribers' requirements, or temporary or seasonal interruptions of work.
When technological change brings about any of the following conditions, the Plan shall apply:
A.	A need to layoff and/or force realign employees in any job title.
B.	Reassignment of regular employees to permanent headquarters fifty (50) miles or more from the employee's permanent headquarters.

A.	Accredited service of one year or more;
B.	No comparable assignment available within fifty (50) miles of the former permanent headquarters and/or refusal of reassignment to a new permanent headquarters fifty (50) miles or more from the
97

However, the Company reserves the right to apply this Plan to any surplus in force, whether or not it is brought about by technological change, that the Company deems appropriate. All elections shall be voluntary and acceptance by the Company will be in order of seniority.
3.	The Company reserves the right to determine the job titles and work group(s) and/or work location(s) in which a surplus exists, the number of work groups and/or work locations in which a surplus exists, the number of employees in such titles and locations which are considered to be surplus, and the period during which the employee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the Company pursuant to this Plan. In no event shall the number of employee elections accepted under the terms of the Plan exceed the number of employees determined by the Company to be surplus.
4.	For those employees who are eligible in accordance with Sections 1 and 2, the Company will provide ISP Termination pay benefits:
A.	ISP Termination Allowance of $1,100, less withholding taxes, for each completed year of accredited service up to and including thirty (30) years for a maximum of $33,000 prior to withholding taxes. The ISP Termination Allowance is not prorated for any partial year of service.
B.	In addition to the ISP Termination Allowance, the Company shall pay an employee who has left the service of the Company with ISP benefits an ISP Expense Allowance not to exceed $750, less withholding taxes, for each completed year of accredited service for a maximum of $3,750 prior to withholding taxes. The ISP Expense Allowance is not prorated for any partial year of service.
The combined maximum ISP Termination pay benefit payable as set forth in Paragraphs A and B of this Section 4 shall in no event exceed a total of $36,750.
The dollar amounts set forth in this Agreement shall be prorated for regular part-time employees based on the average hours worked during the last twenty-six (26) pay periods; i.e., average of thirty (30) hours worked per week would result in termination benefits paid at 75% of those set forth in Paragraphs A and B of this Section 4.
5.	Employees eligible for ISP Termination Allowance in accordance with Section 2 will receive a lump sum payment for the entire amount of the ISP Termination Allowance paid in the month following the month in which the employee leaves the service of the Company.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
Between
VERIZON NORTH INC. (NORTH CENTRAL REGIONJ/GTE COMPANIES
And
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 986 (IBEW)
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between Verizon North Inc. (North Central Region) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 986, covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing; access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual Interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sales and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Verizon's business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union’s goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding Neutrality and Consent election will be applicable to Verizon's former “GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics). This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the
116
parties' mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Verizon Labor Relations staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be antimanagement.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a Union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a "third party" or "outsider".
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement
3.	Rules
117
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit	.
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will "start the clock". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no-event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
5.	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a Labor Union. Management's role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities; and
(c)	Correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
118
6.
Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called “Consent Election”. This process will work as follows:
(1)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use "Consent Election".
(2)	The Union shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The "show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union's show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	in all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days.

If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.

7.
Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the IBEW for access, Verizon Labor Relations staff, in conjunction with focal management and IBEW representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the IBEW representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and the IBEW that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and the IBEW are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and the IBEW commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
8.	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate IBEW representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and the IBEW that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either Verizon or the IBEW can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access
120
(d)
(e)
(0
(i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Verizon and IBEW believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between die parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and the IBEW agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
121
(g) All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by Verizon and IBEW.
9.	Acquisitions and Ventures
10.
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry, Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in those entities may be non-represented, represented in whole or in the part of the IBEW, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.
Duration
This MOA shall be effective October 27,2002, and shall remain in effect until October 22, 2005.

TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD
1.	Verizon North Inc. (North Central Region) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 986 agree to develop and implement a Team Performance Award which will provide participating employees the opportunity to earn compensation based upon collective/team performance results.
2.	ELIGIBILITY
All full-time and part-time regular hourly employees are eligible to receive an award if they are on a TPA team for 30 calendar days or more. Employees on other Incentive plans are not eligible, i.e., BSG, Consumer Sales, Retail, LiveSource.
3.	AWARDS
Awards are based on performance toward objectives over the period of a calendar year. An award amount is determined for the applicable calendar year, a percentage of which may be earned by eligible employees, depending on team performance during that calendar year. The payout ranges from 0% to 120% of an established target.
The range of the Team Performance Award payout is as follows:
A.	The 2002 target award is 4% payable in April 2003. The range is 0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
B.	The 2003 target award is 4% payable in April 2004. The range is 0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
C.	The 2004 target award is 4% payable in April 2005. The range is 0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
The payout percentage is applied to an employee's highest hourly basic rate of pay during the 26 pay periods of the calendar year.
Employees transferring between teams shall have their award prorated according to the time on each team.
In the event of reorganization which results in employees changing teams, awards shall be prorated based upon each team's performance.
An employee who resigns, is laid off, terminated, dies or retires during the calendar year is eligible for a prorated Team Performance Award if all other eligibility requirements have been met.*
*	In case of Termination for Cause the individual situation will be
152
reviewed to determine if the individual is eligible for an award.
*	Temporary and seasonal employees are eligible for a prorated Team Performance award if all other eligibility requirements are met
Employees on approved military leave of absence who have one year or more service will be given a full wage credit up to three months toward the Team Performance Award. Employees on any other unpaid leave will have cumulative leave time excluded from award computation.
4.	TIME OFF FOR UNION ACTIVITIES
Excused time off for union activity will be counted as time worked when computing Team Performance Awards.
5.	BENEFITS TREATMENT
Team Performance Award payments are recognized in the calculation of Pension Plan benefits, Group Life Insurance, and the Hourly Savings Plan. Such payments will be applicable in the year payment is received. This is in accordance with benefit plan definitions.
All other benefits are in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and are based on rates shown in the hourly wage schedules.
6.	TAXES, PERSONAL ALLOTMENT
Deductions for federal, state and local tax liabilities will be made in accordance with lump sum distribution tax laws.
Personal allotments such as savings bonds, and United Way contributions will not be made.
7.	OVERTIME
The Team Performance Award payouts are for hours worked and must be included in overtime payments.
The overtime payment will be calculated as follows:
The Team Performance Award payout divided by the total hours worked equals the award hourly rate. This rate is then multiplied times .5 x number of overtime hours in the same calendar year for which the Team Performance Award was paid. The result of this calculation is the award overtime payment due the employee.
153
EXAMPLE:
Team Performance Award divided by	$ 500
Total Hours Worked	.	1,800
Equals	
Award Hourly Rate	$ 0.2659
Times	
Overtime Rate (1/2)	0.5
Equals	
Hourly Overtime Rate of Pay	$0.1329
Times	
Total Overtime Hours	100
Equals	
Award Overtime Payment	$ 13.29
The overtime-incentive payment is not included in benefit plan calculations.
A Team Performance Award overtime payment will be included in the award payout.
8.	OBJECTIVE/MEASURES
All hourly employees will normally be assigned to teams based on their functional area of responsibility. Teams may consist of a few employees or many.
Each team will be given a set of objectives linked to, but not limited to, one or more of these performance areas:
-	Quality/Value of services delivered
-	Productivity
-	Expense Budget
-	Revenue
Teams that satisfy a minimum level of performance will receive an incentive payment. If that minimum level of performance is exceeded, the incentive payment will be larger. Each member of a team will receive the same percentage of target award that the team achieved. An example would be as follows:
Level of Performance Below minimum Minimum to Target Target Over Target Maximum 1!	Percentage of Target Award 0% 10-99% 100% 101 -120% 54 u
9.	The Company reserves the right to establish objectives and determine performance results. The objectives, the performance results, or any part of the Team Performance Award shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
10.	Prior to the announcement of objectives and performance targets for the applicable year, company representatives will meet with Union representatives to review the rationale for such objectives and targets.
11.	MODIFICATION OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE PLAN
Verizon may at any time modify, in part or in whole, the Team Performance Award Plan. Any modification shall not affect awards already earned under this plan. The Company reserves the right to modify team structure as may be necessary.
12.	TERMINATION OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE PLAN
The suspension or termination must be by mutual agreement of the parties.

(b)	When the Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums for the $350 deductible coverage option under GTE RETIREE OPTIONS reach the figures set forth in the chart below ("Capped Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums"), the Company Contribution Amount shall be capped and the Company shalt make no additional contributions towards Retiree Medical Benefits Premiums.

6.	In order to receive Retiree Medical Benefits, the retiree must pay the Company the amount the Retiree Medical Premium exceeds the Company Contribution Amount as described in paragraphs 4 and 5 above ("Retiree Contribution Amount”).
