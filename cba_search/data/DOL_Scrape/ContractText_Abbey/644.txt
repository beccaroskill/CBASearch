In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as provided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the Employer shall pay a total contribution rate of one dollar and forty four cents ($1.44) per hour, which reflects the sum of the contribution rate required in the Employer Contribution section, the supplemental contribution rate of this section and the new hire benefit contribution rate provided herein.
ii.	Default Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan do not adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule, but instead adopt a legally valid "Default Schedule” within the meaning of the PPA, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required under the Default Schedule effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours); provided that in no event shall such contribution rate be payable prior to the effective date of all of the benefit adjustments required under the Default Schedule. For example, if the Default Schedule benefit adjustments do not become effective until the start of the
34
Rehabilitation Period under the PPA, the Employer shall not be required to pay the Default Schedule contribution rates until that time.
If any required Default Schedule contribution rate exceeds the rate provided for under subsection (i) above, then each annual increase in the top pay rate provided for in this contract shall be permanently reduced by fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour, and ten cents ($0.10) per hour in the case of Courtesy Clerks, effective with the next scheduled pay rate increase following the implementation of the Default Schedule contribution rate. The permanent reductions provided for herein shall continue year after year. It is understood that each annual top rate increase will be reduced until either sufficient reductions have occurred so as to equal the amount of the increase to the supplemental contribution rate of subsection (i) caused by the implementation of the default schedule or until the date on which the employer implements contribution rates which are reduced to, or below, the contribution rates under subsection (i) above and in accordance with subsection (vii) below, whichever occurs first, but in no event shall any such wage reductions made be restored.
iii.	Long-Term Funding Policy Contribution Rates: In the event the Alternate Schedule in subsection (i) above and the Default Schedule in subsection (ii) above are not applicable during the term of this agreement, but the Long-Term Funding Policy is implemented, the Employer shall not be obligated to pay a supplemental contribution under any other provision of this Agreement, but shall continue to pay the base contribution specified in the Employer Contribution Section plus a supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) that shall not exceed fifty five cents ($0.55) per hour. This supplemental contribution shall be a contribution amount which has the same proportionate value relative to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy as the value of the supplemental contribution of fifty five cents ($0.55) per hour under subsection (i) has to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Alternate Schedule. This approach shall be accomplished by utilizing the following formula: a) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy, divided by b) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule, multiplied by c) the supplemental contribution of fifty five cents ($0.55) per hour under subsection (i). These calculations shall be made by the employer consultants and shall be final and binding on ail parties.
For example: If $5M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy and if $1()M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule and fifty five cents ($0.55) per hour is the supplemental contribution under subsection (i), then the supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) is $0.55 times $5M divided by $10M, or twenty seven and one-half cents ($0,275) per hour.
iv.	It is understood and agreed that the Employer may reduce the amount of any of the above supplemental contributions due the Trust (but not below zero) by the amount of any surcharge, deficiency or excise tax required to be paid by the Employer any time after entering Critical Status. The supplemental contribution provided for herein shall be dedicated solely to improving the funding of the Plan, and shall not be used to increase or improve benefits, and will be reduced or discontinued upon determination by the Plan’s Trustees, based on projections provided by the Plan’s actuaries, that such supplemental contributions are no longer needed to support the level of benefits provided for under the Plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (vii) below.
35
v.	As a result of the Plan's having been certified as being in critical status for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2009, the Trustees are authorized to adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached as Appendix B hereto (if they believe it is appropriate to do so). If the Alternate Schedule is adopted by the Trustees, it is hereby deemed approved by the bargaining parties and automatically incorporated into this Agreement.
vi.	In no event shall any contribution increases be required during the term of this Agreement as a result of any annual updates or other changes to the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule or, if applicable, to any Default Schedule.
vii.	In the event the Trustees determine, based on projections provided by the actuaries for the Plan, that, at any time during the term of this Agreement, an Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule with lesser contribution rates and/or benefit reductions would be sufficient to reasonably enable the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, the Trustees may amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule in a manner that, to the extent possible, would restore reduced benefits and would reduce the Employer’s supplemental contribution in an equal manner and amount, based on actuarial equivalence, provided that such modifications to the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule would still allow the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, taking into account to the extent legally permitted any relief available under IRC Section 431(d). In the event the Trustees amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule as provided in this subsection (vii), then the parties agree to adjust the supplemental contribution rates provided above to reflect the lower rates in the amended Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the effective date of any benefit cuts specified in the Alternate Schedule or the Default Schedule, the Trustees determine that (a) such benefit cuts are no longer required to avoid critical status or to have a valid Rehabilitation Plan, and (b) the supplemental contribution could be reduced or eliminated, then the Employer supplemental contribution shall be reduced or eliminated accordingly, and the Employer shall be further entitled to recoup the value of any supplemental contribution paid prior to the effective date of the benefit reductions set forth in the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. This provision shall apply regardless of the reason for the Trustees’ determination, including a change in the law (e.g., a further extension of the Plan’s green status) and/or improved investment returns. The value of the contributions shall be recouped via a suspension of contributions in an amount equal to the amount of the supplemental contribution paid.
viii.	The Board of Trustees is authorized to take all reasonable measures to cooperate and assist in achieving the objectives set forth in this Section.
Clerk's New Hire Benefit
If the Trustees adopt the Alternate Schedule described above, and such Schedule becomes fully effective, the Trustees are authorized to amend the Plan (if they believe it is appropriate to do so) in order to provide the following Benefit for those participants whose employers have adopted the Alternate Schedule above. Newly hired employees hired after March 6,2005 shall be eligible to receive an accrual rate per month for each year of credited service earned by such employees, commencing on January 1,2010 (i.e., for service on or after January 1,2010) subject to (he following terms, conditions and limitations:

Appendix ’’A'
The minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.
Rate Determination
Employees hired before March 27, 2005 who remain in their classification after commencement of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the "hired and assigned in the bargaining unit prior to March 27, 2005” wage schedule while they remain in that classification.
Demotions, Step Downs and layoffs: An employee who is demoted, steps down, or who is laid off in accordance with this Agreement, shall be placed back into the same wage schedule in which the employee was working immediately prior to their assignment into management or promotion into the classification from which they are being demoted, stepping down or laid off. In determining the proper progression level for an employee demoted, stepping down, or laid off from a classification with a higher ’’thereafter'1 hourly rate to a classification with a lower "thereafter” hourly rate, such affected employee shall be placed in the appropriate progression level in the rate schedule referenced in this paragraph based on their experience in the newly assigned classification, regardless of whether such assigned rate results in a reduction in hourly rate. In determining prior experience hereunder, the Employer will give recognition to the verified number of hours of actual work experience in the same classification which said employee may have performed for the Employer and the verified number of hours of actual work experience on a comparable job which said employee may have performed within the previous live (5) years for any other employer in a similar retail grocery operation.
Rate Determination - Promotions, new hires and new entrants into the bargaining unit: Employees hired into, or assigned to, or promoted to a different classification, the bargaining unit on or after March 27, 2005 shall be assigned to the "EMPLOYEES HIRED INTO THE BARGAINING UNIT OR ASSIGNED OR PROMOTED ON OR AFTER MARCH 27, 2005” wage scale. Employees who are promoted to a different classification after March 26, 2005 shall not receive a reduction in their hourly rate of pay if when promoted to such classification they are being paid an hourly rate of pay greater than the minimum, unless they are above the "thereafter” hourly rate in which case they will immediately be paid the "thereafter" hourly rate. When such employee is paid less than the "thereafter" hourly rate, prior to receiving an increase in their hourly rate of pay, they must work 1,040 hours at their current rate before promotion to the hourly rate in the new classification that would give them an increase in their hourly rale of pay.
Ratification Bonus: Effective no later than the second Sunday following ratification, all employees who have been continuously employed for one consecutive year, to the date of ratification, shall receive a gift card (net of taxes) equal to SI,000 for top rate FT, employees, $500 for top rate PT employees, $400 for employees in wage progression and $150 for Courtesy Clerks.

January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2022.
Plan to Emerge from the Red Zone and Annual Benchmarks to Assess Progress Toward Emergence______________________________________________________________________
The Plan’s actuaries certify that the Contribution and Benefit Adjustments shown above are sufficient for the Plan to emerge from the Red Zone at the end of the Rehabilitation Period based on the funded status of the Plan as of January 1,2009 before the addition of any New Hire benefits. In the event that the New Hire benefits arc implemented, the
83
Plan’s actuaries certify that with the additional contributions specifically designated to fund the New Hire benefits, the plan is still reasonably expected to emerge from Critical Status after such benefit increases, as shown in the annual benchmarks including the New' Hire benefits. These schedules will be updated as needed throughout the Rehabilitation Period. Progress toward emergence from the Red Zone will be measured by the Plan’s Funding Standard Account Credit (Deficiency) Balance being greater than (less than) the amounts in the following projections. These projections have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 including:
•	Contribution rates effective for hours worked in December 2009 payable in January 2010 in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
•	An assumption of the same number of contributable hours as reported for the actuarial valuation as of 1/1/2008. The reasonableness of this assumption has been verified by the Trustees.
•	No market related investment gains or losses from 9/30/2009 forward and no other actuarial gains or losses from 1/1/2009 forward.

SAFEWAY INC. CLERKS LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
I.	C-4	1982 Denver Negotiation (Training Language) signed by Charles Mercer for UFCW Local 7,
and dated 8-16-82.
This letter is to confirm our agreement on an interpretation of the training language in the new collective bargaining agreement between Local 7 and Safeway. First of all, that language does not require Safeway to train an employee in the produce area. Second, an employee cannot use that language to receive training when the training would only affect the employee's ability to obtain a more preferential shift. Obviously, this assumes that the more preferential shift has the same or less hours than the employee's current shift.
2.	C-5 Employees reinstated under terms of Alcohol Rehabilitation Program. Agreement reached as
a result of a meeting held on March 31, 1983, between Charles Mercer and Rex Berry.

6.	Safeway Stores, Inc. shall not be liable for any expense associated with an employee's enrollment in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.
7.	Should an employee violate any provision of the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the Company and the union will review the violation to determine if there are any highly unusual circumstances which might warrant continuation in the program. If there are no such circumstances, the employee shall be terminated immediately.
8.	Upon enrolling in the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the employee shall be reinstated, but the employee will nol necessarily be assigned his/her place ofemploymcnl from which he/she
88
was terminated. Safeway Stores, Inc. reserves the right to reinstate an employee to a place of employment which best serves the operational interest of Safeway Stores, Inc.
9.	Reinstatement shall be no later than two full weeks after the agreement is signed, or two full weeks after a "dry-out period", if required by the treating physician.
10.	An employee terminated under the provisions of the Absentee Program who is later reinstated under the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program will return to work under the provisions of the Absentee Program at the same level and status which prevailed at the time of termination.

8.	C-14 Procedure for Scheduling Employees with Conscientious Objections to Working on Their Day of Sabbath. Unsigned and undated agreement between Safeway and UFCW Local 7.
PROCEDURE FOR SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES WITH
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO
WORKING ON THEIR DAY OF SABBATH
We have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath. Safeway has entered into an agreement with UFCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.
Problems can result in agrievance under the contract as well as a possible violation of the laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Safeway Inc. Human Resources if necessary.
This procedure, of course, applies only to any employee who advised you:
1.	that they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.
2.	the nature of their conscientious objections, and
3.	the particular day of the week which they are unable to work.
If you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter. You also should complete the form attached to these instructions, ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Safeway Inc. Human Resources Department for future reference.
The procedure for scheduling is as follows:
1.	Until noon on Saturday for the following week's schedule an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with any employee junior to him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.
2.	As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with a senior employee who is willing to make such an exchange. Again, you may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail and the senior employee may refuse to make the trade.
3.	As a third alternative, an employee may simply decline lo work on their day of Sabbath if they cannot trade shifts with anyone else. Such an employee will not be disciplined under the
94
Absenteeism Program except for failure to notify the Company prior to a scheduled shift that he will not work on their day of Sabbath. You will then assess points for failure to call, but not for the absence itself.
4.	I f an employee cannot make a change of shifts and is scheduled on their day of Sabbath for the entire bid period or for any extended period of time, it is permissible for that employee to advise you at the beginning of the bid period or other extended period of time that they will not work on such day for the entire three months. Such an employee, if full-time, will not in fact be scheduled 40 hours, but 32 hours. The Company has no obligation to provide 40 hours work under these circumstances.
Attached you will find a form for keeping a record of any such scheduling accommodation.
It is very important that we follow these procedures and complete the attached form in the event we are challenged on our application of the settlement agreement.

Vendors cannot sell candy, sandwiches, and other food items (except pastries) that are sold by bargaining unit employees in the Safeway store.
(3)	There will be no more than one vendor and one cart at any store.

"In the event an employee transfers from one area in the Denver Division of Safeway, or is reinstated from another Division of Safeway within thirty (30) days as per Safeway's Reinstatement Policy, to a bargaining unit in the jurisdiction of Local No. 7, then all continuous employment seniority with the Company shall be recognized by both the Union and the Company after thirty (30) days in the bargaining unit to which the employee transfers or is reinstated.
It is agreed that this provision shall become effective, and seniority dates shall be adjusted as soon as administratively possible, for all employees who have previously transferred or been reinstated from another Division of Safeway into a Local 7 bargaining unit."

2.	The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that to the greatest extent possible in circumstances when multiple layoffs are necessary, the Company will operate the layoff procedures in Section 97 (retail meat) and Section 75 (retail clerks) so that the least senior employees in the bargaining unit will be the employees who are laid off.

These are outside time limits, and the affected person is free to inform the Company of which option he/she chooses sooner than these time limits.
4.	Effect of not exercising option within time limits. If the affected person does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits set forth above, the affected person will be deemed to have exercised the first option specified in Section 97 (retail meat) or Section 75 (retail clerks) that is available, assuming that the affected person qualifies for such option when the contract requires qualifications. For example, if a retail clerk employee does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits, he/she will be deemed to have chosen the option in Section 75 of displacing a less senior employee within the same classification in the store or, if such option is unavailable, of displacing the least senior employee within the same classification in the bargaining unit.
5.	The Company will implement this procedure as soon as possible. If either party wishes to discontinue this agreement, it may do so after it has given written notice of at least 30 days to the other party.
16.	Estes Park Store SW 920 (Retail Clerks Contract). Transfers of Employees from Outside the Unit. Clarifies seniority rights for Head Clerks and other management employees who transfer into this store. Signed by Bruce Trull for Safeway on 12-19-94 and Michael Belo for UFCW Local 7 on 1395.
1.	This agreement pertains to the interpretation of Article 27. Section 63, which provides as follows, in relevant part: "Seniority for employees who transfer into the store from another bargaining unit will begin on the first (1 st) day they work in the Estes Park store, except the Company shall have the right to transfer a maximum of one (I) employee per bargaining unit per year into the store who shall retain their original seniority date with the Employer after they have worked for six (6) consecutive months in the Estes Park store."
2.	A dispute has arisen between the Union and the Employer about whether the above provision applies to transfers of head clerks or to transfers of other management employees who are included in the bargaining unit or, even if not included in the unit when transferred, are demoted or step down into the bargaining unit after their transfer. The parties agree to resolve the dispute as set forth below.
3.	In the event that the Employer transfers head clerks or other management employees into the Estes Park store, such employees will have seniority from the date they begin working in the Estes Park store until two years have passed. After two years of working continuously in the store, such employees will regain their company seniority, i.e., length of continuous employment with the
98
Employer. This two-year waiting period shall apply to transfers of head clerks, other bargaining unit management employees, and non-bargaining unit management employees who are demoted or step down into the bargaining unit. This restriction on seniority does not apply to qualifications for the number of weeks of vacation (but does apply to scheduling of vacations) or other non-competitive benefits for which continuous employment with the Employer is the requirement.
4.	Before transferring head clerks or other bargaining unit management employees into the Estes Park store, the Employer will first notify Estes Park employees of the position and will consider any Estes Park employees who have applied for the position. The Employer will have full discretion, however, to decide whether or not to select an Estes Park employee for the position.
5.	Head clerks previously transferred in 1994 shall retain their original seniority date with the Employer after they have worked for six (6) consecutive months in the Estes Park store.
6.	If the Employer transfers a head clerk or bargaining unit management employee into the Estes Park store and such employee is the only person transferred into the store within the calendar year, this agreement does not apply. Such employee shall retain his/her original seniority date with the Employer after working for six (6) consecutive months in the Estes Park store, as provided for in the current contract.
7.	The Union's agreement to this settlement is contingent upon ratification by a majority of members employed in the Estes Park store.
17.	Establishment of Variety Manager Classification. Colorado Stores only. Creates a new variety manager classification and grandfathers existing managers as Second Assistants. Signed by Bruce Trull for Safeway on 8-1-95 and Gary Hakes for UFCW Local 7 on 7-19-95.
UFCW Local #7 and Safeway Inc., Denver Division, agree to the establishment of a Variety Manager classification in all Colorado Retail contracts.

a.	The sales volume of the Variety Department will be approximately $35,000 per week on a regular basis.
b.	The Variety Department may have the equivalent of 1.5 employees or approximately fifty-six (56) hours per week.
2.	It is agreed that this position will not be subject to the promotion request language of the Collective Bargaining Agreements.
3.	Existing Variety Department Managers classified as Second Assistants will be grandfathered and the Company will be allowed to replace them at its discretion, with the new classification through attrition.
4.	Employees assigned to this new classification will be paid the new rate as of the date they are assigned the position.
99
5.	The rate of pay will be S12.00/hour lor Denver and all areas with similar rales. Areas with different rates will be paid a rate comparable to the same percentage of the new rate to the APC rate for Denver.
18.	Incidental Letters Pertinent to interpretation.
a.	Plant Floral Rates of Pay. Letter to Gordon Todd, Safeway from Gary Hakes, UFCW Local 7, dated 6-24-86. Clarifies that the new plant floral rales and classifications created by this letter are for FTD Departments only. GM plant clerks in non-FTD Departments will remain al GM rates.

Clarifies that employees who qualify for health coverage but lose it due to being reclassified as a courtesy clerk during the 6 io 12 month period will be given coverage through the Trust but contributions will not be required.
With regard to health insurance coverage for employees who have qualified therefore but lose coverage due to being reclassified to the courtesy clerk position during the six (6) to twelve (12) month period of their employment, Safeway will agree to handle it as a trust matter. In other words, such employees will be given coverage but contributions will not be required.

ARBITRATION SCHEDULING
Letter of Understanding Between
Safeway Inc. and UFCW Local 7
24.	Establishment of Arbitration Scheduling Procedures. As written in the Last, Best and Final Offer to UFCW Local 7 pursuant to the 2009 negotiations.
During the course of our negotiations for new collective bargaining agreements for Denver, Pueblo and Colorado Springs for the period from May 10, 2009 to September 14, 2013, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 (the Union) and Safeway Inc. (the Company) discussed their mutual desire to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the parties’ administration of the grievance and arbitration process in our labor agreements. These discussions reflected both parties’ belief that a well managed grievance procedure is a cornerstone of any mature collective bargaining relationship and is the responsibility of both labor and management.
Our discussion was open and honest and was forward-looking. Our objective was not to assess blame for why the process had not lived up to expectations in the past, but rather, to use the past as a learning experience for the future. Within this context, the parties have agreed to the following grievance procedure administration guidelines which we believe will help us achieve the type of grievance procedure the Company, the Union and the employees who work under the agreements deserve:
1.	The leadership of Local 7 has committed to “taking a second look” at the backlog of pending grievances to see whether any can be withdrawn or settled. There is no obligation on Local 7 to withdraw any grievance it believes has merit, only to determine whether each grievance has merit and deserves to move forward. Local 7 believes this process can be accomplished by June 30, 2011.
2.	Additionally, the parties recognize that the information requests that routinely accompany grievances filed by Local 7 can be burdensome and time consuming for the Company to respond to, which in turn impacts the effective and efficient administration of the grievance procedure. Accordingly, Local 7 has committed to reviewing the information requests it has accompanying pending grievances as well as information requests it may file with future grievances to determine whether the information requests can appropriately be withdrawn or tailored more narrowly in scope.
3.	The parties also agree to schedule monthly settlement meetings at which the parties will discuss the possible settlement or w ithdraw al of grievances pending arbitration.
4.	The parties will work from an agenda containing cases pending arbitration ranked in order of date filed with the exception that cases involving termination, demotion, or potential continuing liability shall be moved to the top of the agenda in date order and shall be discussed before any other case. The agenda will be prepared one week from the date of the meeting and may then only be modified by agreement of the parties.
103
5.	The parties will endeavor to discuss as many cases as can reasonably be considered at each monthly settlement meeting.
a.	Cases that are settled or dropped/withdrawn by the Union shall be removed from the agenda and shall be deemed closed.
b.	Cases that are continued at the monthly settlement meeting pending further review or investigation shall remain on the agenda for discussion at future monthly settlement meetings.
c.	Cases that have been discussed but not resolved may, at the option of the grieving party, be scheduled for arbitration as provided below.
6.	Grievances referred to arbitration shall be placed in the scheduling queue and scheduled for hearing as follows:
a.	Cases shall be scheduled from the scheduling queue in order of their respective grievance filing date with the understanding termination or demotion cases shall move to the front of the scheduling queue in date order.
b.	The party requesting arbitration shall promptly request a panel of arbitrators from FMCS for each case placed in the scheduling queue.
c.	Within sixty (60) days after a final settlement meeting decision, the parties will select an arbitrator.
d.	The parties will use best efforts to schedule the hearing in the matter for which an arbitrator has been appointed within six (6) months following a final settlement meeting decision with the understanding that the parties may schedule a hearing a date later than six (6) months upon mutual agreement or as the result of 6(e) below.
e.	Notwithstanding the provisions of 6(d) above, neither party shall be required or obligated to schedule more than three (3) cases per calendar month except by mutual agreement.
f.	In all disciplinary cases referred to arbitration, as a condition to accepting appointment, the arbitrator must agree to render a decision and award no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the parties’ post hearing statements. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, such statements must be filed no later than fourteen (14) days following the close of the hearing (or receipt of transcript where applicable) and must be limited to no more than ten (10) single space letter size pages. It is specifically agreed and understood that any such case resolved under this procedure shall be deemed “nonprecedential” and will not be cited by either party in any future proceeding. The provisions of this subsection (e) may be modified on a case by case basis by mutual agreement of the parties.
104
The Company’s Director of Labor Relations and the Union President will retain jurisdiction over this letter of understanding and may, by mutual agreement, modify this letter of understanding as they deem necessary and appropriate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agreements’ grievance and arbitration process. Any such modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties.

WEINGARTEN RULES
Under the Supreme Court's Weingarten decision, when an investigatory interview occurs, you should ask if it is for disciplinary action. If so, the following rules apply.
Rule 1: The employee must make a clear request for union representation before or during the interview. The employee cannot be punished for making this request.
Rule II: After the employee makes the request, the Employer must choose from among three options. The Employer must either:
A.	Grant the request and delay questioning until the union representative arrives and has a chance to consult privately with the employee, or
B.	Deny the request and end the interview immediately, or
C.	Give the employee a choice of:
(1)	having the interview without representation or
(2)	ending the interview.
Rule III: If the Employer denies the request for union representation, and continues lo ask questions, it commits an unfair labor practice and the employee has a right to refuse to answer. The Employer may not discipline the employee for such a refusal.

NOTES
DO NOT GO SUSPENDED!!!
REMEMBER, IF YOU LEAVE THE INDUSTRY FOR ANY REASON (termination, layoff, leave of absence, etc.) apply for your withdrawal card. This must be done within 30 days from the last day worked. This protects your union status in the event you should ever return to the industry. Failure to get a withdrawal card will result in SUSPENSION from the Union and a reinstatement fee will be charged. If you leave the industry IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO GET A WITHDRAWAL CARD!
The withdrawal card will be issued at no cost, the only requirement being that your initiation fee be fully paid and your dues must be paid for the month in which you request the withdrawal card. The withdrawal card is good indefinitely and allows you to become a member of any local union affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union without payment of any additional fee(s). Withdrawal card must be deposited with the union office within 30 days after returning to work or it becomes null and void and the reinstatement fee must be paid. All persons returning to work with a withdrawal card must fill out a new application and authorization.
WITHDRAWAL CARD REQUEST FORM
When your employment terminates, or if you are laid off, or on a leave of absence over 30 days, you should request a Withdrawal Card.
