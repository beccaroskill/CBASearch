In the event there is a dispute as to whether the issue appealed to arbitration is also an issue to the employee's complaint to the OCRC and/or EEOC, the Union and the Department of Law shall meet in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute it is agreed that the Arbitrator shall have the Jurisdiction to determine whether the issue appealed to arbitration is also the issue in the employee’s complaint to the OCRC or EEOC. If a question of arbitrability of the grievance appealed to Step 4 arises, it Is agreed that an Arbitrator other than the one assigned to hear the original grievance shall be selected by the parties.
Section 4.	All decisions of the Arbitrators and all pre-arbitration grievance settlements reached by the Union and the County shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the County, the Union, and the employee(s). However, a grievance may be withdrawn by the Union at any time and withdrawal of any grievance shall not be prejudicial to the positions taken by the parties as they relate to that grievance or any other grievance, unless otherwise agreed to in writing.

In lieu of overtime pay, employees may elect to receive 1.5 hours of compensatory time for every hour he or she would have received overtime pay. Approval of compensatory time off shall be at times that are mutually agreed to by the employee and the employee’s supervisor and shall be based on operational needs. To be eligible to use compensatory time, employees must provide at least 72 hours advance notice in writing of their compensatory time off requests.
