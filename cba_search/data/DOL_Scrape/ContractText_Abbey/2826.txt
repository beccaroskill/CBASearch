1.	Disciplinary action may be imposed for an employee's failure to fulfill his/her job responsibilities or for improper conduct connected with the individual's employment.

a.	Attendance Problems
b.	Insubordination
c.	Unsatisfactory Work Performance
d.	Misconduct on the Job
e.	Certain Instances of Misconduct Off the Job
In general, acts committed while off duty will not be grounds for disciplinary action, unless the results of such acts significantly impair the ability of the employee to perform his/her work, adversely affect the operations of the employing department or bring City service into public disrepute.
2.	Discipline is intended to be corrective and should follow a series of progressive steps to change the employee's unacceptable conduct or behavior.
Following is a series of progressive steps which will serve in the majority of cases:
a.	Oral Reprimand(s)
b.	Written Reprimand(s)
c.	Suspension(s)
d.	Discharge
These steps should give the employee notice that continued unacceptable conduct or behavior will result in more serious disciplinary action.
In cases of more serious offenses, the first disciplinary action taken may begin with the written or suspension step; and, for the most serious offenses, it may be appropriate to impose serious suspension and/or discharge the employee on the first occasion of improper conduct without prior discipline.
3.	Disciplinary action should be appropriate and take into account both the offense and the employee.
-17-
Factors which should be considered in imposing discipline in each case are:
a.	The seriousness and circumstances of the particular offense,
b.	The employment history of the employee involved including length of service.
c.	The recency and nature of prior disciplinary action taken with respect to the employee, d. Prior departmental action in comparable situations.
4.	Any published departmental standards or rules governing employee conduct or expected work performance should be fairly and consistently applied.
Note: Within twenty (20) calendar days following the effective date of this Agreement, representatives of Council 25 shall be provided with copies of the standard work rules.

I.	Special Conference is intended to resolve problems between the parties and avoid situations which may give rise to grievances. It is not intended to be a substitute for initiation of individual grievances. However, on policy matters, if the Union does not receive an answer within the above time limit or the Employer's answer does not resolve the disputes between the parties, the Union may submit a grievance citing the alleged contract violations. Such grievance shall be filed at the fourth step of the grievance procedure with copies to the departments involved.

E.	RESOLVING TIES IN SENIORITY:
1.	Where two or more persons have the same seniority date, the employee with the highest standing (examination rating) on the eligible register from which the employees were certified shall be deemed as having the greater seniority. In the event of identical examination ratings, the employee with the earliest examination date shall be deemed as having the greater seniority. In the further event of identical examination dates, the employee who first submitted his/her employment application (as measured by the examination number) shall be deemed as having the greater seniority.
2.	In the case of inducted employees with the same seniority date, employees will be ranked in accordance with their length of continuous service in the department, agency or activity in which they were employed when inducted into the classified service.

16.	REDUCTION IN FORCE, LAY OFF, DEMOTION, AND RECALL

2.	To displace the least seniority employee in some other classification which the senior employee previously held.
In addition, employees who are unable to displace lesser seniority employees in their department may be transferred or demoted to other available vacant positions in the department for which they are adjudged to be qualified.
Those employees who are unable to displace lesser seniority employees or are status-changed to other available vacancies in the department shall be laid off by issuance of a layoff notice from their department. Such laid off employees shall then have those City-wide displacement rights described below.
Employees who have an opportunity to displace a lesser seniority employee in the next lower class in their occupational series, but elect not to exercise such displacement rights and request to be laid off instead, shall not be eligible for these City-wide displacement rights.

Where two or more laid-off employees have City-wide displacement rights, employees will be given a choice of available displacement opportunities in their class, in order of their seniority. However, employees who do not report for displacement as instructed will waive this right.
F.	EMPLOYEE RECALL, REEMPLOYMENT AND RESTORATION RIGHTS:
1.	Permanent seniority employees who were laid off, exercised their displacement rights or were placed in a lower class shall be placed on a recall ("blocking") list and be recalled to any available vacancies in the class from which they were removed or any lower class in the same series in accordance with their total City seniority.

H.	MULTIPLE TITLES: In determining an employee's rights under this Article, an employee can have permanent seniority in only one (1) class at a time. An employee who carries a multiple title shall be treated as having permanent seniority in the lowest part of his/her multiple title.
Exceptions to this general rule would be where the employee previously held a higher part of the multiple title on a single title basis, or where the parties agree that the employee's permanent seniority should be in a higher part of the multiple title based on the employee's nature and history of employment. Such agreement must be in effect no later than ninety (90) days prior to the announcement of a reduction in force.

4.	Exceptions to the above notice requirements shall be allowed in individual cases where the failure to give timely notice resulted from error or unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of management.	1
J.	RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT: To remain eligible for recall or reemployment under the provisions of this Article, laid off employees must continue to maintain their residency in the City of Detroit, or other approved area if applicable, unless specific permission to temporarily move out of the City is granted by the City's Human Resources Director.

F.	EFFECT OF RECALL ("BLOCKING") LISTS AND PREFERRED ELIGIBLE LISTS ON TRANSFERS AND PROMOTIONS:
1.	No available vacant position in any City department can be filled by promotion, transferpromotion or new hire until laid off or demoted employees on the recall list for the class have been offered placement to the available position in accordance with their seniority as provided in Article 16 - Reduction in Force, Lay Off, Demotion and Recall.
2.	Any available vacant position resulting after implementation of transfers under Sections B or D of this Article, shall be filled first from the recall list for the class. If there is no recall list for the class, then the persons on the preferred eligible list for the class shall be offered placement to the available position in accordance with their seniority before any new employees may be hired.
3.	In all cases where an available position cannot be filled in accordance with Sections B, C, D, and E of this Article, and in the absence of a recall list for the class, persons on the preferred eligible list for the class shall be offered placement to the available position in accordance with their seniority before any new employees may be hired.
G.	SHIFT AND LOCATION PREFERENCE:
Within sixty (60) days of the signing of this Agreement, employees in each unit covered by this Agreement will be allowed to select shifts and work locations in accordance with their seniority within the department within their classifications insofar as it does not adversely affect the operation of the department.
Exceptions to this provision may be made in the Local Supplements to this Agreement. Upon request, employees will be furnished starting and quitting times information prior to submitting their preference. It is understood that hours, shifts and work locations are subject to change as operating needs may dictate. During the period when employees have the opportunity to submit shift and work location preferences, the Employer shall notify employees of any imminent changes which might affect employee selections.
The job location and shift selection will be considered the employee's basic job for the duration of this Agreement. In the event that part of an operation within a department is discontinued, employees affected will be allowed to select, in accordance with their seniority, available shifts and locations within the department in their classifications.
H.	INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS:
In situations where it is necessary to transfer one or more employees from their present job location or shift to another location or shift in the department, such transfers shall first be offered to employees in order of their seniority. When there are not enough volunteers, the transfer shall be made according to inverse seniority. Transfers under this provision shall not affect any transfer requests filed under Section B of this Article.
I.	OTHER TRANSFERS:
The City agrees that in any transfer of work involving employees covered by this Agreement, the City will discuss the transfers with the Michigan Council 25 and the Local Unions affected in order to protect the seniority and equity of the employees involved.
-35-
Note 1: In the past, the Supplemental Agreements for Locals 214 and 312 have established limitations on seniority for Department of Transportation administrative purposes, such as transfer and promotions, when members of other locals covered by this Agreement have transferred or entered into Locals 214 and 312. Should these limitations be continued in the Supplemental Agreements, these same limitations will be equally applied to members of Locals 214 and 312 when they transfer or enter into other locals covered by this Agreement.
Should any alleged error in the application of this provision be brought by the Union to the attention of the Employer, the Employer shall have seven (7) working days to investigate and make any necessary adjustment before incurring any liability.

B.	The right of contracting or subcontracting is vested in the City. The right to contract or subcontract shall not be used for the purpose or intention of undermining the Union nor to discriminate against any of its members nor shall any seniority employee be laid off or demoted or caused to suffer a reduction in overtime work as a direct and immediate result of work performed by an outside contractor.
C.	In cases of contracting or subcontracting, including renewal of contracts, affecting employees covered by this Agreement, the City will hold advance discussion with the Union prior to letting the contract.

-36-
Note: During the course of negotiations there was considerable discussion as to the interpretation and intent of Article 21.

The parties agree that Article 21 is not intended to conflict with the City's ability and responsibility to manage its affairs.
The parties further agree that Article 21 is not intended to maintain improper practices which may exist in the various operating departments nor is it intended to prevent the City from taking appropriate corrective action.

During this absence from work, the employee is entitled to continuation of health care benefit coverage. For employees of the City, the twelve month period is the fiscal year. Questions concerning leaves for FMLA purposes should be referred to the employee’s Human Resources representative.

Health Leaves for Maternity: Upon presentation of adequate medical documentation that the pregnant employee is no longer able to perform her job duties, a health leave of absence will be granted if the employee has at least one (1) year of continuous classified service. If the employee has less than one (1) year of continuous classified service, the employee may be granted a voluntary layoff (see paragraph 4 above). Prior to going on the unpaid health leave, the employee would have the option of utilizing any accrued vacation days or compensatory time after usage of accrued paid sick leave.
8.	Other Personal Leaves: In addition to parenting leaves, leaves of absence for other reasons of a personal nature (e.g. caring for an ill relative) may be granted if recommended by the department head and approved by the Human Resources Director. The maximum duration of such leaves shall be six (6) months.
9.	When an employee requests a leave of absence in accordance with this Article, the Employer shall inform the employee in writing of the Leave of Absence Rule of the Human Resources Department and the procedure necessary to be followed in order to protect his/her rights and benefits during and following the period of the leave.

Copies of such notice will be mailed to those Local Unions which will most likely have members under the newly established classification.
In the absence of any appeal by Michigan Council 25 within twenty (20) working days of the date of the notice to the Union, action on the positions will be submitted to the City Council. In the event of an appeal, the interested bargaining agent may negotiate for a suitable rate with the Labor Relations Director and the matter shall be handled in accordance with the procedure for Special Conference.

Note: In order to continue hospitalization and life insurance benefits, employees are responsible for their portion of the premium as required by the Contract. Those deductions will be made automatically while they remain on the payroll because they are supplementing. Once they leave the payroll, they must make arrangements with the Pension Bureau to pay those premiums in order to continue coverage.
E.	Consistent with the Workers Compensation Act and current City practices:
1.	The City shall continue its program of returning workers who suffered job injuries back to active employment to perform work tasks which are compatible with their current physical capabilities.

2.	If the employee is presently able to perform some but not all of the essential duties, but there is competent medical documentation that he/she will be able to perform all such duties within ninety (90) days, he/she may be placed conditionally in an available position in the classification subject to review at the end of this period. Work tasks assigned will be those compatible with present work restrictions.
3.	If the employee cannot presently be returned to his/her former j ob classification, he/she will be placed in an appropriate available position in another classification on a temporary basis until such time as the employee is able to return to his/her former job classification or acquires permanent status in the alternate classification by action of the Human Resources Department. The duration of the temporary status shall be in accordance with the Workers’ Compensation Act. During the temporary period, efforts will be made to place the employee in available positions consistent with his/her training and experience and current physical capabilities.
4.	While employed in the alternate job classification, whether temporary or permanent, the employee shall be represented by the local union having jurisdiction over employees in that classification and at that location. However, residual seniority rights to the employee’s former classification shall remain with his/her former local or other union. An employee
-59-
in an alternate classification on a permanent basis continues to have a right to return to his former job classification in his former department when physically able to do so.
5.	Employees returned to work under these provisions shall not be charged with absences for di sciplinary purposes where there is medical documentation that such absences were caused and necessitated by the former job injury.

44.	EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
A.	The City and the Union recognize and acknowledge that behavioral-medical problems have an adverse effect on the employee’s job performance and merits special attention. Examples of these problems include but are not limited to substance abuse, including alcohol and drugs, physical illness, mental or emotional illness, marital or family maladjustments and other personal problems. These behavior-medical problems impair the employee’s ability to function, and contribute to increased absenteeism and tardiness, and violation of other rules, regulations, and procedures. The combination of factors is recognized as having potentially damaging effects on the employee, the work site and the well-being of co-workers. The City and Union believe most behavioral-medical problems are treatable. The Employee Assistance Program is designed to provide assistance to employees who are experiencing behavior-medical problems that may result in deteriorating job performance.
B.	The City and AFSCME believe that constructive measures are possible to deal with the problem through labor/management cooperative efforts. Toward this end, the City and the Union agree to continue to have the Central Committee composed of three (3) representatives of Council 25 of AFSCME and three (3) representatives of the City of Detroit.

1.	Providing information to and assisting in identifying and motivating employees who may suffer from problems to seek treatment and rehabilitation.
-68-
2.	Helping the employee understand and deal with problems by referral to the City of Detroit ’ s Employee Assistance Program. Any such communication, referral or consultation will not be the basis of disciplinary action.
E.	Notwithstanding the establishment of a Central Committee and local committees, nothing prevents the City of Detroit from utilizing different means of providing various assistance services in the future.
F.	The parties agree that to increase effectiveness of Committee discussions, relevant training in specific subject areas should be made available to committee members. Provisions may be made to send selected committee members to seminars, workshops or in-service training.

Nothing in this statement is to be interpreted as constituting any waiver of management's responsibility to maintain discipline or the right to invoke progressive disciplinary measures when applicable in the case of misconduct which may result from or be associated with the abuse of any substance or other personal problem; the union may exercise its right to process grievances concerning such matters in accordance with the AFSCME Master Agreement.
2.	During or following treatment, the employee should not expect any special privileges or exemptions from standard personnel practices; however, employees with substance abuse problems or personal problems will be allowed to liquidate sick leave for the purpose of treatment or rehabilitation upon presentation of satisfactory medical evidence.
3.	When a leave of absence is necessary so that an employee may undergo behavioral-medical treatment for alcoholism, drug abuse, or other personal problems in or from an appropriate facility in accordance with this program, and when the employee has voluntarily submitted himself for such treatment, he may be granted a leave of absence if the employee has completed one (1) year of continuous classified service immediately prior to the leave.
4.	The confidential nature of medical records of affected employees will be preserved in the strictest manner as all other medical records. To the extent feasible, employee assistance facilities will be .located in areas separate from other City activities.

B.	The City subscribes to the principle of promotion from within, and, in keeping with that principle, the City agrees to focus some of its resources toward those employees in lower job classifications in order to provide opportunities to train and enter new careers.
-69-
C.	The City and the Union agree that a major goal of training and career development is improvement of the status of female and minority employees in order to fulfill the City’s and Union's commitment to effective affirmative action programs, and to make the work force at all levels reasonably representative of the sex and ethnic composition of the City.
D.	In consequence of the foregoing, the City and the Union agree:
1.	Employees will be recruited from the AFSCME bargaining unit to be trained in programs leading to career advancement. Selection shall be made from among those meeting the prerequisites for the training programs.
2.	Specific training and numbers to be trained will be identified by the Career Development and Training Committee, with priorities based upon the City's projected needs.

-70-
B.	The City agrees to periodically provide the Union with copies of statistical minority employment information reports and such reports concerning policies and programs for equal opportunity in employment regarding City employees.
C.	The City further agrees that a crucial part of an effective affirmative action program is development of an effective training and education program designed to provide existing minority employees maximinn opportunity to advance so as to perform at their highest potential.
D.	Upon request, the Human Resources Director or his/her designated representative(s) shall meet with the Joint Career Development and Training Committee.

After the initial enrollment of applicants by the Pension Bureau, employees who subsequently leave City employment shall have ninety (90) days from their last paid date on the City payroll to select this option.
Retirees who began receiving a Duty or Non-Duty Disability Pension after July 1, 1992, may convert to this option no later than ninety (90) days after they would have had twenty-five (25) years with the City and have been notified by the Pension Bureau of the availability of this option.
Some contents of this Article are modified by the agreed upon Memorandum of Understanding entitled “Re: Retirement Provisions Changes: Optional Defined Contribution Plan Creation” contained on page 109 of this labor agreement booklet. At some appropriate time in the future, the parties will re-write the applicable portions of this Article to incorporate the changes reflected in the Memorandum of Understanding.

B.	Retirement benefits shall be modified to include an optional coordination of benefits between regular retirement benefits and Social Security benefits for those employees who retire from the City with a regular retirement or the Actuarially Reduced 25 Year Option prior to becoming eligible for Social Security payments.

M.	Pension - Employer Contribution (414h Plan):
Upon notification by the Union to the City of its desire to activate a 414(h) Plan, the City will take steps to implement the provisions contained in the following paragraphs. The Union initiated the discussions and proposed the provisions contained in the paragraphs and the parties recognize and agree that it will take some time before this program can become operational due to the necessity of making changes in the City's computerized payroll system.
It is hereby agreed that every member of this bargaining unit shall be required to make contributions in the amount of 5% of their annual compensation to the Annuity Savings Fund of the General Retirement System. The said 5% employee contribution to the Retirement System Annuity Fund, although designated as employee contributions, shall be paid by the City of Detroit in lieu of contributions by the employee. The employee shall not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amount directly instead of having them paid by the employer to the annuity fund. There shall be no additional contribution expense to the City of Detroit, and the amounts so contributed by the employer on behalf of the employee shall be treated, for tax purposes, as employer contributions and thus shall not be taxable to the employee until these amounts are distributed or made available to the employee.
These provisions shall not affect the amount or benefit level of the retirement allowance, or the City of Detroit’s obligation thereto.
The wage rate for members of the bargaining unit shall not be altered or changed in any way as a result of these contract provisions. Consequently, these provisions shall not affect the basis upon which Longevity, sick leave payoff, holiday pay, overtime pay, recall pay, final average earnings, etc., or any wage-based benefit is computed.
The AFSCME - Non Supervisory bargaining unit, agrees to indemnify and hold the City harmless with respect to any adverse ruling, if any, and monetary penalty, judgement, or damages to the City as a consequence of the City's compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.
N.	Employees shall have the option of selecting from two additional surviving beneficiary options of 25% and 75%.	’
O.	Annuity Contribution Amounts: Once the City's new computerized payroll system becomes operational, if it has the capability, the City will offer employees the additional option of a 7% annuity contribution. The implementation of this provision is contingent upon approval by the Internal Revenue Service that this change does not jeopardize the Retirement System's taxexempt status.
49.	RESIDENCY
All members of the bargaining unit shall be residents of the City of Detroit except as provided by action of the Civil Service Commission in accordance with the authority provided by Ordinance. Employees working and residing in areas which are approved by the Ci vil Service Commi ssion shall be construed as residents in the event of a reduction in force.
-74-
50.	TUITION REFUND
A.	Bargaining unit members may participate in the City's Tuition Refund Program as administered by the Human Resources Department. Employees requesting a tuition refund should submit the applications to the human resources officer in their department.
B.	The maximum amount of the tuition refund shall be as indicated below in accordance with the Tuition Refund Program policies as administered by the Human Resources Department:
1.	An eligible employee will be entitled to receive a maximum of $850 per fiscal year to be applied toward tuition in seeking a graduate degree from an accredited university.
2.	An eligible employee will be entitled to receive a maximum of $700 per fiscal year to be applied toward tuition in seeking an undergraduate degree from an accredited university.
3.	An eligible employee will be entitled to receive a maximum of $600 per fiscal year to be applied toward payment for participation in employee development programs
The above amounts cannot be pyramided to permit any employee to receive more than a total amount of $850 in any fiscal year.
51.	PROTECTION CLAUSE
It is the City’s commitment that in terms of a total compensation package, the AFSCME bargaining unit will not be economically disadvantaged as a result of subsequent settlements with other unions. However, it must be understood that compulsory arbitration may result in varied settlements.
The parties agree that special wage adjustments for particular classifications within other bargaining units, when based upon personnel recruitment and retention difficulties or special job skills, shall not require an equivalent increase for the AFSCME unit at large; the parties fiirther agree, however, that an adjustment shall be required for an AFSCME classification to maintain the recognized traditional wage relationship to another bargaining unit's classification which received such a special wage adjustment.
52.	CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES
The parties agree that certain City employees are designated as confidential employees and are, therefore, to be exempt from membership in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement. These employees are those holding the positions as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding reached by the parties and submitted, and approved by the Michigan Employment Relations Commission in connection with Case No. C79 D-l 10 as well as the Decision and Order of the Commission in that case dated June 4, 1980. The City shall not designate other employees as confidential without the agreement of the Union; but may, if the Union fails to so agree, petition the Michigan Employment Relations Commission to approve such designation.
-75-
53.	MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION
It is agreed between the parties that this Contract shall continue in full force and effect until 11.59 p. m., June 30,2001. If either party desires to modify this Contract they shall give written notice during the month of February 2001. Negotiations for a new contract shall commence thirty (30) days after that date.
In the event that the City and the Union fail to arrive at an agreement on wages, fringe benefits, other monetary matters, and non-economic items by June 30,2001, the Agreement will remain in effect on a day to day basis. Either party may terminate the agreement by giving the other party a ten (10) day written notice on or after June 20,2001.
The parties agree that this sole and complete Agreement is intended to cover all matters affecting wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and that, during the term of this Agreement, neither the City nor the Union will be required to negotiate on any further matters affecting these or any other subjects not specifically set forth in this Agreement, except by mutual agreement of the parties hereto.

The parties shall meet and negotiate the provisions of this memorandum in a business-like manner and every effort will be made to come to agreement as quickly as possible.

RE: Procedure for Elimination of the Backlog of Grievances Which Arose Under the 1995-1998 Master Agreement
During negotiations to reach agreement on a contract to replace the Master Agreement which expired June 30, 1998, discussions arose regarding elimination of the backlog of grievances which had arisen under this and earlier Contracts. What follows is a procedure agreed upon by the parties to accomplish that end:
A.	ESTABLISHMENT OF A MEDIATION PANEL: The AFSCME Council 25 President and the City Labor Relations Director will appoint one (1) representative each to serve as members of the Mediation Panel. Said Panel shall meet weekly, if necessary, and have full authority to resolve the backlog of grievances as indicated below:
1.	Council 25, AFSCME and the City of Detroit Labor Relations Division are to develop separate lists, by department, of the unresolved grievances which arose under the 19951998 Master Agreement for submission to the Mediation Panel.
2.	Within thirty (30) days after the 1998-2001 Labor Agreement takes effect, the Mediation Panel will meet and reconcile any discrepancies between those two lists, producing a single list.
3.	Within thirty (30) days of establishing a reconciled list of cases, as indicated in number 2 above, the Mediation Panel will examine the grievances and attempt to group them by issue. Also, either party, for whatever reason, can indicate which grievances are to be excluded from the mediation process.
Grievances of employees who have been discharged, and such discharge is not the subject of one of the unresolved grievances, shall be purged from the list.
4.	The Mediation Panel will examine grievances involving disciplinary action which is more than fourteen (14) months old to (1) determine if there has been subsequent disciplinary action, and if not, (2) to explore the feasibility of withdrawing the grievance or retracting the disciplinary action or otherwise settling the grievance.
5.	The Mediation Panel will determine if settlements can be made of the grievances which survive steps 3,4, & 5 above.
6.	Where decisions of the Mediation Panel have been made to remove grievances from further consideration, written notices of such decisions shall be sent to the grievants at their last address of record. Notice to the grievant’s last address of record shall constitute proper notice. Such notices shall be sent within fifteen (15) working days after the Mediation Panel’s decisions and jointly signed by the Mediation Panel. The decisions of the Mediation Panel shall be final and binding on all parties.
-106-
7.	Separate lists, by department and local union, of the decisions of the Mediation Panel will be sent to the applicable Department Director and Local Union President, andthe AFSCME Council 25 President, and the Labor Relations Director.
B.	CASES REFERRED BY THE MEDIATION PANEL TO A THIRD PARTY MEDIATOR:
1.	The remaining grievances will be submitted to a mediator for a hearing. This hearing will involve only opening and closing statements and submission of documentary evidence, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Panel. The decision of the mediator shall be an advisory opinion, unless the Panel agrees in particular cases to make the Mediator’s decision final and binding.
2.	The Mediator's opinion will be either accepted or rej ected by the Mediation Panel, except in those cases where the Panel agreed that the Mediator’s decision is final and binding on both parties.
C.	CASES TO BE REFERRED TO AN UMPIRE OR ARBITRATOR:
1.	Those grievances which the Mediation Panel excluded from the advisory mediation process and those which were included in the advisory mediation process, but the mediator's advisory opinion was not accepted by the Mediation Panel, will then be scheduled for an appropriate hearing by an umpire or an arbitrator, under the provisions of the 1995-1998 Master Agreement. The threshold issue of timeliness of any grievance scheduled for an appropriate hearing shall be decided by the umpire or arbitrator selected to hear the grievance.
2.	Any grievance or management action which precipitated a grievance may be withdrawn at any point in the process.
D.	PILOT PROGRAM TO REDUCE BACKLOG OF GRIEVANCES: Theparties agree to institute a new Pilot Grievance Review Program for the purpose of expediting the resolution of grievances and to give Council 25 the opportunity to conduct its internal appeal and review of grievances after receiving the Step 4 answer from Labor Relations. Within sixty (60) calender days of receipt of the Step 4 answer, the Council will notify Labor Relations that the grievance is a) being appealed to arbitration under the regular provisions of Article 8, b) being withdrawn, or c) being placed into the Pilot Grievance Review Program. Any grievance referred to the Pilot Grievance Review Program which is not appealed to arbitration by Council 25 within nine (9) months of the Step 4 grievance hearing shall be considered resolved on the basis of City’s last answer. This Pilot Grievance Review Program shall become effective upon the signing of this Agreement and will terminate on June 30,2001. Any extension of this pilot program will only be by mutual agreement of the parties.

3.	The AFC period shall be the highest 3 consecutive years out ofthe last 10 years of service.
4.	Effective January 1,1999, for any person who was a member ofthe bargaining unit at the time of retirement with either a duty disability or a non-duty disability, the maximum annual benefits shall be $9,000 for a duty disability pension and $6,000 for a non-duty disability pension.
10 Some contents of this Memorandum of Understanding modify Article 48 "Retirement" contained on page 71 in the main body of this Labor Agreement, At some appropriate time in the future, the parties will re-write the applicable portions of Article 48 to incorporate the changes reflected in this Memorandum of Understanding.

Minor dependents under age 19 or permanently mentally or physically impaired dependent children who become impaired prior to age 19 of employees who die with 20 years of service without a surviving spouse shall receive a payment of $9,000 per year which shall be divided equally amongst all eligible dependents. The payment will cease when the last minor child attains age 19 or for permanently mentally or physically impaired children at death. The maximum amount of the Accidental Death Benefit as found in Chapter VI, Article VI, Part C, section 1, Paragraphs B and C of the City Charter shall be increased to $9,000.
6.

Members of the bargaining unit shall have the option of belonging to the City’s current defined benefit/defined contribution retirement plan (“old” DB/DC plan) or a new defined contribution retirement plan (“new” DC plan) in accordance with the rules the City will issue for a defined contribution plan. The parties agree this “new” DC plan the Executive Branch will propose for acceptance by the City Council, although not specifically detailed at tiiis, time, is intended to be primarily in accordance with the provisions which were last advocated by the Executive Branch in November-December, 1997, except that these provisions will also seek to provide, consistent with what is prudent, cost-reasonable, and in keeping with applicable law:
1.	A reasonable period of time, consistent with the customary practice for this type of municipal government plan, will be allowed for new persons hired into AFSCME-represented employment positions to decide which plan, the “old” DB/DC plan or the “new” DC plan, to belong to, subject to certain minimum reasonable conditions that may apply with respect to the new hires’ obligations both during this subject decision-making period of time and as applicable to the particular plan decision the new hire makes at the end of the period.
2.	A reasonable period of time, consistent with the customary practice for this type of municipal government plan, will be allowed for an AFSCME-represented employee who is currently working for the City to decide whether to exercise the option to switch from the “old” DB/DC plan into the “new” DC plan.
3.	A reasonable period of time, consistent with the customary practice for this type of municipal government plan, will be allowed for an AFSCME-represented employee covered by either of the preceding two subsections to reverse a decision made, subject to that employee agreeing to pay any costs the City or the Pension System incurs as a result of the employee’s decision to reverse that prior decision, this right of reversal being allowed to be exercised just once.
-110-
4,	Any City and/or pension system actions undertaken to accomplish an employee’s request to transfer pension system funds as a result of plan membership decision(s) made by the employee, will be timed to occur and be done in such a way as to avoid, as much as possible, any financial harm to the subject employee. In all instances, the City of Detroit, the pension system, and AFSCME Council 25 will be heldharmless and immune from any claims of monetary losses or liabilities alleged to follow from an employee’s decision(s). To that end, the actual date of the transferral of any funds and the actual date of a change in plan memberships shall not serve as a basis for any claim that the employee has been financially harmed.
5.	The requirement that any AFSCME-represented employee who belongs to the “new” DC plan, whether as a result of an initial decision as a newly hired employee or a current employee’s decision to transfer from the City’s “old” DB/DC plan, shall not be allowed to make a withdrawal greater than fifty percent (50%) of that employee’s account balance at the time of the withdrawal, subject to all other applicable provisions governing conditions of withdrawals, including a possible reasonable period of participation in the plan and the withdrawing employee’s requirement to pay any administrative costs which may be attributable to the withdrawal.
6.	The parties will form a joint labor/management committee to come to agreement on the specific provisions of the “new” DC plan that will be applicable to AFSCME-represented employees, and each party agrees to share appropriate information with the other side, including the research to determine “customary practice(s)” which was used by the City to make the decisions set forth in Subsections B(l), B(2), and B(3) above.
C.	COMPLETION OF CERTAIN UNDETERMINED DC PLAN DETAILS, EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MEMORANDUM, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS
1.

Re: Wastewater Solids Supply Agreement Between City ofDetroit/Water & Sewerage Department and Minergy Detroit, LLC
Dear Mr. Garrett:
As you know, the City of Detroit/Detroit Water & Sewerage Department proposes to
contract with Minergy Detroit, LLC for the transport and treatment by Minergy of wastewater solids generated at the wastewater treatment plant, to produce glass aggregate using Minergy’s patented vitrification process. This contract presents the City with the opportunity to address several environmentally sound method for disposal of the City’s wastewater product than the traditional methods of incineration and landfilling. We strongly believe that this contract serves the best interests of the City and has the potential for placing Detroit in the vanguard of beneficial and costeffective methods of reusing biosolids.
I wish to address the concerns which have been expressed regarding the potential
impact of this contract arrangement on workers at the wastewater treatment plant. Please let me assure you that fair treatment of any affected plant workers and their reassignment to other DWSD job positions without a reduction in force has been a paramount concern throughout our consideration of this transaction. This will confirm my commitment, and that of DWSD management, that no bargaining unit member affected by this proposed arrangement will be terminated or laid off as a result of this contract, and that all such bargaining unit members will be transferred to or trained for other suitable positions at DWSD comparable in pay and benefits to the position each currently occupies. This will also assure the representatives of my staff as necessary, DWSD management and the Labor Relations Division will work with you in good faith to develop appropriate arrangements for transitioning of these employees from their current positions to their new DWSD positions, including plans for any retraining of employees that may be necessary.
We look forward to working with you to achieve a mutually satisfactory plan for accomplishing this important initiative.

RE: Eligibility Standards of Driving Assignments
Dear Mr. Garrett:
This letter is intended to clarify the matter of eligibility of City employees to operate a motor vehicle on City business.
The "Eligibility Standards of Driving Assignments" issued by the City on March 3,1972 was made applicable to all City employees. These eligibility standards indicate those circumstances under which an employee will no longer be permitted to drive a city-owned motor vehicle or his own vehicle on City business because of suspension or revocation of driving privileges by the State of Michigan, accumulated driving violation points, and/or chargeable accidents while operating a City vehicle.
Although these standards on eligibility to operate a vehicle on City business apply to all employees, specific departmental action is required only in those situations where an employee becomes ineligible to drive and he/she is in a job classification which requires the employee to drive a vehicle in order to carry out the job duties of the classification. These departmental actions, except in the case of employees who knowingly drive a City vehicle with a license which has been suspended or revoked by the State of Michigan, on a public thorough-fare, are not intended to be disciplinary in nature, but rather to give employees reasonable opportunity to take appropriate action to restore their eligibility to drive on City business.
When non-driving work assignments are available and departmental operations are not adversely affected, reasonable efforts will be made and consideration will be given to reassigning ineligible employees without regard to seniority.

Dear Mr, Garrett:
Both the City and Council 25 recognize that jurisdictional disputes are basically between Unions.

Laborer A - Truck Driver/Vehicle Operator
G.A.M. - CEO
Building Inspector - Housing Inspector Mechanics - P.L.D.
The City agreed to do what it can by the special conference method to resolve these disputes between
Council 25 and other City Unions.
The City Labor Relations Division is agreeable to honor a letter from Council 25 indicating those members of Council 25 who will serve on a standing Jurisdictional Committee representing Council 25 in such matters.

Mr. Albert Garrett, President
AFSCME, Michigan Council 25
1034 N. Washington
Lansing, Michigan 48906
RE: Union's Pay Equity Study
Dear Mr. Garrett:
During the course of negotiations, Council 25 expressed the desire to conduct a study to determine if the City’s compensation schedule is fair, equitable, and free of gender-based inequities.
The City does not believe that any wage rates in its compensation schedule are predicated upon gender considerations. However, the City agrees to provide statistical bargaining unit information in its possession to the Union, including wage data broken down by job title and sex.
Please be advised that the City does not consider itself to be a participant in the Union's proposed study and shall consider any findings or conclusions to be strictly informational or advisory. The City does agree to meet with representatives of Council 25 in Special Conference upon completion of the study to review and discuss the information assembled.
Labor Relations Director

EXHIBIT I CITY OF DETROIT AFSCME MICHIGAN COUNCIL 25 NON-SUPERVISORY BARGAINING UNIT
RE: BARGAINING UNIT CLASSIFICATIONS
A.	This Agreement covers certain non-supervisory non-confidential employees within various City departments as defined and listed below. Each unit includes those employees in the classifications listed, subject to the exclusions in each unit as noted in the Michigan Employment Relations Commission Unit Certifications and the unit descriptions in the voluntary recognition agreements.
B.	Michigan Council 25 shall represent all employees in the classifications listed in Exhibit I provided that employees in those classifications are not:
1.	supervisory or confidential;
2.	in classifications represented by another labor organization;
3.	employed in the office of the Mayor, City Clerk, City Council, or the City’s Central Labor Relations (i.e., Administration, Non-Economics and Economics Units, only). (When persons in the Temporary Office Service pool work outside of the Human Resources Department or the offices of the Mayor, City Council, or City Clerk, they shall be represented by appropriate locals and pay agency shop fees in accordance with Article 4.)
C.	Unless noted otherwise by Letter Code, which indicate special representation limitations, the classifications listed in Section 1 are represented by Michigan Council 25 on a City-wide basis except for the exclusions listed in paragraph B above. This listing also includes pay rates which represent wage increases negotiated in the 1998-2001 Master Agreement. (See the Official Compensation Schedule for official pay rates.) The Letta* Codes are explained on page 145.
The pay rates shown in Section 1 and the rules of progression through the pay ranges (if applicable) have been collectively bargained. Any changes in wage administration which would have a substantive impact on agreed-upon wages cannot be unilaterally changed and must be mutually agreed to by the parties.
D.	Section 2 of this Exhibit indicates by department the jurisdictions of the local unions of Michigan Council 25.
E.	Section 3 of this Exhibit explains the Step Codes (rules by which employees progress through the pay range) applicable to classifications covered under this Agreement as shown in Section 1.
F.	In the event the City changes any existing bargaining unit position(s) to a new classification, notice of such change and a copy of the class specification shall be sent to Michigan Council 25 and the Local Union President. Upon request, the Local Union President or Council 25 Representative shall be provided documents setting out the reason(s) for the re-classification.
G.	In the event an abolished classification that has been represented by Michigan Council 25, AFSCME, is subsequently reestablished, the previous representation the union had will also be restored.

CITY OF DETROIT AFSCME MICHIGAN COUNCIL 25 NON-SUPERVISORY BARGAINING UNIT
RE: HEALTH CARE PLANS
INTRODUCTION
The City of Detroit offers a traditional hospitalization plan for employees and retirees plus they may choose alternative coverage through one of the health maintenance organizations or preferred provider plans offered by the City. The City will pay the premium for this alternative health care coverage up to an amount equal to the amount the City pays for the traditional plan. A list of the City's current hospitalization carriers and coverage descriptions is contained herein.
Furthermore, the traditional health plan described herein includes several cost containment features. Furthermore, the joint union/management health cost containment committee will be studying additional cost containment programs which will be included during the term of the agreement.
Note: This matter may also be referred to the Central Labor/Management Committee by mutual agreement of the parties, (see Memorandum of Understanding, page 95).
ELIGIBILITY
Note: This summary of health insurance plans described herein contain the essential features of the hospitalization insurance plans offered by the City in general terms. It is not intended to be a full description of coverage. The complete plans are described in the certificate of coverage issued by each plan.
A.	PERSONS ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE:
1.	The employee;
2.	The employee's dependents as explained below:
The legal spouse of the subscriber, unmarried children related by birth, legal adoption, or legal guardianship (while a dependent of the subscriber), and children of the subscriber's spouse (while a dependent of the subscriber). These children are covered from birth to the end of the calendar year in which they attain 19 years of age. This limit shall be extended one more year for those children still in high school.
Unmarried, dependent children who are incapable of self-support because of a permanent mental or physical disability are eligible for coverage. An application card, which contains a "physician's certification of disability”, must be submitted before December 31 st of the year in which the dependent becomes 19 years of age.
-151-

If a disability recurs as a result of the same or related cause or causes, it shall be deemed a continuation of the prior period of disability unless an intervening period of nine months has elapsed in which event the subsequent period shall be deemed the result of a new sickness and subject to a new waiting period and maximum period of benefits.
Termination of benefits for any reasons shall be without prejudice to any claim originating prior to the date of termination.

8.	Pre-Existing Conditions: Any other provisions to the contrary, any disability commencing within twelve (12) months immediately following the effective date of eligibility of an employee, for which treatment was rendered during the 6 months prior to such employee's effective date of eligibility shall not be considered as a disability hereunder.
9.	Waiver of Premiums: With respect to any employee who is totally disabled and receiving benefits hereunder or total disability, the City will waive payment of any premiums with respect to such employee for any period during which such benefits are payable. For any employee who is in the waiting period and no longer on the City's payroll and awaiting the completion of the waiting period, the City will waive payment of any premium.

2.	Dismemberment and Loss of Sight: When injury results in any of the following losses within one hundred days after the date of the accident, the City will pay the applicable monthly accident benefit for the period the employee is totally disabled and entitled to payment, but in no event will such payments be made after the date of such loss for less than the number of months set opposite the loss. In any event, the waiting period must be satisfied. If death occurs before the waiting period is satisfied, no payment will be made.

If the disability commences prior to the claimant attaining the age of sixty (60) years, but after the claimant attains the age of 58 years and 3 months (or prior to attainment of age 55 years, but after 53 years and 3 months, with respect to those employees with 30 or more years of service with the City), benefits will be paid for the period of such disability not to exceed one year, except that benefits under this provision shall also be reduced by the amount of any service retirement allowance paid by the City to the claimant pursuant to Provisions of Title IX, Chapter VI of the City of Detroit Charter and policies of the General Retirement System.
F.	TERMINATION OF INDIVIDUAL BENEFITS
The benefits of any employee shall terminate on the happening of any of the following events:
l.	Immediately upon attainment of the age of 60 years, or 30 or more years of service with the City.
2.	If benefits are provided on contributory basis and the employee fails to make the required contribution, then such benefits shall automatically terminate at the end of the period for which contribution has been made.
3.	The date the employee leaves, due to leave of absence or voluntary layoff as defined by the City, or is dismissed from employment in a class eligible for benefits hereunder, except that absence from work due to involuntary layoff, as defined by the City, shall not be considered as termination of employment for a period of thirty (30) days next following the commencement of such involuntary layoff.
4.	The date the employee becomes eligible to receive a service retirement allowance.

G.	OTHER BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE CITY'S INCOME PROTECTION PLAN
Separate from the Long-Term Disability Plan, the City will be continuing medical insurance coverage for disabled employees who qualify for Long-Term Disability Benefits, and will also pay a $2,500 death benefit in lieu of the City of Detroit Death Benefit Plan to employees qualified for Long-Term Disability Benefits. The medical insurance and death benefit are payable without the elimination period required of the Long-Term Disability Plan. Since these two benefits are available sooner than 9 months, it is doubly important that employees file for Long-Term Disability Benefits prior to 60 days after becoming disabled.

RE: FROZEN MINIMUM RATES FOR CERTAIN ENTRY-LEVEL CLASSIFICATIONS
Those classifications identified in Exhibit V shall have the minimum of their rate range frozen for the duration of this Labor Agreement, provided that any employee who was holding one of these classifications on the date this Labor Agreement took effect shall be entitled to any general wage increases (including any retroactive adjustments) that go into effect on that date. Employees hired or promoted into these classifications after that date shall start at the frozen minimum; except that employees promoted into these classifications shall be entitled to at least a full annual step upon promotion, and where the maximum of the employee's old class is greater than the minimum of the employee's new class the employee shall be entitled to an increase equal to two annual steps.
Step increments for all classes in Exhibit V shall be paid over a period not to exceed six years. Where normal step increments (i.e. 5% annually; 2.5% semi-annually; or 10e per hour semiannually) are not sufficient to take an employee from the minimum to the maximum in six years, then the annual step increment shall be determined by subtracting the minimum rate from the maximum rate and dividing by 6 steps (in the case of semi-annual steps, divided by twelve steps.) This step amount shall be applied to all employees holding the classification.
