Re:	Local 2110 UAW AFL-CIO - and - American Civil Liberties Union,
American Civil Liberties Union Foundation
Dear Maida:
Reference is made to the collective bargaining agreement by and between Local 2110 UAW, AFL-CIO (the “Union”) and the American Civil Liberties Union/American Civil Liberties Union Foundation (the “ACLU”), dated as of April 1, 2008 (the “Agreement”). This letter shall confirm our understandings as follows:
The “employee pension plan” referred to in Article 16(4) of the Agreement may include a 401k plan, provided that:
(a)	Such 401k plan shall apply only to employees hired after the adoption of such 401k plan and only if such 401k plan applies to newly hired employees of the ACLU generally, and shall replace the current defined benefit pension plan and current 401k plan with respect to those newly hired employees only;
(b)	Such 401k plan shall not apply to current employees, who shall continue to participate in the defined benefit pension plan and the current 40IK Plan subject to all of the terms and conditions of such plans, including but not limited to the terms and conditions relating to vesting, pension formula and reporting;
(c)	The 401k plan in which such newly-hired bargaining unit members shall participate shall be no less favorable than the plan applicable to newly-hired employees of the ACLU generally. It is currently anticipated that such 401k plan, if implemented, shall include employer contributions of no less than 2% and an employer match of no less than 100% of the first 1% of an employee’s contribution and 50% of the next 5% of the employee’s contribution for a total match of 3.5%. In the event the ACLU at any time during the term of the Agreement intends to adopt terms of such 401k plan that are less favorable than those set forth above, it shall give notice to the Union and, upon request, negotiate over the terms to the point of either agreement or good faith impasse.

(d)	In the event that the ACLU does not offer a new 401K Plan to new employees pursuant to (a) above, such employees will participate in the current Defined Benefit Plan and the current 40 IK Plan subject to all of their respective terms and conditions.
If the foregoing correctly expresses our understandings, please sign this letter in the space provided below and it shall be a binding agreement between the Union and the ACLU.
Sincerely yours, [	/
