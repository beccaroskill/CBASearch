(C)	Control Measures and Skilled Trades
The parties agree, to the extent possible, to encourage the use of all reasonable control methods to prevent musculoskeletal disorders (MSD’s). Ergonomic remediation efforts may be based on the results of a variety of tools, including job analysis. Job analysis on skilled trades’jobs will be performed as required. Members of the Local Ergonomics Committee will consider solutions within a combination of feasible controls such as:
a. Re-design or re-orient parts, tools and equipment h. Use of mechanical devices or power tools c. Provide adjustable fixtures and work surfaces d. Job re-design
As interim measures pending engineering changes, or where engineering changes are limited in controlling risk factors, administrative controls and feasible work practices will be implemented. Members of the ergonomics committee could consider solutions for reduction of repetitive motions within a combination of feasible administrative controls such as job sharing and job rotation. The recommendations of the Local Ergonomics Committee shall be mutually agreed upon with the Plant Shop Chairman and the Labor Relations Supervisor. Problems not resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the National Joint Committee for final resolution. Jobs considered potential candidates for administrative control practices will be reviewed by the health and safety train
94
er/crgonomic analyst to determine that the original condition wilt not he further aggravated. Any type of control established should be evaluated after three (3) months of its implementation to confirm its effectiveness.
(D)	Job Analysis and Time Lines
Jobs will be identified as candidates for analysis by reviewing injury/illness and lost time data, including the “54-08” Report and appropriate OHM report (s). A good faith effort shall be made to conduct an initial job analysis, as required, within two (2) months of when a job is identified as having a potential MSD risk factor. Each facility will use a documentation process to record progress with ergonomic modification efforts. In that regard, a monthly report will be required of the Local Ergonomic Committee to be forwarded to Corporate OSH and the (JAW DaimlerChrysler Department. Each facility shall implement feasible measures to control MSD risk factors. A good faith effort will be made to implement ergonomic solutions within a six (6) month time frame after the Local Ergonomics Committee determines that corrective action is requited and it prioritizes the remediation. The parlies acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and the reasons need to be documented. The Local Ergonomics Committee is to develop a “top five” list of the most concerning jobs requiring remediation. Factors to be considered for placing a job on the “top five” list shall include injury rates, ErgoPAL scores, lost work time rates and investment cost paybacks.
The LEC will work aggressively to find practical, feasible, economical solutions to the “top five” list. In the event that a Local Ergonomics Committee believes that a facility is not making proper technical resources
95
from the plant available, it should raise the issue with the LEPC. If not resolved, the matter should be referred to the National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) for immediate resolution.
(E)	Ergonomic Support Equipment
Seats, chairs and mats are considered appropriate solutions to control ergonomic risk factors. The Corporation agrees that it will not remove ergonomic support equipment that is currently in use for ergonomic reasons without mutual agreement with the Local Ergonomics Committee.
(F)	Program Management
The Corporation will continue to support a medical management program for early detection, treatment and placement of employees with MSI J’s.
The NJC will continue to review and, when necessary, revise audit procedures in an effort to ensure the effectiveness of the ergonomic process. The NJC will also review periodic reports of the occurrence of cumulative trauma from all UAW represented facilities. Problems arising regarding the proper functioning of laical Ergonomics Committees may be referred to the NJC for review and resolution by appropriate Corporate and Union representatives.
The NJC will continue to develop and sponsor an annual conference, subject to the Joint Activities Board approval, for all designated Local Ergonomics Committee members to disseminate information about state-of-the-art application, to review project funding procedures and other ergonomic administrative matters and lo share information on successful local ergonomics projects.
Acceptable new methods of employee training, medical evaluation, and Ergonomics Committee training will tw
96
evaluated and implemented by the NJC, as appropriate, to assure efficient control of MSD’s. New workable ergonomic concepts, including specific technical information, will be distributed by the NJC to all UAW-represented plants. A video library of corrective actions taken regarding ergonomic problem areas, by various DaimlerChrysler facilities with documentation for dissemination to facilities wilt be maintained at the National Training Center.
The parlies recognized that ergonomic activities are being conducted at many DaimlerChrysler facilities, including ergonomics committees established during the previous agreements. It is not the intent of the parties to reduce any currently existing efforts in ergonomics.
This procedure shall not preclude the filing of a Health and Safely Grievance at Step I of the Grievance Procedure.
The parties are hopeful that by providing these resources, positive gains in employee morale, injury rates, quality and costs will be realized.

Outside Contracting Review Team
October. 2003
Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Regional Director - Region 2B UAW Maumee, OH 43537
Dear Sir:
During the 2003 Toledo-Jeep Negotiations, the parties discussed at great length matters pertaining to outside contracting nottneation. In particular, the Union cited many instances where certain in-house non-project work was performed by outside contractors and the local union was not afforded the opportunity to discuss with Management outside contracting arrangements due to “time and circumstance” preventing advance notification.
The parties agree that meaningful discussion can only occur between Management and the Union when the outside contracting arrangement is known in a timely fashion. Likewise, it is understood by the parlies that emergency situations will arise where lime and circumstances may prevent advance notification and discussion.
The parties rccogni/e there is a need for constructive progress in communication fur a complete understanding and cooperation of our contractual requirements in this regard. Therefore, the parties agree that an Outside Contracting Review Team be established on the local plant level consisting of the Plant Union Relations Supervisor, the Plant Manufacturing Engineering Manager, the Chairman and the Local Skilled Trades Committee Representative. The Outside Contracting Review Team shall meet on a regular and recurring basis to review cur-
142
rent maintenance and construction programs and plans for the facility.
The review process will be a positive approach for sharing information on manpower skills, equipment, and facilities to do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance, and within projected time limits.
In a further effort to ensure all relevant considerations have been reviewed by the Company and Union prior to letting an outside contract for the performance of skilled maintenance and construction work, the parties have prepared a checklist to guide the local review of potential outside contracting matters. The checklist is to be used in conjunction with the Outside Contracting Review Team Meetings and is intended to assist in the advance discussion of projects other than those of an emergency nature.
Very truly yours,

Mr. Nick Vuich
Chairman
UAW Local #12 Jeep Unit
Toledo* Ohio
Dear Sin
During ihe course of these negotiations, the Union expressed concern pertaining to contractor equipment, trailers/cribs and vehicles remaining on-site following the completion of a contract or project. In particular, the Union believes outside contractor property left on sight increases or perpetuates the amount of work being performed hy said outside parties which infringes on work customarily performed by Toledo Assembly Plant Skilled Trades personnel.
The Company informed the Union it would closely monitor the amount and content of outside contractor property on-site. In addition, Ihe Company and Union will continue to address outside contracting issues pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Specific instances of outside contractors performing work which the Union believes to be contrary to contractual requirements will be referred to the Union Relations Supervisor for expeditious resolution.

Warranty and Service Agreements
August 8, 2002
Mr. Nick Vuich
Chairman
Jeep Unit - UAW Local 12
Toledo, Ohio
Dear Sir:
During the 2002 negotiations, there was considerable discussion regarding the subject of warranty and service agreements. The Union expressed serious concern relative to warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided by suppliers and certain service contracts. They further asserted that certain locations fail to provide the Union with proper notice when suppliers are in the plant to perform particular warranty or service agreement work, especially during off-shifts and overtime periods. The Corporation reaffirmed that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract. The Corporation fur-thcr explained that to remain globally competitive, it must be able to utilize warranty arrangements and/or service contracts ordinarily provided by suppliers'.
In an effort to address the Union’s concerns, il is agreed that any time a supplier visits a facility to perform warranty or service agreement work, as provided in the purchase agreement between the parties, the Union will be notified and an employee on that shift with the appropriate skilled trades classification will be assigned with the supplier. Additionally, in the event other employees from
145
e same supplier are performing different warranty or rvice agreement work in other areas of the plant, an nployee with the appropriate skilled trades classifica-t>n will be assigned with the supplier. The purpose of tis assignment Is for the employee to receive training, ccome familiar with the new equipment, and to help nsurc a smooth transition of responsibilities to our killed trades upon expiration of the warranty and/or mice agreements.
-Vhere concerns or abuses are cited by either party ■egarding the aforementioned understanding, such mat, ers will be discussed in Outside Contracting Review Team Meetings in an attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution.

Dear Sir:
During the negotiations, of the 2003 DaimlerChryster-UAW (Jeep) Agreement, the Corporation reaffirmed its commitment for the replacement of personal tools of Skilled Trades employees broken or damaged on the job.
The Corporation informed the Union that the practice will continue during the term of the 2003 Agreement whereby the Corporation will repair or replace tools broken on the Job by hourly Skilled Trades employees provided there is no evidence of employee negligence, abuse or improper usage, with the following limitations:
1)	The maximum amount expended for the repair or replacement of any one tool shall not exceed $300,00, and;
2)	The maximum amount expended at each plant in each year shall not exceed an amount equal to $10.00 multiplied by the total number of hourly Skilled Trades employees on the active roll at the plant in the last pay period ending in the month of June preceding the beginning of each year of the Agreement.
The local plant will be required to establish a repair or replacement of broken tool procedure whereby skilled trades employees may arrange for the repair or replace
149
merit of broken tools through the plant tool crib system. Any costs above $304.00 for the repair or replacement of a broken tool will be the responsibility of the skilled trades employee.

Apprentice Development
November, 2003
Attention: Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Dear Sir:
During the 2003 negotiations, the Corporation and the Union discussed at great length the current status of the Apprenticeship Program.
The Union and the Company acknowledged that skilled trades personnel provide vital support to operations, and that there is a direct relationship between the effectiveness of skilled trades personnel and the success and viability of the operations they serve. Establishing new levels of competence within the apprenticeable trades through training and retraining will permit the Union and the Corporation to pursue the critical objective of continuous improvement in quality, flexibility, operational effectiveness and, in turn, enhance Job security.
The parties also discussed that in view of the fact that a number of skilled trades employees are currently on layoff and/or protected status the need for new Apprentices during the term of the Agreement is diminished.
Consistent with these discussions and in response io cur- ' rent skilled trades demographics, potential future retire- 1 ments, and attrition, the Corporation has agreed to review 1 the need for additional apprentices, and during the term । of the 2003 Agreement, business conditions permitting, I will place (sixteen) 16 apprentices in the program. The dis- I tribution of Apprentices may be equally allocated on an | annual basis beginning in 2005. The Corporation will | place the new Apprentices into the core trades that are
151
representative of the skill sets present in world class automotive manufacturing operations in the United States. Based on a semiannual review, should the Corporation determine it cannot meet this objective, the Corporation will provide the Union the reasons it cannot meet the objective, and the parties will make an adjustment to the objective as appropriate. Every effort will be made to manage the flow of accessions to facilitate the orderly scheduling of core skills training for new Apprentices.

During the course of negotiations, the parties discussed the assigning of overtime within the skilled classifications This letter is to reinforce what we have commonly under stood to be a sound operating principle. The parties agree that, under normal circumstances, it is not advantageous to schedule employees holding skilled classifications for more than twelve (12) hours per day. When it is necessary to work overtime, the Company will make reasonable efforts to utilize off-shill employees holding the same classification lo fill vacancies due to manpower issues. It is also understood that this understanding does not preclude employees in exceeding twelve (12) hours when deemed necessary to ensure operational efficiencies. The parties further agree that conflicts that arise due to this operating principle will be brought to the Plant Labor Relations Department for resolution.

Toledo, Ohio
Dear Sir:
During Ihe course of negotiations, Ihe Union expressed interest in training for Skilled Trades employees on specialized work assignments currently performed by outside contractors. The parties discussed this at length within the framework of the necessity to remain competitive in a global automotive industry. In the past, many challenges arose a result of pre-existing barriers such as overtime, manpower movement, etc. Ihal prevented the Company from fully utilizing its Skilled Trades workforce. The Company and the Union were in accord that the lack of flexibility threatened its ability to be truly competitive.

Intense foreign and domestic pressures have forced both parties to find new ways of doing business, lb that end, a commitment was made to explore opportunities to better utilize its existing workforce and expound upon the current knowledge base. The parlies agreed to finalize a business case for specialized training which provides for creative ways lo utilize those skills to enhance the business enterprise. Specialized training and improved processes to belter utilize our workforce also corresponds to the goal of migration toward Skilled Trades teams.
To maintain operating efficiencies while facilitating
164

In order to enhance cooperative efforts and to create a framework promoting teamwork and non-adversarial communication while sustaining an environment that promotes constructive problem solving, the following guidelines were agreed to as a result of the discussions:
•	The parties acknowledge the necessity to maintain and continue to develop certain specialized skill sets such as vibration analysis, spray mat ion lab, infrared analysis, facility walkthrough, etc. in addition to developing new* types of specialized skill sets such as fiber optics installation (all communication wires) and torque gun systems.
•	Employees who accept work assignments that require specialized training will be required to stay in their current work assignment for eighteen (IS) months from the completion date of the training.

Full Utilization of Skilled Trades
December ft, 2003
Mr. Lloyd Mahaffey
Regional Director - Region 2B UAW 1691 Woodlands Drive
Maumee, OH 43537
In our negotiations leading to the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today, we discussed in great detail the meaning of full utilization of Skilled Trades manpower, as referenced in Letter (209) Full Utilization of Skilled Trades, during periods when outside contractors are being utilized to perform work on the plant premises.
The Union insisted that the Company do everything it can to '‘perform maintenance, construction and tool & die work with its own employees,” placing “primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees”, “fully utilize its seniority employees,” and maintain “maximum employment opportunity”, and “always keep ihe interest of our personnel in mind”.
In response to this matter, the Corporation assured the Union that its policy is to fully utilize its own employees to perform maintenance, fool & die, and construction work provided skilled trades employees are available to work and can complete the project under review consistent with cost and timing parameters as well as supporting production requirements of the plant.
The parties agreed the definition of “full utilization” may not necessarily be limited to skilled trades employees
173
working five (5) days per week, eight (8) hours per day but, also, is not necessarily seven (7) days per week, twelve (12) hours per day but may extend lo daily, weekend and other overtime periods, when outside contractors are on the plant premises and are performing work customarily and historically performed by UAW bargaining unit personnel.
Any alleged abuses of the aforementioned may be referred to Corporate Union Relations and the UAW DaimlerChrysler Representatives to assist in resolving these issues.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr, Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs
During our discussions relative to outside contracting, the utilization of DaimlerChrysler skilled trades employees has been a matter of mutual concern. Although no agreement was reached regarding the definition of “full utilization”, the parties did agree that the appropriate forum in which to address this issue is at the local level, in conjunction with the outside contracting review process. It was indicated that the definition of full utilization will vary from location to location, depending upon the circumstances of each contract, including the number of skilled personnel involved, the number of hours allocated to the project, and the extent to which outside contractors are contemplated for utilization on weekend work.
The parties agreed that the following additional considerations may also bear on the definition of full utilization:
i)	Whether a contractor will perform work on overtime during the workweek and/or on a weekend,
ii)	Whether skilled trades employees are on layoff or in Protected status.
iii)	The necessity for specialized equipment not readily available at a cost which, when added to other factors, exceeds the cost of a contractor performing the work and/or contractor work skill sets or competencies that the Company may not possess.
175
iv)	The percentage of affected trades, if any, to be assigned work along with outside contractors.
v)	The requisite number of plant skilled trades employees available and/or willing to work overtime during the workweek and/or on a weekend which may be required to complete the project under review, consistent with cost and timing parameters.
Although no one of these considerations is necessarily controlling, each may be instrumental in assisting the parties in determining whether the skilled trades workforce is fully utilized as that concept relates to the decision to use an outside contractor.

Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern for the security of its membership and frustration over certain communication issues as well as complaints over the job assignments of non-ToJedo Assembly personnel while in the plant.
The Company agrees that early involvement in special projects is key to a smooth transition from concept, to build, to launch and sustainment.
In an effort to address these issues and to utilize the Bargaining Unit Engineer's considerable expertise, the Bargaining Unit Engineers will be utilized in project planning as early in the process as possible.
It is further understood that when supplier or non-l Bargaining Unit personnel perform tasks on the plant floor related to their product, they will work in liaison with Bargaining Unit Engineers, including advance communication, when the work in question has historically been done by represented employees. The intent of this advance communication with an appropriate represented Engineer is to allow for the clarification of roles and responsibilities and to prevent unannounced entry into Ihe plant by supplier employees.
2(M)
In addition, communication will be enhanced through department meetings with the O, C, and E Committeeman or his representative, whereby the parties will share upcoming project information, estimated duration, and forecasted disciplines.
The parties recognise (hat the future success of Toledo Assembly, its employees and the members of Local 12-Jeep Unit depend upon the cooperative effort of all concerned in building a world-class vehicle.

Memorandum of Understanding — Flexible Operating patterns
Mr. Nick Vuich UAW Local 12 Jeep Unit Toledo, OH
December 16,2003
Dear Mr. Vuich:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the need for the Corporation to be flexible and adaptive to rapid changes in customer demand in the market place. When implemented, Flexible Operating Patterns will allow the Company to increase competitiveness, provide greater job security for our employees, more efficiently utilize assets and improve profitability.
This letter will confirm our understanding regarding models for the Alternative Work Schedule (AWS), and Four Day Work Week Flexible Operating Patterns (FOP’s).
It is anticipated that the AWS, a three crew three shift work pattern, will be appropriate for implementation when customer demand dictates a need for incremental production capacity. With this work pattern, employees would receive thirty-five (35) minutes relief, and will receive fifteen (15) minutes pay for lunch. Team communication, as required, will be addressed during the relief period.
The Four Day Work Week is suitable in situations where more efficient plant operations can be realized with the additional benefit of a shorter work week for our employees.
204
Dependent on customer demand for our vehicles, the parties agreed that the Corporation at its discretion may implement either the Alternative Work Schedule. Implementation of the Four Day Work Week will require advance discussion and approval of the plant LEPC. The applicable administration guidelines for these Flexible Operating Patterns are attached.
It is further understood that in implementing a Flexible Operating Pattern, the Management would not prejudice its exclusive right to schedule and determine the working hours pursuant to Article III, Paragraph 1 of the Agreement, or its exclusive right, subject to the provisions of the Agreement, to --sign and schedule manpower to work a regular five (5) day, eight (8) hour schedule with daily overtime and weekend work.

Dear Sir
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, stains as a qualified person with a disability or membership in any other legally protected class, and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated in their Agreement an “Equal Application” provision that both insures adherence to that principle in ail aspects of employment at Chrysler and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violation of that principle.The parties now recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (i) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the contractual method for the prompt resolution of all claims of denial of equal application rights or claims of sexual harassment, (ii) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (iii) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal, provincial and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of ihe contractual grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently lime consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems, (e) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to

[ Accordingly, the parties have established an Equal Application Committee,

। lives of Plant Management. The representatives of the Local । Union shall be limited to the Unit Chairman, the Unit Vice । Chairman, and the Ch a i rman of the C i v i 1R ights Comm i tree of । the Local Union or a designate representative. The represen* । tatives of Management shall be the Plant Manager, or his des-। ignated representative, and two (2) Plant Management repre-। sentatives at least one of whom is active in the Corporation’s । equal employment opportunity program. Local Plant Equal । Application Committees shall meet during January, April, । July, and November or at times mutually agreed upon, but no ' fewer than four (4) times a year. Copies of minutes from these । meetings will be made available to the Union. Such Union । representatives if not on a full time Leave of Absence for 1 Union Business, and if working in the plant, shall receive pay 1 from the Corporation at their regular hourly rates for time 1 spent in such meetings or when jointly investigating and/or । studying a complaint with a management member of the 1 Local Plant Equal Application Committee, that they would 1 otherwise have worked tn the plant. Local Plant Equal ' Application Committees shall have the following duties:
’ A—Recommend to the Unit Chairman and Human Resources Manager ways and means of promoting use of the grievance ' procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving ’ claims of denial of equal application rights.
250
-Suggest guidelines for Union and Corporalion representa-;s active in the grievance procedure in the proper and >mpt handling or grievances alleging such claims.

Depart mental Transfer Language
December 22, 1987
Dan Twiss, Chairman
Jeep Unit, Local 12
Toledo, Ohio 43657
On December 18. 1987, Company and Union representatives met to discuss a disagreement between the parties regarding the intent of the transfer language of the new agreement.
The union's position was that the language on inter-depan* mental and intra-departmental transfers and the ‘Transfers Permitted” letter limited the total number of moves from one opening in each de pan men t to six (6) moves, but not the total amount of movement plant wide.
The Company pointed out that the language was clear in limiting the number of manpower moves (iotradepartmental, interdepartmental and shift-to-shift) plant-wide, resulting from and opening, to a total of six (6). The Company emphasized that one of its main objectives during negotiations was to limit manpower movement and adopting the union's interpretation would not accomplish that objective. The company specifically stated that the opening created by the inter-departmental transfer described in paragraph “d" of the “Transfer Permitted" letter was not another opening subject to an additional six (6) moves.
After considerable discussion the parties agreed during negotiations that the language limited the number of moves of plantwide as a result of one permanent opening.
The Union pointed out that during negotiations the preliminary discussions resolving the manpower movement issue
252
involved seven (7) moves and the “Transfer Permitted” letter only provided for six (6) moves.
The Company and Union agreed to resolve the entire matter by adding one additional move to the (I) inter-departmental transfer provided for in paragraph “d” of the “Transfer Permitted” letter, will be filled by one (I) intra-departmental transfer, from among those applications on file, if any.
Paragraph “F’ of the “Transfer Permitted” letter would also necessarily be modified to provide that the seventh (7th), rather than the sixth (6th), “transfer, or less if applicants are not available, the resultant opening will be filled by the Employment Office.”
Schematically the maximum moves would now be as follows:
I.	Employee “A” retires from Trim on first shift.	1
2.	Two (2) inrra-departmental transfers on first shift in Trim. 1 3. One (1) shift-t o-shi ft transfer in Trim.	।
4.	Two (2) intra-depart mental transfers on second shift in i Trim.	I
5.	One (1) inter-departmental transfer from Body (first shift) | to Trim.	|
6.	One (J) intra-depanmental transfer on first shift in Body. Resultant opening in Body filled from Employment Office (other than inter-departmental transfer.)
This letter will be in effect at the Parkway facility until either one of the following occur:
•	Implementation of Team Concept
•	Deactivation

During the negotiations the plant pointed out that employee transfers under Article XI would adversely affect product quality and the efficiency of plant operations during certain periods, such as model launch, line speed change, model mix, major production increases and the addition or elimination of a shift, when it is usually impractical to effectuate such transfers.
In view of the seriousness of the problems discussed, the parlies may mutually agree that employee transfers under Article XI may be suspended during the aforementioned periods. However, the Union and Plant Management may mutually agree to allow employees who are denied transfers during such periods to later displace probationary employees hired in a department before such employees gain seniority provided the efficiency and product quality of the involved departments are not adversely affected,
tn any event, it is understood the release of employees from any department shall be subject to the condition that the necessary skills required in that department are fully protected and maintained at all limes.

Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sirs:
During the course of these negotiations, we agreed that two (2) issues within the area of ergonomics required fur* ther study and debate and, therefore, would be discussed following the conclusion of negotiations. Accordingly, following receipt of notification of ratification of the Collective Bargaining Agreements, a study group shall be formed. The composition of the study group shall be the Senior Manager of Current Safety Processes and the Manager of Ergonomics for the Corporation and the head of the DaimlerChrysler UAW Health and Safety Department, along with the UAW International lead ergonomist for the Union. The study group shall investigate and review their findings along with recommendations, if any, with the NJC on two subject matters relating to secondary ergonomic analysis as follows:
The parties utilize a variety of tools such as ihe 1981 NIOSH Lifting and the Three Dimensional Static Strength Predictor (3DSSP) to help determine manual material handling lifting exposures. The study group will continue to discuss the use of these tools as appropriate.
The study group will investigate the potential for the use of additional secondary quantitative assessment tools such as Rapid Upper Limb Assessment Postural Risk (KULA), the ACGIH Hand Activity IavcI TLV, Multimedia Video Task Analysis (MVTA), Humanscale, U of M Energy Expenditure, BA KPA K und others. Such analysis will
290
include practicality (including cost, ease or use, redundancy, and efficiency), the effect on standardization within the company, industry and suppliers, and the potential benefit of using the tools. The results of this study will be discussed and recommendations presented at the NJC before the end of the year 2005.

EARLY WARNING PROGRAM
October 03. 2003
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sirs:
The parties acknowledge that through significant efforts during the term of the last Agreement, tremendous gains have been made in reducing ergonomic recordable injuries. We also recognize that, while our priorities need to be focused on remediation of jobs creating injuries and lost work time, there may also be value on a prospective basis to look at jobs in the future that are producing employee complaints which have not yet risen to the level of recordable injuries. In that context, we explored the feasibility of the Company’s Occupational Health Manager (OHM) to be used as a tool. It was explained that an injury/illness database to capture such signs and symptoms exists within OHM which has the capability of matching job station data to key medical data.
In the assembly facilities, job stations arc automatically fed into OHM via the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering’s AMPs software program. However, the AMPs feed is not currently present in every manufacturing location, and therefore Early Warning will be used in the assembly plants only.
Access to this data for the Ergo Analysts will be made available via key screens in OHM after each Analyst signs a medical confidentiality agreement. This information must be used for the sole purpose of injury identification and not he shared with other parties. The ultimate pur-
292
pose for obtaining such data is to identify potential high-risk jobs that may ultimately create injuries to our employees.

Dear Sir:
During these negotiations, the Parties discussed their mutual interest in reducing the number of Toledo Assembly Plant Supplemental employees who were on indefinite lay off status as of the effective date of the 2003 Agreement. Notwithstanding the limited liability associated with the Supplemental workforce and the fact that seventy seven Supplemental employees have been transferred to permanent status, the Corporation continues to explore socially responsible programs in an effort to address the Supplemental workforce.
As a result of these discussions, the Parties agreed that a program that encouraged the voluntary attrition of these Supplemental employees was appropriate given the current circumstances. Accordingly, without prejudice, the Corporation agreed to uffer the following options to Supplemental employees:
1.	Supplemental employees hired between March 1, 2000 and November 1, 2000 will be eligible for a $5000 Separation Incentive payment
2.	Supplemental employees hired between February I, 2001 and July 1, 2001 will be eligible for a $2000 Separation Incentive payment.

3.	Upon receipt of the Separation Incentive payment, the employee will cease to be an employee of the Corporation and will be deemed to have lost his/her seniority, however will be eligible for preferential hire to other Supplier Park firms.
4.	Supplemental employees may sign up for a future preferential hire opportunity at a third-party owned body and paint facility at OEM wages and benefits. The Corporation will make arrangements with the supplier that these employees will be given preferential hiring considerations. If hired by a third-party, a supplemental employee may terminate employment with DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
5.	Supplemental employees may continue to remain on layoff status until expiration of their recall rights and may be recalled to a temporary, part-time or permanent position at the Toledo complex for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.
6.	Employees will be canvassed to select one of the three options outlined above. The intent of this program is to bring total and Anal resolution to the Supplemental workforce issue inclusion of any grievances associated with this subject matter.

Parity Agreement

Maumee, Ohio 4353?
Dear Mr. Mahaffey;
This letter will confirm the understanding reached between the Corporation and the Union during the 20(13 contract negotiations concerning parity between the Jeep Corporation Union Retirement Income Plan (the Plan) and the DaimlerChrysler - UAW Pension Agreement (the National Agreement.)
Substantial changes were made to the Plan as a result of this understanding, and it is the intent of the parties that the plans are to be interpreted and administered similarly. The parties further agree that the National Plan is the basis for comparison, and that the Plan will be interpreted and administered in a manner consistent with the interpretation and administration of the National Plan.
Two notable exceptions to parity with the National Agreement remain and are identified as follows:
1.	Enhanced 30 & Out Retirement Supplement for Employees with 30 Years of Credited Service as of October 1, 1999.
Employees who had accrued 30 Years of Credited Service by October 1, 1999 continue to be eligible for an enhanced 30 & Out Early Retirement Supplement as described in Appendix I) to the Plan.
314
2,	57 and 10 Protected Benefit.
In bringing the Plan into parity with the National Plan, the 57 and 10 Retirement Eligibility under Article III Section 2(A)(1) ceased to be a set of conditions under which an employee could elect to retire. A consequence of eliminating this eligibility criterion is that employees with an accrued benefit as of December 31, 2003 will have that accrued benefit “protected’* with respect to the retirement provisions of Article III Section 2(A)(1), and the deferred vested provisions of Article III 5(C). This protected benefit will be referred to as the “2003 57 & 10 Protected Benefit”.
An Employee with a 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit who is not otherwise eligible to retire, shall retain the right to draw his 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit upon attaining age 57, under the terms of Article 111 Section 2(A)(1) and as calculated under Article III Section 2(B)(2)(b). Such action will terminate the Employee’s employment and, except with respect to such 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit for purposes of retirement under Article 111 Section (2)(1) or performing a calculation under Article III Section 23 (B)(2)(b) (and only to the extent of such 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit), the Employee will not be considered a Retired Employee under the Plan, but rather an Ex-Employee. The employee will be eligible to commence receipt of the balance of his entitlement (his accrued benefit less the Actuarial Value of his 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit expressed as a monthly annuity) upon satisfying the conditions of Article III Section 5(D).
315
Similarly, an Ex-Employee with a 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit, whose employment is terminated prior to the Employee attaining age 57, shall retain the right to draw his protected benefit upon attaining age 57 under the terms of Article III Section 5(C) and shall be eligible to commence receipt of the balance of his entitlement (his accrued benefit less the Actuarial Value of his 2003 57&10 Protected Benefit expressed as a monthly annuity) upon satisfying the conditions of Article 111 Section 5(D).
For the purposes of determining the actuarial equiv* alence of both the protected benefit and Ihe accrued benefit above, the interest rale and morality table will be those used by the Plan to determine and Actuarial Equivalent of an equivalent lump sum value.
