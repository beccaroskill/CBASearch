A copy of seniority lists when established shall be furnished to the UNION's designated representative.
B.	Employees and the UNION shall be obligated to notify the EMPLOYER by certified mail of any error in the seniority list within thirty (30) days of the date the seniority list is furnished to the UNION's designated representative. Within thirty (30) days of notification of errors, the EMPLOYER shall correct errors in the seniority list and furnish the corrected list to the UNION's designated representative. If no error is reported within thirty (30) days after the date the seniority list is furnished or within thirty (30) days after the date a correction in such list is furnished to the UNION's designated representative, the list will stand correct as posted.
Section 4.	Except in those instances where senior employees are not qualified to perform remaining work duties, seniority shall determine the order of:
A.	Layoff which shall be in inverse order of seniority within each work classification and department*, provided that any employee who is to be laid off and has previously served in a lower work classification covered by this AGREEMENT may request to exercise seniority rights in such lower classification or its designated equivalent.

C.	If a senior employee requests exercise of seniority rights over a less senior employee for purposes of layoff, the senior employee, as a condition of the EMPLOYER granting such a request, must accept the work schedule (days of week, work shift, and number of hours per shift) and work location of the least senior employee. The senior employee, as an alternative to replacing the least senior employee in the department may, if such least senior employee's work location is outside the senior employee's geographical work area, request exercise of seniority rights over the least senior employee in the senior employee's geographical work area. Geographical work areas for the purposes of this section shall be as contained in Attachment A. In situations when more than one (1) employee in a job class is simultaneously requesting to exercise seniority rights to positions in the same lower job class, the EMPLOYER will make reasonable efforts to match scheduled hours by seniority.
Section 5.	The EMPLOYER shall issue written notice of layoff or recall from layoff to affected employees at least ten (10) calendar days in advance of the effective date. Such notice shall be made by certified mail to the employee's last known address as shown by the EMPLOYER's records except when the employees are present at the work site to receive notice. *Certain departments are treated as a single department for purposes of layoff and recall from layoff; see Attachment B.
Section 6.	Assignment of employees to designated departments shall be at the discretion of the EMPLOYER. When it is necessary for the EMPLOYER to assign/re-assign an employee to a different work assignment, the EMPLOYER will provide such employee with two (2) weeks advance notice when practicable.
Section 7.	The UNION will reimburse the EMPLOYER the expense of furnishing seniority lists required by this AGREEMENT in an amount equal to $25.00 per list or $.05 per employee on each list, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $50.00. When more than one copy of the list is requested or required by this AGREEMENT, the UNION shall reimburse the EMPLOYER for such copies at the rate $.20 per page.

AFSCME Council No. 5, Social Service Unit, Local 34 - 2016-2018
Section 8.	The above provisions shall not apply to the seniority list established by the EMPLOYER and provided to the UNION prior to the effective date of a layoff as provided in Section 3A herein.
Section 9.	Employees on layoff will be recalled to fill vacancies in other classes and departments for which qualified, provided they may not exercise seniority rights to create such vacancies. Such employees may waive the recall if the salary rate offered by the EMPLOYER for the position to which recalled is more than twenty (20%) percent below the salary rate of the employee when laid off. The name of an employee so recalled will remain on the layoff list for the class from which laid off, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this AGREEMENT.
The parties agree to provide employees who are laid off and in the “Alternative Placement Process” the opportunity to state their preference when there is more than one placement opportunity available to them. (The County would be obligated to take the employee’s preference into consideration but would not be required to grant the employee’s preference).
The parties agree that if there are alternative placement opportunities available and placement is not accomplished within 2 weeks of the layoff notice, the UNION may appeal the matter to the County Ombudsperson. If placement is not accomplished within 3 weeks of the layoff notice, and if there is an alternative placement opportunity available, the employee will be compensated at the rate of the available position subject to offset by any County derived earnings (i.e. temporary or intermittent wages, or Reemployment Insurance).
Section 10.	For purposes of layoff and recall, the job classes of Financial Worker and Senior Financial Worker shall be considered a single job class, subject to continuation of the "junior/senior" plan for those two classes through the completion of the Financial Worker redesign implementation. For purposes of layoff and recall, the Financial Worker series is equivalent to the Human Services Representative series.
Section 11.	For purposes of layoff and recall, the following job class series shall be considered a single job class: Social Worker and Senior Social Worker, Chemical Health Counselor and Senior Chemical Health Counselor, Clinical Psychologist and Senior Clinical Psychologist, Child Support/Collection Service Officer, Principal and Child Support/Collection Service Officer, Senior.

Section 2. It is specifically understood that any matters governed by statutory provisions, County Human Resources Rules, or departmental personnel rules, except as expressly provided for in this AGREEMENT, shall not be considered grievances under this AGREEMENT. If by law an appeal procedure, other than the grievance procedure contained herein, is available for resolution of a dispute arising from any provision covered by this AGREEMENT and the aggrieved party pursues the dispute through such appeal procedure provided by law, the aggrieved employee(s) shall be precluded from making an appeal under this grievance procedure.
Except that with respect to statutes under the jurisdiction of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or Minn. Stat. §§ 363.01 - .20, an employee pursuing a statutory remedy is not precluded from also pursuing an appeal under this grievance procedure.

to the employee and his/her steward.
10 of 56
AFSCME Council No. 5, Social Service Unit, Local 34 - 2016-2018
Step 2: FORMAL. If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved in Step 1 and the UNION wishes to appeal the grievance to Step 2 of the grievance procedure, it shall be referred, in writing, to the Department Head or his/her designated representative and to the Labor Relations Director or his/her designee within fourteen (14) calendar days after the designated supervisor's answer as provided for in Section 3, Step 1-B. The grievance appeal shall be initiated by means of a written grievance to be signed by the employee and the union representative. The written grievance shall set forth the nature of the grievance, the facts on which it is based, the provisions of the AGREEMENT allegedly violated, and the relief requested. The Department Head and/or his/her designated representative shall discuss the grievance with the UNION within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date presented at a time agreeable to the parties. If the grievance is resolved as a result of such a meeting, the settlement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the Department Head or his/her designated representative and the union representative. If no settlement is reached, the Department Head or his/her designated representative shall give written answer to the union representative within fourteen (14) calendar days following their meeting.
Step 3: MEDIATION. If the grievance is not settled in accordance with the procedure set forth in Step 1 or Step 2, it may be submitted to mediation provided that the UNION and the Labor Relations Director or his/her designee, by mutual agreement, jointly petition the Minnesota BMS for assistance in resolving the grievance within ten (10) working days after the employee and UNION’s receipt of the EMPLOYER’s written answer in Step 2. The parties shall have thirty (30) calendar days in which to resolve the grievance through mediation.
Section 4. ARBITRATION: If the grievance is not settled in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the UNION may refer the grievance to arbitration within fourteen (14) calendar days after the employee and UNION's receipt of the EMPLOYER's written answer in Step 2. The parties shall mutually agree upon an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the selection of an arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the "Rules Governing the Arbitration of Grievances" as established by the Public Employment Relations Act and administered by the State of Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services. The arbitrator shall hear the grievance at a scheduled meeting subject to the availability of the EMPLOYER and the union representatives. The arbitrator shall notify the union representative and the EMPLOYER of his/her decision within thirty (30) calendar days following the close of the hearing or submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to an extension thereof. The fees and expenses for the arbitrator's services and proceedings shall be borne equally by the EMPLOYER and the UNION, provided that each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. Employees who serve as such representatives or witnesses shall not be compensated at a rate in excess of their base pay rate. If either party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it may cause such a record to be made, provided it pays for the record. If both parties desire a verbatim record of the proceedings, the cost shall be shared equally. The arbitrator shall not have the right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this AGREEMENT. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the specific issue(s) submitted, in writing, by the EMPLOYER and the UNION, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue(s) not so submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power to make decisions contrary to or inconsistent with or modifying or varying in any way the application of laws, rules or regulations having the force and effect of law. The decision shall be based solely upon the arbitrator's interpretation or application of the express terms of this AGREEMENT and on the facts of the grievance presented. If the arbitrator determines that the grievance is covered by law or statute, or not covered by the express provisions of this AGREEMENT, the arbitrator shall refer the grievance back to the parties without decision or recommendation.

C. Health Insurance Premium and Plan Design Changes, 2017 and2018,2019
The parties agree to a consensus decision making model within the context of the existing Labor Management Health Care Committee (LMHCC) for the purpose of setting plan design and premium for the years 2017,2018 and 2019 as described below, and subject to the consensus parameters agreed to by the parties and incorporated by reference as an extension to this AGREEMENT.
The LMHCC’s consensus recommendations will be advisory to the EMPLOYER. If a consensus decision is reached by 8/31 of any given year of the contract, both the UNION and the County agree to be bound by the decision, pending County Administration approval. The consensus recommendation will be submitted to County Administration for final approval.
If a consensus decision is not reached by the LMHCC by 8/31 in any given year of the contract, the EMPLOYER will, in its sole discretion, set the health insurance premiums for each plan and implement plan design changes, if any, for that particular year, after consulting with the third party administrator, benefits consultants, and based on the discussions with and input from LMHCC.
During the last year of the contract, If a consensus decision on plan design and premium or continuation of the consensus model is not reached by the LMHCC by 8/31 of thatyear, the parties shall revert to the negotiation process as it has in the past. The EMPLOYER shall present their proposal for changes to plan design and premium in the traditional contract negotiation format, after consulting with the third party administrator, benefits consultants, and based on discussions with and input from the LMHCC. Employee contributions for the subsequent AGREEMENT will continue to be subject to negotiations between the parties.
The consensus model described herein will expire on 8/31 of the last year of this AGREEMENT, unless the LMHCC provides a consensus recommendation that it should be continued into the subsequent AGREEMENT.
D.	Health Insurance Provider Tiers, 2016,2017,2018
As agreed to in prior contracts, the EMPLOYER will, in its sole authority, determine for2016,2017and 2018 how many tiers and which providers are included in which tier. Any such changes will be shared with the LMHCC group with the driving reason for such change and the financial impact initiating the change.
NOTE: Consistent with previous rounds of bargaining, the health insurance plan design and the provider networks /tiers shall not appear in the labor agreement(s), but rather shall reside on the Human Resources Benefits Unit website.
E.	Health Care Plan Reserves Fund
The EMPLOYER will use $3,000,000 from the Health Care Plan Reserves Fund to offset the predicted 2016 premium cost increase of 7.9%.
This action will allow for an additional2.9% point reduction in premium cost. In combination with the 0.75% point reduction in premium cost gained through plan design changes discussed above, the end result is a 4.25% increase to premium costs.
In 2017 and 2018, the EMPLOYER, in its sole discretion, will determine if and how many dollars from the Reserves Fund will be utilized.

AFSCME Council No. 5, Social Service Unit, Local 34 - 2016-2018
ATTACHMENT C
FUNERAL LEAVE ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE AFSCME CONTRACT
The "Funeral Leave" Article (Article 16) of the labor agreement between Hennepin County and AFSCME Council #5 provides that employees can receive paid leave to make necessary funeral arrangements and to attend funeral services in the event of a death in the employee's "immediate family." Article 16 defines "immediate family" for this purpose as comprising the following family members:
"...spouse, parent, step-parent, parent-in-law, children, stepchildren, brothers, brothers-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, grandparents, grandparents-in-law grandchildren, or person regarded as a member of the employee's immediate family.'' (Emphasis added.)
The bolded part of the provision cited above first appeared in the 1994-95 labor agreement. The intent of this new provision was to recognize "non-traditional" family relationships that employees might have with persons who do not meet the literal definitions enumerated above, but who fulfill the same roles for the employee. For example, the funeral of an employee's domestic partner would qualify for paid leave under this language, if the domestic partner's relationship to an unmarried employee is comparable to that of a married employee's spouse. Similarly, such a domestic partner's parents would be analogous to parents-in-law, and the domestic partner's children would be analogous to the employee's children or stepchildren. Another type of qualifying relationship could be the parent of the employee's children (if the parents are not married).
Because the criteria relate to the definition of "immediate family" found in the labor agreement, application of the term must be consistent with the definition found in the agreement. An employee's qualifying "non-traditional" family relationship should virtually be the equivalent of a qualifying "traditional" relationship. There should be a history to the relationship that establishes such equivalency.
It would be inappropriate, for example, for an employee to decide that any funeral qualifies for paid leave under this article, because all humanity is a "family." It would also be inconsistent with the intent of the language for the employee to decide that a friend is the equivalent of a brother or sister (although a friend might qualify as a "brother" if he and the employee grew up together in the same household). Friendship alone is not a defining characteristic of either traditional or nontraditional relationships.

Letter - Local 34 Issues
November 22, 1999
Rita During
AFSCME Council 14
300 Hardman Ave So, Suite 2
South St. Paul, MN 55075
RE: Local 34 Issue
Dear Ms. During:
In the current labor contract negotiations for the Social Service Bargaining Unit (Local 34), the Union has proposed that “If the Employer hires new employees above the entry rate, the Employer will immediately raise all employees, in the same classification and at a lower rate, to the rate of the newly hired employee.”
In principal, the County agrees that hiring new employees at a higher rate than paid to existing employees in the same class who are equally or better qualified has the potential to create perceptions of inequity and generally should be avoided. However, the County does not consider paying employees, whether new or existing, above the entry rate of the negotiated pay range to be a violation of the labor agreement and is not agreeable to, in effect, imposing financial penalties on itself for doing so.
The County understands and appreciates the Union’s concerns on this matter and intends to be responsive in any future incidents as it has been in the past. To ensure that the Union has a means to address any concerns it does not feel are being properly addressed through normal channels, the Union many refer such concerns to the Deputy County Administrator or his/her designee. The Deputy County Administrator will serve as an “ombudsperson” on these matters in the same way he/she serves as the County “ombudsperson” on health and safety matters.
Sincerely,
Rolland C. Toenges

Clarification of Health Insurance Article
December 1, 1995
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
This letter is to clarify the interpretation of Section 7 of Article 22, Insurance, contained in the collectively bargained agreement between Hennepin County and AFSCME Council 14 for the period January 1996 through December 1997.
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that there is a mutual duty to bargain regarding a change in the level of health insurance benefits unless such change occurs as a result of a change in insurance carriers or self insurance.
The parties further acknowledge that, pursuant to existing Minnesota Statutes, the aggregate level of benefits provided by a group insurance contract may not be reduced unless the parties to the collective bargaining agreement agree to the reduction in benefits. Under existing statutes, therefore, if a change in insurance carriers or self insurance will result in a reduction in the aggregate level of benefits for employees, such change may not occur without agreement of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement.

Clarification of Seniority Letter
March 8, 1994
Mr. Steve Marincel
Business Representative
AFSCME Council #14
267 Lafayette Frontage Road South
St Paul, MN 55107-1683
Dear Mr. Marincel:
The purpose of this letter is to clarify how the parties shall interpret and administer Article 6, Seniority, Section 9 of our Clerical and Related Labor Agreement. Section 9 reads as follows:
"Employees on layoff will be recalled to fill vacancies in other classes and departments for which qualified, provided they may not exercise seniority rights to create such vacancies. Such employees may waive the recall if the salary rate offered by the EMPLOYER for the position to which recalled is more than twenty (20%) percent below the salary rate of the employee when laid off. The name of an employee so recalled will remain on the layoff list for the class from which laid off, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this AGREEMENT."
An employee laid off pursuant to Article 6, Section 4 will be recalled via Section 9 to fill vacancies in other classes and departments for which qualified. The employee must accept such recall unless the pay for the job class to which he/she is recalled is more than 20% below that of the job class from which laid off.
The Employer will first recall such laid off employees to vacancies covered by the Clerical and Related Bargaining Unit. If no vacancy is available within the bargaining unit, the Employer will recall such employees to a vacancy outside the bargaining unit, if available.
If the vacancy to which an employee is recalled via Section 9 is in a different class than that from which he/she was laid off (either within bargaining unit or outside bargaining unit), the employee will remain on a layoff list for the job class and bargaining unit from which laid off. When a vacancy occurs anywhere in the bargaining unit in the job class from which the employee was laid off, the employee shall be recalled to fill such vacancy subject to seniority provisions. Upon such recall, the employee will be removed from the layoff list.
If after recalling an employee to a vacancy in a different job class from which laid off (via Section 9), a vacancy becomes available in the job class from which the employee was laid off, but such vacancy is outside the bargaining unit, it shall be the Employer's option to assign the employee to such vacancy. If the employee is so assigned, he/she shall remain on a layoff list for the job class from which laid off in the bargaining unit.
If this interpretation is consistent with your understanding of Article 6, Section 9, please so signify by signing below.
Sincerely,

Consensus Model Based Insurance Proposal and LMHCC Structure 10/8/15 Tentative Agreement, edits based on Alison 11/9/15 email.
Consensus Parameters: County suggests that these parameters be signed by the parties in a Memorandum of Understanding and incorporated by reference as part of the CBA.
1.	For the term of this contract, the scope of the current LMHCC will expand to include consensus decision-making on the topics of plan design and premium, consistent with the consensus parameters established by the parties below.
2.	It is understood that the LMHCC will continue to operate as an educational and conversation vehicle year-round, with the
consensus process only utilized for decisions related to plan design and premium. While these decisions may come up at anytime during the year, it is expected that most of the decisions requiring a consensus will occur late in the summer each year.
3.	The parties will engage in a good faith effort to reach a consensus decision on premiums and plan design and realize that
this may take several additional meetings in late summer of each year.
4.	Attendance at the LMHCC remains available to all current attendees, but each bargaining unit will identify one "oonsensus
representative” (and an alternate) who will be responsible to speak for their bargaining unit on the two consensus issues of premium and plan design. The consensus representative will be polled and must indicate whether or not his/his bargaining unit can support consensus on a plan design or premium issue (or, in the last year of the contract, the continuation of the consensus model into the future contract). In all cases, if a consensus decision is reached, both the union and the county agree to be bound by the decision, pending County Administration approval.
5.	There will be a total of 17 eligible "oonsensus representatives,” one representing each bargaining unit, and 8 management members from County Benefits and Labor Relations staff who will also be considered eligible "oonsensus representatives”.
6.	One Business Agents/attorney representative from each unit, as well as a Council 5 staff member may attend LMHCC
meetings and may be the consensus representative/alternate for a particular local if that is the desire of the particular union/local.
7.	Representatives (or alternates) to LMHCC must be present at multiple meetings, particularly during July/August of each year, to provide their bargaining unit’s opinion on any consensus decision. If a representative/alternate is not present, the LMHCC will proceed without their input.
8.	Early in 2016, a mediator will be asked to train the LMHCC on the concepts of facilitation and to explain how the consensus process differs from a negotiations or a voting process. The parties may also choose to continue to call upon the mediator as a facilitator if needed.
9.	All Union representatives and County representatives must be in consensus to reach a decision. The parties understand
that a representative 's consent to a decision indicates a willingness to accept the decision, not necessarily full endorsement.
10.	A consensus decision must be reached by August 31st, 2016 and2017 (2018 if there is a 3rdyear of the contract) to allow for appropriate timing of open enrollment.
i.	If full consensus on premium amount and plan design is reached by August 31st of any year2016,2017 or 2018, the
consensus plan will be submitted to County Administration for final approval.
ii	If full consensus on premium amount and plan design is not reached by 8/31 of any year2016,2017,2018, the
decision on premium and plan design forthat year will revert back exclusively to County Administration. The Labor Relations Director will present to the County any potential items/topics on which consensus was reached as well as the items/topics in dispute.
11.	In addition, during the lastyear of the contract, whether that year is August 2017 or August 2018, the LMHCC will attempt to reach a consensus recommendation regarding the premium amount and plan design for the first year of the new contract (plan year 2018 if a 2 year contract; plan year 2019 if a 3 year contract), as well as a consensus decision regarding whether or not to recommend continuation of the LMHCC consensus model.
i.	If consensus on plan design and premium amount is not reached by 8/31 of the negotiations year, the parties shall
revert to the negotiation process as they have in the past. The employer shall present their proposal for changes to plan design and premium in the traditional contract negotiation format.
ii.	If a consensus on whether or not to continue the consensus model is not reached by 8/31 of the negotiations year,
the parties will revert to the negotiation process as they have in the past.
iii.	In all cases the amount of employee contribution under the new contract remains subject to negotiations.
12.	It is understood that the County’s recommended rate need for the health plan, as well as the County’s assessment of the plan’s status vis-a-vis the Cadillac tax is determined in consultation with actuaries and is not subject to the consensus process outlined below. (The parties acknowledge the Cadillac tax will not be a factor during the term of this agreement)
13.	Use of the County’s reserves or other financial assets is not an appropriate topic for the consensus discussions. The

LMHCC is charged with finding a consensus recommendation regarding premium and plan design that does not include the use of reserves. The LMHCC may choose to submit a separate recommendation (or not) regarding the reserves, which County Administration may consider with no obligation to agree. In all cases, the County Administration retains sole discretion on any decision regarding the reserves. Any decision by the County to use reserves in the future will be timely shared with the LMHCC in order to incorporate such information into discussions leading to consensus.
Neither the consensus process nor a negotiations process will be used for changes mandated by law or a vendor. However, the parties will negotiate the effects of any such changes.
The county reserves any and all rights with regard to benefit plan administration and policy unless specifically identified in this document or in the collective bargaining agreement. Nothing herein waives, expressly or implied, the Union’s right to negotiate any mandatory subject of bargaining.
There is no implied commitment by either party to the consensus process beyond the term of this contract. Prior to August 31 of the last year of the contract, the LMHCC will determine any continuation terms as described above.
