2003-2004 CITY-SEIU Work Preservation Agreement (Parties Tentative Agreement - Reached 7:30am on May 9th, 2003)
May 9, 2003
I Preamble
Recognizing the challenging fiscal realities facing San Francisco and the State of California, the parties agree that in order to preserve City services and employment, they must work cooperatively to identify operational efficiencies, explore additional sources of revenue, and reduce the size of the City workforce through attrition, retraining and reorganization. The parties further agree that it is in their mutual interest to avoid unnecessary reductions in direct public services and to prevent existing City employees from becoming jobless and therefore they mutually agree that they shall focus their efforts to maintain programs and public service jobs to the fullest extent possible.
II
Economic Mitigation
The Union agrees that represented employees shall assume payment of their mandatory employee retirement contribution in an amount equal to 7.5% of covered gross salary until close of business 6/30/04, a program which will achieve an estimated annual savings to the general fund of $28 million dollars. With equal participation from all other City unions, this city-wide agreement will save approximately $90 million in the City’s General Fund, preserving the employment of more than 1,250 individuals currently working for the City.
In addition, savings to enterprise and special funds through this Agreement will preserve additional jobs in Departments that rely upon those funds and will create additional opportunities for displaced workers employed through the General Fund to find alternative employment in the City.
III
Work Preservation Fund
To create a resource for the preservation of SEIU jobs and essential City services, the City and the Union agree to create a Work Preservation Fund (WPF) for fiscal year 2003-2004. The Union shall contribute to the Fund as follows:
1.	Work Preservation Fund Resources
a.	Pay Equity. The Union agrees to release to the City approximately $1 million set aside for pay equity adjustments in the 2000-2003 CBA, resulting in an additional $1 million savings in 2003-2004.
b.	Step Advancement. The Union further agrees that, for fiscal year 2003-2004, there shall be no step advancements based on time in class. This will result in a savings to the General Fund of approximately $2.7 million in the first year of this CBA. Step advancements will resume in fiscal year 2004-2005. This provision shall not be subject to any economic reopener for 2004-2005.
c.	Retirement Pick-Up. The Union agrees that represented employees shall assume payment of their mandatory employee retirement contribution in an amount equal to 7.5% of covered July 1, 2003 - June 30, 2006 CBA Between City and County of San Francisco and
SEIU LOCALS 250, 535 & 790

gross salary for the full paycheck issued on July 1, 2003 (covering the last full pay period in June 2003) and for all gross salary earned in fiscal year 2003-2004.
d.	State Revenue. The parties agree to apply to the WPF unanticipated state revenues identified and secured by the Union which are expected to result in an additional 1 million dollars of General Fund monies.
e.	Additional Savings. The parties agree that the expected funding for the services identified in Section 2 (a) (i) relating to the Mental Health Rehabilitation Facility (MHRF) and those relating to jail health services includes cost savings totaling approximately 3.5 million dollars not within the scope of issues in these negotiations. Therefore, it is expressly understood that if the expected funding is not secured, the parties will immediately resume negotiations on alternative means of funding the MHRF and funding jail health services. Mediator Barry Winograd shall retain jurisdiction to assist the parties in identifying sources of alternative funding for these programs. Should the parties fail to resolve their differences before June 15, 2003 the City shall be under no obligation under 2(a)(i) or 2(b)(i) as the latter relates to jail health services.
2.	Use of Work Preservation Fund
a.	Staffing and Services. During Fiscal Year 2003-2004, WPF resources shall be used to assist the parties to accomplish the following objectives in the 2003-2004 Budget:
i.	Mental Health Rehabilitation Facility: Contingent upon full funding in the WPF as outlined in Section 1 (Work Preservation Fund Resources), the Department of Public Health agrees to continue to operate the MHRF for fiscal year 2003-2004 as a sub-acute, locked, skilled nursing psychiatric facility, as it was on January 1, 2003. No later than October 1, 2003, the Mayor will establish a Blue Ribbon committee chaired by the Director of Public Health to study the future use of the MHRF. SEIU may appoint a member to this committee.
In resolution and full settlement of the Union’s January 1, 2004 grievance over the MHRF and this sub-section, on or about August 15, 2005 the City agrees to provide a lump-sum settlement to all SEIU represented employees on the payroll as of June 1, 2004 in an amount equal to .75% of 04-05 SEIU General Fund payroll costs as determined by the Controller and set forth as Exhibit B in the City's 2004-2005 Arbitration Exhibit Binder. Part-time employees will be paid a pro-rata share of the lump-sum settlement paid to full-time employees based upon hours worked. This settlement payment shall not be considered part of base wage. The Union agrees to withdraw its January 1, 2004 grievance over the MHRF and this sub-section.
ii.	Laundry Facility: The City agrees to continue use of civil service employees to perform offsite laundry services for Laguna Honda Hospital. It is understood, however, that civil service employees shall be reassigned as necessary during construction and/or relocation of new offsite laundry facilities for Laguna Honda. The City commits to completing the construction and/or relocation of the laundry as promptly as possible, and anticipates reopening the facility within the period between January 1 and April 1 2004. Upon its reopening, the City shall staff and operate the facility with civil service employees in the current job classifications. The parties shall explore together ways to make the new offsite laundry facilities economically self-sustaining.
To resolve the Union’s pending April 28th, 2004 grievance over the Laguna Honda laundry facility and this sub-section, the parties agree to expedited arbitration for hearing and decision by December 1, 2004 before Barry Winograd, or if he is unavailable, before another neutral by mutual agreement.

iii.	Log Cabin Ranch: The City agrees that future services in the current Log Cabin Ranch facility will be performed by civil service employees.
iv.	Pool Cashiers and Locker Room Attendants: The Work Preservation Fund shall be used to create “near list” placement opportunities for Pool Cashiers and Locker Room Attendants who cannot be reassigned to other positions at the Department of Recreation and Park.
v.	Floyd Ray-Ed Gazzano Budget Partnership Committee: Between January 1 and March 31st of each year of this Agreement, the City and the Union will convene a city-wide committee to study and offer advisory recommendations to improve work procedures in City operations, with the committee consisting of a maximum of seven representatives from each side. This committee shall meet twice per month.
Between November 1 and January 31st of each year of this Agreement, there shall also be established departmental sub-committees of no more than five persons per side at the ten departments that employ the largest number of bargaining unit members. An additional sub-committee of the same size shall be established to address work procedures in other City departments employing bargaining unit members. These committees shall meet once per month.
The city-wide and departmental committees will cooperate to assess effectiveness and efficiency of work groups and methods, including cost-savings, gain sharing, workplace best practices, and improved delivery of services to the public. The citywide committee can seek appropriate funding necessary to carry out its work. A city-wide committee report will be presented to the Mayor not later than March 31st.
These committees will not supplant collective bargaining between the parties nor shall=they supercede the rights of the parties under Charter section A8.409 et. seq.
Members shall be released the full day of the scheduled committee meetings for caucuses and meeting participation.
b.	Contracting Out and Bargaining Unit Work: WPF resources shall be used to assist the parties to achieve the following principles regarding contracting out and bargaining unit work:
i.	Contracting Out: The parties agree to abide by existing CBA provisions regarding contracting out and to respect all rights and privileges of the parties as reflected in the MOU, the City Charter and state law, including constraints that may exist under such provisions regarding contracting out, and the transfer and/or reassignment of bargaining unit work, for existing employees in layoff status.
To resolve disputes arising under the MOU provisions regarding contracting out, the parties will establish an expedited arbitration system to be known as the “Contracting Arbitration Board,” chaired by Arbitrator Barry Winograd or another mutually agreed upon neutral chair. The Board also will include one designee from the City and one from the Union. The Board will be scheduled in advance for up to six days per year, for expedited hearings on any contracting out grievance filed with the Board. To carry out the Board’s work, the neutral chair may direct the production

and exchange of relevant documents prior to the hearing, and adopt such other procedures as will assure a prompt and fair resolution of any claim hereunder.
ii.	Bargaining Unit Work: The City agrees that it will not assign work currently performed by SEIU represented employees to any other bargaining unit.
c.	Internal Job Placement Committee
The parties agree that within ten (10) days of reaching tentative agreement, the City and SEIU shall reconvene an internal job placement committee (IJPC). The committee shall consist of no more than 10 representatives from each party, including a representative from the Mayor’s Office and DHR. The committee shall be co-chaired by the Mayor’s senior management designee and a designee of SEIU. For the first ninety (90) days after its establishment, the committee shall meet at least once a week unless mutually agreed otherwise. Members of this committee shall be on City-paid release time while at IJPC meetings. The mission of the committee shall be, to the maximum extent possible under the financial circumstances, to maintain City employment for all SEIU represented employees facing layoff or displacement.
The parties affirm their commitment to utilize Proposition F, the City’s Early Retirement Program (ERP), as the primary tool to mitigate the impact of any layoff or displacement. In accordance with the Budget Director’s memo dated April 28, 2004, the City will utilize Proposition F to the maximum extent legally permissible and commits to use best efforts to provide early retirement opportunities before layoffs occur. The City agrees to provide an early retirement status report at each IJPC meeting. The status report shall include updates on: (a) ERP-identified classifications and; (b) the Controller’s certification of ERP slots.
The IJPC shall be responsible for identifying alternative employment within the City for employees facing layoff or displacement. In addition to conferring regarding near-list opportunities and vacancies for employees facing layoff or displacement, the committee shall make recommendations to the City regarding the following subjects and any other alternatives that it may identify which the City will make all reasonable efforts to implement:
i.	Savings that can be used to create jobs from existing budgeted and authorized vacant positions;
ii.	Opportunities to utilize EDD workshare or similar arrangements as an alternative to planned layoffs; including but not limited to a pilot EDD workshare program.
iii.	Maintenance of existing positions funded by reductions in overtime expenditures related to bargaining unit work;
iv.	Use of enterprise and/or other non-General fund savings attributable to Unions’ agreements that employees assume payment of any portion of their mandatory retirement contribution to create or fill non-general fund jobs.
d.	Job Retraining and Assistance: For employees facing layoff or displacement and for whom alternative City employment is unavailable, in addition to all other CBA provisions regarding training, retraining and alternative placement, the parties agree as follows:
i.	The City and Union will apply jointly for any available retraining grants from the State or Federal governments;
ii.	During any period of retraining not to exceed six months, in either a grant funded program or other approved retraining, the City agrees to utilize the WPF to pay the difference between unemployment insurance benefit and the employees City base wage to the extent funds remain available. Such employees shall not be entitled to any severance benefits provided in this CBA.

Early Retirement
The parties recognize that an early retirement program, if properly designed, could reduce the City’s workforce. The parties further recognize that such a measure must be designed in an equitable manner that achieves permanent reductions in a manner that permits the City to continue to provide effective, essential services.

If the City does not meet this 90-day deadline, the grievant(s) shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 5% per year beginning on the 91st day until the date the check is issued.

Policy
577.	The City acknowledges its responsibility to provide safe, healthful work environments for City employees and users of City services. Every employee has the right to safe and healthful working conditions.
578.	Upon request of the Union, Departments will meet with the Union to discuss and address safety concerns relating to facilities where employees are assigned to work alone while the facility is open to the public. These discussions may include proposals to provide cellular phones, personal alarm devices, and/or other options where appropriate.
579.	Where the employee has a good faith belief that a work assignment presents health and safety risks outside those normally associated with the work, he/she may refuse to begin or continue a work assignment.
580.	When in such a case an employee declines to begin or continue a work assignment, she or he shall notify his/her in-house safety officer of the situation. The in-house safety officer shall promptly investigate the complaint. While the employee is awaiting the arrival of the in-house officer, and until the officer has made his/her determination, the employee shall not be required to perform the disputed assignment.
581.	If the safety officer determines that the complaint is valid, his/her decision shall override the "departmental" management decisions, including abatement procedures or employee re-assignments. If, after investigation, the in-house officer determines that the work assignment does not present such an unsafe condition, he/she shall notify the employee. The employee shall then have the following options:
1.	continue the work in reliance on the decision;
2.	request a re-assignment, which shall not be unreasonably denied; or
3.	continue to refuse the work assignment.
582.	If the employee elects option three, he/she shall not be paid unless he/she executes an agreement that if it is ultimately determined that the complaint was invalid, the money shall be repaid to the City. If it is ultimately determined that the employee's complaint was valid, and he/she has not elected to be paid, the employee shall be made whole for all lost wages and benefits.
583.	Employees shall not be subject to discipline or retaliation for exercising any rights under this Section unless it is finally determined that the employee's complaint was a gimmick, e.g., was made or pursued in bad faith or for ulterior motives unrelated to the merits of the dispute.
584.	The Union may employ or assign its own safety consultant to investigate the situation in conjunction with the City's in-house officer. If after consultation between the two, the dispute remains unresolved, it shall be submitted for final determination to a neutral arbitrator selected pursuant to the provisions of the section covering Expedited Arbitration (page 78) or another mutually agreed upon third party.

676.
677.
678.
679.
1)	The birth of a biological child of the employee;
2)	The assumption by the employee of parenting or child rearing responsibilities. Family care leave does not apply to an employee who temporarily cares for a child for compensation, such as a paid child care worker;
3)	The serious illness or health condition of a family member of the employee, the employee's spouse or domestic partner, a parent of the employee or the employee's spouse or domestic partner, the biological or adoptive child of the employee, or a child for whom the employee has parenting or child rearing responsibilities; or

Personal Leave
687.	Personal leave for permanent employees may be approved for a period of up to 12 months within any two-year period.
B. RETURN TO WORK
688.	The City will make a good faith effort to return an employee who is pregnant or who has sustained an injury or illness and whose doctors certify that he or she is temporarily unable to perform specified aspects of his or her regular job duties to temporary modified duty within the employee's medical restrictions. Duties of the modified assignment may differ from the employee's regular job duties and/or from job duties regularly assigned to employees in the injured employee's class. Where appropriate modified duty is not available within the employee's classification, on the employee's regular shift (including regular days off), and in the employee's department, the employee may be temporarily assigned pursuant to this section to work in another classification, on a different shift (including different days off), and/or in another department. The City will make a good faith effort to avoid assigning the employee to work on a different shift or different days off, and will appropriately train the employee for the new assignment. After a period of three (3) months, the parties shall evaluate the modified duty assignment in conjunction with the employee's medical restrictions. It is understood that modified duty assignments are temporary only.
689.	An employee who is absent because of an occupational or non-occupational disability and who is receiving Temporary Disability, Vocational Rehabilitation Maintenance Allowance, State Disability Insurance, may request that the amount of disability indemnity payment be supplemented with salary to be charged against the employee's accumulated unused sick leave with pay credit balance at the time of disability, compensatory time off, or vacation, so as to equal the normal salary the employee would have earned for the regular work schedule.
690.	An employee who wishes not to supplement, or who wishes to supplement with compensatory time or vacation, must submit a written request to the Appointing Officer or designee within seven (7) calendar days following the first date of absence. Written requests made subsequent to this time shall be effective at the start of the payroll period following the request. Disability indemnity payments will be automatically supplemented with sick pay credits (if the employee has sick pay credits and is eligible to use them) to provide up to the employee's normal salary unless the employee makes an alternative election as provided in this section.
691.	Salary may be paid on regular time-rolls and charged against the employee's sick leave with pay, vacation, or compensatory time credit balance during any period prior to the determination of eligibility for disability indemnity payment without requiring a signed option by the employee.
692.	Sick leave with pay, vacation or compensatory time credits shall be used to supplement disability indemnity pay at the minimum rate of one (1) hour units.
693.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the supplemental disability income credit program shall continue in effect during the term of this Agreement, except that the employee’s pay shall be supplemented under the program up to the employee’s approximate net pay rather than gross pay.

behavior or prior to being asked to submit to a drug or alcohol test. Selfidentifying after notification of a drug or alcohol test will not relieve the employee of the requirement to take a test, nor will it be cause to prevent the implementation of disciplinary action on the basis of the results of the test or refusal to be tested.

The Airport recognizes that confidentiality of information obtained in the drug and alcohol testing process is a critical concern to all employees who have been or will be tested. The Airport will handle test results and employee information in a
confidential manner. All participants in the collection, testing and reporting process
will be informed of their responsibility to protect the employee's privacy and testing
program confidentiality. Testing records and results wi limited designated personnel authorized to receive such
l be released only to the nf tarnation.
F.	All employees performing safety-sensitive functions, as provided in III.A. above, shall be subject to urine drug testing and alcohol testing by an evidential breath testing (EBT) device, for reasonable suspicion (see G. below), following an accident (see H. below), on a random and unannounced basis, and prior to return to duty and on a follow-up basis after rehabilitation (see I. below).
1.
Drugs to be tested for include marijuana, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine (PCP), and amphetamines. Alcohol concentration is measured by EBT.
2.	If an employee in a safety-sensitive position refuses to take a required drug or alcohol test, tests positive for any of the above-listed drugs, or shows an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or EeRler, such employee shall be immediately relieved of his or her safety-sensitive functions, shall be referred to the Medical Review Officer ("MRO"), and may be subject to discipline based on the facts of the case, up to and including discharge.
3.

more vehicles involved sustains disabling damage as a result of the occurrence and must be towed | ^Wh'. A post-accident drug test will be administered to an employee or employees When an accident, I EFdefined above, has occurred and the employee performed a safety-sensitive function that either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor in the accident. An employee will be subject to alcohol testinl EEn a post-accident situation only when the employee's conduct causes a supervisoror manager reasonably to suspect that the employee may be under the influence of alcohol.
I.	. "Return-to-duty" testing as used in this policy means a drug or alcohol test required when the Airport allows an employee who did not pass a drug or alcohol test to return to I Eojk or when an employee has self-identified before any testing is required and has successfully completed an appropriate rehabilitation program. The SAP must determine that the employee may return to duty. Employees returning to duty as described in this paragraph may be given unannounced "follow-up" drug or alcohol tests, or both, if recommended by the SAP. Such follow-up testsshall not exceed a two year period, unless special circumstances prompt the SAP to recommend an extension of this period.
IV. Drug and Alcohol Testing Procedures
SFIA/SEIU drug testing procedures shall be based on Department of Transportation (DOT) standards. The procedures set forth below were established as of July 2000 and are for general informational purposes. To the extent these procedures have been modified by more current DOT standards, DOT standards shall supersede those set forth here.
A.	Pre-Employment Testing
1.	Purpose - The purpose of pre-employment testing is to identify applicants who have consumed a prohibited drug in the recent past. This behavior has the potential to impact the workplace and may present an unacceptable safety risk to the employee, coworkers, passengers, and the general public. The Airport will not hire an applicant who tests positive in a pre-employment drug test. |=]
2.	Coverage - Applicants, except current City employees, seeking the following positions will be required to submit to urine drug testing as part of the selection process:
a.	Candidates applying for the following positions are subject to preemployment drug testing:
9202 Airport Communications Dispatcher

b.	Applicants, except current City employees, for classifications whose incumbents must obtain security clearances because of their access to areas secured by U.S. Customs will also be subject to preemployment testing. Such classes currently include:
2708
2716
2718
2719
7268

c.	Applicants who test positive, or who decline to be tested, will not be further considered.
3.	Pre-employment drug testing shall be administered only after the candidate has been given and has accepted a conditional job offer. The conditional offer shall specify that a final offer shall be conditioned upon, among other things, negative drug test results.
4.	Collection and testing procedures for pre-employment drug testing will be the I E=Je as for other types of testing as described in paragraph F, as applicable to the circumstances, except that the individual will not be escorted to or from the collection site.
B.	Random Testing
1.	The Airport will administer random drug tests to employees in classifications listed in Section III.A. of the Policy Concerning Substance Abuse Random drug tests will be conducted without advance notice during employees' normal working hours.
a.	All employees will be placed in a random testing pool, from which random selection shall be made. The Human Resources Director or his/her designed representative shall notify said employees in as confidential manner as reasonably possible.
b.	The random numbers or other identifiers assigned to all employees who have been selected for random testing shall be immediately returned to the pool, so that everyone has an equal chance of being selected for the next round of testing.

2.	The Airport will annually require at least I25% of the covered employees to undergo drug testing, except that the Airport Director may revise the testing rate after reviewing data concerning the rate of positive tests in the previous calendar year. Random testing will be conducted throughout any given year at a relatively steady I ate, although the days of the week and the times when testing is conducted wilrrary.
C.	Reasonable Suspicion Testing All employees shall be subject to reasonable-suspicion testing in classifications set forth in Section II.A. and B.
D.	Post-Accident Testing
1.	Purpose - The purpose of post-accident drug testing is to determine whether substance abuse has been a causative factor in an accident in which an individual dies or is injured or disabling damage occurs to one or more vehicles involved. Although the first concern is the health of any accident victim(s), post-accident drug and alcohol tests must be performed as soon as possible after the accident and after it is determined that the employee's performance cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor.
2.	Post-accident drug tests must be administered whenever a safety-sensitive employee is involved in an occurrence (accident) with an Airport vehicle in which an individual dies. Testing is also required when in an occurrence an individual suffers bodily injury and immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or in which the Airport vehicle or another vehicle involved incurs disabling damage and is transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle. In such nonfatal accidents, the Airport will test a covered employee on duty in the vehicle if the employee has been cited or if the Airport Human Resources Director or his/her designated representative determines the employee's performance could have contributed to the accident.
a.	In the event of an accident described in 1. above, urine specimens must be collected, not later than eight (8) | hours after the accident, from every employee who performed a safetysensitive function that either contributed to the accident or cannot be conclusively ruled out as a contributing factor to the accident. Ordinarily, specimens will be collected as soon as possible after the accident, allowing for treatment of any injuries first.

b.	Alcohol testing will be conducted only when the employee's conduct, besides the mere fact of being involved in an accident, causes a supervisor or manager reasonably to suspect the employee may be under the influence of alcohol. An alcohol test should be
administered within two (2)
administered within eight (8)
hours of the accident, and must be ours of the accident.
c.	The decision to administer post-accident drug and alcohol tests will be made by an Airport supervisor.
d.	Supervisors will explain the reason for the tests to each employee to be tested and will escort employees to the collection site.
e.	Employees involved in occurrences as defined in paragraph D.2. above must remain available for testing following the accident and should be paid for this time. The supervisor shall inform the employee(s) when he or she may leave. If an employee leaves the scene without authorization or is otherwise unavailable for testing, the employee shall be considered to have refused the test and shall be subject to appropriate discipline.
3.	If reasonable suspicion (see b. above) is also found in post-accident situations, the employee will be transported home and . placed on administrative leave without pay until test results are received. The employee will be reinstated and any lost pay will be restoreosnould the test results be negative = |
E.	Return-To-Duty and Follow-Up Testing
1.	Purpose - The purpose of return-to-duty testing is to provide assurance that the employee is presently free of alcohol and/or any prohibited drugs and is able to return to work without undue concern about continued substance abuse. The purpose of follow-up testing, which will be specified by the Airport's SAP according to the circumstances of each case, is to ensure that an employee's recovery from substance abuse is continuing so that the possibility of accidents and injuries is minimized.
2.	Any employee who refuses to take or does not pass a required drug or alcohol test, and is not discharged, may not perform a safety sensitive function until he or she passes a drug or alcohol test, or both, and the SAP has determined that the employee may return to duty. The leave and pay status of any such employee before return to duty will depend upon the circumstances.

Employees who are subject to follow-up testing must undergo unannounced testing if such testing is recommended for the SAP. The duration and frequency of their tests will also be determined by the SAP, but may not exceed 2 years unless circumstances arise which cause the SAP to recommend an extension. The terms and conditions of any return to work situation will depend upon individual facts.
Employees subject to follow-up testing will at all times remain in the random testing pool so that such employees may be requiredro undergo random testing in addition to follow-up testing.
F.	Procedures Common to Pre-Employment, Reasonable Suspicion, Post-Accident, Random, Return-to-Duty, and Follow-up Drug Testing
1.	When an employee must be ^tested for reasonable suspicion or following an accident, he or she will be escorted by a supervisor to the collection site. Upon arrival at the collection site, the employee will be | Eqjiired to follow the instructions of collection site personnel. In other situations, the employees will not be escorted.
a.	The employee will be required to complete a urine custody and control form, the purpose of which is to ensure proper identification, handling, and confidentiality of the specimen.
b.	The employee will provide a urine specimen in a private enclosure according to instructions of collection site personnel.
(1)	The employee will be provided with a securely wrapped single-use collection cup or specimen bottle, to be opened in front of the employee.
(2)	The employee will be required to provide a specimen of not less than 45 milliliters (ml.) of urine.
(3)	The collection site person will pour the urine into two specimen bottles (if a collection cup is used) or pour off urine in excess of 30 ml. from the specimen bottle used for collection into another specimen bottle. This process will result in a split sample consisting of the primary specimen of 30 ml. of urine and the split specimen of at least 15 ml. of urine.

c.	The specimens will be sealed and labeled by collection site personnel. The employee will observe the sealing and initial the labeling. The specimens will be transported to a laboratory approved by the Department of Health and Human Services ("DHHS") for actual testing.
d.	If the employee is unable to provide at least 45 ml. of urine, the collection site person will instruct him or her to drink not more than 24 ounces of fluids during a period of up to two hours. The employee will then be directed to provide another specimen, and if he/she provides 45 ml. of urine, the first specimen shall be discarded. If the employee fails to provide 45 ml. of urine, the specimen shall be discarded and the employee referred to the I mRO, who shall refer the employee for medical evaluation to determine whether the individual's inability to provide an adequate specimen is genuine or constitutes a refusal to submit to a drug test. Applicants who do not provide 45 ml. of urine after this procedure shall not be considered further in the selection process.
e.	Employees will be escorted or directed to report back to their work sites or vehicles, as the case may be. If an employee is being tested for reasonable suspicion, the Airport will arrange for transportation to the employee's residence.
2.	In certain limited circumstances, the specimen collection will be | monitored.
a.	If there is reason to believe that an individual has adulterated the specimen or otherwise compromised the collection process, that individual will be asked to provide a specimen under the direct observation of a same-gender collection site person. The following circumstances may result in a request that an individual provide a specimen under direct observation:
(1)	The employee has presented a urine specimen that falls outside the normal temperature range (90.5-99.8F) and declines to provide a measurement of oral body temperature by sterile thermometer or shows an oral temperature that varies more than 1C/1.8F from the temperature of the specimen.

(2)	The last urine specimen provided by the employee (the most recent test) was determined by the laboratory to have a specific gravity of less than 1.003 and a creatinine concentration below .2 g/L.
(3)	The collection site person observes conduct clearly and unequivocally indicating an attempt to adulterate the specimen (for example, substituting urine in plain view or presenting a specimen containing blue dye).
b.	If the employee refuses to cooperate with the collection process, the collection site person will inform the Airport Human Resources Director or his/her designated representative and shall fully document the non-cooperation on the urine custody and control form. Failure to BOperate may result in disciplinary action, up to and including charge. In the case of pre-employment testing, any failure to cooperate by an applicant shall disqualify him or her for further consideration in the selection process.
3.	The laboratory will perform screening of the specimens using a technique known as immunoassay. All positive results will be confirmed using a second technique known as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
4.	All test results will be reported by the laboratory to the Airport's MRO, who is a licensed physician with knowledge of substance abuse disorders, in a manner designed to ensure confidentiality of the information. Only specimens confirmed positive by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry will be reported as positive by the laboratory to the MRO.
5.	The MRO, after appropriate review, will report test results to the Human Resources Director or his/ her designated representative.
a.	In the event of a positive test result, the MRO shall give the individual an opportunity to discussthe test result with him or her before reporting the result as positive to the Airport.
b.	The employee shall be given twenty-four (24) hours to respond to the MRO's attempt to contact him or her; failure torespond within that time will cause the MRO to request that the Airport's Human Resources Director or his/her designated representative contact the employee and direct him or her to contact the MRO immediately.
c.	The MRO shall examine any alternative medical explanations offered
by the individual to explain any positive test result.

d.	If the MRO determines that there is a legitimate explanation for a
positive test result, the MRO shall report that | esjlt to the Airport as negative.
e.	The MRO shall verify a result as positive to the Airport without direct contact with the tested employee when:
(1)	The employee expressly declines the opportunity to discuss the test; or
(2)	The Human Resources Director has directed the employee to contact the MRO and more than two (2) days have passed without such contact occurring.
f.	The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive test that he or she has seventy-two (72) hours in which to request a test of the split specimen.
6.	When the MRO reports a positive result for an employee and depending on the facts of the case the employee may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including I discharge
7.	All test results will remain strictly confidential, whether maintained by the laboratory, the MRO, or the Airport.

8.	An employee (or applicant) who does not pass a drug test administered under the Policy Concerning Substance Abuse may request that the split urine sample be tested by submitting a written request to the MRO within seventy-two (72) hours of notification by the MRO to the employee of his or her right to request another I est. The MRO will then direct, in writing, the laboratory to provide the split sample to another DHHS-certified laboratory for analysis.
a.	If testing of the split sample fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug(s) or drug metabolite(s) found in the primary specimen, the MRO shall cancel the test. The MRO shall also cancel the test if the split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing, or untestable. The MRO shall declare that the employee has passed the test in any circumstance where a second test is not possible through no fault of the employee or that test fails to confirm the presence of any prohibited substance(s).
b.	The employee who has not contacted the MRO within the seventy-two (72) -hour period may present to the MRO information documenting circumstances, such as serious illness or injury, that unavoidably prevented the employee's timely request for testing of the split sample. If the MRO determines the employee's information adequately explains his or her failure to contact the MRO, the MRO shall then direct the testing of the split sample be performed.

G.	Alcohol Testing Procedures
1.	Alcohol testing will be accomplished by means of an evidential breath testing device (EBT) approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and listed on its Conforming Products List. The EBT measures an employee's alcohol concentration in exhaled breath.
2.	Alcohol testing will take place at a testing site ^ or facility and will be conducted by persons qualified as Breath Alcohol | Technicians.
a.	Employees and applicants to be tested will either report or be escorted to the testing site for testing. The test will be administered by a properly trained Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT).
b.	The BAT shall be trained to proficiency in the EBT he or she is using and in the alcohol procedures specified in this Policy.
c.	The alcohol test shall be conducted in a manner that provides the employee with privacy to the greatest extent applicable.
d.	The EBT must be secured with no unauthorized access at any time. Only one test will be conducted at a time, and the BAT may not leave the testing site while the preparations for testing or the test itself is in progress.
3.	Testing process
a.	The individual to be tested must present to the BAT positive photo identification (such as a driver's license or Airport identification card).
b.	The employee or applicant and the BAT must complete, date and sign a form indicating that the employee or applicant is present and providing a breath specimen. A copy of the completed form will be provided to the tested individual.
c.	The BAT will initially conduct a screening test.
(1)	The BAT will open an individually sealed, disposable mouthpiece in view ofthe employee or applicant and attach it to the EBT.

(2)	The BAT will instruct the employee to blow forcefully into the mouthpiece for at least six seconds or until an adequate amount of breath has been obtained. The BAT will then show the employee the test result displayed on the EBT or on the printed result.
(3)	If the result of the screening test is an alcohol concentration less than 0.02, no further testing is required and the test result will be considered as negative.
(4)	If the test result shows an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a confirmation test will be performed.
d.	The confirmation test must be conducted at least 15 minutes, but not more than 20 minutes, after the completion of the screening test.
(1)	During the interval between tests, the employee may not eat, drink, or put any substance into his/her mouth. The employee will also be instructed not to attempt to belch. (However, the test will be conducted even if the employee disregards the instructions.)
(2)	The confirmation test is conducted using the same procedures as the screening test, with a new mouthpiece.
(3)	If results of the screening and confirmation tests differ, the confirmation test result is deemed to be the final result.
(4)	If the result displayed on the EBT is not the same as that on the printed form, the test will be canceled, and the EBT removed from service.
e.	Following completion of the testing, the BAT will sign and date the form, and the employee will sign and date the certification statement. The BAT will attach the alcohol test result printout directly onto the alcohol collection form with tamper-proof tape (unless the results are printed directly on the form).
f.	In the event of an incomplete test, the BAT must begin a new test using a new alcohol testing form with a new sequential test number.

g.	Refusal by an employee to complete and sign the alcohol testing form, to provide an adequate amount of breath, or otherwise to cooperate with the directions of the BAT will be deemed a refusal to be "ested, will result in a presumed positive test, and may subject the employee, depending on the facts of the case, to disciplinary action, up to and including possible discharge. Refusal by an applicant to do any of these things will result in rejection from employment.
(1)	If the employee fails to provide an adequate amount of breath,
he or she shall be immediately referred to a physician, who shall determine the employee's medical ability to provide an adequate amount of breath.
(2)	If the physician determines that no there is no valid medical
reason for the inadequate breath, the employee's failure will be considered a refusal to take the test.
h.	If a screening or confirmatory test cannot be completed, the BAT must, if practicable, begin a new test using a new alcohol testing form with a new sequential test number.
4.	Test | Accuracy
a.	The above procedures must be followed rigorously for each test.
b.	Alcohol tests will be considered invalid when one or more of the following occur:
(1)	The external calibration check of the EBT produces a result outside the allowed tolerance levels.
(2)	A device other than an NHTSA-approved EBT is used.
(3)	The BAT does not wait 15 minutes between the screening and confirmatory tests.
(4)	The alcohol test form with the attached EBT printout is not completed correctly. Employee and BAT signatures, or relevant BAT remarks, should be included.

(5)	The EBT fails to print the confirmation results, the sequential test number on the EBT is not the same as the number on the printout, or the alcohol concentration displayed on the EBT is different from what is printed out.
5 Consequences of Positive Result
a.	Any safety-sensitive employee whose confirmation test shows an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater shall be removed from service and will be advised to go to the Employee Assistance Program or to seek other appropriate treatment in the event he or she may a substance abuse problem. A second such incident will result in disciplinary action. If a safety-sensitive employee’s test results are 0.04 or greater, the employee will be immediately removed from service, escorted home, and referred for an evaluation by the MRO or SAP. Depending on the facts of the case, that employee may also be subject to appropriate discipline. In addition, the MRO or SAP must approve of the employee's participation in a rehabilitation program, if appropriate, if the employee is permitted to return to work.
(1.) The MRO or SAP shall determine, among other things, the employee's fitness for duty, whether and what rehabilitation programs may be appropriate, the period of time the employee should be subject to follow-up alcohol testing after return to duty as discussed elsewhere, and whether follow-up drug testing should also be included.
(2.) Assessment by the MRO or SAP shall be scheduled as soon as is feasible. The employee shall not be permitted to work in the interim.
(3.) Assessment by the MRO or SAP shall not affect the Airport's right to discipline, including discipline an employee including discharge if circumstances warrant, for being under the influence of alcohol.

b.	If a non-safety sensitive employee's confirmation test is less than 0.04, the employee will be allowed to return to work, barring other extenuating circumstances. If a non-safety sensitive employee's confirmation test is 0.04 or greater, that employee will be advised to seek treatment in the event he or she may have a substance abuse problem. The employee may be counseled or disciplined, depending upon the test result level and upon the circumstances and behavior of the employee. The employee shall be relieved of duty for the remainder of the shift and escorted home a second such incident may result in more severe action.
If a non-safety sensitive employee's confirmation test is 0.08 or higher that employee shall in addition to the above, be referred to the MRO or SAP.
V. Employee Self-Identification
A. Employees having substance abuse problems may self-refer to the Airport's Employee Assistance Program through an Airport supervisororthrough the Human Resources Department, or may otherwise self-identify and seek rehabilitation for a chemical dependency problem without penalty. The Airport encourages employees having substance abuse problems to self-identify, and will assist in coordinating treatment, including authorizing applicable periods of leave for the employee to be treated. (Each case, however, will be evaluated on its own facts.) Self-referral or self-identification after notification of a required drug or alcohol test will not relieve the employee of the requirement to take a test, nor will it prevent the administration of disciplinary action on the basis of the test results or a refusal to be tested.

HEALTH CARE REFORM
Letter of Agreement
In Support of National Health Care Reform
The Union and the Employer agree to write and sign a joint letter in support of national health reform. The letter will be based upon the following ideas and set of principles.
Skyrocketing health care costs threaten the living standards of workers and the financial stability of state and local governments.
The parties recognize that the problem cannot be solved through collective bargaining alone. Health care costs cannot be adequately controlled on a plan-by-plan, employer-by-employer, or even on a state-by-state basis. Rather, a national framework for a health care system that works in partnership with the states is required to solve the three related problems of cost, quality, and access.
National health care reforms should recognize the best of local and state initiatives, including health care reforms that improve access, maximize delivery of cost-effective preventive care, and establish medical care payment programs designed to reduce overall medical costs. The parties recognize that cooperation between labor and management will increase their effectiveness in achieving changes in state and federal policy that both support.
Universal Coverage: Health system reform must guarantee health care as a right, not a privilege, with universal coverage and access for all people who live in California and in the United States, regardless of culture, class, ethnicity, and sexual orientation.
Role of Public Health Departments and Public Sector Providers: Public health departments provide essential population-focused health promotion and disease prevention services that are not typically included as part of individual health care benefits through insurance coverage. Examples of these services include disease control, health education, public health nursing services, disaster planning, emergency medical services and environmental protection services. These services must be recognized and adequately funded in any health reform plan.
Even under the most comprehensive national plan, public sector providers will be essential to any health care delivery system. This is for at least three reasons: First, the public sector must always be ready to respond to health care crises, such as the HIV epidemic. Second, the public sector must be available to provide services to those who do not have access to other providers. Finally, there will always be individuals whose circumstances have not been planned for in the comprehensive health care plan, and services need to be available to them through the public sector. It is absolutely essential to provide access for persons who are not able to receive appropriate health care service in other ways through the preservation of a strong and well-financed institutional safety net.
Comprehensive Benefits: There must be a guaranteed broad-based benefit package that emphasizes coordinated preventive and primary care services for individuals. Covered services must include disease prevention and health promotion programs which will assist in long-term cost containment. The plan should also include specified programs currently provided by public health departments, including mental health, family planning, long-term care, and substance abuse services.

Cost Containment: Health reform must include a package of cost containment measures to control operating and capital expenses because excess costs ultimately limit access to services. These measures should be based on appropriate regulatory provisions and should cover all components of the health system, without creating barriers to appropriate care. Appropriate cost controls include evaluations of technology and procedures, utilization of the most appropriate procedures at the most appropriate level of care, resource planning for distribution of capital and medical technology, and global budgeting.
Financing: Health reform must recognize that individuals in society ultimately will pay for the financing of any health system. The health system should be financed through a combination of progressive financing mechanisms that reflect ability to pay.
Quality Assurance: There must be mechanisms and safeguards to ensure effective and efficient organization of services and high quality care. Mechanisms should include a process of appeal to ensure that patient rights are respected. Quality assurance should also address the cultural competence of care and assess whether culturally and linguistically appropriate services are being delivered.
Development of Health Workforce: Comprehensive health system reform must include support for the education and training of health care workers to ensure: (1) adequate financing; (2) appropriate supply and distribution of workers, geographically and across specialties; (3) affirmative action to reach to goal of appropriate representation of all cultural and ethnic minorities in the health care workforce; and (4) culturally competent care through multicultural education and training of all providers.
Ongoing Planning and Evaluation with Consumers, Communities and Providers: To ensure accountability to providers and consumer communities and the protection and promotion of consumer rights, there must be mechanisms to ensure ongoing planning and evaluation of the system. These mechanisms include consumer satisfaction surveys, community-based needs assessment, measures of quality of care, technology assessment, and diverse representation on all advisory committees.
