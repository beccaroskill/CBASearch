The representative of Ohio Council 8, and the President and Vice-President of the Union shall have the privileges accorded to a Chief Steward by this Contract. Any suspected abuse of these privileges shall be resolved through a meeting of the City and the Union.

Said notice shall be provided to the Union as soon as practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days after the Appointing Authority or designee gained knowledge of alleged misconduct by any employee, or at the conclusion of a criminal investigation or investigation of other allegations that local, state, or federal laws or executive orders of the Mayor, have been violated, or at the conclusion of criminal proceedings if criminal charges are filed against the employee.
The Notice of Results of Investigation (i.e., Summary of Investigation) shall contain the facts surrounding the incident that was investigated.
Section 10.3.	Service of Disciplinary Actions.
(A)	If, disciplinary charges are brought against any employee after the investigation has been completed, they shall be furnished to the employee in writing on a form agreed upon by the City and the Union and signed by the Appointing Authority or designee within ten (10) days after notice to the Union that the investigation has been completed. A copy of such form shall be given to the Union President ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Failure to provide a timely notice to the President shall not result in the charges being dismissed. The Union shall be notified of the time and location of the hearing on the disciplinary charges and shall have the right to attend said hearing for the purpose of representing the employee and/or to protect the integrity of this Contract.
(B)	Oral and written reprimands, signed by the Appointing Authority or designee, shall be furnished to the employee in writing on a form agreed upon by the City
- 23 -
and the Union within ten (10) days after notice to the Union that the investigation has been completed. (See Appendix D.)
(C)	When reasonable, the Appointing Authority or designee will serve disciplinary charges to the employee by personal service. If the employee cannot reasonably be served in person, the Appointing Authority or designee may serve disciplinary charges by regular U.S. mail and certified mail to the last home address furnished by the employee(s) to the Appointing Authority or designee.
(D)	Mail service shall be deemed complete three (3) days after mailing the disciplinary charges or reprimand to the employee’s home address.
Section 10.4.	Hearing on Disciplinary Charges.
(A)	A hearing on the merits of the disciplinary charges shall be conducted by the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee within thirty (30) days from the delivery of the charges to the employee. All hearings will be conducted in a fair manner, and the designated hearing officer will not assume the role of prosecutor in disciplinary hearings.
(B)	If an Appointing Authority or designee brings disciplinary charges against an employee as a result of an investigation prompted by a complaint, the complainant will be called to testify at the hearing if reasonably possible, unless there is sufficient independent evidence to prove the charges by a preponderance.

Thereafter, the City may order an employee to attend a disciplinary hearing, and if the employee refuses, the City may hold the hearing in the employee’s absence.
Section 10.5.	Disciplinary Grievances.
If the Union is not satisfied with the results of the hearing, the Union may appeal this determination to Step 2 of the grievance procedure, together with any alleged violations of administrative procedures and time limits set forth in this Article. The Step 2 grievance meeting shall be a meeting not a hearing; it is not the purpose of the Step 2 grievance meeting in discipline cases to conduct a new review of the evidence and testimony, but rather to review the case based on information and evidence developed through the disciplinary hearing conducted
- 24 -
pursuant to Section 10.4. Only evidence and/or information that was not available at the time of disciplinary hearing will be independently reviewed.
Section 10.6.	Leave Forfeiture or Fine In Lieu of Suspension.
The designated hearing officer, after having found an employee guilty of one or more of the disciplinary charges, may make a recommendation as to the appropriate level of discipline. Should this recommendation be a suspension, the Hearing Officer may make a written offer to the employee that the employee forfeit up to one hundred twenty (120) hours of accrued vacation or compensatory time, provided the employee has sufficient vacation and/or compensatory time balances at the time the offer is made. Fines in an amount of one (1) to three (3) days only for violations of Central Work Rule number 5 (Attendance) or any future Central Work Rule addressing attendance may be offered by the Hearing Officer. If the employee agrees to the fine or forfeiture, such accrued leave shall be one (1) hour of accrued leave or fine for each one (1) hour of the proposed suspension. Accepting a fine or the type of leave (vacation or compensatory time) shall be the employee’s choice. The fine or forfeiture of the leave shall constitute corrective/disciplinary action of record, shall be accordingly noted in the employee’s personnel file, and shall constitute the final resolution of the departmental charges, which resolution shall not later be subject to challenge by the employee or the Union under the grievance procedure or in any other forum. If the employee chooses to accept the Hearing Officer's written offer, the Hearing Officer shall acknowledge the employee's acceptance of the offer in writing. Should the Hearing Officer choose not to offer this option or should the employee reject the offer, appropriate disciplinary action shall be imposed.
Section 10.7.	Length of Time Prior Discipline May Be Considered.
Oral reprimands may be considered in connection with subsequent disciplinary action for a period of one (1) year. Written reprimands may be considered in connection with subsequent disciplinary action for two (2) years. Any other form of disciplinary action may be considered in connection with subsequent disciplinary action for a period of three (3) years. After the expiration of the periods specified above, such disciplinary action shall not be used as a basis for any further disciplinary action.

(A)	If an investigation requires more time to complete, the parties may agree to extend the time period. Such extensions shall not be unreasonably withheld by the Union.
(B)	The time constraint provisions of this Article shall not be applicable when actions of a criminal or conspiracy nature or when alleged violations of other local, state or federal laws, or Mayor’s executive orders, warrants extensive investigation, or upon mutual consent of the parties.

ARTICLE 11	- GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
Section 11.1.	Definition and Purpose.
(A)	The prompt presentation, adjustment and/or answering of grievances is in the interest of sound relations between employees and the City. The prompt and fair disposition of grievances involves important and equal obligations and responsibilities on the part of representatives of each party to protect and preserve the grievance procedure as an orderly means of resolving grievances.
(B)	A "grievance" is defined as a complaint arising under and during the term of this Contract raised by an employee or the Union against the City alleging that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of an express written provision of this Contract.
(C)	A grievance classified as a “class action grievance” must contain the following, in addition to the requirements of Section 11.4:
(1)	A community of interest shared by two or more employees; and
(2)	The classification of grieving employees; and
(3)	The identity of who will represent the grievants at hearings,
(D)	Counseling is not grievable. Oral reprimands shall be grievable through Step 1. Written reprimands issued by an appointing authority or designee shall be grievable beginning at Step 1 through Step 2.
Section 11.2.	Who May File A Grievance, Exclusivity of Remedy.
Grievances can be initiated by the Union or an aggrieved employee, except as otherwise provided in this Contract (see Section 11.8(A) for special rules on disciplinary grievances). Except as may be specifically provided elsewhere in this Contract, the grievance procedure shall be the exclusive remedy available to the Union and to employees to redress alleged violations of this Contract. Nothing in this Grievance and Arbitration Procedure shall deny members any rights available at law to achieve redress of their legal rights, including the right of redress in another forum. However, once a member elects to seek redress in another forum, the member is thereafter denied the right to file or proceed further through the steps of the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure. Further, any relief obtained by the member under this Contract shall be rescinded and shall not continue to be performed or provided to the extent that the results achieved by the member in another forum is either inconsistent with the result achieved under this Contract or is cumulative and redundant of the result achieved under this Contract.
- 26 -
Section 11.3.	Time Limits.
(A)	A grievance must be filed in writing within fourteen (14) days after the occurrence of the first event giving rise to the grievance, or within fourteen (14) days after the Union or the affected employee(s), through the use of reasonable diligence, could have known of the first event giving rise to the grievance. If a grievance is not presented within this fourteen (14) day filing deadline, it will be considered "waived" and may not be pursued further by the aggrieved employee(s) or the Union.
(B)	If a grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limit or an agreed extension thereof, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the Step 1 answer. Failure at any step of this procedure to hold a hearing or meeting or communicate a decision on a grievance within the specified time limits shall permit the aggrieved party to treat the grievance as denied and to proceed immediately to the next step.
(C)	The time limits prescribed in the following steps in this Article may be extended at any time by mutual consent of the parties involved. Similarly, any step in the grievance procedure may be eliminated by mutual consent. Mutual consent must be indicated in writing and signed by both parties involved. Unless otherwise stated, days as specified herein shall be calendar days.
Section 11.4.	Specificity Required in Written Grievances and Limitations on Expanding the Scope of a Grievance.
The written grievance shall specify the section or sections of this Contract that are allegedly violated, misinterpreted or misapplied; a detailed statement of the full facts on which the grievance is based; the specific relief requested; the name(s) of the aggrieved employee(s) and their position(s); the name of the lowest-level non-AFSCME supervisor(s) of the aggrieved employee(s); the date the grievance was filed; and the signatures of the aggrieved employee(s) and any union official assisting in the preparation of the grievance. After a grievance is filed, the employee or the Union may amend the grievance to clarify the relevant facts and circumstances or to correct clerical errors no later than with the Step 2 filing, but may not amend the grievance to assert new claims, contract violations or to expand the scope of the relief sought without the express written consent of the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee.
Section 11.5.	Grievance and Arbitration.
The following are steps that shall be followed in the processing of a grievance, and the parties will act in good faith to limit the number of people present at each hearing.
(A)	Step 1. A grievance shall be filed in writing (within the time limits and in the form specified in Sections 11.3 and 11.4) with the aggrieved employee's Appointing Authority or designee. The Appointing Authority or designee shall hold a hearing with the employee and the Chief Steward (or Local Union Vice-President in his/her absence) within seven (7) days after receipt of the grievance. The Appointing Authority or designee shall give a written answer, after review by the Appointing Authority’s office, to the employee and the Chief Steward (or Local Union Vice-President in his/her absence) within fifteen (15) days after the hearing. If the Union does not refer the grievance to Step 2 of the procedure
- 27 -
within seven (7) days after receipt of the decision rendered in this Step, the grievance shall be considered to be satisfactorily resolved.
(B)	Step 2. (1) Step 2 Hearings for Non-Disciplinary Grievances. If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step 1, the Union may, within seven (7) days after receipt of the Step 1 answer or within seven (7) days of when the Step 1 answer was due, appeal the grievance to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee shall hold a hearing with appropriate representatives of the grievant’s department and the employee, the Chief Steward, the Local Union President or the Vice-President, and/or a representative of Ohio Council 8 within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee, after consultation with the Appointing Authority or designee, shall give a written answer to the employee and the Local Union President within ten (10) days after the Step 2 hearing.
Step 2. (2) Step 2 Meetings for Disciplinary Grievances. In disciplinary cases (except for oral and written reprimands issued by a department), a grievance must be filed at Step 2 by the Union within fourteen (14) days of the Hearing Officer’s decision issued pursuant to Section 10.4 of this Contract. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee and appropriate representatives of the grievant’s department shall hold a meeting with the employee, the Chief Steward, the Local Union President or the Vice-President, and/or a representative of Ohio Council 8 within ten (10) days after receipt of the grievance. The hearing officer conducting the Step 2 disciplinary grievance meeting shall not be the same hearing officer who conducted the disciplinary hearing pursuant to Section 10.4. The review of disciplinary cases at Step 2 shall be a meeting to review the case, not a hearing. The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee, after consultation with the Appointing Authority or designee, shall give a written answer to the employee and the Local Union President within ten (10) days after the Step 2 meeting.
(C)	Step 3.
(1)	If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at Step 2, the Union may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Step 2 answer or within thirty (30) days of when the Step 2 answer was due, submit the issue to arbitration. The Union shall notify the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee of its intent to submit the grievance to arbitration.
(2)	A permanent panel of five (5) arbitrators and three (3) alternates will be selected by the parties. An arbitrator shall be selected from the panel to hear grievances through random drawing. For all grievances filed after the effective date of this Contract, an arbitrator shall be selected within 365 days of the Union’s notice of intent to submit the matter to arbitration or the grievance will be waived. The parties may extend the Union’s deadline to select an arbitrator by mutual consent in writing. Continuances shall not be unreasonably withheld. Once selected, the
- 28 -
arbitrator’s name will no longer be available for selection until all remaining arbitrators on the panel have been selected.
(3)	The arbitrator shall be notified of his/her selection by a joint letter from the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee and the Union requesting that he/she set a date and time for the hearing subject to the availability of the City and Union representatives, provided that the hearing must be held within thirty (30) calendar days following the selection of the arbitrator. If the selected arbitrator is unable to schedule the hearing within the thirty (30) day period, the parties may select another arbitrator.
(4)	After all arbitrators on the panel have been selected once, the above process regarding random drawing will be repeated.
(5)	The parties may mutually agree to remove an arbitrator from the panel after he/she has issued at least one decision.
(6)	All arbitrations shall be held in the City of Columbus, Ohio. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the City and the Union. The arbitrator's decision shall be rendered within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing or the submission of post-hearing briefs by the parties, whichever occurs later.
(D)	The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the question of whether there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific provisions of this Contract based on the specific issue submitted to the arbitrator by the parties in writing. If no joint written stipulation of the issue is agreed to by the Union and the City, the arbitrator shall be empowered to determine and decide the issue raised by the grievance as submitted in writing at Step 1. The arbitrator shall be without power to make recommendations contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable laws or rules and regulations of administrative bodies that have the force and effect of law. The arbitrator shall not in any way limit or interfere with the powers, duties and responsibilities of the City under law and applicable court decisions. The decision of the arbitrator, if made in accordance with the jurisdiction and authority granted to the arbitrator pursuant to this Contract, will be accepted as final by the City, the Union and the employee(s), and all parties will abide by it.
(E)	Grievance settlements reached at Step 1, shall be in writing, shall have a limited application to the area of responsibility of the Appointing Authority and not precedent setting for the City. Grievance settlements reached at Steps 2 and 3 by the Union and the City shall be in writing, and shall be final, conclusive, and binding on the City, the Union, and the employees.
(F)	A grievance may be withdrawn by the Union at any time from the grievance procedure, and the withdrawal of any grievance shall not be prejudicial to the positions taken by the parties as they related to that grievance or any other grievances.
- 29 -
Section 11.6.	Persons with Responsibilities Under the Grievance Procedure and Scope of Authority.
The Union shall maintain a current list of Union officers, Chief Stewards and Stewards listed by departments and divisions. This list shall be furnished to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee together with revisions as changes occur. Persons whose names are not on this list shall not be recognized as officials of the Union for the purpose of this Article. Furthermore, the City emphasizes that all non-AFSCME supervisors have the responsibility for adjudicating grievances pursuant to the provisions of this Article. If requested to do so by the Union, the City shall provide a list of first-line non-AFSCME supervisors. Such responsibility shall prevail only over those employees assigned to that non-AFSCME supervisor. No employee in the bargaining unit shall have any authority to settle or respond to a grievance on behalf of the City.
Section 11.7.	Time Off For Presenting Grievances.
(A)	An employee and his/her Chief Steward or other Union representative authorized to act in the place of the Chief Steward as provided in Article 6 (Floating Chief Steward, Union President or Vice President) shall be allowed time off from regular duties with pay for attendance at scheduled hearings and meetings under the grievance procedure with proper notification to their respective supervisors. Employees must provide their own transportation unless otherwise approved by their supervisor. The appropriate Union representative as provided in Article 6 shall have adequate time with pay for a proper investigation of each grievance as provided in Article 6.
(B)	The aggrieved employee and any necessary witnesses shall not lose any regular straight-time pay for time off the job while attending a grievance hearing, meeting or an arbitration hearing.

(B)	Grievances with City-Wide Application. A grievance with city-wide application (i.e., involving a matter or issue of repetitive or general application) that may affect bargaining unit employees in different divisions and departments shall be brought directly to Step 2. Once a grievance on a matter or issue of repetitive or general application has been resolved by the parties on the merits (i.e., by a mutually agreed upon written settlement or an arbitration award on the merits), the Union will not advance to arbitration any further grievances on that particular matter or issue, unless the prior settlement or award is being violated.
No grievance settlement requiring the payment of money outside the routine payroll operations shall be considered to be authorized by or binding upon the City unless the settlement is authorized by the City Attorney’s office.
- 30 -
(C)	Grievances Involving Withholding of Terminal Pay. A grievance involving a claim that the City has improperly withheld money allegedly owed to the City by the employee from the employee's final pay (whether it be a final paycheck, vacation pay, pay for sick leave bank or other terminal pay) shall be filed directly at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
(D)	A grievance classified, as a “class action grievance” must contain the following in addition to the requirements of Section 11.4:

(2)	The classification of grieving employees; and
(3)	The identity of who will represent the grievants at hearings.

(F)	Filing of Other Grievances. All other grievances must follow the entire grievance procedure as set forth in this Article 11, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing for a specific case.
Section 11.9.	Use of Mediation.
The parties acknowledge that they have used mediation processes in the past to expeditiously resolve backlogs of grievances pending Step 3 (arbitration) proceedings. The parties agree that they may utilize the services of a mediator in the future to resolve pending grievances and written reprimands that have been grieved through Step 2. The use of a mediator for such purposes shall be by mutual agreement of the parties as to an identified grievance or grievances and according to procedures mutually agreed to in writing in advance of the
- 31 -
mediation process. The Union and City shall meet periodically to attempt to resolve matters prior to mediation or arbitration.
ARTICLE 12	- NO STRIKE OR LOCKOUT
Section 12.1.	No Strike.
(A)	The services performed by the City employees included in this Contract are essential to the public's health, safety and welfare. The Union, therefore, agrees that it will not authorize, instigate, aid, condone or engage in any strike, work stoppage or other action at any time, which will interrupt or interfere with the operation of the City. No employee represented by the Union shall cause or take part in any strike, work stoppage, slowdown or other action, which will interrupt or interfere with the operation of the City.
(B)	In the event of a violation of this Article, the Union agrees to take affirmative steps with the employees concerned such as letters, bulletins, telegrams, and employees' meetings to bring about an immediate resumption of normal work.
(C)	A "strike" means concerted action in failing to report to duty; willful absence from one's position; stoppage of work; slowdown or abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful, and proper performance of the duties of employment for the purpose of inducing, influencing or coercing a change in wages, hours or other terms and conditions of employment.
(D)	Stoppage of work by employees in good faith because of dangerous or unhealthful working conditions at the place of employment which are abnormal to the place of employment shall not be deemed a strike. The Union or an employee may file a grievance at Step 2 for immediate review in the event of a dispute over dangerous or unhealthful working conditions.
Section 12.2.	Discipline of Strikers.
Subject to the protections provided to employees under Section 12.1(D), any or all employees who violate any of the provisions of this Article may be discharged or otherwise disciplined by the City.

Section 12.3.	No Lockout.
The City agrees that it will neither lockout employees nor will it do anything to provoke interruptions or prevent such continuity of performance by said employees insofar as such performance is required in the normal and usual operation of City services.
Section 12.4.	Judicial Relief.

ARTICLE 13	- SENIORITY
Section 13.1.	Seniority of Probationary Employees.
New hires shall have no seniority during their probationary period of employment, but after completion of their probationary period their seniority date shall be the date of hire used to compute their probationary period.

Section 13.3.	Role of Seniority in Filling Vacancies in Position Assignments within a Division.
When a vacancy in a job classification occurs within a division, the vacancy shall be filled from among employees in that job classification in that division as set forth below:
(A)	Position Assignments without Specialized Qualifications. Where the vacancy is a position without specialized qualifications and employees want to switch shifts, reporting locations or work schedules (i.e., different days off or different regular hours), classification seniority shall determine the filling of vacancies within the division.
(B)	Position Assignments with Specialized Qualifications. Vacancies within a division, where the particular job assignment requires specialized qualifications that are not shared by all employees in the job classification, shall be filled on the basis of management’s evaluation of the specialized qualifications that correspond to the requirements, responsibilities and duties of the position as described by the division and associated specialized knowledge, skills, and abilities. Provided all of the above factors are equal, classification seniority shall determine which applicant is given the position in question. The Union may grieve the City’s determination that a particular job assignment or position requires specialized qualifications.

(1)	An employee has separated from a position and the Appointing Authority has decided to fill the position;
(2)	An increase in the total number of positions in the class;
(3)	A reallocation of a position as approved by the Civil Service Commission;
or

(4)	An increase in the total number of positions in a class on a specific shift or reporting location.
The term "Division" is defined as the Appropriation Unit for budgetary purposes.

ARTICLE 14	- TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS
Section 14.1.	Transitional Return to Work.
The City agrees to make reasonable efforts to provide transitional return to work assignments for all employees who have sustained an occupational injury or illness or a reoccurrence/exacerbation of a preexisting condition or, in some cases, are returning from short-term disability leave. This Section 14.1 is not to be construed as requiring the assignment of transitional return to work in any case, but only that reasonable efforts to do so will be made. This will be done in accordance with the following:
(A)	During the time an employee is in a transitional return to work program, the employee will be assigned duties which the employee is capable of performing based upon the recommendation of the employee’s attending physician. Such assignment shall not exceed ninety (90) days. Duties will be reviewed not less than every thirty (30) days and may be discontinued at any time.
(B)	Upon request of the City employees must participate in the transitional return to work program unless precluded from participation by their attending physician.
(C)	A transitional return to work assignment may be to a classification in a lower pay range and the employee’s regular hourly rate of pay will not be reduced.
(D)	The terms of the transitional return to work arrangements shall be reduced to writing including the instructions of the employee’s attending physician.
- 34 -
Section 14.2.	Assignments to Work Out of Classification.
(A)	A temporary change of duty assignment is defined as any given situation wherein an employee is required to perform work outside his/her regular job duties above or below his/her normal duties.
(B)	Employees shall be selected for both regular and overtime temporary duty assignments based upon their dependability and ability to perform the work of the job to which they will be temporarily assigned. Where ability and dependability are relatively equal, then seniority within the job classification shall control.
(C)	Employees who are temporarily assigned duties of a classification assigned a lower wage rate shall retain their classification and current rate of pay. The provision regarding compensation for temporary change of duty assignments is found in Section 26.7.
(D)	Employees who receive a temporary assignment of this nature shall continue to accrue seniority within their current classification.
(E)	A temporary assignment to fill a permanent vacancy shall not exceed one hundred twenty (120) days.
ARTICLE 15	- LAYOFFS
Section 15.1.	Responsibility.
The Civil Service Commission is responsible for the establishment and enforcement of the rules governing layoffs, except as amended in this Article. Both the City and the Union agree to strictly adhere to the rules in effect since April 1, 2002, as follows or as may be amended by the provisions set forth in this Contract.
Section 15.2.	Notice to the Commission.
Whenever it becomes necessary because of a material change in duties, a reorganization or a shortage of work or funds, to reduce the number of full-time employees in any department of the City, the Appointing Authority shall file a notice with the Civil Service Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to the expected day of the layoff specifying the class(es) in which the layoff is to occur and the number of employees to be laid off in each class.
Section 15.3.	Certification of Layoff.
The Civil Service Commission shall certify to the Appointing Authority the names of those fulltime employees to be laid off as determined by Civil Service Commission Rules, and the procedures approved by the Commission Executive Secretary except as amended by the procedures set forth in this Article. Layoffs shall be by class and based on seniority, but in accordance with status and appointment type using the following categories:
(A)	Temporary or Seasonal employees
(B)	Provisional full-time probationary employees
(C)	Provisional full-time non-probationary employees
- 35 -
(D)	Permanent full-time probationary employees
(E)	Permanent full-time non-probationary employees
Employees in the category at the top of the list are to be laid-off first. No employees from a higher category can be laid-off until all employees in the lower categories have been laid-off. The Appointing Authority shall notify any laid-off employee(s) at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the lay off.
Section 15.4.	Bumping.
A laid-off employee may have bumping rights within the same class to another division within the same department, to a lower class within the same class series or to a class in the same job family in which he/she previously served and for which he/she is qualified. No laid-off employee may bump another employee in accordance with the provisions of this section, unless he/she has more seniority and is in the same or a higher category as listed in Section 15.3 above. A bumped employee has the same bumping rights as a laid-off employee.
Non-bargaining unit employees shall have no bumping rights into an AFSCME bargaining unit classification(s).
(A)	Same class. A laid-off full-time employee in a division shall have bumping rights within the same class against the least senior full-time employee in the department in the order set forth in Section 15.3 above.
(B)	Class series. If an employee has no opportunity to bump within the same class, then such employee shall have bumping rights within his/her division (if none, then within the department) against the least senior full-time employee holding a position in the next lower class within the series. If no bumping opportunity is afforded, the same right shall extend to the next and each lower class until the class series is exhausted.
(C)	Job family. If an employee has no bumping opportunity within the class series, then such employee shall have bumping rights within his/her division (if none, then within the department) against the least senior full-time employee holding a position in a lower class in the same job family if the laid-off employee previously served in the class and if he/she is presently qualified; however, no such bump may occur in the presence of an appropriate competitive eligible list unless, in accordance with Civil Service Commission Rules, the laid-off employee will have permanent status in the previous class. A "lower class" for purposes of this Subsection means any class which has a maximum rate of pay lower than the minimum rate of pay for the class of the laid-off employee.
(D)	Part-time. In the event the laid-off employee has no bumping rights to a full-time
position under (A), (B) or (C) above, then such employee shall have bumping rights within the same class against the least senior part-time employee within the division, or if none, within the department.
Section 15.5.	Eligible List Reinstatement.
The names of any laid-off permanent employees shall be placed at the top of the appropriate competitive eligible list, as provided in Civil Service Commission Rule VIII(C)(3), in order of seniority, and shall be certified for appointment in any department in accordance with Civil
- 36 -
Service Commission Rules when an Appointing Authority has a vacancy to fill. If the eligible employee at the top of the list was laid-off from that department, that person shall be appointed.
Section 15.6.	Recall.
The names of any laid-off provisional employees or employees in noncompetitive classifications shall be placed on the appropriate recall list, in order of seniority, for a period of twenty-four (24) months. In the event that a vacancy in a department is to be filled in a class for which a recall list exists, then the appointment shall be made of the individual highest on the list who was laid-off from that department. Otherwise, appointment may be made as provided elsewhere by Civil Service Commission Rules. No recall list shall remain in effect after an eligible list for the class has been established.
Section 15.7.	Limited Positions.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, if a limited position is to be eliminated and the employee in the position was appointed subject to the availability of work or funding, then that employee shall be terminated in accordance with Civil Service Commission Rule X(F)(1). A limited employee who is bumped shall have the same bumping rights as other employees.
ARTICLE 16	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 16.1.	Normal Workweek and Workday.
(A)	Non-24 Hour Operations. The normal workweek for full-time employees shall be forty (40) hours of work in five (5) consecutive eight (8) hour shifts, exclusive of the time allotted for lunch periods.
(B)	24-Hour Operations. In twenty-four (24) hour operations or where there is a continuous seven (7) day-a-week operation, made necessary because of the nature of the work, the normal workweek for full-time employees shall be forty (40) hours of work in five (5) consecutive days of eight (8) consecutive hours each day.
(C)	Refuse Collection Division. For the classifications of Refuse Collector, Refuse Collection Vehicle Operator (Automated), Refuse Collector and Vehicle Operator (Manual), Refuse Collector and Packer Operator and Refuse Collection Supervisor only in the Division of Refuse Collection, the normal workweek for fulltime employees shall consist of five (5) consecutive days of eight (8) hours per day with no lunch break.
Section 16.2.	Changes in Normal Workweek and Workday.
(A)	Permanent Changes to Normal Workweek and Workday.
(1)	In situations where the City believes that alternate or flexible work schedules, different from those set forth in Section 16.1 above, are needed for operational efficiency and effectiveness, the City will give the Union President and Chief Steward for the Department (where applicable)
- 37 -
written notice of the proposed work schedule and a list of those job classification(s)/position assignment(s) affected at least fourteen (14) days in advance of any proposed change(s). If the Union wants to bargain about the proposed change(s), one representative from the City's Labor Relations Section and two representatives from the Department involved shall meet with the Union President, Regional Director or designee and Chief Steward in the affected Department (where applicable), to negotiate the proposed schedule changes as well as the impact of such change(s) on matters such as holidays, sick leave, vacation leave, etc. In the absence of an agreement being reached within the fourteen (14)-day period, the City may, at the end of the fourteen (14)-day period, implement its proposed work schedule.
(2)	The Union may file a grievance at Step 2 of the grievance procedure if it believes the schedule change is not reasonably related to operational needs. If an arbitrator finds in favor of the Union in such a grievance, the remedy shall be limited to directing the City to prospectively restore the pre-existing work schedule pending further negotiations and/or agreement on a different schedule.
(3)	The process set forth in this Section 16.2(A) applies only to changes in work schedules or shifts that are of a permanent nature. "Permanent nature" is defined for purposes of this Section 16.2 to be periods of ninety (90) days or longer. No changes shall be made to work schedules or shifts unless they are of a permanent nature, except as provided elsewhere in this Article 16.
(4)	Employees affected by any changes in work schedules or shifts as a result of the process set forth in this Section 16.2(A) shall be given fourteen (14) days prior notice of a permanent work schedule or shift change. Reassignment of employees to new or revised work schedules or shifts established as a result of the process set forth in this Section 16.2(A) shall be done in accordance with Article 13 (Seniority).
(B)	Establishing an Alternate Work Schedule for a Vacancy. When a vacancy occurs, the City may, before filling the vacancy, decide to establish an alternate work schedule for the vacant position without following the procedures set forth in Section 16.2(A). When this occurs, the City may hire a new employee or transfer a current employee, pursuant to Article 13, on the condition they accept the alternate work schedule as a condition of employment or as a condition of accepting transfer into the vacancy.
(C)	Temporary Change In Shift Assignment. When any full-time employee is scheduled for a shift other than that to which he/she is regularly assigned in multiple-shift operations, he/she shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours of pay at time and one-half his/her regular rate unless he/she has been given at least forty-eight (48) hours notice of a change in his/her regular shift assignment, in which case payment shall be at his/her regular hourly rate.
- 38 -
(D)	Temporary Change in Work Schedule. Temporary work schedule changes of less than ninety (90) days may be made in response to specific short-term operational requirements. Absent any unforeseen circumstances, the employee will be given seven (7) days prior notice of a temporary work schedule change. Such changes may be made without following the procedures set forth in Section 16.2(A). The Union may file a grievance at Step 2 of the grievance procedure if it believes the change is not reasonably related to operational needs.
Section 16.3.	Overtime Eligibility and Pay.
(A)	Calculation of Daily Overtime. Overtime will be calculated from shift to shift. Overtime will be paid if an employee works more hours than the hours of his/her regular shift. Time and one-half will be paid for time worked beyond the employee's regular shift provided the employee has completed eight (or more, if applicable) hours of straight-time work that workday (for example, an employee working a normal workday of ten (10) hours, shall be eligible for daily overtime after actually working ten (10) hours in the workday). For purposes of this Subsection (A), the term "time worked" shall mean only actual work time, and shall not include any paid or unpaid time that is not actually worked, except for paid lunch periods in continuous operations as referenced in Section 16.7. Time and one-half will also be paid for call-backs as referenced in Section 26.5, regardless of whether the employee has actually worked eight (8) hours in the day.
(B)	Calculation of Weekly Overtime - On First Regular Day Off. Time and one-half will be paid for time worked on an employee's first regular day off provided the employee has accumulated forty (40) straight-time rate hours in paid status during the workweek. For purposes of this Subsection (B), paid status will include periods of Union leave without pay, but shall not include sick leave, injury leave or disability leave.
(C)	Calculation of Weekly Overtime - On Second Regular Day Off. Double time will be paid for time worked on an employee's second regular day off provided the employee has accumulated forty (40) straight-time rate hours in paid status during the preceding six (6) days. A fourth shift employee’s second regular day off will start twenty-four (24) hours immediately preceding the start of the first regular shift of the next workweek. Alternative work schedules can establish when an employee’s second regular day off occurs and therefore when double time pay will apply to overtime. For purposes of this Subsection (C), paid status will include periods of Union leave without pay, but shall not include sick leave, injury leave or disability leave.
(D)	Inapplicability of Overtime When Changing/Trading of Work Days by Mutual Consent. Time worked due to work schedules being changed at the request of the employee or trading days off by mutual consent of employees and the prior consent of the Appointing Authority is not subject to overtime compensation, to the extent permitted by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
(E)	Inapplicability of Overtime for Scheduled Shift Changes. Time worked by employees who are subject to a regularly scheduled three (3) month shift change
- 39 -
at the time a shift change is scheduled, or time worked by employees at the time a shift change is scheduled in a twenty-four (24) hour-a-day operation and/or a continuous seven (7) day-per-week operation, is not subject to the compensation set forth in this Section 16.3, unless subject to the overtime payment requirements established in the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Section 16.4.	Distribution of Overtime.
(A)	Overtime Eligibility. Employees within the same classification and with the same work capabilities within the same reporting location who are participating in the overtime provisions shall have an equal opportunity to earn voluntary overtime pay. Classifications which include different work capabilities shall be identified to the Union prior to the formation of a separate overtime list. It is the Appointing Authority’s burden to prove that work capabilities needed are different.
Employees desiring to work voluntary overtime shall so indicate in writing to their immediate supervisor. All employees who choose to participate in overtime will be given an equal opportunity to earn overtime on a continuing basis. The opportunity for overtime work shall be computed by totaling overtime earned plus overtime offered but declined. If overtime is cancelled by management the hours will not be charged. Post-training new hires, transferees, and those employees returning to the reporting location from an extended leave who desire to work voluntary overtime shall be initially assigned the highest number of overtime hours in the assignment unit in order to place them on the overtime equalization list. All overtime, whether in class or out of class, shall be recorded on the same overtime equalization list.
(B)	Overtime Distribution Procedures.
(1)	On each occasion the opportunity to work scheduled overtime shall be offered to the employees desiring to work overtime who have the least number of overtime hours to their credit at that time. If an employee does not accept the assignment, the employee with the next fewest number of overtime hours to his/her credit shall be offered the assignment. This procedure shall be followed until the required number of employees has been selected for the overtime work.
(2)	If an employee turns down overtime or is unable to respond when contacted for overtime, the number of hours offered to him/her shall be credited to his/her overtime hours. Employees who have declined to participate in the voluntary overtime shall be automatically charged for overtime hours worked in the classification at the reporting location.
(3)	Employees on military leave not exceeding twenty-two (22) eight (8) hour work days (176 hours) shall not be contacted or charged for overtime work during that period.
(4)	An employee on leave shall not be contacted for voluntary overtime, but shall be charged for overtime work during such leave as long as the employee comes up for overtime work during that period. However, an
- 40 -
employee on holiday; jury duty; vacation leave or compensatory time of three (3) workdays or less; or his/her regularly scheduled days off shall be contacted for voluntary overtime subject to the provisions of this Section 16.4.
(5)	If an employee is not offered the opportunity to work overtime when qualified and entitled, he/she shall be offered the next opportunity to work overtime consistent with the terms of this Article. Those hours not offered when initially entitled shall not be included in hours credited when worked.
(C)	Posting of Overtime Equalization List. A record of the overtime hours worked and of overtime hours offered but not worked, by each employee, shall be posted on a bulletin board within the employee's general work area daily. Each time overtime is offered and charged the list will be updated.
Section 16.5.	Overtime Scheduling.
(A)	Where practical, overtime shall be administered on a voluntary basis; otherwise, it shall be mandatory that each employee scheduled to work overtime must perform the job assignment within his/her given classification.
(B)	Mandatory Overtime. Mandatory overtime may be required when volunteer(s) cannot be found to work the overtime. An exception to the application of mandatory overtime scheduling shall be permissible when a valid reasonable request is made by an employee. Mandatory overtime shall be distributed in an equitable manner starting with the least senior employee on the first mandatory occasion. Thereafter, the next least senior employee shall be assigned to the next mandatory occasion, until all employees have worked a mandatory overtime assignment.
(C)	In cases of overtime scheduled as a result of holidays or extreme emergencies involving a departmental operation, it shall be the established procedure for the department or division head to confer with the employee's Union representative when available regarding a mutually acceptable work schedule.
(D)	Working overtime out of class in a lower classification shall be scheduled by using the lowest number of hours worked among persons with the ability and dependability to do the work.
(E)	Pre-scheduled overtime shall be offered no later than the end of the employee’s workday prior to the overtime.
Section 16.6.	Rest Periods.
(A)	All employees' work schedules shall provide for a fifteen (15) minute rest period during each half shift. The rest period shall be scheduled at the middle of each half shift whenever feasible. When practicable, rest periods shall be taken within the work area or in close proximity to the work area that shall afford no more than the allotted fifteen (15) minutes. Rest periods shall not be taken at the beginning or end of each half shift, and shall not be used to extend a lunch break.
- 41 -
(B)	Employees who for any reason work beyond their regular quitting time shall receive a fifteen (15) minute rest period before they start to work on the extended shift. In addition, they shall be granted the regular rest periods that occur during the extended shift.
Section 16.7.	Lunch Period.
All employees shall be granted a lunch period during each full shift. Whenever possible the lunch period shall be scheduled at the middle of each full shift. Employees who work in a twenty-four (24) hour operation shall receive a paid lunch period; all other employees shall receive an unpaid lunch period. When there is an extension of the regular shift as a result of an emergency or scheduled overtime, a lunch period shall be granted when the extension exceeds four (4) hours.
Section 16.8.	Tardiness.
Employees are required to be punctual at all times. A grace period of six (6) minutes from the shift starting time will be allowed without disciplinary action unless frequent abuse occurs.
Section 16.9.	Reporting Off Work Procedure.
The failure of any employee to report off duty in any twenty-four (24) hour City operation at least one (1) hour before his/her scheduled starting time shall constitute away without leave for all scheduled hours which were not worked. All other employees shall report themselves off duty at least thirty-(30) minutes prior to their regularly scheduled starting time. Failure to so report shall constitute away without leave for all scheduled hours not worked. The provisions of this Section 16.9 shall not apply when it is impossible for the employee to so report due to circumstances beyond his/her control, provided that the employee will then report at the earliest opportunity followed by a written explanation of the circumstances which made it impossible for him/her to report as directed.
Section 16.10.	Compensatory Time.
(A)	The amount of compensatory time earned may be calculated at the straight time rate, or in lieu of payment of overtime, by one and one-half (1-1/2) when time and one-half is applicable or by two (2) when double time is applicable by the number of hours actually worked on an authorized overtime basis. The compensatory time account balances shall be maintained in units of one-tenth of an hour.
(B)	Eligibility. A compensatory time account may be established for full-time employees. Compensatory time may only be earned in lieu of cash payment for authorized time worked on a premium basis. The employee may, at his/her option, receive either cash payment or compensatory time for time worked on a premium basis.
(C)	The following conditions shall govern the use of compensatory time:
(1)	Compensatory time upon request by the employee may be taken by the employee at such time or times as may be approved by the Appointing Authority.
- 42 -
(2)	An employee who is about to be separated from city service for any reason and who has an unused compensatory time account balance to his/her credit shall be paid such account balance upon separation. Such payment shall be calculated by multiplying the employee's regular hourly straight time wage rate by the number of hours in his/her compensatory time account upon separation.
(3)	Any compensatory time account balance above eighty-(80) hours shall be paid off at the employee's hourly rate. Pay out of compensatory time over the approved balance will be paid once per year unless the Union and the Appointing Authority agree to a different pay-out schedule. The cut-off time established pursuant to this section shall be set no less than six (6) months in advance of the pay period selected. Notice of the date of the end of the selected pay period shall be posted within the Division and the Chief Steward shall be notified of the date.
(4)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (C)(3) above, all compensatory time account balances for grant-funded positions shall be paid out by the end of the grant award period.
(5)	No interest is to be paid by the City on any compensatory time account.
Section 16.11.	No Pyramiding.
Compensation shall not be paid (nor compensatory time taken) more than once for the same hours under any provision of this Article or Contract.

No vacation credit shall be allowed for any employee working a forty (40) hour workweek for any pay period in which such employee is off duty and not in paid status for more than eight (8) hours of regularly scheduled work; except that when an employee is required to report for work and does so report but is denied work because of circumstances beyond his/her control, his/her absence from work for the balance of that workday shall not be construed as unpaid work status for the purpose of this Article.
Section 19.5.	Scheduling Vacations.
(A)	All vacation leaves shall be taken at such times as may be approved by the Appointing Authority. Vacation leave may be taken in increments as small as one-tenth (1/10) of an hour with the approval of the Appointing Authority.

A full-time employee with more than thirteen (13) pay periods of vacation accrual in paid status who is about to be separated from City service through discharge, resignation, retirement or layoff and who has unused vacation leave to his/her credit, shall be paid in a lump sum for each hour of unused vacation leave (less any amounts owed to the City by the employee) in lieu of granting such employee a vacation leave after his/her last day of active service with the City, provided, however, that such payment shall not exceed the maximum number of vacation hours outlined in Section 19.3.
- 47 -
Section 19.7.	Vacation Payoff at Death.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article, when an employee dies while in paid status, any unused vacation leave to his/her credit shall be paid to the surviving spouse, less applicable withholding and any amounts owed by the employee to the City.

ARTICLE 20	- SICK LEAVE
Section 20.1.	Sick Leave Entitlement.
Each full-time non-seasonal employee employed at the beginning of the first day of the first pay period of the year shall receive ninety-six (96) hours of sick leave with pay (hereinafter referred to as Sick Leave Entitlement).
Each full-time, non-seasonal employee hired on or after the first pay period of each year shall, on the date of hire receive his/her current sick leave with pay for the remainder of that payroll year computed as follows: 3.692 hours for each pay period in the year of hire, commencing with the first full pay period which occurs on or after the date of hire. However, for each pay period in which an employee is in unpaid status for more than eight (8) hours, 3.692 hours shall be deducted from his/her paid sick leave entitlement.
When an employee is required to report to work and does so report but is denied work because of circumstances beyond his/her control, absence from work under these circumstances shall not be considered as unpaid work status for purposes of this Section.
If an employee’s sick leave entitlement is exhausted and the employee is in unpaid status, and therefore no deduction from sick leave entitlement can be made, the employee shall be considered absent without leave unless the employee applies for unpaid personal leave and such leave is granted by the City.
Should an employee voluntarily move from full-time non-seasonal status to part-time or seasonal status during a calendar year in which he/she is eligible for sick leave, the employee shall retain his/her sick leave balance for the number of pay periods months he/she was in fulltime status, but 3.692 hours shall be deducted from his/her paid sick leave account for each full pay period in which the employee is in part-time or seasonal status. No such deduction will apply to employees who are laid off and are compelled to bump into a part-time or seasonal position to retain continued employment.
Section 20.2.	Eligible Uses and Procedures.
(A)	Sick leave with pay shall be allowed for full-time employees only in the following situations:
(1)	Illness of, or injury to, the employee, whether work or non-work related.
- 48 -
(2)	Physical, dental or mental consultation or treatment of the employee by professional medical or dental personnel, whether work or non-work related.
(3)	Sickness of a spouse, child, step-child, foster child, person for whom the employee is the legal guardian and upon prior approval of the Appointing Authority, a family member who is dependent on the employee for his/her health and well-being.

(5)	Maternity, paternity, and adoption leave for employees.
(6)	Death of immediate family member for up to five (5) days per instance. For the purposes of this Subsection, immediate family shall be defined as including the employee's spouse, child, step-child, foster child, brother, sister, parent, grandparent, grandchild, father or mother-in-law, son or daughter-in-law, brother or sister-in-law, stepfather or mother, stepsibling, a legal guardian or other person who stands in the place of a parent. Employees may also elect to use compensatory time or vacation leave instead of sick leave because of a death in the immediate family, or may use a day of compensatory time or vacation leave to attend the funeral of an Aunt or Uncle.
(B)	Any leave which is granted under this Article 20 for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave as provided in Section 24.7 shall be charged as an FMLA leave and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
(C)	Any employee scheduled to work on a holiday, designated in Article 17 of this Contract, who reports sick shall be charged the number of sick leave hours appropriate for his/her workday for the holiday, and further shall be ineligible for holiday pay under the provisions of Section 17.5 of this Contract. When an employee is absent due to illness on the workday before or the workday after a holiday, and the holiday is celebrated on a regularly scheduled workday, he/she shall be charged the number of sick leave hours appropriate for his/her workday for the holiday. The day before refers to the employee's last regularly scheduled workday occurring before the holiday. The day after refers to the regularly scheduled workday following the day on which the holiday is celebrated. However, no charge will be made under this Section 20.2 for sick leave on the holiday when the employee has been on sick leave the day before and the day after the holiday.
(D)	Sick leave, when used, shall be paid at an hourly rate equal to the employee's regular straight time wage in effect at the time of the usage. No sick leave with pay will be allowed for increments of less than one tenth (1/10) of an hour.
- 49 -
Section 20.3	Sick Leave Documentation and Suspected Sick Leave Abuse.
If an employee has sufficient sick leave accruals, and there is no evidence of sick leave abuse, the Appointing Authority shall grant sick leave upon the written request of the employee. In cases of extended illness, that is, illness which lasts more than three (3) consecutive workdays, or suspected abuse, as determined by the Appointing Authority or designee, the Appointing Authority or designee may require evidence as to the adequacy of the reason(s) for an employee's absence during the time for which sick leave is requested. Any sick leave use protected by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall not be considered as sick leave abuse.
(A)	Sick leave abuse may be indicated by any or all of the following:
(1)	Excessive use of sick leave within a twelve (12) month period which has not been substantiated by a physician’s or other licensed health care provider’s statement;
(2)	Use of sick leave as soon as it has been credited to an employee’s sick leave balance;
(3)	Consistent use of sick leave on the same day of the week;
(4)	Consistent use of sick leave on the day(s) before and/or after regularly scheduled days off or holidays.
(5)	Falsification or misrepresentation of the reason(s) for an employee’s absence;

(7)	Being in unpaid status for whole or part of a day, which absence is not covered by the FMLA.
(B)	If there are one or more indicators of sick leave abuse, the Appointing Authority or designee shall notify the employee, in writing, that he/she will be required to provide documentation from a physician or other licensed health care provider for each use of sick leave until further notice, and the reasons for that requirement. The Appointing Authority or designee shall review the situation not longer than every one hundred twenty (120) days to determine if the problem has been abated. Upon receipt of the written notice, the employee may request a meeting with the Appointing Authority or designee to discuss the requirement to provide such documentation. The employee may, upon request, be accompanied by a Union representative at such meeting.
(C)	Failure to correct sick leave abuse or provide medical documentation when required to do so may result in disciplinary action consistent with the provisions of Article 10 of this Contract.
(D)	Falsification of a physician's or other licensed health care provider’s statement may also be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
- 50 -
(E)	If the Appointing Authority or designee questions the reason(s) offered by the employee for his/her sick leave, the Appointing Authority or designee may require the employee to be examined by a licensed physician identified by the Appointing Authority or designee. Failure to submit to the examination shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action.
(F)	Each Appointing Authority or designee shall develop a procedure for his/her department to implement the provisions of this section.
Section 20.4.	Sick Leave Reciprocity.
(A)	Entitlement. During January of each year, each full-time employee has the option of receiving payment in cash for unused sick leave hours at the end of the preceding fiscal year, provided such employee was entitled to sick leave benefits during all of the twenty-six pay periods of the previous year and is in paid status or on authorized leave without pay, based on the following calculation table:
CASH BENEFIT CALCULATION TABLE
Hours of Sick
Leave Taken
(New Sick Accrual or Old Bank)	Cash Benefit Hours Allowed
0-8	48
9-16	40
17-24	32
25-32	24
33-40	16
Greater than 41	0
Any disallowance of sick leave credit by the Appointing Authority as provided for in Section 20.1, and any hours paid on disability leave will be considered as hours of sick leave taken during the year for the purpose of computing paid sick leave hours available to an employee under the reciprocity plan. If an employee uses five (5) days or less of injury leave (regardless of the number of claims) during the year, this leave shall not be considered sick leave taken for computing sick leave reciprocity. If an employee uses more than five (5) days of injury leave, all injury leave used during the year will be considered hours of sick leave taken in computing sick leave reciprocity.
(B)	Procedures. Each full-time employee who qualifies for sick leave benefits as of the first pay period of each year shall notify the Appointing Authority by February 1 of that fiscal year, on a form to be provided by the City, if the employee wishes to participate in the reciprocity plan. The payment will be made in January following the fiscal year. The payment will be calculated at the employee's hourly rate in effect as of the final pay period of the fiscal year preceding payment. The period to be utilized in calculating sick leave reciprocity benefits shall be the fiscal year for which payment is to be made. Any employee may withdraw from the
- 51 -
plan prior to the end of the twenty-fourth (24th) pay period of each fiscal year upon the written notification to the Appointing Authority.
(C)	Effect on Unused Sick Leave. The number of reciprocity hours paid each employee will be subtracted from his/her total accrued unused sick leave. The remainder of his/her unused sick leave will be carried forward each year as his/her current sick leave account.
(D)	An employee who is eligible to participate in the provisions of this Section 20.4 is limited to and must elect only one of the following options:
(1)	Not to participate in any of the provisions.
(2)	To participate solely in the provisions of Paragraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this Section.
Section 20.5.	Carryover Sick Leave Balances from Certain Prior Public Employment.
Employees who have been employed in the classified or unclassified Civil Service or as teachers, school employees, firefighters, peace officers or state highway patrol officers of the State of Ohio or any of its political subdivisions shall be credited with any certified, unused and unpaid balance of accumulated sick leave earned in such service when such persons are employed in the classified or unclassified Civil Service of the City on or after April 1, 1987, provided employment with the City occurs within ten (10) years after leaving his/her prior position when such action occurs after January 1, 1972. Such unused balance shall then be subject to all other provisions of this Article, with the exception of Section 20.7.
Section 20.6.	Old Sick Leave Bank.
The old sick leave bank shall represent the employee's balance of unused sick leave as of the effective date of the Contract that went into effect in April 1987.
(A)	Any sick leave hours in this bank, when used, shall be paid on the basis of the employee's straight-time hourly rate in effect on March 31, 1987.
(B)	Sick leave may be withdrawn from the old sick leave bank, at the value provided in this Section 20.6 for the sick leave purposes outlined in Section 20.2(A), provided the employee has exhausted his/her current sick leave accrual to date. An employee may withdraw from the old sick leave bank the number of hours or tenths of an hour necessary to compensate the employee at not greater than his/her current regular straight time hourly rate for approved sick leave time.
(C)	An employee who experiences a break in continuous City service through retirement, discharge, resignation or layoff shall receive pay for unused sick leave or, in lieu thereof, may elect to transfer such sick leave to another governmental unit. Beginning with the effective date of this Contract and for the duration of the Contract, if the employee elects payment, his/her account balance shall be valued as of the time of the break in continuous service at one hundred percent (100%) of the amount obtained by multiplying the number of unused sick leave hours by the employee's straight-time hourly rate in effect on March 31, 1987. At such time, the employee who is not transferring such sick leave to another governmental unit must elect one (1) of the following options: (a)
- 52 -
immediate payment in a single lump-sum; or (b) two (2) equal installment payments, the first to be paid at the time of retirement or separation and the second to be paid one (1) year thereafter; or (c) three (3) equal installment payments, the first to be paid at the time of retirement or separation, the second to be paid one (1) year thereafter, and the third to be paid one (1) year after the second payment. However, the City must approve those employee elections which provide for payment in other than a single lump-sum.
(D)	For the purposes of this Section 20.6, all sick leave in an employee's old sick leave bank that represents sick leave transferred from another governmental unit shall be valued using the unit's sick leave separation payment plan existing on March 31, 1987 and the employee's regular straight-time hourly wage as of March 31, 1987.
Section 20.7.	Payment of Sick Leave Balances at Time of Separation.
(A)	An employee who experiences a break in continuous City service through discharge, resignation, retirement or layoff may elect to receive pay for accumulated current sick leave or to transfer said sick leave to another governmental unit, provided such election is made within a period of not more than one (1) year. If an employee elects to receive a lump-sum payment, said payment shall be computed as follows:
(1)	One (1) hour pay for each four (4) hours of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals up to and including nine hundred and fifty (950) hours.
(2)	One (1) hour of pay for each three (3) hours of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals from nine hundred and fifty-one (951) hours up to and including seventeen hundred and fifty (1,750) hours.
(3)	One (1) hour pay for each two (2) hours of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals from seventeen hundred and fifty-one (1,751) hours up to and including twenty five hundred and fifty (2,550) hours.
(4)	One (1) hour pay for each hour of unused sick leave in the new bank for all accruals in excess of twenty five hundred and fifty (2,550) hours.
(5)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph (1) above, no payment of any unused sick leave upon separation shall be made to any employee with less than four hundred (400) hours accrued sick leave credit. However, an employee who is temporarily laid-off for thirty-five (35) calendar days or less and who has less than four hundred (400) hours of accrued sick leave at the time of layoff, shall be credited at the time of rehire with the actual number of sick leave hours accrued prior to the temporary layoff of thirty-five (35) calendar days or less.
(B)	The City reserves the right to deduct from any final sick leave payment to the employee any amounts which the employee owes to the City.
- 53 -
Section 20.8.	Payment of Sick Leave Balances at Death.
If an employee dies while in paid status, his/her unused sick leave account balance (less applicable withholding and any amounts owed by the employee to the City) shall be paid to his/her surviving spouse. In the event that the employee has no surviving spouse, said balance shall be paid to the employee's estate. The employee's account balance shall be valued as of the time of death in the manner as set forth in this Article for new and old sick leave, as applicable, less any amounts owed by the employee to the City.
ARTICLE 21	- DISABILITY LEAVE
Section 21.1.	Eligibility and Waiting Period.
(A)	The City will provide, at no cost to employees, a disability program covering fulltime employees for non-work related illnesses and injuries. Employees will be eligible for this benefit on the first of the month following one (1) year of continuous City service.
(B)	This program shall provide for payment to the employee from the fifteenth (15th) day of accident or illness for a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks per disability per calendar year.
Section 21.2.	Application Procedure and Deadlines.
The proper forms must be submitted to the City, through the Division Personnel Officer or designee, no later than forty-five (45) days from the commencement of the disability. In the event Injury Leave and/or Workers’ Compensation benefits were denied and the employee chooses to apply for short-term disability benefits for the same disabling condition, the employee must submit the proper forms for short-term disability benefits within thirty (30) days of the occupational injury denial.
Section 21.3.	Disability Benefits.
Disability benefits shall be based on eighty one percent (81%) of the employee's standard gross wages. The applicable tax rates will be deducted. The employee may, if he/she so desires, elect to use all, or part of, his/her accumulated but unused sick leave in order to make up any difference between one hundred percent (100%) of his/her gross wages and the amount which he/she receives under the disability program, provided that all new sick leave accruals are exhausted before an employee may use the available balance in his/her old sick leave bank. If an employee exhausts all sick leave benefits, other approved leave may be granted by the Appointing Authority. If, while receiving disability payments, the employee performs work for the City, the amount of payment under the disability program shall be reduced by the compensation which he/she receives during that time period. If the employee is capable of performing his/her regular duties or transitional duties, such duties are available and the employee refuses to return to work, disability benefits shall not be paid. Any insurance premium not paid during disability leave must be brought current upon return from leave.
Section 21.4.	Limitations and Fraudulent Claims.
No disability payments shall be made to any employee who is working for another employer or also receiving temporary total benefits. Fraudulent actions automatically preclude employees
- 54 -
from receiving any disability benefits. If a payment is made pursuant to a fraudulent claim, the employee shall repay the City immediately.
Section 21.5.	Continued Contact With Division and Return to Work Notification.
An employee on disability leave shall maintain biweekly contact with the division personnel officer or designee during the period of time they are disabled. This requirement may be modified in writing by the personnel officer for extended leaves. An employee shall notify the personnel officer or designee at least seven (7) days before his/her expected return to work date to reconfirm that date.
Section 21.6.	Ninety (90)-Day Fitness Hearing.
After ninety (90) days, the City may conduct a hearing to determine the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of his/her classification.
Section 21.7.	Coordination with FMLA Leave.
Any disability leave which is granted for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
Section 21.8.	Continuation of Certain Benefits While on Disability.
While an employee is paid disability benefits pursuant to this Article, vacation accruals shall cease. During the period in which an employee receives disability payments, he/she shall suffer no reduction in his/her paid sick leave accrual set forth in Article 20 of this Contract, as applicable. Holidays shall be paid at the disability benefit rate as set forth in Section 21.3. Medical, dental, drug, vision, and life insurance shall continue uninterrupted until the employee is no longer on the disability program.
ARTICLE 22	- INJURY LEAVE
Section 22.1.	General Scope of Benefits and Eligibility for Injury Leave.
The injury leave program is a benefit intended to cover employees injured on the job, which is separate and distinct from any Workers’ Compensation benefits. Injury leave will be approved according to the provisions of this Contract, and the rules and policies of the Human Resources Director or designee and the Board of Industrial Relations. Workers’ Compensation laws, rules, and court decisions do not apply to the injury leave program. All full-time and part-time employees shall be allowed injury leave with pay up to a maximum of sixty (60) workdays per calendar year for on-the-job injuries, not to exceed a total of one hundred twenty (120) workdays per injury, for on-the-job injuries that meet the requirements set forth in this Article.

For all injuries that occur on or after January 1, 2009, all full-time and part-time employees shall be allowed injury leave with pay up to a maximum of fifty (50) workdays per calendar year for on-the-job injuries, not to exceed a total of one hundred (100) workdays per injury, for on-the-job injuries that meet the requirements set forth in this Article. The one hundred (100) day total shall apply to injuries (and any recurrences of the same injuries) occurring on or after January 1, 2009.
- 55 -

Signatures of the employee’s immediate supervisor, the Division Administrator, and the Appointing Authority are required thereafter. Claims are to be submitted to the Human Resources Department within a total of twenty-eight (28) days from the date the injury occurs (provided, however, that an employee's eligibility for injury leave shall not be prejudiced by a delay in filing caused by supervisors if the employee has complied with his/her fourteen (14)-day filing deadline). If the employee is physically unable to comply with the fourteen (14) day filing deadline or the medical documentation submitted by the employee is inadequate, the employee will be given an additional fourteen (14) days to submit adequate documentation.
Section 22.5.	Determination by Director of Human Resources and Related Limitations and Procedures.
(A)	Director of Human Resources Approval Required. Injury leave with pay shall be granted to an employee only for injuries determined by the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee as caused by the performance of the actual duties of the position. No employee shall be granted injury leave with pay unless the Appointing Authority has in his/her possession written authorization signed by the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee indicating the approximate length of the leave. If, in the judgment of the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee, the injury is such that the employee is capable of performing his/her regular duties or transitional duties during the period of convalescence, he/she shall so notify the Appointing Authority in writing and deny injury leave with pay.
(B)	Medical Examination/Documentation. The City may require an independent medical examination for any employee requesting injury leave, at the City's expense. No employee on injury leave shall be returned to work without the written approval of an attending physician.

- 56 -
ensure uninterrupted injury leave coverage. All such documentation must be submitted to the appropriate Department or Division Human Resources representative.

(E)	Forty (40) Day Fitness Hearing. After forty (40) workdays, the City may conduct a hearing to determine the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of his/her classification.
(F)	Fraudulent Claims. Fraudulent actions automatically preclude employees from receiving injury leave benefits and, if any benefits are paid pursuant to a fraudulent claim, they shall be repaid immediately and/or may be withheld from an employee's final pay upon termination.
(G)	No Outside Employment. No injury leave payments shall be made to any employee who is working for another employer nor also receiving temporary total benefits.
(H)	Limitation on Recreational Activities. In addition, no injury leave payment shall be made to any employee engaged in recreational activities when the physical demands of engaging in the recreation conflict with the approved injury/medical condition.
(I)	Coordination With FMLA Leave. Any injury leave which is granted for reasons permissible under an FMLA leave shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
(J)	Vocational Rehabilitation. If the Physician of Record indicates an employee is medically eligible to participate in vocational rehabilitation, the employee shall agree to participate in the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation voluntary vocational rehabilitation program. In the event the employee chooses not to participate, the Appointing Authority will be notified in writing and injury leave with pay will be denied.
Section 22.6.	Board of Industrial Relations Proceedings.
Any injured employee may appeal the decision of the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee by written notice to the Board of Industrial Relations within ten (10) days of notification that injury leave has been denied.

The Board of Industrial Relations, at the City's expense, may require an employee to be examined
- 57 -
by a physician of the Board's choice. The Board of Industrial Relations decision shall be final. The employee may appeal the Board's decision to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Appeals of injury leave denials cannot be grieved through the grievance procedure, with the sole exception of allegations that the City has not adhered to procedural provisions expressly set forth in the written provisions of this Article 22. Such a grievance shall be filed at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
Section 22.7.	Use of Other Leaves Pending Decision on Injury Leave.
Pending a decision by the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee, an employee applying for injury leave may be carried on sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time with pay, in that order, which shall be restored to his/her credit upon certification by the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee that injury leave has been approved. If injury leave is not certified by the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee, the employee will be charged sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time, in that order, for the time used or charged leave without pay after the employee's sick leave, vacation leave, and compensatory time are exhausted.
Section 22.8.	Use of Injury Leave for Medical Examinations/Treatment and Certain Related Hearings.
Pursuant to rules established by the Director of the Human Resources Department or designee, time off for the purpose of medical examination, including examinations by the Bureau of Workers' Compensation, and/or treatments resulting from an injury approved under the injury leave program, shall be charged to injury leave. A maximum of four (4) hours of injury leave shall be allowed per scheduled physician's appointment and/or treatment resulting from an on-the-job injury. An employee will be retained in his/her current pay status at the time of Bureau of Workers’ Compensation hearings or Industrial Relations Board hearings if the employee provides his/her immediate supervisor with proof of hearing notice prior to the date of hearing. The Director of the Human Resources Department or designee may approve an employee's request for injury leave of greater than four (4) hours for a scheduled physician's appointment or for treatment resulting from an on-the-job injury if the Director of Human Resources or designee determines that such request is supported by medical documentation. However, such medical documentation must be submitted to the Director of Human Resources or designee by the employee prior to such appointment and/or treatment in order to be considered.
Section 22.9.	Continuation of Benefits While on Injury Leave.
While an employee is on approved injury leave with pay, sick leave entitlement and vacation accruals, PERS contributions and all employee benefits shall continue uninterrupted and the City shall maintain applicable insurance benefits for the employee until such time as the employee returns to duty or is terminated from employment. Upon proof that an employee is receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, sick leave entitlement and vacation accruals and all applicable insurance benefits shall continue uninterrupted until the employee returns to duty or is terminated from employment. Any insurance premium not paid during injury leave must be brought current upon return from leave.
Section 22.10.	Extension of Injury Leave in Certain Circumstances and Repayment from Workers’ Compensation.
If an employee who has been granted injury leave does not begin receiving payments in lieu of wages from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation by the time the injury leave has been exhausted (i.e., after sixty (60), fifty (50), or forty (40) workdays, whichever is applicable), and the employee has filed a timely claim under the Ohio Workers' Compensation laws for such

payment, then the City shall pay the employee seventy-two percent (72%) or sixty-six and 2/3 percent (66-2/3%), whichever is applicable, of his/her wages until such time as payments from the Bureau are received or the claim is denied by a Staff Hearing Officer of the Industrial Commission of Ohio. In any instance of payment by both the City and the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation for the same day or days, the employee shall promptly provide full reimbursement to the City as determined by the City unless the City has received payment directly from the Bureau of Workers’ Compensation. The employee will be required to execute any necessary forms with the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation to effectuate payment to the City.

An employee who is away without leave, or AWOL, may be subject to disciplinary action. AWOL includes, but is not limited to, the following situations:
(A)	The employee does not call off by following the proper procedure and does not report for work;
(B)	The employee does not have enough accrued leave time to cover his/her absence;
(C)	The employee leaves the workplace without notifying and/or securing the approval of his/her supervisor, or if unavailable, the next available supervisor within his/her chain of command;

(E)	The employee fails to show or call off for scheduled overtime;
(F)	The employee reports to work but is seven (7) or more minutes late; and/or
(G)	The employee fails to follow the proper call off procedure.

- 62 -
Section 24.4.	Unpaid Union Leave.
(A)	Long Term. At the request of the Union, a leave of absence without pay shall be granted to any classified employee who is a member of the Union and who is selected for the Union office or employed by a Union for a fixed term of office, subject to the approval of the Appointing Authority. Such leave shall initially be limited to sixty (60) calendar days with possible extensions up to one (1) year. Such service will not constitute a break in service for seniority rights or promotional examination administered by the Civil Service Commission.
(B)	Short Term. At the request of the Union, a leave of absence without pay shall be granted to any classified employee who is a member of the Union to attend a convention or other similar functions of short duration subject to the approval of the Appointing Authority. Such leave of absence will affect neither his/her sick leave and vacation leave accruals, premium pay computations, and/or anniversary date for increases or seniority; nor will it constitute a break in service for computing service credits for Civil Service examinations.
Section 24.5.	Leave of Absence to Accept Provisional Appointment.
An employee with permanent status who accepts a provisional appointment shall be granted a leave of absence for a period of two (2) years from his/her permanent classification position.

Section 24.6.	Military Leave of Absence.
An employee shall be granted a leave of absence to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States of America or any branch thereof. The City shall comply with all applicable Federal laws relating to the granting of military leave and reinstating employees upon the conclusion of said leave. Such leave of absence shall be governed by the following principles:
(A)	No employee shall lose his/her rank, grade or seniority enjoyed at the time of his/her enlistment, induction or call into the active service of the Armed Forces of the United States of America or any branch thereof.
(B)	Any employee, upon his/her discharge from the Armed Forces, other than a dishonorable discharge, shall be returned to the position he/she held immediately prior to his/her enlistment or induction into the Armed Forces or to a position of equal rank and grade. This reinstatement is conditioned on the employee establishing the fact that his/her physical and mental condition has not been impaired to the extent of rendering him/her incompetent to perform the duties of the position he/she previously held. Such employee must request restoration to his/her position within ninety (90) calendar days of receiving a discharge, other than a dishonorable discharge, from the Armed Forces or his/her position will be declared vacant. Nothing contained in this Section 24.6 shall obligate the City to pay an employee who is on military leave of absence except under the conditions set forth in Section 23.1 of this contract.
(C)	An employee selected from an eligible list and having completed the probationary period who is serving in a position vacated temporarily due to the previous incumbent being in the Armed Forces, shall be determined to have been given a
- 63 -
permanent appointment if the returning employee does not return to work within the prescribed time.
(D)	The term "Armed Forces of the United States" as used in this Section 24.6 shall be deemed to include such services as designated by the Congress of the United States.
(E)	Any employee who is transferred or advanced to a position by reason of a vacancy caused by an employee serving in the Armed Forces shall be returned to the position he/she held before said transfer or advancement or to a position of equal rank or grade, upon the return of the employee from the Armed Forces.
(F)	An employee appointed from an eligible list for assignment to a temporary position with the City, becoming available by virtue of an employee enlisting or being inducted or called into the Armed Forces, shall be reinstated to the eligible list upon completion of the temporary employment.
(G)	In any case where two (2) or more employees who are entitled to be restored to a position left the same position in order to enter the Armed Forces, the employee with greatest seniority in that classification shall have the prior restoration right without prejudice to the reemployment rights of the other employee or employees to be restored.
(H)	Where service in the Armed Forces results from induction or call to active duty, leave shall be granted for the duration of such call.
Section 24.7.	Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave.
(A)	Employees who have worked for the City for at least twelve (12) months, and have worked for at least 1,250 hours over the twelve (12) month period preceding the leave, shall be eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave per twelve (12) month period for the following:
(1)	For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child;
(2)	For placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or
foster care. Adoption is limited to a child of eighteen (18) years of age or younger unless the child is incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability;
(3)	To care for the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition;
(4)	Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's job.
- 64 -
(B)	For the purposes of Section 24.7(A):
(1)	FMLA leave shall be granted for an employee's "spouse" as defined by Ohio law (i.e., unmarried domestic partners are not included). If both spouses are working for the City, their total leave in any twelve (12) month period shall be limited to an aggregate of twelve (12) weeks if the leave is taken for either the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a sick parent.
(2)	"Child" means a child either under eighteen (18) years of age or eighteen (18) years or older who is incapable of self-care because of mental or physical disability. An employee's "child" is one for whom the employee has actual day-to-day responsibility for care and includes a biological, adopted, foster or stepchild or the child of one standing in loco parentis.
(3)	"Parent" means a biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to an employee when the employee was a child. This term does not include parents "in law."
(4)	An employee's right to leave for the birth or adoption of a child ends twelve (12) months after the child's birth or placement with the employee.
(5)	The City retains the option of choosing a uniform method to compute the twelve (12) month period, including a rolling twelve (12) month period measured backward from the date leave is used.
(6)	The City retains the right to require written documentation of the family relationship, when applicable.
(C)	For the purposes of Sections 24.7(A)(3) and (4), a "serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment or a physical or mental condition that involves:
(1)	Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or consequent to inpatient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital, hospice or residential medical facility;
(2)	Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school or other regular daily activities of more than three (3) calendar days, and that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider; or
(3)	Continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider for a chronic or a long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3) calendar days; or
(4)	Prenatal care by a health care provider.
- 65 -
(D)	Employees may take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only when medically necessary because of the employee's own serious health condition or the serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child or parent. If leave is requested on this basis, however, the City may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternative position which better accommodates recurring periods of absence or a part-time schedule, provided that the position has equivalent pay and benefits.
(E)	Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee shall be returned to the position held prior to the leave or an equivalent position.
(F)	The City shall maintain health insurance benefits for the duration of FMLA leave at the level and under the same conditions (including employee premium contributions) and coverage that would have been provided if the employee had continued in active work status for the duration of the leave.
(G)	During an unpaid FMLA leave, subject to Section 13.2 (regarding accumulation of seniority) an employee shall not continue to accrue seniority and shall not accrue any employment benefits for the period of the leave, except for continuation of insurance benefits as provided in Paragraph (F) immediately above.
(H)	All accrued sick leave benefits must be utilized for any FMLA leave taken for any reason which qualifies for sick leave under Article 20 of this Contract. All accrued vacation leave benefits must be substituted for all or part of any unpaid FMLA leave taken after sick leave benefits have first been exhausted or for any FMLA leave for which sick leave is not applicable.
(I)	The following notice and scheduling requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests, unless the FMLA leave is being charged to sick or vacation leave, in which case the notice requirements for sick leave in Article 20 or for vacation leave in Article 19 of this Contract shall apply.
(1)	Employees must give thirty (30) days notice to the City before taking FMLA leave, if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, the employee must notify the City as soon as is practicable (normally no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the need for the leave becomes known).
(2)	If an employee has actual notice of the notice requirement stated in 24.7(I)(1) above (this requirement of actual notice is fulfilled by posting a notice at the worksite), and fails to provide the City with thirty (30) days notice for a foreseeable leave with no reasonable excuse for the delay, the City may deny the taking of leave until at least thirty (30) days after the employee provides notice.
(3)	Employees shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the City aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave. The City may inquire further
- 66 -
of the employee when additional information is needed to determine whether FMLA leave is to be taken.
(4)	If an employee takes leave based on the serious health condition of the employee or to care for a family member, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as to not unduly disrupt the City's operation. If an employee does not initiate discussions with the City to attempt to arrange a mutually agreeable treatment schedule, the City may initiate such discussions and require the employee to attempt to make such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care provider.
(J)	The following medical certification requirements shall apply to FMLA leave requests:
(1)	Employees who request leave because of their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a covered family member shall be required to provide a certification issued by the health care provider of the employee or the employee's family member on a form acceptable to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee in accordance with Department of Labor regulations. For the employee's own medical leave, the certification must include, among other things, the date the condition commenced, probable duration of incapacity, a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the employee's position, and a statement of the regimen of treatment prescribed for the condition by the health care provider (including estimated number of visits, nature, frequency, and duration of treatment). For leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the certification must include, among other things, the date the condition commenced, probable duration of incapacity, a statement that the patient requires assistance for basic medical, hygiene, nutritional needs, safety or transportation, or that the employee's presence or assistance would be beneficial or desirable for the care of the family member, and an estimate of the amount of time the employee is needed to provide care.
(2)	The City shall give employees requesting FMLA leave written notice of the requirement for medical certification.
(3)	In its discretion, the City may require a second medical opinion and periodic re-certification at its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the City, at its own expense, may obtain the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved jointly by the employee and the City.
(4)	Employees must provide the requested certification to the City within the time frame requested by the City, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts. The City must allow at least fifteen (15) calendar days after the City's request for certification.
- 67 -
(5)	In most cases, the City shall request that an employee furnish certification from a health care provider at the time the employee requests leave or soon after the leave is requested or in the case of unforeseen leave, soon after the leave commences. The City may request certification or recertification at some later date if the City has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration, if circumstances have changed significantly or if any extension of the leave is requested. If the City believes the certification is incomplete, it shall notify the employee and allow an opportunity to correct the deficiency. In the case of a complete certification which is unclear, the City's health care provider may, with the employee's permission, contact the employee's health care provider to clarify and authenticate the certification.
(6)	Certification shall be submitted using a form approved by the Director of the Department of Human Resources for use by employees consistent with the FMLA.
(7)	All employees who take FMLA leave because of their own serious health condition shall be required to provide medical certification of their fitness to report back to work. The City may seek fitness for duty certification only with regard to the particular health condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave.
(K)	The City may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the employee's status and intent to return to work. An FMLA leave will not be granted to permit an employee to accept gainful employment elsewhere, including selfemployment. If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not to return, the City's obligations under FMLA to maintain health benefits (subject to COBRA requirements) and to restore the employee cease.
(L)	Leaves that are granted under any other provision of this Contract or under State law, whether paid or unpaid, including sick, disability and injury leave as provided in Articles 20, 21 and 22, respectively, for purposes which are covered under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall be charged as FMLA Leave and shall be subject to the twelve (12) week per year limitation for the length of an FMLA leave.
(M)	The City, in its discretion, may implement the FMLA consistent with the foregoing provisions of this Section 24.7 and in accordance with any Department of Labor regulations, which may be in effect from time to time.

Testing procedures will be comparable to those set forth in Federal regulations governing drug and alcohol testing for CDL holders; except as follows. An employee with an alcohol level of .04 to .06 shall be relieved of duty but the result will not be considered positive. Alcohol levels of higher than .06 shall be considered positive; the employee will be referred to EAP and will be required to take a return-to-duty test.

(A)	Any employee who tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol shall be relieved of duty without pay (unless the employee elects to use his/her available vacation or compensatory time balances) and referred to the City’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP). Before returning to work after a positive test result, an employee must take a return-to-duty test and test negative. An employee shall be subject to follow-up testing for one (1) year.
(B)	Any employee who voluntarily requests drug and/or alcohol education and/or treatment shall not be disciplined in connection with that request, if the request is done prior to selection for random testing.
(C)	Failure to cooperate and a refusal to test shall be construed as a positive test result. Any drug test which reveals the presence of adulterants shall be construed as a positive test.
(D)	Any employee that has completed his/her initial probationary period who tests positive the first time will not be disciplined for the positive result, although he/she may be disciplined for other work rule or policy violations in connection with that positive result. A second positive drug or alcohol test shall result in discipline up to and including termination of employment.

(3)	At no time will an employee be paid higher than the maximum hourly rate
- 73 -
of any step.
(C)	Each year of continuous service shall be based upon an employee's continuous service as defined in Article 2. Solely for purposes of Section 26.1(A) and 26.1(B) of this Contract, a part-time employee will be deemed to have completed one (1) year of continuous service when he/she has accumulated more than 2,080 hours in paid status with no separation from City employment.
(D)	Employees shall qualify for the step increases provided for under this Section 26.1 on the first day of the pay period following completion of each required period of continuous service.
Section 26.2.	Contributions to the Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio.
(A)	The term "earned compensation" shall mean any and all monies earned by an employee from the City of Columbus, for which there is a pension contribution.
(B)	For full-time employees, that portion of an employee's contribution made to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System equal to ten percent (10%) of the employee's earned compensation shall be picked up (assumed and paid) on behalf of the employee, and in lieu of payment by the employee, by the City of Columbus. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply uniformly to employees and no such employee shall have the option to elect a wage increase or other benefit in lieu of the payment provided for herein.
(C)	For part-time employees, that portion of an employee's contribution made to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System equal to six percent (6%) of the employee's earned compensation shall be picked up (assumed and paid) on behalf of the employee, and in lieu of payment by the employee, by the City of Columbus. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply uniformly to employees and no such employee shall have the option to elect a wage increase or other benefit in lieu of the payment provided for herein.
(D)	The City shall, in reporting and making remittances to the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System, report that each employee's contribution has been made as provided by statute.
(E)	The City hereby declares that the sum paid hereunder by the City on behalf of an employee, in Paragraphs (B) and (C), of the employee's earned compensation, is not to be considered additional salary or wages and shall not be treated as increased compensation. For purposes of computing the employee's earnings or basis of his/her contribution to the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, the amount paid by the City on behalf of an employee as a portion of his/her statutory obligation is intended to be and shall be considered as having been paid by the employee in fulfillment of his/her statutory obligation.
(F)	If, at any time, the Ohio Public Employee Retirement System reduces the employee contribution to an amount less than ten percent (10%), the City's obligation shall be reduced accordingly with no further requirement to adjust
- 74 -
employees' compensation.
Section 26.3.	Administration of Pay Plan.
(A)	Pay Rates. All employees in the bargaining unit shall be granted a three percent (3%) pay increase effective at the beginning of the pay period which includes April 1, 2008; a three percent (3%) increase effective at the beginning of the pay period which includes April 1, 2009; and a three percent (3%) increase effective at the beginning of the pay period which includes April 1, 2010. The hourly rate of pay of each employee of the City shall be at the sole pay rate for employees whose classes are assigned to Pay Range 29 or below. Employees whose classes are assigned to Pay Range 30 or above shall be paid as provided herein, or at an hourly rate authorized for that pay range as provided in Subsection (B), (C), and (D) below. Changes in pay made to any rate in Pay Range 30 and above shall be effective at the beginning of the next pay period following written notice by the Appointing Authority to the Civil Service Commission. Except as set forth in this Article, the City will not unilaterally change an employee’s Pay Range.
(B)	New Hiring Rate. The hiring rate for a class shall be at the lowest pay rate in the range except as otherwise provided herein. Wherein a multiple pay range is established for a classification, the Appointing Authority will designate the range at which the employee shall be paid in Step 0. Any employee initially hired after June 5, 2005 shall be paid in Step A.
(C)	Demotion. Whenever an employee is reduced from his/her class to a class which is assigned more than one pay range or more than one pay rate, the Appointing Authority shall have the sole discretion as to which range or rate the employee is entitled to be paid within the new class.
(D)	Local 1632 Merit Increases. The City shall continue a merit pay review system for bargaining unit employees assigned to classifications with variable pay ranges and/or pay ranges 30 and above. Each employee shall be evaluated once every two (2) years (provided the conditions set forth below are met) based on the employee’s classification seniority date. If an employee meets or exceeds the requirements of the merit pay review system, the Appointing Authority or designee may approve a merit pay increase for him/her. If an employee has reached the highest step of the highest pay range(s) assigned to his/her classification, and otherwise qualifies for a merit increase, the Appointing Authority or designee may give that employee a merit bonus of one hundred fifty dollars ($150), less taxes and appropriate deductions. For those employees whose seniority date falls on or after July 1, 2008, the merit bonus increases to two hundred dollars ($200). If an employee is denied a merit pay increase, the employee shall be provided the reason(s) for such denial in writing. A merit increase will not be denied solely on the basis of a lack of funding.
Any employee hired after June 1, 2003 will be eligible for merit consideration after successful progression through Step 5.
- 75 -
For those employees whose classification seniority date falls on or after July 1, 2008, after July 1, 2008, any applicable merit increase must be given no later than the first day of the first pay period following the ninetieth (90th) day after the employee’s classification seniority date. Any merit increase processed after that date will be retroactive to said date.
(E)	Additional Compensation or Benefits. Except as provided in Section 26.7 of this Contract, no employee shall receive, and the City Treasurer shall not draw any checks or any additional compensation in any form, sick and injury leave, vacation, insurance coverage and any and all other benefits and privileges, for any employee who substitutes or acts for another in the position of another, other than the position to which he/she was appointed pursuant to the Ohio Constitution, City Charter provisions, and the rules and regulations of the Civil Service Commission. No Appointing Authority shall appoint any person or submit any personnel action form contrary to said constitution, charter, rules and regulations, and the provisions of this Contract.
(F)	Payroll Deductions. Payroll deductions shall be governed first by the ability of the City Auditor's payroll system to handle them, and secondly, upon a determination by the City of the type of payroll deductions which are to be offered to employees and also based upon which ones will benefit the largest number of employees. Deductions or withholdings, except where demanded or required by law, must be agreed to in writing by the employee with the specific reason stated in writing and filed with the Appointing Authority.
(G)	City Council Authorization Required. Neither the Civil Service Commission nor the City Auditor shall approve and/or pay any pay rate based on the assignment of any class to a pay range not specifically authorized by Board of Health, except as provided in Article 26.7.
Section 26.4.	Report-In Pay.
When any full-time employee reports for work in his/her regular shift and has not received written notification from the Appointing Authority or his/her designee by the previous workday not to report, he/she shall be assigned at least three (3) hours of work at any available job, or in the event that no work is available, he/she shall be paid three (3) hours straight-time at his/her regular hourly rate and released from duty no more than thirty (30) minutes after the report-in time. All written notices not to report shall be countersigned by the employee affected. Where written notice is provided, the written notice may direct employees not to report to work for multiple work days. This Section 26.4 shall not apply in hazardous weather conditions as set forth in Section 30.11.
Section 26.5.	Call-Back Pay.
A call-back is defined as an unscheduled work assignment which does not immediately precede or follow an employee's scheduled work hours (this provision, for example, does not apply to a pre-scheduled early call-in or in cases of overtime authorized as an extension of a regular shift). In any situation where notification of the overtime is given prior to the end of a scheduled shift, call-back pay shall not apply. When any full-time employee is required by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee to report to work after he/she has been relieved of duty upon the completion of the employee's regular schedule and he/she does so report, he/she shall be paid
- 76 -
for a minimum of four (4) hours at time and one-half his regular hourly rate, except that if the call-back occurs on the second regular day off and the employee is eligible for double time, he/she shall be paid at the double time rate for a minimum of four (4) hours. If the call-back occurs within two (2) hours of the start of the employee's regular shift, he/she shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate. If an employee is called back to work, he/she will be paid from the time he/she leaves his/her home until the time he/she is released from duty, subject to the above stated provisions. This provision does not apply in cases of overtime authorized as an extension of a regular shift.
Section 26.6.	Shift Differential.
(A)	The Appointing Authority, at the time of hire, shall designate or assign the applicable shift for each new hire and such assignments shall not abridge the seniority rights of employees. The shift designation shall determine the shift differential for the entire shift. The provisions of this Section apply to full-time and part-time employees.
(B)	A differential in pay of fifty-two cents ($.52) per hour over the regular hourly rate shall be paid to employees who are assigned to work eight (8) hours on the second shift; a differential of sixty cents ($.60) per hour over the regular hourly rate shall be paid to employees who are assigned to work eight (8) hours on the third shift.
(C)	Those employees whose regularly assigned shift is a rotating shift shall be paid a shift differential of sixty cents ($.60) per hour over the regular hourly rate for all hours worked regardless of shift.
(D)	For purposes of computing leave with pay, except for compensatory time, shift differential shall not be paid in addition to regular pay.
(E)	In those departments, divisions, sections, offices, and programs where only one (1) shift prevails, no differential shall be paid regardless of the hours of the day that are worked.
(F)	Shift differential pay shall be added to the base hourly rate prior to computing the overtime rate.
(G)	Any employee who participates in a flextime program shall not qualify for shift differential pay.

Alternate medical treatment benefits refer to expenses that are approved before they are incurred, which may not otherwise be payable as covered expenses under the medical plan.

Section 29.3.	Tools and Equipment.
The City agrees to furnish all employees, except those specified in Section 29.4 of this Article, with tools and equipment necessary to perform their jobs. Such tools and equipment, as well as the employees who receive the same, shall be determined by the City. The City shall retain
- 93 -
ownership of such tools and equipment and the same shall be returned by employees upon their separation from City service. The City agrees to replace any damaged or worn out tools and equipment. However, employees shall be responsible for replacing those items which are lost or stolen through fault of the employee.
The parties agree to the following regarding the security of personal tools of employees:
(A)	Employees will use the “buddy system” (i.e., looking after each other's property while one is away from the work area) during working hours as a safeguard against tool theft.
(B)	During working hours when the building is not secured and the employee is not on duty, forcible entry into the locked tool box will suffice as evidence of theft.
(C)	Employees will be responsible for securing personal tools during non-working hours. The City will assume liability for tools stolen during an employee's nonworking hours provided forcible entry to either the building or the employee's locked tool box can be shown. A police report must be filed by the employee.
(D)	Employees will be responsible for maintaining a tool inventory form which will be supplied by the City and updating the inventory as purchases are made. The City will only reimburse for those tools listed on the inventory.

ARTICLE 30	- MISCELLANEOUS
Section 30.1.	Gender.
Every effort has been made to make the context gender neutral, however unless the context in which they are used clearly requires otherwise, words used in this Contract denoting gender shall be deemed to refer to both the masculine and feminine.
Section 30.2.	Pay Stub Information.
Employees shall be provided with a record of accumulated earned vacation, sick leave and compensatory time on a bi-weekly basis.
- 94 -
Section 30.3.	Fund Receipts and Disbursements.
The City agrees to diligently pursue an administrative policy of eliminating, insofar as possible, the necessity for City employees to handle cash monies. Concentration of the money deposits or payments for all purposes within the Treasurer's Office is strongly recommended. Individual cash drawers and receipt boxes shall be established wherever possible to facilitate establishment of individual responsibility for the handling of funds.
Section 30.4.	Mileage Allowance.
(A)	When a City employee uses his/her private car for transportation on any City business, in or out of the City of Columbus, he/she shall be reimbursed for mileage actually traveled on City business. The mileage reimbursement rate shall be equal to the Internal Revenue Service allowable rate for business mileage in effect on each January 1 for the succeeding twelve (12) months for the duration of the Contract.
(B)	Employees who are regularly required to report directly to job sites away from their City reporting locations are entitled to mileage allowance to the extent such mileage exceeds that from their home to their reporting location. No allowance is payable from the employee's home to or from his/her City reporting location.
(C)	In order for an employee to be reimbursed for such expenses incurred while on City business, said employee must obtain authorization for such reimbursement from the proper department or division head prior to the use of a privately-owned vehicle for City business. In order to receive timely reimbursement, a form, approved by the Auditor's Office, must be submitted by the employee by the fifth (5th) day of the month, for the preceding month's mileage, to the Department Head.
Section 30.5.	Comprehensive Physicals and Respiratory Protection.
(A) Examinations/Identification Potential Hazardous Working Conditions. The City has the responsibility to provide a safe working environment for all employees. In recognition of this responsibility and in order to provide a means to carry out the same, the City shall continue a program to conduct mandatory comprehensive physical examinations and/or testing in accordance with federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to Ohio’s Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (O.R.C. Chapter 4167) to determine and identify potential hazardous working conditions and locations. Further, these physical examinations and/or testing will be for the purpose of enabling the City to comply with legal obligations imposed upon it as an employer under applicable federal, state and local laws together with administrative rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, such as, but not limited to, the Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (O.R.C. Chapter 4167).
Other than for the purposes specified herein, the data collected during the physical examinations and/or testing shall remain confidential, unless the employee waives such confidentiality in writing.
- 95 -
	The City shall also continue to offer voluntary physical examinations and testing to all bargaining unit members who have been afforded such examinations/tests in the past. Employees voluntarily participating in physical examinations and testing will be required to sign a form indicating that the examinations/testing is voluntary. Refusal to submit to a mandatory physical examination and/or testing as required by federal, state and local laws, including but not limited to, Ohio’s Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (O.R.C. Chapter 4167) may be grounds for discipline, up to and including termination. The physical examinations and/or testing shall not in any way be used for alcohol, drug, or substance abuse testing, nor shall the results of examinations and/or testing be used to relieve an employee of duty involuntarily without due process.
(B)	Respiratory Protection. It is agreed that the City will take the appropriate steps necessary to comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws, including but not limited to Ohio’s Public Employment Risk Reduction Program (O.R.C. Chapter 4167), dealing with respiratory protection. To that end, the City will provide respirators that are applicable and suitable for the purposes intended consistent with applicable provisions of law. Employees shall use the respiratory protection provided in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, training provided, and all applicable provisions of law. Further, employees will be fit-tested for respirators in order to ensure that a proper facial seal exists as prescribed and mandated by current law. The City will require employees to correct conditions which prevent, impair, or impede a proper facial seal, including but not limited to, a growth of beard, sideburns, any object worn that projects under the facepiece, or temple pieces on glasses. The refusal or failure of any employee, after being advised by management, to take corrective action to remedy those conditions which prevent, impair or impede the proper fit of a respirator may subject such employee to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Employees who are assigned a respirator must be medically cleared to determine their fitness to wear the respirator, which may require a physical examination. No employee will be assigned a task requiring the use of a respirator unless found physically able to perform the work while wearing the respirator. Physical examinations to determine medical fitness to where a respirator shall be conducted by a licensed health care professional. Certain provisions of applicable occupational health and safety laws require site and/or job specific policies, procedures and protocols. It is further agreed that the City will promulgate and employees will comply with such site and/or job specific policies, procedures and protocols. Failure of an employee to comply with such policies, procedures and protocols may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
- 96 -
Section 30.6.	Contract Copies.
The City agrees to equally share the cost of printing the Contract with AFSCME Local 1632.
Section 30.7.	Operational Changes.
(A)	Should the City intend to institute any new methods of operation that would result in a material change in the essential functions of a job presently being done by employees covered by this Contract, the City shall meet with the Union at the earliest possible time but not later than thirty (30) days prior to the implementation of such intended changes and/or methods of operations; extreme emergencies excluded.
(B)	Prior to the effective date of implementation, upon written request by the Union, a joint conference shall be scheduled for the purpose of discussion with respect to the following subjects: transfer to comparable work, retraining for transferred employees or the disposition of displaced employees resulting from the institution of such new methods, machinery or equipment.
Section 30.8.	Errors and Omissions Policy.
It is the policy of the City to cover employees for errors and omissions by such employees while performing duties within the scope of their employment by the City.
Section 30.9.	Application of Contract to Part-Time Employees.
Except as otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this Contract, part-time employees in the bargaining unit shall not be eligible for any fringe benefits under this Contract (other than specifically noted), including but not limited to sick leave, other leaves of absence, holidays, vacations, service credit, and tuition reimbursement.
Section 30.10.	Employee Address.
Employees shall provide their payroll clerk or other individual designated by the Appointing Authority with their correct current name, home address, and home telephone number (if any), and shall update this information with their payroll clerk to keep it current at all times.
Section 30.11.	Employee Assistance Program.
The City and the Union recognize the significance of employees' personal problems and the effect those problems may have on personal well being and productivity. The City and the Union agree to utilize the City's Employee Assistance Program to refer employees with potential problems to the appropriate assistance program. Employees referred to the EAP will be granted up to a maximum of three (3) free visits per calendar year to the EAP for assessment, referral and follow-up without being charged with time off.
(A)	Professional assistance should be encouraged and sought by employees with problems related to stress, substance abuse, mental or emotional illness, finances, legal issues or family crisis; however, employee participation shall be strictly voluntary.
(B)	Employees participating in this program should be made aware that treatment records may be maintained and such records shall remain confidential.
- 97 -
(C)	All employees receiving treatment shall remain in paid status, until the employee's accrued vacation and sick leave credits are exhausted. After the exhaustion of these benefits, the City may, at its option, advance sick leave through a pay back arrangement. Should termination occur, sick days borrowed shall be repaid from wages and benefits due at the time of termination.
(D)	The City's designated disciplinary hearing officer may order an employee to EAP as part of a disciplinary order.
Section 30.12.	Hazardous Weather Conditions.
In cases of severe wind, rain or electrical storms, severe temperatures/wind chill factors or severe snowstorms and ice blanketing, no employee shall be unnecessarily compelled to work under conditions, which involve a physical risk to his/her health and personal safety. In the event the Union believes employees are being compelled to work under such conditions, the Local Union President or designee has the right to discuss the matter with the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. However, such discussion shall not affect the City's rights under this Section 30.12. If, after such discussion, the City maintains that employees should work under such conditions, the City shall provide such employees with the protective, foul weather gear and clothing as provided in Section 29.2(F).
Section 30.13.	Effect of Article and Section Headings.
The article and section headings contained in this Contract are included only for convenience of reference and do not define, limit, explain or modify this Contract or its interpretation, construction or implementation.
ARTICLE 31	- RELATION TO OTHER LAWS AND SEPARABILITY
Section 31.1.	Savings Clause.
If any article, section or appendix of this Contract should be held illegal by operation of law or by any tribunal of competent jurisdiction; or if compliance with or enforcement of any article or section should be restrained by such tribunal pending a final determination as to its legality, the remainder of this Contract or the application of such article, section or appendix to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it has been held illegal or as to which compliance with, or enforcement of, has been restrained, shall not be affected. It is understood by the parties that nothing in this Contract shall be deemed to conflict with Federal laws, and the Constitutions of the State of Ohio and the United States of America.
Section 31.2.	Negotiations.
(A)	In the event any article, section or appendix is declared illegal, this Contract shall be reopened on such article, section or appendix. The City’s Chief Negotiator and the Union shall meet within thirty (30) calendar days for the purpose of negotiating a lawful alternate provision. However, such negotiations shall not affect the enforcement or validity of any other provision of the Contract.
(B)	No ordinance or resolutions dealing with negotiated wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment shall be submitted to City Council or to the Board of
- 98 -
Health until negotiated and approved by the City and the Union with the exception of those classifications in a federally funded program wherein the imposition of federal constraints negate the bargaining process.
Section 31.3.	Effect of Subsequently-Enacted Legislation.
It is agreed that, in the event the Ohio General Assembly or the United States Congress passes legislation which becomes law and which affects the City of Columbus and this Contract, the Contract can be reopened only for purposes of amending said Contract to conform to such law or laws. Either party hereto shall have the right to call for a reopening of the Contract under such circumstances by giving notice to the other party in writing; said notice may be given at any time after such legislation is signed into law and prior to the effective date of such law or laws. Such negotiations shall commence within ten (10) days after written notification.
ARTICLE 32	- ENTIRE AGREEMENT/MID-TERM MODIFICATIONS
Section 32.1.	Entire Agreement/Precedence of Agreement.
This Contract, upon ratification, supersedes all prior practices and agreements, whether written or oral, unless expressly stated to the contrary herein, and constitutes the complete and entire agreement between the parties, and concludes collective bargaining for its term. Therefore, except as provided in Articles 31 and 32, the parties, for the duration of this Contract, each voluntarily waives the right and obligation to bargain collectively with respect to any subject covered by this Contract. This Contract is not intended, however, to render null and void prior arbitration, judicial and applicable administrative agency decisions involving the parties to the extent that such decisions involve contract language which remains unchanged and to the extent that the governing law involved in such judicial and administrative agency decisions remains unchanged.
Section 32.2.	Changes in Conditions of Employment Which Are Not Specifically Established by Contract.
Any term and/or conditions of employment not specifically established by this Contract shall remain within the discretion of the City to modify, establish or eliminate; provided, however, that no such determination shall be implemented prior to consultation with the Union, as provided below in Subsections (A) and (B):
(A)	Changes in Mandatory Subjects Not Specifically Established by Contract. The parties agree the City may implement changes in terms and conditions of employment during the term of the Contract where the subject matter of the change is a mandatory subject of bargaining under Ohio Revised Code (ORC), Chapter 4117, and where the Contract does not expressly address the subject matter of the change after giving the Union notice of the proposed change and a reasonable opportunity to bargain about it. In the event the parties do not reach an agreement about the proposed change, the parties agree that the Union may choose to grieve the matter to arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provisions of Section 11.5(D). The City will not implement its proposed change until the arbitrator issues an award, unless the Union chooses not to grieve in which case the City may implement its final proposal.
- 99 -
(B)	Changes in Permissive Subjects Not Specifically Established by Contract. It is further agreed that this bargaining obligation referenced in Subsection (A) above does not apply to any change which does not constitute a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORC Chapter 4117. The City retains complete discretion to modify, establish or eliminate any term or condition of employment which is not expressly addressed in the parties' Contract. If the City intends to modify, establish or eliminate any term or condition of employment which is not expressly addressed in the parties' Contract, and which is not a mandatory subject of bargaining under ORC Chapter 4117, the City may do so after consultation with the Union. The City also shall comply with the posting and notification requirements set forth in Article 8 of the Contract, when applicable. If the Union disagrees with the change in terms and conditions of employment after the City implements it, the Union may choose to grieve the reasonableness of the implemented term or condition of employment under the grievance procedure of the Contract.
Section 32.3.	Changes in Conditions of Employment Which Are Specifically Established by Contract.
The parties may, by mutual agreement, reopen negotiations to expand, clarify, modify or amend provisions of this Contract. In order to amend the Contract, the party proposing the amendment shall identify to the other party the specific section(s) of the Contract to be reopened. Except as stated in other sections of this Contract, neither party shall be obligated to agree to reopen the Contract.
In addition to reopening this Contract for the purpose of amendment, the parties may enter into written memoranda of understanding that define, clarify, interpret or construe the meaning of specific contract sections. Such memoranda of understanding shall not be valid until signed by the City’s Chief Negotiator or designee and appropriate Union officials. Such memoranda of understanding cease to exist at the date stated therein or the expiration of the current contract (whichever is less) unless the parties specifically incorporate them by reference into the successor contract. Any action taken by the Civil Service Commission which would change Appendix A of this Contract shall be accomplished by a memorandum of understanding.
Neither party hereto shall attempt to achieve the alteration of this Contract by recommending changes in, additions to or deletions from ordinances or resolutions of the Columbus City Council.
ARTICLE 33	- TIME DONATION PROGRAM
Section 33.1.	Purpose.
Effective ninety (90) days after the effective date of this Contract, a time donation program will be established to assist full-time employees, eligible to earn accruals, who have exhausted all accumulated paid leave and all disability leave benefits available as a result of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related. This program neither supersedes nor replaces other disability programs covered by this Contract.
- 100 -
Section 33.2.	Conditions.
An employee may utilize the time donation program only if all of the following conditions are met:
(A)	Prior to requesting approval for donation of vacation leave, the employee must have exhausted all paid leave and disability leave benefits available to him/her; and
(B)	The employee shall submit an application requesting donation of vacation leave from other bargaining unit employees in the same division to the Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee. The application shall include acceptable medical documentation of a catastrophic illness or injury that is not job related, including diagnosis and prognosis. The injury or long-term illness must require the employee to be away from work for at least one (1) full pay period. This application shall be on a form mutually agreed to by the City and the Union; and
(C)	The Director of the Department of Human Resources or designee shall determine that the injury or long-term illness is catastrophic in nature and that the employee is eligible to receive vacation leave donations from other bargaining unit employees in the same division. If an employee works in a division with fewer than forty (40) employees in the bargaining unit, the City would consider donations from employees from outside the division, but inside the department; and
(D)	The approved application shall be forwarded to Local 1632. The Local shall post a notice on the Union bulletin boards to other bargaining unit employees in the same division that the eligible employee may receive donations of vacation leave; and
(E)	If the eligible employee is in a probationary period, the probation will be extended by the number of days the employee is off duty receiving leave donations. The Civil Service Commission must be notified of an extension of any probationary period; and
(F)	Donated leave shall be considered sick leave but shall never be converted into a cash benefit.
Section 33.3.	Employees Donating Vacation Time.
(A)	An employee desiring to donate vacation leave shall submit a completed time donation form to the Division payroll office.
(B)	It is understood that all vacation leave donations are voluntary and once vacation leave is donated, it will not be returned to the donating employee.
(C)	All donated vacation leave shall be paid at the regular hourly rate of the employee receiving and using the donated leave, not at the regular hourly rate of the employee donating the leave.
- 101 -
(D)	Vacation leave may be donated in increments of at least four (4) hours.
This is a completely voluntary program. A decision made by the City regarding implementation, acceptance or rejection of an application for donations shall be final and the same shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
- 102 -
ARTICLE 34	- DURATION OF CONTRACT
This Contract signed on ____________________, shall be effective as of April 1, 2008, and shall remain in full force
and effect through March 31, 2011 unless either party gives written notice to the other of its intent to terminate or modify at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to its expiration date.

Study time will be incorporated into the eight (8) hour day for employees in the OIT classification.

Page 2 of 4
An OIT must obtain and maintain his/her Class 1 certification within twenty-four (24) months of date of hire or a disciplinary hearing will be held that will result in termination.
OVERTIME
Overtime will be set up on a hierarchy in wastewater treatment plants, consistent with Section 16.4 of the contract, with OITs not being eligible for overtime until they have successfully completed the on-the-job training curriculum.

(A)	Wastewater Plant Operators will be offered first.
(B)	OITs will be offered second.
(C)	Wastewater Plant Supervisor Is will be offered third.
OITs, once trained in specific process areas, will be used to fill in for operator vacancies prior to authorizing overtime. An OIT filling in for a Wastewater Plant Operator shall not constitute a working out of classification assignment.
Overtime will be set up on a hierarchy in water treatment plants for overtime within the Water Plant Operator I classification in the following order:
(A)	Water Plant Operator Is will be offered first.
(B)	OITs will be offered second.

Page 3 of 4
A leave of absence from the OIT to accept an appointment to another classification will not be granted.
SHIFT SELECTION
At the time of initial appointment, the OIT will be assigned to a shift by management.
Once an OIT has completed all of the requirements to be an operator as stated in the “PROMOTION” section above, the OIT’s shift will be bid per Section 13.3 of the collective bargaining agreement.
If, during the course of the shift bidding process a more senior Water Plant Operator I or Wastewater Plant Operator requests the OIT’s shift through the seniority transfer process, the OIT will then be required to accept the shift remaining after the bid process is complete. This may result in the OIT being transferred to another shift and/or another plant.
CERTIFICATION INCENTIVE
Incentive pay for certifications beyond what is required by the classification specification will be provided for each hour worked. Effective with the first payperiod following passage of the 20082011 Collective Bargaining Agreement by City Council, employees will receive the incentive based on hours in paid status as follows:

Wastewater Plant Supervisor I Wastewater Works Operator Class II/Class III $0.25
Water Plant Operator I	Public Water System Operator I/Class II	$0.25
Water Plant Operator I	Public Water System Operator I/Class III	$0.50
Incentive pay will be effective the first payperiod following notice of certification.
Employees who are receiving an incentive and fail to maintain a valid certification shall notify plant management within one (1) working day of loss of such certification.
Certifications will be verified at least once per year by the Human Resources Section of the Department of Public Utilities working in conjunction with Plant Management.
For purposes of this paragraph, “grandparented” applies only to Wastewater Plant Operators who were hired prior to the Civil Service requirement of possessing an EPA certification (June 27, 2005). Employees who were not grandparented into the classification and fail to maintain

It is essential that Communication Technicians be immediately available to answer telephone calls from the public as well as other police personnel. To that end, Communication Technicians are assigned to consoles to answer such incoming calls. Although Communication Technicians are available, there are times when incoming telephone calls are not constant. It is not practical to permit Communication Technicians to leave their respective consoles when they are awaiting incoming telephone calls.
In order to promote the alertness of Communication Technicians awaiting incoming telephone calls, it is agreed that they be permitted to work on small craft activities at non-emergency telephone consoles in the Police Communications Center. Small craft activities include such things as knitting, cross-stitching and needlework. It is essential that the individual be able to immediately stop the craft activity in order to answer incoming calls. Small craft activities shall not be permitted at consoles receiving incoming 9-1-1 calls.
No activity shall involve the use of any liquids, scraps, or other fragments which may deter the Communications Bureau’s equipment or operations.
Permission to engage in small craft activities shall be subject to guidelines formulated by management. The privilege to engage in such activities may be temporarily or permanently revised, rescinded or otherwise modified by management at any time. Any Division of Police supervisor may order an individual to cease small craft activity at any time.
This Memorandum of Understanding applies only to Police Communication Technicians working in the Police Communications Center.
DURATION
This MOU may be terminated by either party giving thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other party, but shall not extend beyond March 31, 2011.
