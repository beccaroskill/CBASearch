This Agreement is entered into between Albertson's Inc., Smith’s Food & Drug Stores, Von’s, Food for Less (individually an “Employer” and collectively, the “Employers”) and UFCW Local 711 (collectively the “Parties”). The intent of this memorandum is to describe in general forms the understanding of the Parties with regard to changes in Health and Welfare and Pension Benefits. The provisions of the Las Vegas Retail Clerks Food Industry and Las Vegas Retail Meat Agreements, effective February 6, 2001 through September 12, 2004, shall remain in full force and effect, and shall only be modified by amendments to those Agreements and to the extent that those amendments reflect the intentions of the Parties to this Agreement
A.	Term: The term of this Agreement shall be date of ratification through and including February 29,2008.
HEALTH AND WELFARE AND DEATH BENEFITS
B.	Health and Welfare and Death Benefits:
The Trustees are authorized and directed to modify benefits, for both active employees and retirees, in the manner set forth in the Leiter of Understanding and otherwise consistent with this Agreement. The Maintenance of Benefits (MOB) obligations of the Employers are eliminated, and the Trustees shall implement and maintain over time a schedule of benefits and plan design, including a prudent operating reserve, that can be supported by the applicable hourly contribution rate. These changes shall be made by the Trustees as soon as possible following ratification of this Agreement, except that plan changes for those hired prior to or on ratification shall become effective March 1,2005.
Effective for all employees hired on or after the ratification date of this Agreement, the Trustees shall establish new plans B and C. They shall include the following provisions:
The initial eligibility rule will be modified to require 4 months of qualifying hours and member only eligibility will begin after a one-month lag (i.e. the first day of the 6th month).
•	Plan C shall cover the employee only (nd dependent coverage) during the first twelve months of eligibility in Plan C. Children will be covered in the 13th month of eligibility. Family coverage will begin in the 25th month of eligibility.
•	Plan C employees (and their dependents) shall commence coverage under a new Plan B after the employee has completed 36 months of eligibility in Plan C.
•	The new Plan B benefit structure will be implemented with the Agreement. Plan B coverage will begin the 37th month of eligibility and continue through the 72nd month of eligibility (for employees and their dependents).
1
The Plan’s current monthly straight-time work hours requirements for each classification of employment, as they related to eligibility, shall continue to apply.
Effective March 1, 2005 and thereafter, any employer that desires to cover all of its employees under Plan A shall pay an employer contribution rate for those additional employees sufficient to cover the projected cost of that Plan as detr-rmined by the coconsultants during the term of this Agreement
If an employee leaves the industry and returns without having gone 4 consecutive months with no hours reported they will resume their status relative to plan progressions that existed before they left. Similarly, any employee who returns from a layoff or leave of absence or reinstatement after termination will retain their former status regardless of the length of absence.	.
Any employee who is transferred by an Employer into the Las Vegas area shall have their status determined based on their original date of hire with the Employer.
C.	Employer Contributions:
Effective with hours worked in February 2005, payable in March 2005, the Employer agrees to contribute $3.00 for all classifications under the term of this Agreement This. rate shall remain effective through the term of this Agreement
Such contributions shall be made on the same basis as under the Las Vegas Retail Clerks Food Industry and Las Vegas Retail Meat Agreements, Effective February 6, 2001 through September 12,2004.
PENSION FUND
D.	Employer Contributions:
The Employers shall continue to contribute to the Retail Food Employers and United Food and Commercial Workers Local 711 Pension Trust Fund (the “Trust Funds” or “Funds”). Current participants in this Fund are referred to as CLERKS for purposes of this Memorandum. It is understood that the contributions required on behalf of any Employee shall not exceed forty (40) straight-time hours per week or 2080 straight-time hours per year.
CLERKS Contributions:
Effective with hours worked February 2005 the Employer agrees to contribute to the Trust Fund for the term of the Agreement based on the following rates:
a.	Seventy seven cents ($0.77) per straight-time hour for the first twelve months following the contribution effective date for CLERKS.
2
b.	Eighty two cents ($0.82) per straight-time hour for the thirteenth (13th) month through the twenty-fourth (24th) month following the contribution effective date for CLERKS.
c.	Eighty three cents ($0.83) per straight-time hour for the twenty-fifth (25th) month following the contribution effective date for CLERKS and thereafter.
MEAT CUTTER Contributions:
Effective with hours worked February 2005 the Employer agrees to contribute to the Intennountain Retail Food Industry Pension Trust Fund (until the participants in this Fund who are referred to as MEAT CUTTERS are moved to the CLERKS Fund, when at such time the contributions will go to CLERKS Fund) for the term of the Agreement based on the following rate increases over the current contribution rates:
a.	Nineteen cents ($0.19) per straight-time hour for the first twelve months following the contribution effective date for MEAT CUTTERS.
b.	A total of twenty four ($0.24) over the current contribution rates per straight-time hour for the thirteenth (13“) month through the twenty-fourth (24th) month following the contribution effective date for MEAT CUTTERS
c.	A total of twenty five cents ($0.25) over the current contribution rates per straight-time hour for the twenty-fifth (25th) month following the contribution effective date for MEAT CUTTERS and thereafter.
Such contributions shall be made on the same basis as under the Las Vegas Retail Clerks Food Industry and Las Vegas Retail Meat Agreements, effective February 6, 2001 through September 12,2004.
The seven (7) month deferral of contributions for accounting and actuarial purposes, first implemented for the Trust Fund’s 1999 fiscal year, continues to be in effect. However, if additional contributions are necessary in order to avoid Minimum Funding Standard deficiencies for a Plan Year that remain after benefits are modified in accordance with Section E below, the Employers may agree to accelerate all or a portion of one or more months of contributions which would have been attributable to the following Plan Year after taking into account the normal seven (7) month deferral for accounting and actuarial purposes. If such acceleration of contributions would result in a funding deficiency for the following Plan Year, a similar acceleration from the second subsequent Plan Year into the following Plan Year may be made to meet Minimum Funding Standards for that year. This general principal can also be used in later years, if necessary.
In lieu of accelerating contributions in the manner described above, the Employers may elect to make Supplemental Contributions (over and above negotiated contributions) in order to meet Minimum Funding Standards for a Plan Year that remain after benefits are modified in accordance with Section E below. Employers will then be permitted to
3
suspend contributions in one or more subsequent Plan Years to offset the Supplemental Contributions in whole or in part The suspensions will occur at the earliest possible time or times such that they would not cause a funding deficiency in the Plan Year of Suspension. The amount of the suspensions will be equal to the Supplemental Contributions. (See, however, the treatment of certain Supplemental Contributions described in Section G below.)
An employee shall receive both vesting and benefit accrual credit on the same basis as under the Las Vegas Retail Clerks Food Industry and Las Vegas Retail Meat Agreements, Effective February 6,2001 through September 12,2004.
E.	BENEFITS:
The Trustees are authorized and directed to modify benefits in accordance with the following provisions, and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement:
Effective March 1,2005, future benefit accrual rates for current CLERKS employees will be:
a.	For the first ten years of benefit credit the benefit accrual rate will be $33.15
b.	For all years of benefit credit after the first ten years the benefit accrual rate will be $44.20
c.	Other benefit accrual rates for lower contribution rates will be adjusted in a similar manner by the Trust Fund’s Co-Consultants
Effective March 1,2005, future benefit accrual rates for current MEAT CUTTERS employees will be 2.6% of contributions based on the contribution rate in effect the day prior to the ratification of this agreement :
The Board of Trustees is authorized and directed to provide the following schedule of benefits under the Pension Fund for those employees who are hired on or after ratification of this agreement (referred to as “New Hires’^:
a.	New Hires must be at least age 21 and have one year of service to meet the eligibility requirements for participation
b.	For New Hires, one year of service for eligibility purposes is defined to be at least
750 hours of service
c.	New Hires will be 100% vested after five years of service
4
d.	New Hires will not be eligible for the Rule of 85 retirement benefits
e.	New Hires normal retirement age will be age 65 with 5 years of service
f.	New Hires early retirement eligibility will be age 55 with 4 years of service
g.	New Hires who retire early (prior to age 65) will have their accrued benefits
reduced on an actuarial equivalence basis
h.	The applicable benefit accruals for CLERKS will be 40% of the current top benefit accrual rates as follows:
(1 .)For the first ten years of Benefit credit the benefit accrual rate shall be $20.40,
(2.)For all years of benefit credit after the first ten years the benefit accrual shall be $2720.
i.	The applicable benefit accruals for MEAT CUTTERS will be 1.6% of contributions based on the contribution rate in effect the day prior to the ratification of this agreement
The Trustees shall implement and maintain over time a pension plan design that can be supported by the contribution rates called for in this Agreement. The Trustees are further authorized and directed to make necessary amendments to avoid any funding deficiencies and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of any long term funding policy for the Trust Fundthat may be adopted by the Trustees.
The Trust Fund shall prepare and distribute an ERISA Section 204(h) notice, and any other required notices and filings, to Trust Fund participants in order to implement the above referenced changes by March 1,2005 (or as soon thereafter as legally permitted.
F.	APPLICATION FOR AMORTIZATION EXTENSIONS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 412(e) AND LONG TERM FUNDING POLICY
The Trustees (both for the CLERKS Fund and MEAT CUTTERS Funds) shall cause the Trust Funds to apply for an amortization extension under Internal Revenue Code § 412(e).
If the applications are approved, the Trustees will adopt the following long term funding policy.
Long Term Funding Policy
The co-consultants will produce along with the annual actuarial valuations, an actuarial projection for an additional six (6) years with the goal of identifying
5
possible future funding deficiencies (defined as where the. expected negotiated contributions are not enough to satisfy the expected minimum required contributions under Internal Revenue Code Section 412). These annual projections will be based on the following:
•	Projections will take into account only negotiated contributions except as noted below.
•	Using the assumptions and actuarial methods in the then current annual actuarial valuation as jointly agreed to by the Fund’s co-consultants
•	No unanticipated actuarial gains or losses during the projection time period
If the annual projection indicates any future funding deficiencies during the current plan year or the six (6) years of the projection, the Board of Trustees is authorized and directed to amend future benefit accruals (or any other nonprotected benefits), effective as soon as practicable, in order to eliminate all future funding deficiencies during the projection period.
In the event that the contributing Employers accelerate contributions or make Supplemental Contributions which entitle them to a future contribution suspension, the amount of contributions shifted or suspended shall be taken into . account in the projections in a manner to ensure that the employers receive a credit if they are required to make a contribution which is greater than the negotiated rate in order to meet minimum funding solely as a result of adverse actuarial experience and not as a result of any accelerated contribution beyond the 7-month shift. Any acceleration of Employer contributions beyond the normal 7-month shift will not be taken into consideration when preparing the annual projections required under this funding policy.
Any deadlocked Trustee motion relating to a reduction in benefits required under the long term funding policy shall be arbitrated on an expedited basis with the arbitration to take place no later than sixty (60) days following the Trust meeting in which the deadlock occurs."
If the applications for amortization extensions under Internal Revenue Code § 412(e) are not approved the Long Tenn Funding Policy above shall be modified to change the projection period from six (6) years to five (5) years, and shall be adopted by the Trustees.
G.	SPINOFF OF INTERMOUNTAIN RETAIL FOOD INDUSTRY PENSION TRUST AND PROJECTED PRE-SPENOFF FUNDING DEFICIENCIES
Subject to the approval of the Trustees of the receiving pension trust funds, the Trustees of the Intermountain Retail Food Industry Pension Trust (the’Tntermountain Plan”) shall cause a spin-off of the participants’ assets and liabilities of that Plan into the Local 711 Pension Trust ( as to current Participants who are currently covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements in Utah and Nevada), the Desert States Pension Trust (as to
6
current Participants who are currently covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements in Arizona) and the Intennountain Retail Stores Pension Trust or any other designated pension trust fund (as to current Participants who are currently covered by Collective Bargaining	Agreements	in	in
Montana and Idaho), respectively, effective no later than June 1, 2005, remitting in a short Plan Year for foe Trust
Allocation of assets to employees being spun-off shall generally be in proportion to the accrued liabilities of foe Intennountain Plan. However, assets attributable to employees on behalf of whom increased contributions were made pursuant to this Agreeement and prior to the spinoff shall receive all assets attributable to those increased contributions. Similarly employees of Employers that did not benefit from contribution suspensions to foe Intennountain'Plan for the full period which was originally negotiated, shall receive an additional asset allocation reflecting foe present value of the missed suspensions. The mechanics of foe asset allocations shall be determined by foe advisors to the plans in a manner consistent with foe intent of foe Parties to this Agreement, subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code governing mergers and spin-offs of pension plans.
It is projected that a funding deficiency will remain for foe Local 711 Pension Trust for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2004. As described in Section D, foe Employers will accelerate foe contributions usually made for August 2005 hours payable in September of 2005 (and if necessary September 2005 hours payable in October 2005) to the extent necessary to meet Minimum Funding Standards for the 2004 Plan Year. Should this acceleration cause a contribution deficiency for foe 2005 Plan Year, similar acceleration of contributions from the 2006 Plan Year to the 2005 Plan Year shall be made.
In foe event that foe application for extension of amortization periods under Section 412(e) for the Intennountain Plan is not approved, a funding deficiency is projected to remain for foe short Plan Year beginning 10/1/2004. if such deficiency would occur foe Employers will make a Supplemental Contribution (as described in Section D) to foe appropriate (Intennountain Plan (or, where applicable, to the relevant spin-off plans) after foe contemplated spin-off and no later than 8 J4 months after foe end of foe short Plan Year. The Employers agree that they will not seek reimbursement of these Supplemental Contributions from foe Trust funds through future suspensions. Any assets attributable to foe Supplemental Contributions shall be included in projections made under foe Long Term Funding Policy.
H.	OTHER COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS COVERING PARTICIPANTS IN THE LOCAL 711 PENSION TRUST AND THE INTERMOUNTAIN RETAIL FOOD INDUSTRY PENSION TRUST
The Parties agree that other Collective Bargaining Agreements which cover employees participating or entitled to participate in either the Local 711 Pension Trust or The Intennountain Plan and which expire after the ratification of the
7
Agreement shall have their Pension provisions modified in a manner identical to the provisions of this Agreement in all respects without further collective bargaining
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - JANUARY , 2004
INITIAL BENEFIT PLAN DESIGN SUMMARIES
The Bargaining Parties agree that the attached benefit plan designs identified as Benefit Fund Appendices A, B and C summarize the initial benefit plan designs that will become applicable to Active and Retired Employees for Plans A, B and C. 1
If the specified contribution is subsequently determined to be adequate to improve benefit levels (assuming the Plan will maintain prudent operating reserves), the trustees are authorized to improve benefits. Furthermore, if the specified employer contribution is subsequently determined to be insufficient to maintain the benefit levels outlined in Benefit Fund Appendices A, B and C and a prudent operating reserve, the Trustees are authorized and directed to reduce benefits to the extent necessary. Any such benefit modifications shall be rescinded by the Trustees, if and when, the financial position of the Fund improves to so allow. The Plan will cover all medically necessary treatment, subject to current plan exclusions.
Except for those changes described in, required by, or necessary to implement this Article, and subject to the right of the Trustees to amend, modify or eliminate any Plan benefit or feature at any time as provided herein, the existing Plan coverages shall initially be part of the new Plan design. This provision shall not be interpreted, applied or construed to: (a) create any expressed or implied obligation to maintain or preserve any benefit or plan feature under the Plan; (b) .create any vested entitlement to any benefit or feature under the Plan; or (c) limit or restrict, directly or indirectly, the right of the Trustees to make changes in those benefits or features when they deem it necessary or appropriate under the Plan and/or as a matter of fiduciary duty.
8
Annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits shall be reduced proportionately with the number of months remaining in the calendar year at the time the benefit changes are implemented for all Plans (including retirees).
