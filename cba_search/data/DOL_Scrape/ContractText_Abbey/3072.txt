The County agrees to provide the Union with a list of designated management representatives and keep such list updated.
4.3	Union Meeting Space Upon Union’s request, the County may provide meeting space outside working hours, provided such space is available and Union complies with all departmental rules and County policies. Request for use of facilities shall be made in advance to the Department Head, or designee, and will indicate the date, time, and general purpose of the meeting and facilities needed. Rest breaks and lunch periods are not to be considered within working hours for purpose of this Section (4.3).
4.4	Union Communications The County's interdepartmental messenger service may be used for individual business-oriented communication between employees who are represented by Union and between the paid staff of Union and such employees provided that paid staff of Union shall pick up and deliver all written communications outside the County's normal distribution route. Union understands that the continuance or discontinuance of the interdepartmental messenger service is a matter within the sole discretion of the County.
4.5	Union Bulletin Boards County will furnish adequate bulletin board space measuring no less than 36 x 48 inches. Bulletin boards shall be located in mutually acceptable areas and shall, when possible, be out of plain view of the public. The County shall install new bulletin boards in areas where the Union and the County agree that they are required, with the Union having the option to supply the bulletin boards or to reimburse the County for the cost of the board(s). All materials to be posted on said boards shall be in good taste and strictly impersonal in nature and limited to the legitimate business of the Union. Prior to posting, any material shall be plainly and legibly initialed by an authorized representative of the Union.
4.6	Union Employee Lists The County will provide the Union with a bi-weekly data run of all represented employees showing each employee's name, department and Section code, job classification, employee status, and the employee's home address and social security number. The Human Resources Director and the Union's General Manager may agree to reasonable modifications to the employee information to meet, if possible, the representational needs of the Union. The Union recognizes the legal right of each employee to the employee's privacy and agrees not to use any information obtained pursuant to this Memorandum, or to allow others to use the information for commercial gain, nor in a manner that would violate those rights. With respect to this promise, the Union agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the County of Sonoma, its officers, employees, and agents, from any claim, liability, or damage arising from the Union's breach of its duty under this Memorandum.

No Stewards may leave duty or work for purposes of union representation without the specific approval of the Stewards' supervisor or other authorized management official. Such release will not be capriciously or arbitrarily denied. The Union's request for release time shall not be made capriciously or arbitrarily and time demands on any one employee shall be within reasonable limits. The Union and the County agree that employee performance evaluation meetings which do not include a discussion of discipline will not create a right for Steward representation or assistance at the meeting.

The Union shall specify in the request whether the time to be used will be paid time or unpaid time.
The Union is authorized a total of 500 hours of paid release time each Fiscal Year except that the Union may roll over up to 200 hours of unused time each fiscal year.

In the event that an employee receives a 90-day notice under this Section (5.2), the County will continue to make a reasonable effort to place the affected employee in another available position(s) within the County for which the employee is qualified consistent with applicable Civil Service Rules and other related employment requirements. In return for the foregoing, the Union agrees the County is under no obligation under state law or the County Employee Relations Policy to meet and confer with the Union over either the decision to contract out bargaining unit work or the impact to represented employees resulting from such contracting out. During the 90-day notice period, the Union and the County agree to collaboratively discuss possible options/alternatives to mitigate negative impacts on represented employees.

11.4	Continuing Education - Leave
When a Continuing Education Course is offered during an employee's normal work schedule, the employee may be authorized continuing education leave. Such leave authorization shall be subject to the approval of the employee's appointing authority and must be directly related to the employee's present position, or career advancement within the present department. Approval of one course in a series does not automatically constitute approval for the entire series unless specifically authorized by the appointing authority. Approval or denial of leave will be provided to employees in writing in a timely manner. This provision will be applied as consistently as possible and will not be unreasonably denied.
Continuing Education leave shall be considered as time worked.
11.5	Inservice Training
11.5.1	Inservice Training - Program
The County shall make every effort to provide a program of inservice training for employees in the bargaining unit designed to maintain a high standard of performance and to increase the skills of employees in the bargaining unit. Training courses to be attended shall have a direct bearing on the work of the employee. Attendance at training courses may be authorized by the department head. Decisions by department heads on request by employees should be based on the following criteria: a) The effect the absence of the employee will have on the department's operations and its ability
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
40
to continue to provide the services and perform the functions for which it is responsible.
b) The relationship of the subject of the program, seminar, conference or workshop to the function performed by the employee and the department, and the employee's professional development.
11.5.2 Inservice Training - Payment
There are three ways the expenses of the program might be paid. By the County - Expenditures for travel, meals, lodging, registration and other items included annually within the department budget. By other public or private agencies - Occasionally, employees receive approval for their expenditures to be paid by grants from the State or Federal governments, from private organizations or from professional organizations. By the individual employee - Occasionally, the departmental budget may not permit trips to be paid by the County. The employee may feel that the trip would be of benefit to the employee's professional development, and therefore, would be willing to pay the expenses if the employee were permitted time off from work. Inservice training time shall be considered as regular hours worked. When more than one employee within a department requests to attend inservice training and it is not possible to grant attendance for all those employees who have made such a request, because of the criteria listed above, the department head shall establish an attendance list based on the priority order of: a)	Prior identified training needs.
b)	Prior attendance at similar courses.
c)	Seniority (continuous service) for purposes of this Subsection 11.5.2, seniority (continuous service) shall be defined as inservice hours from the date of appointment in the respective department.
11.5.3	Inservice Training - Agreement
When attendance of any one course extends over a period in excess of four (4) days, either consecutive or at regular intervals, and when an expenditure of $500 or more is required to cover expenses, then an employee shall be required to sign an agreement wherein the employee shall reimburse the County for costs of the training, including tuition, books, travel and living expenses paid by the County, if the employee leaves County employment within one (1) year after completion of the training course. If the employee leaves County employment between one and two years after completion of the training course, the employee will reimburse the County for one-half of the cost. An Inservice Training Agreement shall not be required where, against an employee's expressed desires, a department requires an employee to attend inservice training.
11.5.4	Inservice Training - Non-Arbitrability
Section 11.5 is not arbitrable.

12.8	Health Care - Employee/Retiree Health Plan
12.8.1	Health Plan - Retirees - Employed before January 1, 1990
a)	For employees hired before January 1, 1990, and continuously employed without a break in service before retirement (regardless of status in County employment), the County contributes to the cost of a health plan for its retirees and their dependents.
b)	Laid-Off & Restored Employees
Employees who were employed by the County prior to January 1, 1990, but who were laid off thereafter shall not be subject to the restrictions of Article 12.8.2 (Health Plan-Retirees -Employed after January 1, 1990), provided that they are subsequently restored to County employment and rejoin the County retirement system.
12.8.2	Health Plan Retirees - Employed after January 1, 1990
For any employee who is newly hired or rehired by the County or any other agency covered by this Memorandum after January 1, 1990, this benefit shall only be available upon the employee’s retirement under the following circumstances.
a)	Employed at least 10 years.
With respect to the retiree, he or she must have been employed with the County for a period of at least 10 years (consecutive or non-consecutive), which may include employment with the County prior to January 1, 1990, and must have been a contributing member (or a contribution was made on their behalf) of the County’s Retirement System for the same length of time. Upon meeting these two conditions, the County shall contribute for the retiree only the same amount towards a health plan premium as it contributes to an active single employee in the same manner and on the same basis as is done at the time for other retirees who were hired or rehired before January 1, 1990. The retiree may enroll eligible dependents in the group health plan covering the retiree, but the retiree is responsible for the total dependent(s) premium(s).
b)	Employed at least 20 years.
When such an employee has been employed (consecutive or non-consecutive) by the County for a period of at least 20 years, which may include employment with the County prior to January 1, 1990, and has been a contributing member (or a contribution was made on their behalf) of the County’s Retirement System for the same length of time the County shall also contribute for one dependent the same amount towards a health plan premium as it contributes to an active employee with one dependent in the same manner and on the same basis as is done at the time for other retirees who were hired or rehired before January 1, 1990. The retiree with 20 or more years of County service may enroll eligible dependents in the group plan covering the retiree, but the retiree is responsible for the total premium cost of more than one dependent.
c)	Contribution limit.
In no event shall employees hired or rehired after January 1, 1990 be entitled to receive greater contributions from the County for a health plan upon retirement than the County pays for
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
43
employees hired or rehired before January 1, 1990 upon their retirement.
12.8.3	Health Plan - Retirees - Surviving Dependent
Upon the death of an enrolled retiree who retired on or after June 29, 1999, the County will continue to pay the health plan premium contribution for the surviving dependent who was receiving the County contribution under Article 12.8.1 or 12.8.2.b.
12.9	Long-Term Disability
The County agrees to maintain Long-Term Disability Program as described in the plan document; the LTD Plan will include part-time employees (0.4 FTE minimum) and not require the exhaustion of an employee's sick leave before LTD benefits would be paid to an eligible employee. An employee who chooses to use sick leave after the 60th day of disability will not receive any LTD benefits until the employee stops using sick leave. Sick leave cannot supplement LTD benefits. The LTD plan would continue to be offset by any outside income, including any short-term disability plan the employee may have available. The waiting period for benefit eligibility will be 60 calendar days and the maximum benefit level will be $7,000 per month. The benefit for part-time employees will be 66-2/3% of the average base salary over the last 26 pay periods or the employee's most recent continuous County service, whichever is less. Effective 7/1/99, benefit duration will go to age 65 for both injury and illness. The cost of the LTD Program will be entirely paid by the County during the term of this Memorandum.
Upon request of the Union, the Auditor-Controller will make a good faith effort to integrate any sick leave requested by an employee who is eligible to receive benefits under the Union's short-term disability plan. The Union and its insurance carrier will cooperate fully with the Auditor-Controller. The Auditor-Controller, however, may conclude such an integration is unworkable or beyond the County's resources available for payroll maintenance activities.
12.10	Health, Dental, & Vision Benefits - LWOP or Unpaid Absence
If an employee is on an unpaid absence or goes on leave without pay, either of which reduces the employee's time in pay status to less than 50% of the employee's regular work schedule in a pay period, the County will cease to pay its normal benefit contributions. The employee must pay the total benefit premiums if the employee desires to continue any coverage. If an employee is on an unpaid absence or goes on leave without pay, either of which reduces the employee's time in pay status to no less than 50% of the employee's regular schedule in a pay period, the County will continue to pay its normal benefit contributions.
12.11	Health, Dental, & Vision Benefits - Medical or Pregnancy Disability
When an employee exhausts all but 40 hours of sick leave and goes on medical or pregnancy disability leave without pay, the County will make its normal contribution to the employee's health, dental, vision care, life insurance and LTD benefits for a period not to exceed 13 pay periods per disability. Beginning with the 14th pay period, the employee will be entitled to continued coverage by paying the full cost of the insurance premiums. Prior to the exhaustion of the 13 pay periods the County will provide reasonable notice of the employee's obligations regarding the opportunity to continue employee-paid benefits.
An employee who returns to work from medical or pregnancy disability leave without pay prior to the exhaustion of the 13 pay periods of entitlement under this Article, shall not have the 13 pay period entitlement reduced for any pay period in which the employee is in pay status for at least 50% of the employee’s allocated full-time equivalent as specified in this Section 12.11 (Medical or Pregnancy Disability Leave). If the employee returns to medical or pregnancy disability leave without pay for the same condition, the 13 pay period time frame will continue where it left off and will be reduced only
for those pay periods when the employee’s pay status hours fall below 50% of the allocated full-time equivalent. The County’s 13 pay period leave without pay benefit entitlement shall run concurrent with
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
44
FMLA/CFRA.
The employee's 18-month entitlement under COBRA law shall begin when FMLA has been exhausted and the employee goes on an unpaid leave which is less than 50% of the employee allocated hours. When an employee returns to work and has at least 50% of the employee’s allocated full-time equivalent in pay status in any pay period and subsequently goes out on Medical or Pregnancy Disability Leave, the 18-month COBRA time period starts over again. A new 18-month COBRA period begins again in the pay period in which the employee has a reduction of hours below 50% of the employee’s allocated full-time equivalent, as this would constitute a new qualifying event under COBRA.
12.12	Health, Dental, & Vision - Employee Obligation Continued Coverage
An employee who is entitled to continued benefit coverage as specified in Section 12.10 (County Contributions for Benefits During Unpaid Absence or Leave Without Pay) Subsection 16.11.1 (Education Stipend) and/or Section 12.11 (Medical or Pregnancy Disability Leave) above, must notify the Auditor-Controller no later than five (5) County business days after the first day of the leave of absence, of the employee's intent to continue insurance coverage. A Request for Leave Without Pay form signed by the employee and his/her appointing authority shall be forwarded to the Auditor-Controller's Office when leave is authorized.
To assure continued insurance coverage, premiums shall be paid by the employee to the Auditor-Controller's Office no later than the last day of the pay period. This premium provides coverage for the two-week period from the next pay date. If the employee fails to pay the premium by the last day of the pay period, he/she will receive one reminder notice. In order to reinstate coverage, the employee shall pay a $10.00 late charge in addition to the premium amount by the date specified in the reminder notice.
Only one reminder notice will be sent. If the employee fails to make proper payment to the Auditor-Controller by the end of the second pay period, the employee's continued health, dental, vision, life insurance and LTD coverage shall be terminated. Under no circumstances will the County be obligated to pay premiums for dependent coverage under Sections 12.10 and 12.11.
12.13	Health, Dental, & Vision Benefits - Part-Time Employees
Part-time employees shall be eligible to participate in the health benefit programs and/or the dental program on a prorata basis. Part-time employees shall be covered by the Vision Plan. Proration for health, dental and vision plans shall be based on whichever of the following is greater: the employee’s FTE (full-time equivalent) or the number of pay status hours in the pay period, excluding overtime (except when paid as regular hours per article 7.25). For pay periods with no pay status hours, proration shall be based on the employee’s FTE or the average pay status hours in the 6 pay periods preceding the first day of leave without pay, whichever is greater. Election to participate in the health and dental programs shall be made during the first full pay period of employment. In addition, part-time employees may utilize the procedures specified in Section 12.7 (Participation) above. Any part-time employee and their dependents, who, on June 29, 1987, were being provided with the same insurance benefits as full-time employees, will continue to receive full-time benefits throughout the term of this Memorandum. Part-time employees shall be entitled to participate in long-term disability as specified in Section 12.9 (Long-Term Disability).
12.14	Temporary Disability Indemnity - Supplementing with Paid Leaves
An employee not entitled to the benefits of Labor Code Section 4850 who is absent from work by reasons of industrial injury compensable by temporary disability indemnity shall supplement such compensation with enough paid leaves to increase his/her gross earnings to equal his/her regular biweekly base salary as follows:
■	All sick leave shall be taken until the remaining sick leave balance is 40 hours or less.
■	Once the sick leave balance is 40 hours or less, the employee may elect to supplement by taking any combination of the remaining sick leave, vacation, and or compensatory time off up to his/her base salary.
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
45
Employees whose sick leave balance is 40 hours or less may also elect not to supplement at all.
An employee shall accrue vacation leave and sick leave only during such portion of absence from work due to industrial injury for which the employee uses previously earned vacation leave, sick leave or compensatory time off.
12.15
Life Insurance
The County shall continue, at no expense to the employee, a term-life insurance plan in the amount of $10,000 for full-time and part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work 60 hours or more per pay period. The life insurance coverage for employees in the supervisory bargaining unit will increase to one (1) times their annual base salary effective 9/11/02. Each eligible and enrolled employee may purchase through payroll deduction dependent coverage of $5,000 for each eligible dependent. Details of coverage shall be as specified in the insurance contract.
Eligible employees may purchase additional life insurance coverage for themselves at their own expense during the annual open enrollment periods specified in Section 12.7 (Participation). The employee may purchase supplemental coverage in increments one times (1X) to 4 times (4X) the basic coverage to a maximum of $500,000, in accordance with the insurance contract. If less than 40% of eligible employees purchase supplemental coverage, then health evidence of insurability will be required of all employees purchasing supplemental benefits. An employee enrolled in supplemental coverage who moves from one age bracket to the next higher bracket will have to pay the rate of the higher age bracket beginning the January of the year in which the employee moves to the higher age bracket.
12.16
Malpractice Coverage
All employees of the County who are engaged in patient care and covered by the County's malpractice coverage shall continue to be covered for activities falling within the scope of their employment. Criminal or fraudulent conduct by the employee within the scope of their employment is specifically excluded. If the County should discontinue the malpractice coverage, the County agrees to meet and confer with the Union. This Section 12.16 is neither grievable nor arbitrable.
12.17
Salary Enhancement Plans
All employees who belong to the retirement system shall have their wages adjusted according to Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code which has the effect of deferring Federal and State income taxes on the employee's retirement contributions.
The County shall continue, under IRS Code Section 125, a Health Care Premium Conversion Plan to allow eligible employees to make their required contributions towards health care premiums with pre-tax dollars through payroll deduction. Benefits eligible for this diversion are premium contributions towards group health, dental and vision.
The County shall continue to offer under IRS Code Section 105, a Health Care Reimbursement Account to enable eligible employees to set aside pre-tax dollars for reimbursement of employee's medical expenses not reimbursed or covered under health, dental and vision insurance plans. Such expenses include deductible, co-pays, and qualified medical expenses not reimbursed by the employee's health insurance plan. The County will continue the Child and Dependent Care Assistance Plan under IRS Code Section 129 it began with the Union's assistance in 1989.
All of these deferral plans will be set up and/or administered by the County in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws and, as such, will not be subject to Article 20 (Grievance Procedure) of the Memorandum.

An extra-help employee who is covered by the health plan who fails to work at least 20 hours in any pay period will be eligible to continue the health coverage by paying the full amount of the premiums by payroll deduction if sufficient funds are available, or through COBRA if insufficient funds are available to cover the full cost of the premiums.
Employees who lose coverage due to pay period(s) with insufficient hours worked shall regain coverage on the first pay date following a period with at least 20 hours worked.
The County reserves the right to cancel an employee’s active coverage if an employee loses coverage more than twice in any 13 consecutive pay periods, or a similar frequency that is determined to be an administrative burden. An employee canceled under this section shall be eligible to elect COBRA continuation of coverage. If canceled under this section, an employee wishing to reactivate coverage must file new enrollment forms and must work at least 40 hours a pay period for 4 consecutive pay periods.
12.20.5	Health Benefits - Extra-Help Employees: Dependent Coverage
Covered employees may purchase dependent coverage for eligible dependents at their own expense through pre-tax payroll deduction as allowed by IRS code sect. 125.
12.20.6	Health Benefits - Extra-Help Employees: Enrollment
Approximately 45 days prior to the anticipated eligibility date, the County shall provide enrollment materials to the employee. The employee then has 30 days to complete and submit the enrollment forms. If coverage is waived upon initial eligibility, election to participate in the health plan can only be made during an annual open enrollment period designated by the County or as required by law.
12.20.7	Health Benefits - Extra Help Employees: FMLA/CFRA
Eligible extra-help employees who are off work on an FMLA or CFRA qualifying leave shall receive a County contribution toward health insurance equal to the average amount received in the two pay periods immediately preceding the first pay period of eligible leave. Employees must pay their share of the health benefits in order to maintain coverage and to continue to be eligible for a County contribution. Employees must file an Extra Help CFRA/FMLA Leave form along with appropriate medical documentation with their department. The approved leave form signed by the employee and his/her appointing authority shall be forwarded to the Auditor-Controller’s office.
An employee who is eligible for this continued benefit shall notify the Auditor-Controller’s payroll division of the employee’s intent to continue insurance coverage no later than five (5) County business days after the first day of the leave.
To ensure continued insurance coverage, premiums shall be paid by the employee to the AuditorController’s office no later than the last day of the pay period. This premium provides coverage for the
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
48
two-week period beginning on the next pay date. If the employee fails to pay the premium by the last day of the pay period, he/she will receive one reminder notice. In order to reinstate coverage, the employee shall pay a $10.00 late charge in addition to the premium amount by the date specified in the reminder notice. Only one reminder notice will be sent. If the employee fails to make proper payment by the end of the second pay period, the employee’s continued health insurance shall be terminated.
The employee will not regain eligibility until he or she has worked four (4) consecutive pay periods with 40 or more hours worked in each. Under no circumstances will the County be obligated to pay premiums for dependent coverage.
12.20.8	Health Benefits - Extra-Help Employees: Review of Benefit Administration Issues
The County and the Union agree to meet and confer in committee:
a)	to discuss any issues that may arise during initial implementation, for example computer software programming, that may require modification of the eligibility rules; and
b)	to review the effects of these eligibility rules on administration of the Plan and discuss any administrative issues that have arisen during the first eighteen (18) months of the Plan in an effort to implement any mutually agreed upon changes as soon as practical.
12.20.9 Health Benefits - Extra-Help Employees: Plan Adoption Process
After approval of this MOU and the receipt of the appropriate premium information from the Trust, the County and the Union will meet and agree to the acceptability of the plan options and premium costs that will be included in the election. The Union will then, within three (3) months, conduct an election of the extra-help members on the agreed upon options for coverage. Premium quotes have been requested from the Trust based on three (3) levels of co-pay, each with and without optical coverage. The election will be a form of preferential voting to determine the option with the greatest preference.
Option	Office Copay	Rx Co-pay	Optical

The County will continue to provide insurance benefits at group rates plus 2% as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1986, including any applicable subsequent amendments or revisions where applicable. In the event this Act is rendered inapplicable to the County, either by legislative or judicial action, the County shall, from the effective date of such action, not follow its provisions.
12.22	Long-Term Care - Payroll Deduction
The County agrees that represented employees may purchase CalPERS Long Term Care Insurance at their own expense through bi-weekly payroll deduction as long as the County is eligible to participate in the CalPERS payroll deduction program.
Each employee is responsible to submit his/her own application and any subsequent membership changes directly to CalPERS, as CalPERS Long Term Care is not a County program or under County direction. CalPERS may directly invoice employees for missed payroll deductions or premiums due prior to start-up of payroll deduction. Implementation of the payroll deduction program will occur no later than the pay date of September 25, 2002.

This holiday pay shall not exceed 8 hours for each holiday nor, for a part-time employee, be less than 3.2 hours for each holiday in the pay period. “Ongoing work schedule” for purposes of this Section shall mean an average of the two pay periods immediately preceding the holiday. Upon approval of the appointing authority, a part-time employee may elect to accrue compensatory time in lieu of holiday pay only when the holiday pay status creates hours in excess of the employee’s regular allocated full-time equivalent. Holiday accrued as compensatory time will not count as inservice nor affect the accruals or proration of benefits until used in a later pay period.
13.7	Holidays - Extra-Help Employees Extra-help employees are not covered by this Article 13 except for the provisions of Subsection 13.5.2 above.
13.8	Holidays - Reopener Effective 7/23/02, six (6) additional floating holiday hours were added for represented full-time employees (pro-rated for part-time employees) to bring holiday hours to the average of comparison counties.

16.10	Family & Medical Leave Each eligible employee is entitled to Family and Medical Leave as provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), as amended. The leaves under FMLA and CFRA run concurrently as provided by law. A full-time or part-time employee with more than 12 months of County service and at least one thousand two hundred and fifty (1,250) hours-actually worked during the previous 12 month period may request up to 12 weeks of Family and Medical Leave within a 12 month period. In some circumstances, an extra-help employee may be eligible for Family and Medical Leave. Reason for the Family and Medical Leave may be the birth or adoption of a child or the placement of a foster child (within one year of the event) or the serious health condition of a child, spouse, parent, or the employee’s own serious health condition. Child is defined as a biological, adopted or foster child, stepchild, legal ward or child of a person standing in loco parentis who is under 18 years of age or an adult dependent child. Spouse is defined as a partner in marriage as defined in Civil Code Section 4100. Parent is defined as a biological, foster or adoptive parent, stepparent or legal guardian (does not include a parent-in-law). If both parents are County employees, the aggregate Family Leave may be limited to 12 work weeks during any 12 month period. This limitation does not apply to leave taken by one spouse to care for the other, to care for a seriously ill child or for the employee's own serious health condition. Under those circumstances, each of the employees would be entitled to 12 weeks of Family and Medical Leave. The appointing authority may grant such Leave Without Pay which qualifies as FMLA/CFRA Leave in addition to the paid sick leave provided for in Article 15 upon submission of reasonable documentation. If the employee requests a paid or unpaid leave of absence for any reason which qualifies under CFRA/FMLA, the County shall designate that the requested leave of absence run concurrently with the employee’s CRFA/FMLA entitlement. Prior to going on Leave Without Pay, which qualifies under CFRA/FMLA, an employee may be
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
58
required to use certain accrued paid leave time. Please refer to Section 16.1 for the specific requirements.
The County shall continue its contribution towards the health plan premium for up to 12 workweeks of the leave. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the use of medical or pregnancy disability leave in Section 12.11 when the employee is medically incapacitated or disabled. If an employee does not qualify for continued benefits under this Section 16.10 or Section 12.11 (Medical or Pregnancy Disability Leave) and the employee wishes to continue benefit coverage, then Section 12.10 (County Contributions for Benefits During Unpaid Absence or Leave Without Pay) applies.
If the event necessitating Family and Medical Leave becomes known to the employee more than 30 calendar days prior to the employee's need for the leave, the employee shall provide 30 days written advance notice to the appointing authority. If the event becomes known to the employee less than 30 days prior to the employee's need for a leave, the employee shall provide as much written advance notice as possible, and, at a minimum, a written notice no less than five (5) working days from learning of the event. If the event necessitating the leave is an emergency or is otherwise unforeseeable, the employee shall provide as much written advance notice as possible. If the leave is for a planned medical treatment, the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment to avoid disruption of departmental operations.
This provision shall be interpreted as the legal minimum Family and Medical Leave available to eligible employees. The appointing authority may grant additional leave without pay under this Section (16.10) provided it is consistent with the applicable provisions of the Sonoma County Civil Service Rules, County leave policies, Section 16.1, and other provisions of this memorandum.

Both parties understand that state law requires that the 3% at 60 benefit be implemented for all general members on the same date.
On the above date, SEIU-represented SCERA members will begin contributing an additional 3.03% pretax to their employee retirement account. This contribution will continue for twenty (20) years (until July 2024) to pay for the unfunded accrued actuarial liability resulting from any past service.

ARTICLE 25	- AGENCY SHOP SERVICE FEE
25.1	Union - Fair and Equal Representation
It is recognized that the Union must provide fair and equal representation to all employees in all represented classes without regard to Union membership or non-membership.
25.2	Agency Shop - Service Fee
As a condition of employment, all represented employees (except those in the Supervisory Bargaining Unit) must be members or service fee payers of the Union. If any employee does not voluntarily make application for membership or service fee status within 45 days of the effective date of this section or within 45 days of beginning work, whichever is later, the County shall enroll the employee as a service fee payer automatically and by default. The County shall deduct the service fee from the employee’s paycheck.
Payroll deductions shall be made bi-weekly. However, the initial deduction for any employee shall not begin unless either a voluntary authorization for deduction of Union dues or a service fee has been properly executed or the 45-day application period for considering voluntary enrollment has expired. Changes in the amount of the monthly membership dues must be delivered to the AuditorController, Payroll Division, at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the last pay day of the calendar month prior to the change becoming effective.
A represented employee may revoke his/her voluntary authorization for deduction of Union dues only as provided in Article 26 (Maintenance of Membership) of this contract. Any non-supervisory represented employee who revokes his/her voluntary authorization for membership shall be immediately enrolled as a service fee payer. All sums deducted by the County shall be remitted to the Union at an address given to the County by the Union, by the tenth (10) calendar day following the pay period when the deductions were made, together with a list of names and the amount deducted for each employee for whom a deduction was made. The County will also notify the Union of the name of each employee who revokes his “Voluntary Authorization for Deduction of Union Dues.” This does not apply to “Special Assessments or penalties” levied by the Union that are over and above the regular paid dues.
The County shall not be liable to the Union by reason of the requirements of this Article for the remittance or payment of any sum other than that constituting actual deductions made from the pay earned by the employees. In addition, the Union shall indemnify and hold the County harmless from any liability resulting from any and all claims, demands, suits or any other action arising from
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
79
	compliance with this Article or in reliance on any list, notice, certification or authorization furnished under this Article.
25.3	Agency Shop - Religious Exemption Any employee who is a member of a religious organization whose traditional tenets or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to join or financially support the Union. Such employee(s) shall execute a written declaration that the employee is a member of a bona fide religion, body or sect which holds a conscientious objection to joining or financially supporting any public employee organization as a condition of employment. Such employee(s) shall pay, in lieu of a service fee a sum equal to such fee to a non-religious, nonlabor charitable fund(s) exempt from taxation, chosen by the employee from those charities listed with the charitable federations that participate in the County’s combined fund drive.
25.4	Agency Shop - Separation from Unit - Exception The provisions of Section 25.2 above shall not apply during periods of separation from the eligible bargaining unit by any employee otherwise subject to that Article but shall reapply to such employee following the first full pay period following the return of the employee to the bargaining unit. The term "separation" includes layoffs, transfer out of the covered bargaining units by request, promotion, demotion, reclassification or for any other lawful reason, and leaves of absence of a duration of more than one (1) full pay period, whether paid or unpaid and for any reason, including disability.
25.5	Agency Shop - Chargeable Costs To the extent authorized by law, the costs of its collective bargaining activities shall be considered by the Union when making a determination of the amount of the agency shop service fee authorized by this Article. Examples of chargeable costs include but are not limited to (1) expenditures for labor contract negotiations (e.g., the fees and expenses of the Union representative and staff support, including research of and preparation for negotiating matters within the scope of representation); and (2) expenditures for administration of contracts (e.g., meetings and discussions with management concerning grievances under the contracts, meetings with employees as part of grievance resolutions, and costs of representatives for arbitrations and staff support including research and preparation).
25.6	Agency Shop - Non-Chargeable Costs Currently, the following activities are not included in the calculation or determination of the agency shop service fee: a)	lobbying or other political activity except as authorized by law; b)	payments to affiliates, except for chargeable costs as authorized by law; c)	social activities except as authorized by law; d)	charitable and philanthropic activities; e)	insurance and other benefit programs except as authorized by law; and f)	any cost that, by law, cannot be included in a agency shop service fee.
25.7	Agency Shop - Advance Reduction of Service Fee No agency shop service fee shall be collected from any employee until non-chargeable costs have been deducted from its amount.
25.8	Agency Shop - Notice of Service Fee All enrolled service fee payers shall receive annual written notice sent by certified mail from the Union, which includes legally adequate audited information concerning the breakdown of "chargeable" and "non-chargeable" expenses, a reasonably prompt opportunity as provided below to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decision-maker, and an escrow shall be set up by the Union for the amounts reasonably in dispute while such challenges are pending. Specifically, such notice shall, at a minimum, include: a) An accounting report prepared, signed and verified by an independent auditor, who is a
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
80
certified public accountant, for the overall purpose of providing an itemization of the expenditures of the Union in detail necessary for an employee reasonably to be able to determine what the Union spends on both chargeable items and non-chargeable items, and consider whether expenses designated as chargeable are related to the Union's collective bargaining functions. However, this requirement can be met without requiring or allowing non-members or the County to become the Union's auditors. The accounting will utilize data from the prior fiscal year. At a minimum, this accounting report must:
(1)	state the amount of the agency shop service fee and provide an overview of how the accounting reports were translated into calculation of this fee;
(2)	disclose the Union's major categories of expenses, including employee compensation, specifying the actual expenditures within each category and the amount spent in each expenditure for chargeable items and non-chargeable items;
(3)	each major category and the allocations of expenditures therein for chargeable and non-chargeable expenses must be verified by the Auditor;
(3)	disclose what percentage of total Union expenditures is allocable to chargeable items and what percentage is allocable to non-chargeable items;
(4)	state the total sum of money the Union pays affiliates and demonstrate what percentage of such money is used for chargeable and what percentage is used for non-chargeable activities;
(5)	disclose what percentage of regular membership dues is allocable to chargeable items and what percentage is allocable to non-chargeable items and, consequently, what percentage of dues will be collected as the agency shop service fee;
(6)	explain the methodology used in producing this accounting report.
To enable the independent auditor to prepare the accounting report, the Union shall provide the auditor access to all records reasonably necessary for such a preparation, including a record of the employee's activities in sufficient detail to enable the auditor to make the necessary determinations of chargeable or non-chargeable. In the event that payments are made to any other organization, the auditor shall be provided access either to such organizations' records or relevant audited financial statements when reasonably necessary to prepare the above accounting.
b) Instructions on filing a challenge to the amount of the agency shop service fee with the Union, which, at a minimum, shall provide as follows:
(1)	non-members who wish to challenge collection of the agency shop service fee
because the amount identified allegedly contains expenditures for non-chargeable activities must file an objection letter with the Union within 30 calendar days of receipt of notice (notice shall be rebuttably presumed to have been received no later than five (5) calendar days after it is postmarked). A non-member may file a letter by presenting it to the Union business office in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The non-member shall provide a copy of the letter to the County's Employee Relations Manager within three (3) calendar days of its filing with the Union;
(2)	the letter shall be signed by the challenger or the challenger's agent under penalty of perjury and must state with specificity the particular expenditures being challenged, and the grounds for such challenge. The letter must contain the name and mailing address of the challenger;
(3)	during the pendency of the challenge, the amount of the agency shop service fee reasonably in dispute shall be placed in an escrow account established by the Union;
(4)	within 30 calendar days after receipt, the Union shall schedule a date for arbitration, which shall be conducted in accordance with procedures established by American Arbitration Association. Pending the commencement of arbitration, the Union and the challenger may, by mutual agreement, attempt to resolve the dispute informally;
(5)	the arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the procedures of the American
2002-2008 COUNTY/SEIU MOU
81
Arbitration Association;
(6)	the Union shall have the burden of proving that the fee amount complies with this Article and applicable law; and
(7)	The costs of the arbitrator and court reporter, if any, shall be borne entirely by the Union. The challenging employee shall be responsible for his/her costs including but not limited to attorney fees and copies of the court reporter's original transcript.

25.9.1	Agency Shop - Acknowledgment Obligations

Nothing in this Article or any other, however, relieves the Union of taking whatever additional action may legally be required to protect the constitutional rights of employees who are subject to an agency shop service fee under this Article. The Union also acknowledges that the law in this area is constantly evolving, and therefore, recognizes that it has an ongoing obligation to monitor relevant legal developments, including the case law on this subject, and to adapt its conduct in implementing this Article as required. The Union also recognizes that it is foreseeable that the employees subject to the agency shop service fee may suffer damages if this Article is not carried out in accordance with the First Amendment.

b)	Union Stewards shall be authorized to receive the names and addresses of new employees each pay period from the departmental payroll clerk.
c)	The names and addresses provided the Union shall be kept confidential.
25.12	Agency Shop - Indemnification

This Section shall be in addition to any other remedy available to the County under this contract or provision of law.

25.14	Agency Shop - Recordkeeping and Reporting
The Union shall comply with the financial record-keeping and reporting requirements of Government Code Section 3502.5(d) or its successor provision.
25.15	Agency Shop - Violation of Article 25
If a court finds the implementation of this Article in violation of constitutional law, the Union shall have 60 days to comply with the Court's order or the County may thereafter cancel Article 25. In the interim, all collections of agency shop service fees by way of payroll deductions by the County shall be suspended, except as allowed by the Court. Also except as allowed by the Court, no unpaid agency shop fee that would otherwise have been due during the time such violation existed may be collected retroactively after the violation was corrected.
25.16	Agency Shop - Non-Arbitrability of
Except as provided below, Article 25 shall be grievable and arbitrable under Article 20 of this agreement.
The following are not grievable nor arbitrable under this agreement:
a)	the adequacy of the Union's notice required by Section 25.8 above; and/or
b)	other issues bearing on the constitutionality of the Union's collection of an agency shop service fee as prescribed by the courts.
Disputes regarding the amount of the agency shop service fee shall be arbitrable under this memorandum but only pursuant to Section 25.8 above.
ARTICLE 26	- MAINTENANCE OF MEMBERSHIP
On the date this agreement is executed, all Union members who had Union deduction authorizations on file with the Auditor-Controller or the Union, or who may thereafter authorize in writing the deduction of their Union dues, shall remain on payroll deduction for the term of this Memorandum or so long as they are members of the representative units. Union members may terminate payroll deductions of dues at the expiration of this Memorandum by giving written notice to the Union during a one-month period between 90 and 60 days prior to the expiration of the term. The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the County, its officers, agents and employees from any claim, liability or damage arising from this provision.

DOMESTIC PARTNER DEFINED
The term "domestic partner" as used in the MOU is based on the definition below:
A "domestic partnership" shall exist between two persons, one of whom is an employee of the County, covered by this Memorandum of Understanding, regardless of their gender and each of them shall be the "domestic partner" of the other if they both complete, sign, and cause to be filed with the County an "Affidavit of Domestic Partnership" attesting to the following:
a.	the two parties reside together and share the common necessities of life;
b.	the two parties are not married to anyone, eighteen years or older, not related by blood
closer than would bar marriage in the State of California, and mentally competent to consent to contract and are not acting under fraud or duress;
c.	the two parties declare that they are each other’s sole domestic partner and they are responsible for their common welfare;
d.	the two parties agree to notify the County in writing if there is a change of circumstances attested to the affidavit; and
e.	the two parties affirm, under penalty of perjury, that the assertions in the affidavit are true to the best of their knowledge.
Termination. A member of a domestic partnership may provide notice of the end of said relationship by filing a statement with the County. In the statement, the person filing must affirm, under penalty of perjury, that 1) the partnership is terminated and 2) a copy of the termination statement has been mailed to the other partner.
New Statements of Domestic Partnership. No person who has filed an affidavit of domestic partnership may file another such affidavit until six months after a statement of termination of the previous partnership has been filed with the County. This requirement does not apply if the earlier domestic partnership ended because of the death of either partner.
