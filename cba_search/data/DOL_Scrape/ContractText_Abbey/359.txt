Language Issues
•	Limit Transfers to New Plant
See Page 6 for tranfer language.
•	* There will be no attempt by the Company in the 2005 negotiations to remove current provisions for paid Personal Days (two) and/or Vacation allotment and compensation
- percentage for current employees (hired prior to January 1, 1999).
• Mandatory Flex - New Plant
Flex Pay is $.30 per hour

Transfers
Opening for all classification in the new Plant #2 will be filled per current contract language with the following exceptions:
•	For the first twelve (12) months (Phase I), first six (6) months (Phase II) the openings will be filled by seniority from the transfer file by the most senior, employee who is previously qualified in the classification to which they are requestirfg the transfer.
•	Employees accepting transfers will be moved as soon as possible to not interrupt production, but in no event longer than four weeks (unless mutually agreed upon).
•	For a rolling period of six (6) months after start up of each phase no classification will be required to allow more than fifty percent of their current work force to transfer to the new plant.
•	Transfers to the new plant will be charged to the employee at the time of acceptance. The twelve month time frame for transfers will not start until actual date of move. It is our intention that we will fill openings well in advance of the plant opening to assure that we can replace all employees requesting transfers in a timely and efficient manner.
Transfer language will revert back to current contract two years after start date (estimated July, 2002)
