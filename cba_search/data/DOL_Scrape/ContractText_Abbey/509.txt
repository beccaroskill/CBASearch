This Memorandum;of Understanding is entered into between The Peoples Gas Light-and Coke Company (the "Company11) and Gas WorkersUnion, Local 18007, S.E.I.U., AFL-CIO (the"Union*1), for the purpose of setting .forth the terms and conditions under which a workforce reduction will be accomplished .among, the clerical staff at Central District Shop (herein called "Clerks"). These terms and conditions are as follows: <■	.	. r- •.	’ ■
1.	Promptly upon determining that an employee will be displaced because of this reduction in the. Gential District Shop Clerical workforce, the.Company will give the employee written notice of such determination. From the date of the notice, the employee will continue on the active;payroll for an additional eight-week period. During this period, the Company may relieve the employee from his/her duties so that the.employee may attend to career transition issues.
2.	The parties recognize.that the Company has the right to change the method of
performing the clerical workcurrently per-ormed by the Clerks at Central District Shop. Pursuanl.to this right, the Company will reassign the duties currently performed by the Clerks to management personnel or to non-bargaining unit office clerical personnel and will phase cut the clerical workforce at Central
. District Shop. Nothing in the new basic collective.bargaining agreement will be construed to prevent the foregoing reassignment of duties and elimination of the Central District Shop clerical workforce.
3.	The Clerks will not be allowed to exercise their seniority under Article VII of the new basic-collective bargaining agreement to displace clerical employees in the Meter Testing and Repair Department, or to displace any other bargaining unit employee. However, the Company will commit to find suitable entry level bargaining unit positions for displaced Clerks and, in addition, to consider displaced Clerks for open non- bargaining unit positions. Among the nonbargaining unit positions for which the displaced Clerks will be considered are sixteen Account Representative I-positions expected to be filled prior to August 1, 2001.	. • . •	.
If more than one displaced Clerk is found to be eligible for an open position, preference will be given to the Clerk with the greatest length of service in the . bargaining unit. A displaced Clerk who is offered an open position must accept it by the end of the third working day following the offer; otherwise, the Clerk will be regarded as having rejected the offer.;	. :	■	.
'The displaced Clark will have a ninety (90) day period to determine his/her su liability >for the new job. The displaced Clerk maintains his/her right to career transition benefits under Paragraphs 5 and 6 during this ninety (90) day period. Displaced Clerks who accept a position outside the bargaining unit shall be subject to the same requirements, and shall enjoy the same rights and remedies, as other employees in the same position.
A displaced Clerk who elects to transfer to one of the entry-level bargaining unit jobs offered by the-Cornparty will; upon-completing the ninety (90) day period provided for above and. continuing his/ber employment in such job,, be paid the rate of pay which he/she would have received if he/she had remained in the job held on April 30, 2001, including lhe annual increases provided for in the new . basic collective bargaining agreement, With the first annual increase retroactive to May 1; 2001. A displaced Clerk who-elects to transfer to an open non-
. bargaining unit job offered by the Company will have his/her rate of pay frozenat the April 30,2001 level if such rate of pay Is higher than the?current rate of the new job, and this rate of pay will remain frozen until the rate of the new job exceeds the frozen rate.
;	‘.i _■ ■:	ns	■
The'obligation undertaken bythe Gom[5any under this Paragraph 3 to find suitable positions for displaced'Clerks'will cease whenthe last Clerk is released under Paragraph s below or August 1, 2001; whicheverpccurs first.
4.	As the clerical work force-at Central District Shop is phased out, the Company will lay off the Clerks in order of their length of service in the bargaining unit (lowest to highest), provided the remaining Clerks must have the ability to perform the remaining work. During the phase-out period, the Clerks still actively employed will be covered by the new basic collective bargaining agreement to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding. Their salary will be the same salary that they were receiving on April 30, 2001 .with no general wage increase under the new co.'lective bargaining agreement.	■	<	'
5.	The Company will offer all Clerks the opportunity to receive career transition benefits described on Exhibit A, attached, provided that a Clerk’s receipt of these = benefits (other than outplacement assistance) iscontingent upon his/her signing

* position under Paragraph 3 above.	..	•
6.	-.-:' The Company wilLoffer four Clerks (Rosemary Domanchuk, Joseph Wynkes, Jr., . Glyden Hernandez, and Freddie tee) a special opportunity to retire eariy with a pension.

Exhibit Q
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING METER SHOP WORKFORCE REDUCTION :
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into between The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company (the "Company") and Gas Workers Union, Local 18007, S.E.LU., AFL-CIO (the "Union”), for the purpose of setting forth the terms and conditions under which workforce reductions will be accomplished in the Meter Repair'Group of the Meter Testing and Repair Department (herein referred to as the "Meter Shop"). These terms and conditions are as follows:	.
,1.	The parties recognize that the Company has the right to change the nature of its
' operations involving the purchase, testing and repair of meters and, in connection with
such changes, to reduce the Meter Shop workforce, currently consisting of Master Meter Mechanics; Meter Technicians; Meter Handlers; Chauffeur, Truck; Meter Provers; and Laborers. Pursuant to this right, the Company will make the changes :	described in Paragraph 2, below.	J ‘
■ ■ . ■ . * - > -
2.	The following complement of employees in the Meter Shop will be. effective as follows:
Classification	Effective 07/01/01	Effective 10/01/01
Master Meter Mechanic	2	2
Meter Mechanic	2 ■	1
Meter Prover	3" " “	'	2
Laborer	7 .	5
The classifications of Meter Handler and Chauffeur, Truck are eliminated, and the title of the Meter Technician classification is changed to Meter Mechanic,
3.	July 1,2001, and October 1,2001, are the earliest dates that the foregoing complements of employees will be effective. The Company shall have the right to defer the workforce reduction, in whole or part, based on the operating requirements of the Meter Shop.	'	' 1	■' '
4.	To the extent that the foregoing reduction in the complement requires demotions of Meter Shop employees and displacement of other Meter Shop employees from the Meter Shop, such demotions and displacement will be effected based on length of service in the Meter Shop (herein referred to as “departmental seniority”). Exhibit A, attached, which shows the names of Meter Shop employees and their anticipated status as of July 1, 2001 and October 1,2001, is understood by the parties to reflect a correct application of this Paragraph 3, assuming that the most senior Meter Shop employees choose to remain in the Meter Shop.
5.	All Meter Shop employees will continue to receive the hourly rate of pay which they were receiving on April 30,2001, until approximately July 1,2001. A Meter Shop employee who is regressed by approximately July 1,2001, in connection with the workforce reduction described above will have his/her rate of pay frozen at the April 30,2001 amount until the appropriate rate equal or exceeds the frozen rate; however,
; such employee will receive the one-lime lump sum payment provided for in Part A, . Paragraph 2 of the Company’s Memorandum-of Offer of April. 30; 2001 To Be Effective May 1,2001 * A Meter Shop employee.who is not regressed by. approximately July 1, 2001, will receive a general increase based on the applicable hourly rate of pay bracket in the Company's Memorandum of Offer of April 30,2001 To Be Effective May 1, 2001, retroactive to May 1,2001.	-	.	-	<
6.	Nothing in this Memorandum, of. Understanding or in the new basic collective
.	bargaining agreement ccnstitutes a commitment by the ,Company to. maintain the
complement.set forth in Paragraph 2 abcve.jn force and effect, as they may change based upon, changing requirements of the Mcter Shcp . ,. ...
7..	All field duties of the type currently performed by.Master Meter Mechanics (other than those identified in the Company’s. Memorandum of offer of April 30, 2001 to be effective May 1,2001) will be reassigned to the non-bargaining unit Measurement Technician job title. Because Master Meter Mechanics will no longer work in the field, the ninth paragraph of Article Vlll-A, Section 6.of the.prior basic collective bargaining agreement will not.be continued in the newbasic collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding or in the.new basic collective bargaining agreement prevents, the .Company from assigning a Master Meter Mechanic to a special assignment io the field. ..	■ ■
8.	Non-bargaining ;unit Measurement technicians will be allowed to remove and reinstall or replace temperature compensating heads on rotary meters when they are performing calibration tests and adjustments at the Meter Shop.

Meter Mechanics may be assigned to perform any work at,the Meter Shop, except skilled work involved in partially repairing diaphragm and rotary meters, performing special inspections of meters, and technical work involved in facility maintenance. Meter Provers may be assigned to perform any work at the Meter Shop, except the duties set forth above, and except adjusting and readjusting repair otdiaphragm meters. Laborers may be assigned to perform any work at the Meter Shop, except the duties set forth above, and except performing accuracy tests on diaphragm and rotary meters.. Without limiting the foregoing definition of duties, Laborers’ duties .will be expanded to include removing ERT’s from meters in the Meter Shop, making "okay repairs”, washing and.flushing rotary meters, and performing leak tests on all meters.
. In addition, Meter Provers’ duties will be expanded to include performing accuracy tests on diaphragm and rotary meters and classifying required repairs on such meters at the Meter Shop. Further, Meter Mechanic duties will be expanded to include performing adjusting and readjusting repair of diaphragm meters. Nothing in this Paragraph prevents the Company from temporarily upgrading a Meter Shop .employee . in accordance with-the new basic collective bargaining agreement.
2
10.	Displaced Meter Shop employees will not be allowed to bump any.other bargaining unit employee outside of the Meter Shop.. However, the Company.will commit to find suitable entry level bargaining unit positions for displaced Meter Shop employees and, in addition, to consider displaced Meter.Shop employees for. open non-bargaining unit
. positions.. If more than one displaced Meter Shop employee is found to be eligible for an open position, preference will be given to the employee with the;most departmental seniority. An employee who is offered an open position must accept it by the end of the third-working day following the offer; otherwise, the employee will be regarded as having rejected the offer. The displaced'employee will have a ninety (90) day period to determine his/her suitability to the new job?; The displaced employee rr aintains his/her right to enhanced-severance benefits under Paragraphs 14 and 15 during this ninety (90) day period. Displaced Meter Shop employees who accept a position outside the bargaining unit shall be subject to the same requirements, and shall enjoy the same rights and remedies, as other employees in the same position.
A displaced Meter Shop employee who elects to transfer to one of the entry-level bargaining unit jobs outside the Meter Shop offered by the Company will,-upon completing the ninety (90)-day;period provided for above and continuing his/her employment in such job, be paid the rate of pay which he/she would have received if he/she had remained in the job held on April 30,2001, including the'annual increases provided for in the new basic collective bargaining agreement, with the first annual increase retroactive to May 1,2001. A displaced Meter Shop employee who elects to transfer to an open non-bargaining unit job offered by the Company will have his/her rate of pay frozen'at the April 30,2001 level if such rate of pay is higher than the current rate of the new job, and this rale' of pay will remain frozen Until the rate of the new job exceeds the frozen rate. This paragraph applies only to Meter Shop employees who are displaced from the Meter Shop; it does not apply to employees who continue to work in the Meter Shop. - '	•	'
The obligation undertaken by the;Company under this Paragraph 13 to find suitable positions for displaced Meter Shop employees will cease when the last Meter Shop employee is released under Paragraph 14 below or on December 31,2001, whichever occurs first	*	:	t; ■ .
11.	Promptly upon determining that an employee will be displaced because of this reduction in the Meter Shop workforce, the Company will give the employee written notice of such determination. From the date'of the notice, the employee will continue on the active payroll for an additional eight-week period. During this period, the Company may relieve the employee from his/her duties so that the employee may attend to career transition issues.	•	’
12.	Employees who are transferred out of or laid off from, the Meter Shop will.be given an opportunity, in departmental seniority order (highest.to lowest),.tc return to the Meter Shop if openings occur within one year of their transfer or layoff.
3
13.	Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding or in the new basic collective bargaining agreement shall be interpreted as preventing the Company from outsourcing the Meter Shop function if the Company can accomplish that function in a more efficient manner during the term of the new basic collective bargaining agreement, provide^ th at the Company will commit to find suitable open positions for :	the outsourced employees and will treat the outsou rced employees in the same
manner as the displaced employees covered in Paragraph's 10 and 14 and, if eligible, ■‘Paragraph 15herein.■	..

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING
- TRANSFER OF METER READERS TO DISTRIBUTION DEPARTMENT
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into between The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company (the “Company”) and Gas Workers Union, Local 18007, S.E.I.U., AFL-CIO (the “Union”), for the purpose of setting forth the terms and Condhl’S^'unddfwtiich Meter Readers will be transferred to the Distribution Departmehtin the tirture.'These-fdTriis^and conditions are asfollows:
1,	The Company intends to phase out the Meter Reader classification during the term of the basic ' collective bargaining agreement. As Meter Readers are displaced because of the reduction in the size of the Meter Reader workforce, those who are eligible will be transferred to the Distribution Department as Gas Surveyors. The entry level rate for a Meter Reader transferred to the Distribution Department as a Gas Surveyor is Gas Surveyor - First 180 Days.
2.	To be eligible for consideration, a Meter Readermust (a) have a valid driver’s license, and (b) have had no disciplinary lay-off of eight hours or more during the two years preceding the date of the transfer, provided that Distribution Department management may waive requirement (b) and allow a Meter Reader to transfer notwithstanding his/her failure to meet this requirement. Both full-time and part-time Meters Readers are included, provided that part-time Meter Readers become full-time.	...............
3.	Distribution Department management will transfer eligible Meter Readers based on classification seniority in the Meter Reader classification, with the most senior Meter Reader being transferred first.	•”	'	:	\	’ ' '
4.	A Meter Reader who is transferred may elect to return voluntarily to Meter Reader within fourteen calendar days from'the date of the transfer without loss of classification seniority, provided there
* are still Meter Readers With less classification seniority at the time. Such employee will not be given another opportunity to transfer to the Distribution Department but will be allowed to continue working until his/her classification seniority does not allow him/her to keep his/her position as a Meter Reader.
5.	Meter Readers who are transferred are subject to the same 180-day trial period as other newly-hired Gas Surveyors, including all training and testing requirements associated with the training period of Gas Surveyors. If Distribution Department management decides, for any reason, that a former Meter Reader is not suitable for continued employment as a Gas Surveyor,rthe former Meter Reader will be relumed to Meter Reader with no loss of classification seniority, provided there are still Meter Readers with less classification seniority at the time. Such employee will be allowed to continue working until his/her classification seniority does not allow him/her to keep his/her position as a Meter Reader. This action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure in Article IV of the basic collective bargaining agreement In addition, the Company may separately take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, for any misconduct which
occurs during the trial period, providing that the Union may file a grievance with respect to that disciplinary action under Article IV of the basic collective bargaining agreement.
6.	A Meter Reader who has been or is given the opportunity to transfer to the Distribution Department as a Gas Surveyor and who either declines the opportunity or returns to the Meter Reading Department under Paragraph 4 or 5 above will not again be eligible to transfer to the Distribution Department as a Gas Surveyor, ..	.... ,	...
7..	.To the extent that seniority is relevant.tb actions dr preferences involving Gas Surveyors, the seniority to be used is bargaining-unitsehiodty. There will be no separate classification seniority in the Gas Surveyor classification. In the case of a tie, the tie-breaker will be a coin flip.
8.	. The Company may employ Gas Surveyors on a temporary,basis for summer employment at 85% of the entry level rate'.	..	.
9.	Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding prevents the Company from hiring a hew Gas Surveyor from the outside when there is no displaced Meter Reader available for transfer to the Distribution Department. It is recognized in such case, the newly-hired Gas Surveyor (“New Hire”) may have the opportunity to progress to Gas Mechanic before all Meter Readers have been given .. the opportunity to transfer to the Distribution Department. If this situation occurs, the former Meter . Readers will be regarded as having greater seniority, in the Gas Mechanic classification than the New Hire for purposes of determining eligibility for promotion to Crew Leader.
10.	This Memorandum supplants the memorandum entitled “Memorandum Of Understanding
. Regarding Leak Survey Work In The Distribution Department, dated April 30,1998, except that said Memorandum shall continue in force and, effect insofar as its terms have not been modified, either expressly or by implication, by this Memorandum or by the Company's Memorandum Of Company Offer Of April 30, 2001, To Be Effective May 1,2001.
11.	This Memorandum will remain in effect until modified by the parties or.terminated by either party’s giving the other written notice of termination during the same termination notice period as the applicable basic collective bargaining agreement.	. .	...

APPENDIX I
PAID TIME OFF (PTO) BANK PLAN
Effective January 1, 2002
Purpose of PTO	.	■	.
PTO Bank Days allow employees to take paid-time-off for vacations, personal business, illnesses of family membcrs-funcrals of friends or relatives who are not immediate family members, religious observances, and school visitation. In addition, PTO Bank Days provide paid-time-off for certain absences because of non-occupational sickness or injuries ("sickness absences’). ■
Earning PTO Bank Davs - Full-Time Employees
PTO Bank Days, each consisting of eight hours of paid-time-off, are earned on a current, service anniversary year basis. Employees who will complete one or more years of Company Service during a calendar year will receive an allotment of PTO Bank Days which may be used during that calendar year in accordance with the schedule below:
Years of Company Service	■	....
Completed in the Calendar Year . PTO Bank Days
1 through 4	18
5 through 9	- .	.	22
10 through 14	. .	. 25
15 through 19	28
20 through 24	.	31
25 through 29	:	35
30 or more ;	’	’ ■	36
Notwithstanding the foregoing, employees who have 25 or more years of Company Service as of December 31,1998, will receive an allotment
43
of 38 PTO Bank Days in the year in which they complete 30 years of Company Service and in each subsequent year.
Earning PTO Bank Davs - Part-Time Employees
Part-time employees earn PTO Bank Days on a prorated basis (i e., based on the ratio that their scheduled work hours at the beginning of a calendar year bear to a full-time work schedule). For example, an employee who is scheduled to work 20 hours per week as of the beginning of a calendar year will receive an allotment of, PTO Bank Days which is one-half theallotment which will be received by a full-time employee with the same number of years of Company Service.
Using PTO Bank Davs ,
PTO Bank Days may be used when employees experience scheduled absences, sickness absences, and other approved unscheduled absences, in accordance with the terms set forth below. PTO Bank Days will be deducted from an employee’s PTO Bank based on the amount of time he/she was absent from his/her normal schedule of work. ' For example, if an employee's normal schedule is five eighthour workdays per. week, one PTO.Bank Day will be deducted for each full day of absence taken under this Plan. If an employee's normal schedule is four ten-hour days per week, one and one-fourth PTO Bank Days will be deducted for each full day of absence taken under this Plan. If an employee’s normal schedule is five four-hour days per week, one-half of a PTO Bank Day will be deducted for each full day of absence taken under this Plan. If an employee, regardless of his/her normal schedule, is absent for a partial day under this Plan, the number of hours of absence will be deducted from his/her PTO Bank.
Using the PTO.Bank Before Fully Earning ft
■ Newly hired employees are eligible to use their first annual PTO Bank allotment after completing one year of service. PTO Bank Days are earned during the period from one service anniversary to another. Employees with more than one year of Company Service may begin taking PTO Bank Days starting on January 1 of each calendar year even, though they have not completed earning the total’number of days. ■	...	: • . '	. ’	■ ,	■
44
Accumulating PTOBank Davs ••	■ r-■	<1:^ 1?:' .,.
Employees may carry over up to 20 PTO Bank Days from one calendar year to the next*. However, the maximum number ofdays that an employee may have in his/her PTO Bank is 20 more than the allotment of days attributable to the current calendar year.' *-
■.	>	'	-	■	■ *	.■	'. - l -■	1 ’■	* t .	.
Scheduled PTO Bank Absences >	• ■
Each department will implement a PTO Bank program; which --- will enable employees to schedule absences during the course of the year in a way that will not unduly interfere with the department's operations. Continuous scheduled PTO Bank absences in excess of three weeks will not be allowed except in unusual'circumstances and with the approval of the department head.
The Company may limit the number of employees who may be off chi any given day to prevent an interference with the Company’s business operations, provided that in the case of Columbus Day or Dr.
■ Martin Luther King's Birthday, the Company may limit the number of employees who may be off only to assure that a normal holiday complement is present. If more employees request a given day off than can be released from work, preference will be given on the basis of Company seniority within classification. '
k
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Company shall, subject to operating requirements, endeavor to avoid scheduling PTO Bank absences for the months of January, ■ February, - and - December, and shall give each employee at least 30 days' advance - notice of the period scheduled for his/her regular scheduled PTO Bank absence. However, an employee at his/her own request may be granted a scheduled PTO Bank absence during such months. ■
Employees may use PTO Bank Days in hourly increments, subject to the approval of the department head. Department heads may restrict PTO Bank absences to full-day increments if smaller increments would unduly interfere with the department’s operations. - - ='■ -
If a'holiday observed by the Company occurs during an ! employee’s scheduled PTO Bank absence, and if the employee would -
‘45
have beeri elrgibJe for holiday pay for the holiday if he/she had not been absent for a scheduled PTO Bank absence, then the employee will be given an extra PTO Bank Day for the calendar year in which the absence occurs; ' .	>
Sickness Absences '	-	■ ’
If an employee has not previously experienced a sickness absence tasting more than five days during the calendar year, he/she will be paid for the first five days of the absence from his/her PTO Bank, and the sixth day and any subsequent days of the absence wilt be paid from the Sickness Benefit Plan, subject to the terms and conditions of that Plan, If the employee does not have enough PTO Bank Days to be paid for some or all of the first five days of the absence, he/she wilt be paid the PTO Bank Days which are available, and the remaining day or days will be unpaid. A sickness absence will be considered to have occurred during the calendar year in which the absence begins. In the case of an employee whose normal schedule of work is other than five days per week and eight hours per day, he/she will be paid for the first forty hours of the absence from his/her PTO Bank, and the waiting period for benefits under the Sickness Benefit Plan will be forty hours.
If the.employee has previously experienced a sickness absence lasting more than five days for which he/she received benefits under the Sickness Benefit Plan during the calendar year, he/she will be paid for the first two-days of the absence from his/her .PTO Bank, and the third day and any. subsequent days of the absence vail be paid from the Sickness Benefit Plan, subject to the terms arid conditions of that Plan. If the employee does not have enough PTO Bank Days to be paid for one or both of the first two days of the absence, he/she will be paid any PTO Bank Day which is available, and the remaining day or days will be unpaid, tn the case.of an employee whose normal schedule of work is other than five days per week and eight hours per day, he/she will be paid for the first sixteen hours of the absence from his/her PTO Bank, and the waiting period for benefits under the Sideness Benefit Plan will be sixteen hours	. .	.	■
An employee who experiences a sickness absence must report such absence as early as possible onthe first day of the absence to the person designated by the department head to receive such reports (The
46
designated person’). Failure to make this report will, result in die nonpayment of benefits from the PTO Bank and/or the Sickness Benefit Ran, and for such. other action, as the Company -may consider appropriate. An employee who becomes sick or injured dunnga scheduled PTO Bank absence must promptly notify the designated person. The five-day or two-day waiting period for. benefits under the Sickness Benefit Plan will commence on the day of such notice,
Other Unscheduled Absences	..	..
An employee requesting an unscheduled PTO Bank absence must make the request to the designated person as early as possible. Department heads may deny the requested absence and/or the use of PTO Bank Days for the absence.	:<	-
Payment Upon Termination of Employment
Employees who terminate their service with the Company will be paid for their earned and unused PTO Bank’Days. This payment will be calculated as follows: '	'
Current Year Accrual: Multiply the total number of PTO Bank Days the employee would have been eligible for in the current year by the number of full calendar months the employee has worked since his/her Company. service anniversary date in the prior year (up to a maximum of 12) and divide the product by 12. Subtract from this figure any current year PTO Bank Days the employee has already taken. (An employee who terminates service for any reason other than discharge before reaching his/her service anniversary date during rhe current year may be - eligible for an additional allowance under the Termination
Allowance Plan for the value of his/her current year PTO Bank Days which have not been earned or used.)
Next Year Accrual: Multiply the total number of PTO Bank Days the employee would have been eligible for in the next year by the number of full calendar months; if any, the employee has worked * since his/her Company service anniversary date in the current year, and divide the product by 12.
47
Other Regulations >	■ • -	.	-
' ” Approved-leaves of absence without pay, military leaves, sickness absences, absences for jury service, and other excused absences shall not affect an employee's-eligibility for PTO Bank Days, except to the extent that a leave of absence may affect the determination of an employee's length of service under the Company’s Regulations for Determining Service.
Benefits under this Plan may not be used to duplicate benefits which an employee is entitled to receive for an absence under any law or other Company benefit plan or policy.
Definitions .
The term "pay" shall mean the salary or wage which the employee would have received for the period involved on the basis of his/her normal schedule of work.
Other terms used in this Plan shall have the meaning set forth in the Company’s Regulations for Determining Service.
Employees Transferred to and from Associated Corporations
An employee who is transferred to an associated corporation (except for Peoples Energy Services Corporation) is not eligible to receive any further benefits under this Plan, including but not limited to the benefits which are paid to employees who terminate their service. An employee who is transferred to Peoples Energy Services Corporation will be treated as an employee who has terminated his/her service as of the date of the transfer and will be paid for his/her earned and unused PTO Bank Days in accordance with the provisions of this Plan.
An employee who is transferred from an associated corporation (except for Peoples Energy Services Corporation) will be entitled to an allotment of PTO Bank Days hereunder in the calendar year of such transfer. The “years of Company Service” of the transferred employee will be determined in accordance with the Company’s Regulations for Determining Service. The allotment of PTO

An.absence shall be regarded as ‘qualifying for the Sickness Benefit Plan’ after five days of absence on account of sickness (40 hours of absence in the case of an employee whose normal work schedule is; other than five days per week and eight hours per day). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an employee has previously experienced an absence on account of sickness of more than five days (or 40 hours) for which he/she has received benefits under this Plan, subsequent absences in the same calendar year shall be regarded as ‘qualifying for the Sickness Benefit Plan’ after two days of absence on account of sickness (sixteen hours of absence in the case of an employee whose normal work schedule is other than five days per week and eight hours perday). A sickness absence will be considered to have occurred during the calendar year in which the absence begins. The employee may be eligible to be paid for the foregoing five-day (40 hours) or two-day (sixteen hours) waiting period under the PTO Bank Plan, subject to the terms and conditions of that Plan.
In each case of necessary absence from work on account of sickness:of a regular employee, the period of absence during which the absent employee will receive pay from the Sideness Benefit Plan and the rate of such pay shall be as follows:
