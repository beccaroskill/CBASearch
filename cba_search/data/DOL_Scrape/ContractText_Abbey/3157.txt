XII. Compensation
A. Teacher Salaries
The parties recognize that the School District of Philadelphia has special challenges reflected in the need to attract and retain new teachers, to encourage professional growth of teachers, to meet the needs of our students, and to offer more competitive salaries.
Toward that end, the District and the Federation have agreed to establish in addition to the Basic Compensation System as set forth in the Agreement (See C-1) an Enhanced Compensation System, as well as a Bonus Program available to teachers in either system.
1.	Enhanced Compensation System (“ECS”) Design
(a) The Enhanced Compensation System and the Bonus Program shall be developed by a Teacher Compensation Committee composed of equal numbers of representatives appointed by each of the parties. Such appointments shall be made no later than October 1, 2000.
(1)	The Teacher Compensation Committee shall cooperatively design enhancements to the agreed upon Enhanced Compensation Salary Schedule (See C-2) which shall provide for salary increases awarded on the basis of demonstrated levels of skill and knowledge in subject content and classroom practice, and to recommend to the Superintendent areas of critical need and positions of professional responsibility for which bonuses will be provided.
(2)	The Committee shall jointly determine the amounts of salary enhancements and bonuses to be awarded under the Enhanced Compensation System and the Bonus Program.
(3)	Together with the educational compensation consultant identified in paragraph B, the Committee shall continuously monitor the implementation of the Enhanced Compensation System.
2.	ECS Development and Implementation
(a)	The Teacher Compensation Committee shall identify a consultant । with expertise in educational compensation to assist in the development and implementation of the Enhanced Compensation System. It shall also identify an independent educational
-37-
compensation expert to provide opinions and recommendations periodically, as described below. If the Committee is unable to select an independent expert within 30 days from the Committee’s formation, each party shall immediately identify one such expert and these two experts shall, within 10 days, select a qualified individual to so serve. Should the Teacher Compensation Committee be unable to reach consensus on an issue critical to the initiation or continued implementation of the Enhanced Performance Compensation System or the Bonus Program, the District may proceed with implementation of the program, provided:
(1)	the issue has been presented to the independent expert for a timely expert opinion and recommendation;
(2)	the District has afforded a reasonable opportunity for the parties to discuss the opinion and recommendation by the independent expert; and
(3)	the independent expert concludes that the District’s plan is not unreasonable.
(b)	Should the independent expert conclude that the District’s plan is unreasonable, paragraphs 1,2, and 3 above must be repeated until the consensus is reached, or the District develops a plan that the independent expert finds not unreasonable.
3.	Timeline for Development and Implementation
(a) The Teacher Compensation Committee shall design the Enhanced Compensation System and the Bonus Program according to the following process and timeline:
(1)	By March 1, 2001, the Committee shall establish the parameters of the Enhanced Compensation System, including but not limited to the standards of skills and .	knowledge of subject content and classroom practice, the
criteria and measures for receiving such enhancements, and the amount and scope of the enhancements. The process for assessing classroom practice shall include the school principal.
(2)	By March 1, 2001, the Committee shall also design the Bonus Program, including but not limited to cooperative recommendations to the Superintendent regarding areas of critical need and positions of professional responsibility which should qualify for bonuses, as well as joint
-38-
determination of the amounts of bonuses. This program shall be implemented effective September 1,2001.
(3)	During the 2001-2002 school year, the School District shall implement the Enhanced Compensation System on a pilot basis. Participation in the pilot shall be entirely voluntary, and shall result in placement in the Enhanced Compensation System salary schedule, with a resultant increase in salary effective September 1,2001.
(i)	Anyone who voluntarily participates in the pilot program may withdraw from participation in the pilot at any time, whether before or after being assessed, thereby returning to the Basic Compensation System for the 20012002 school year. An assessment during the pilot shall not result in any participant losing compensation or being adversely affected in any subsequent assessment.
(ii)	At the end of the pilot, the independent expert may recommend change(s) to the program. The recommendation(s) will be considered and to the extent feasible incorporated into the Enhanced Compensation System. Implementation may then proceed so long as the independent expert concludes that any failure to make recommended changes is not unreasonable.
(iii)	Failure of the parties to develop a pilot, or failure to secure or retain the targeted number of volunteers for the pilot, shall not preclude timely implementation of the Enhanced Compensation System so long as the independent expert concludes that the implementation plan is not unreasonable.
(4)	During the 2002-2003 school year, the Enhanced Compensation System shall be implemented for any teacher who elects to participate, as well as for all teachers hired on or after March 1,2001. All participants shall be placed into the Enhanced Compensation System salary schedule effective 9/01/02, and this placement shall ensure an increase in pay relative to what each participant would have received in the Basic Compensation System.
(5)	Participants in the Enhanced Compensation System shall remain in that salary schedule permanently. However:
(i)	Those electing the Enhanced Compensation System, assuming satisfactory annual ratings, will at no point earn
-39-
less than they would have earned in the Basic Compensation System.
(ii)	Should an assessment not be completed by the end of the school year for which it was requested, the increase, if awarded at a later date, shall be retroactive to the date when it should have been received.
(iii)	Anyone who undergoes a review and is not successful shall suffer no reduction in pay, assuming a satisfactory annual rating.
4.	Evaluations and Appeals
(a)	The yearly teacher evaluation process will continue for all teachers, except that for a teacher in the Enhanced Compensation System it shall be replaced by the periodic assessment in those years when he/she is assessed.
(b)	The Committee shall establish a procedure for accepting and deciding appeals that will be limited to determining whether the proper procedures were followed, and whether the action of the assessors is supported by the documentation collected during the assessment process.

FEDERATION-DISTRICT MIDDLE SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP
The School District and the Federation share a mutual interest in improving middle schools. Success in the middle grades is critical to a student’s educational success and long-term life chances. However, middle schools too often face problems that result in insufficient academic progress, school climate not conducive to learning, high vacancy rates, and high staff turnover.
Much work has been done at the national and local levels to address these issues. In order to ensure that the most effective practices are implemented in the most timely manner possible, the District and the Federation commit to establishing with other interested parties a three year Middle Schools Partnership. Funding will be provided by the District. The activities of the 2000-2001 year will include:
□ Identification of conceptual foundations of middle school renewal
o Identification of key strategies to address:
-	student learning
-	disruptive students
-	content knowledge of staff
-	behavior management
□	implementation at each site of a structured process of data collection and analysis, exploration of best practices, planning, implementation, and ongoing monitoring, assessment and re-evaluation
□	training of school leadership teams, including the building committees, the SLC coordinators,~and the teachers at each site who serve as content knowledge experts
□	development at each school of a school plan for 2001-2002 which incorporates the strategies appropriate for that school, and designs the school’s instructional program support services, budget, staffing, roster, and professional development accordingly
Years two and three will be devoted to ongoing training and monitoring of progress at the sites, and an assessment of the effectiveness of the Partnership.
-158-
The budget, staffing, and training will be carried out as a partnership of the parties involved.
This partnership shall expire at the end of the 2002-2003 school year unless mutually extended by the parties.
-159-
APPENDIXF
CURRICULUM
The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers and the School District mutually recognize the necessity of aligning standards, curriculum, and assessment. This alignment is necessary in order to provide meaningful professional development that can be successfully incorporated into classroom content and instruction. Therefore, the parties agree to work cooperatively to develop well-articulated programs of instruction for each grade level that will guide and support teachers in aligning classroom instruction with the standards, curriculum, and assessment system in order to support improved student achievement. The programs of instruction will outline to teachers and inform parents as to what students should know and be able to do, and incorporate relevant research-based developments in the areas of teaching and learning and effective practice. National and local curriculum programs, models and materials will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to determine their value for alignment with the standards, curriculum and assessment system, and where deemed appropriate will be incorporated into the programs of instruction. Professional development framed by the aligned standards, curriculum and assessments will support teachers in the continuing enhancement of their content knowledge and classroom practice.

Dear Messrs. Kirsch and Jordan:
This letter sets forth the School District’s understanding of the conditions that will govern the length and schedule of bargaining unit employees’ workday, designing teachers’ rosters as well as the planning and scheduling of professional development activities (including induction and mentoring) for the 2000-2001 school year.
Specifically, the workday and work year for bargaining unit members shall be as existed under the terms of the expired 1996-2000 collective bargaining agreements, as set forth in Articles T-II1, until the 2001-2002 school year. By the same token, for the 2000-2001 school year the process for designing teachers’ rosters and the number of hours of instruction shall, be governed by Article B-II 14 b and T-II 1 of the expired Agreement.
Before changes regarding the lengthening of the work day become effective in 2001-2002, the provisions of Article T-V 16 a-c and T-III, 5 a of the expired 1996-2000 contract shall continue to determine the time dedicated for professional development and faculty meetings, to specify the portions of such time that are to be jointly planned, and to fix the number of night meetings. However, the timeframes and mechanisms for achieving agreement over the schedule and content of professional development activities shall be in accordance with the procedures of Article X.

Dear Mr. Kirsch:
In the event the School District has been unable to recruit and/or hire a sufficient number of certified teachers to fill existing vacancies in areas of critical need through the normal hiring, posting and transfer processes by June 1, the School District may enter into contracts with outside providers to provide services which would otherwise be filled by bargaining unit members. Except in circumstances of unanticipated vacancies, the Federation shall be provided with no less than three (3) months’ prior written notice of any decision to utilize any outside providers.
The District shall use its best efforts to fill such vacancies through the normal hiring, transfer and job posting processes. The School District will continue its effort to recruit in shortage areas.
Ordinarily an outside provider may be utilized to fill a vacancy in any location for two (2) school years. The Federation-District Committee shall meet in February 2002 and in February of each subsequent year to evaluate whether a vacancy(ies) in critical needs areas can be addressed effectively by means other than renewal of a contract(s) with an outside provider(s). The Federation-District Committee will also consider ways to fill chronic vacancies permanently. Absent a concrete and reasonable basis for concluding that the vacancy(ies) can be filled for the following school year through the normal recruitment, hiring, transfer and job posting processes, the District may contract for up to an additional two (2) years. A contract renewal shall be for only one year if there is a concrete and reasonable basis to conclude that the vacancy(ies) can be filled through normal processes in less than two (2) years.

Dear Mr. Kirsch:
This will confirm the School District’s procedure for repaying preparation time which could not be restored during the school year.
In June of each school year each school is to submit the dates on which the employee is to be reimbursed for lost prep time on a form distributed by the School District. Each school will total the periods lost and then indicate the number of lost prep periods to be reimbursed by either the cash pay back option [at the extra-curricular rate] and/or the personal leave option [one (1) day for every seven (7) periods owed].
Not included in the above figures will be:
•	The first four (4) prep periods for elementary teachers for whom an S-324 has been submitted.
•	The first four (4) periods taken for coverage for secondary teachers. There is no pay back at the secondary level until the taking away of a prep period for the fifth (5th) time.
Every effort must be made to repay teachers for their lost prep time through the use of substitute service, impossible.
Sincerely,
Rhoda Chatzkel
Chief Financial Officer
