D.	Section 7., Reemployment Lists, and Section 8., Status on Reemployment, of this Article, shall not apply if the County has a written agreement with an employer, public or private, which guarantees the County employee an offer of reasonably comparable employment with the new employer who is taking over a function formerly performed by County employees and the new employer does make such an offer in writing to the employee.
Section 2.	Order of Layoff
A.	When a reduction in the work force is implemented, employees in regular positions and those occupying limited-term positions at the direction of the Department Head shall be laid off in an order based on consideration of:
1.	employment status;
2.	past performance;
3.	length of continuous service	with the County.
B.	Layoffs shall be made by class within the department except that:
1.	Where a class has a dual or multiple concept, the Chief of Employee Relations may authorize a layoff by specialty within the class.

PO-73
C.	Within a class, employees shall be subject to layoff in the following order:
Employment Status	Layoff Order
First -	Temporary Promotion	Determined by Department
Second - New Probationary	Determined by Department
Third - Regular/Promotional Probationary Layoff Points
After all new probationary employees and employees on temporary promotion have been removed from a class within a layoff unit, the employee with the lowest number of layoff points shall be subject to layoff first. When two (2) or more employees have the same number of layoff points, the department shall determine the order of layoff for these employees.
D.	If a layoff is going to be made in a class from which an employee has left through a temporary promotion, the employee on temporary promotion shall be returned to his or her former class and shall be subject to layoff in accordance with this procedure.

A.	Written notice of layoff shall be given to an employee or sent by mail to the last known mailing address at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff. Notices of layoff shall be served on employees personally at work whenever practicable.
B.	It is the intent of the parties that the number of layoff notices initially issued shall be limited to the number of positions by which the work force is intended to be reduced.

The notice of layoff shall include the reason for the layoff, the proposed effective date of the layoff, the employee's hire date, the employee's layoff points, a list of classes in the employee's occupational series within the layoff unit, the employee's rights under Sections 5. and 6., and the right of the employee to advise the County of any objection to the content of the layoff notice prior to the proposed effective date of the layoff.
Section 5.	Voluntary Reduction in Lieu of Layoff
A.	A promotional probationary or regular employee who is subject to layoff may request a reduction to a lower class within the same occupational series in the layoff unit provided the employee possesses the minimum qualifications for the class and passes any required performance tests. The reduction shall be made if there is a vacant position in the layoff unit or an incumbent in the lower class in the layoff unit has fewer layoff points than the employee requesting the reduction. In the latter case, the incumbent in the lower class with the fewest number of layoff points shall be subject to layoff.

Where such notification is not in writing, the employee shall confirm the notification in writing as soon as practicable.
3.	Failure by an employee to respond to the department pursuant to this Section shall result in a rebuttable presumption that the employee does not intend to exercise any right of reduction to a lower class, and that the employee's hire date stated in the layoff notice was correct.
4.	No employee action or inaction referred to in this Section shall be considered a waiver of an employee's right to file grievances concerning any matter within the scope of the grievance procedure.
