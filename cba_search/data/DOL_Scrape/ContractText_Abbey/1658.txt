ARTICLE II Union Security
Section 1:	Union Membership. All present employees, within the meaning of this Agreement, who are members of the Union on the effective date of this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, maintain their membership in the Union. All present employees who are not members of the Union and all employees who are hired hereafter shall become and remain members of the appropriate Union as a condition of employment not later than the eighth (8th) day following the beginning of their employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. Failure of any employee to comply with the provisions of this Article shall, upon the request of the Union, result in the termination of such employee. Upon written request, the Employer shall furnish a designated Union official on each job with the names of any new employees not later than eight (8) days after employment upon forms to be supplied by the Union. The Employer shall not justify the discrimination against any employee for non-membership in the Union (a) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members, or (b) if he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
Employer agrees to check off Union dues and initiation fees, and turn the same over to the proper Union officials upon presentation of proper authorization cards supplied by the Union and signed by the employee, in conformity with the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended. The Employer shall not be held liable for, and the Union agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless the Employer from any claims arising from disputes between the Union and its Members concerning dues and initiation fees. Employer, upon written request and for good cause, will supply the Union with a list of all its employees’ names who are performing its bargained for unit work covered by this agreement.
Section 2:	Minimum wage scale. The minimum wage scales to be paid by Employer shall be as set out in Article XII of the Agreement except that such Article may be amended by written mutual consent and agreement. In the event the Davis Bacon Act is repealed, either party may notify the other party of their intent to renegotiate the
2
wage rates within thirty (30) days following the effective repeal date. If a Union fails to submit the negotiated wage rates to the United States Department of Labor or the West Virginia Department of Labor each year in a timely manner or does not properly prevail its wages, the Union will be required to reopen the contract for the purpose of renegotiating the wage rates. If no new wage rate is established through negotiations, the Employer is responsible for payment of the wage rate prevailed at the time the contract is let to bid.
Section 3.	Surety Bond. The Union may require those Employers who have not maintained a presence in the jurisdiction of the Union for five (5) years or more or who are not previously a party to an agreement with the Union or who are delinquent or who become delinquent in payment of fringe benefit funds and who do not cure such delinquency within thirty (30) days provided by this Agreement to procure, pay the premium for and deliver to the Union a Bond written by a responsible surety company in the sum of Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) plus any existing delinquencies due said fringe benefit funds guaranteeing the payment of all wages and fringe benefits due employees under this Agreement and all payments and penalties due as provided in this Agreement.
An Employer desiring to start work before furnishing such Bond shall make a Five Hundred Dollar ($500.00) cash deposit with the Local Union office. His job may then proceed for a period of thirty (30) days. Thereafter, the Surety Bond must be posted before work may continue. Any such deposit shall be refunded to the Employer upon presentation of the Bond. The above Bond and cash deposits are for the purpose of securing the payment by the Employer of all payroll and fringe benefits due employees and shall be refunded to the Employer upon completion of the work, providing that all obligations with respect to payroll and fringe benefits have been paid.
ARTICLE III
General Working Conditions
Section 1:	Accidents. Employees shall immediately report to the Employer all accidents, together with the names and addresses of all witnesses to the accidents. Upon written request, Employer shall furnish the Union concerned with a report of each lost time accident involving a member of that Union on a form to be agreed upon.
Section 2:	Street/highway safety. Employer shall not require employees to take out on the street or highways any vehicles not equipped with the safety appliances prescribed by law, or any vehicle that is not in a safe operating condition.
Section 3:	Equipment defects. Employees shall immediately report to the Employer all equipment defects. If an occasion arises that an employee reports defective equipment to Employer and receives no satisfaction, he shall report the matter to the officers of his Union, who shall in turn consult with Employer.
Section ,4: Manning equipment. Employer shall man his equipment at all times with a sufficient number of men to properly handle the load. There shall be no limit on production by workmen or restrictions on the full use of tools and equipment. There shall be no restrictions other than may be required by safety regulations on the number of men assigned to any crew or to any service except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement.
Section 5:	Safety & sanitary regulations Employer shall comply with all of the safety and sanitary regulations specified by the laws of the United States of America and the State of West Virginia. Required safety equipment shall be furnished by the Employer. If after analysis by a recognized testing laboratory, materials used in construction are found to be injurious to health and safety to employees, the Contractor will endeavor to correct the situation through reasonable protective measures or substitution of other materials.
Section 6:	Working steward. The Union may refer a working steward for each shift who will be paid at the journeyman wage rate for the job classification in which employed and will be allowed reasonable time to fulfill his responsibilities for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the working steward must be able to productively perform any available work. The working steward shall not be discriminated against for
3
discharging his duties as a steward. The Union shall notify the Employer, in writing, the name of the working steward on each job. Designated officials of the crafts shall be permitted upon the job site provided that said official complies with safety regulations and does not affect the work in progress. Before the Employer discharges or lays-off a steward, the employer must discuss the reason for the discharge or layoff with the local union Business Manager if available.
Section 7:	Foul weather. Necessary foul weather gear, including over-the-shoe boots, shall be supplied by the Contractor when the weather or type of work requires it and shall be chargeable to the man if lost or damaged beyond ordinary wear and tear. The Employer shall determine if weather is suitable for working. The Employee shall not be punished for refusing to work in unsafe weather conditions.
Section 8: Management of operations. The Employer retains and shall exercise full and exclusive responsibility for the management of its operations. The Employer will be the judge in determining the competency of applicants and employees with the right to hire, reject or terminate accordingly and will be responsible for determining a fair day's work. The Employer may direct the working force, at its sole prerogative, including selection and hiring of general foreman, foreman, promotion, transfer, layoff or discharge of its employees. No rules, customs or practices shall be permitted or observed which limit or restrict production or limit or restrict the joint or individual working efforts of employees. Further, the Employer shall be the judge as to the number of employees, foremen, general foremen and other supervisors required to perform the work, and the number of employees to be assigned to any crew, operation or piece of equipment. Employees may be shifted from one piece of equipment or operation to another, as job conditions require. General foremen, master mechanics, foremen and other supervisors may operate any equipment or use the tools of the craft when instructed to do so by the Employer for instructional or emergency purposes. The fact that certain classifications and rates are established does not mean that the Contractor must employ workmen for any one or on such classifications or to man any particular piece of equipment that happens to be on the job unless the Contractor has need for such equipment. General foremen and foremen who have been in the employ of the Employer for one year or more, may be transferred from project to project. The Employer shall have the unqualified right to select and hire directly all supervisors it considers necessary and desirable without such persons being referred by the Unions with the understanding that utilizing this right to hire such persons as supervisors and eventually demote them to bargaining unit employees merely to circumvent the local hiring hall procedure will not be tolerated. The Employer may utilize any method or technique of construction and there shall be no limitation or restriction, regardless of the source or location, of the use of machinery, precast, prefabricated or preassembled materials, tools, or other laborsaving devices, nor shall there be any limitation upon choice of materials or design.
The Employer shall assign work on the basis of traditional work jurisdictional lines. It is, however, recognized that effective competition requires the use of partnering crew or a cadre approach among the respective crafts. Based upon past practices in West Virginia and area custom, a partnering crew or a cadre may be utilized. The partnering crew or cadre is a crew comprised by the Employer at its discretion. The Employer is not required to utilize individuals of each union signatory to this agreement nor individuals of each union present on the construction site in establishing the partnering crew or cadre. The Employer will make up the crew on the basis of the amount of work involved for each Union. Only on projects with gross contract value greater than $3,000,000.00 will pre-bid approval be required for use of a partnering crews or cadres.
Section 9:	Union workforce. The Unions will exert their utmost efforts to recruit sufficient numbers of skilled applicants to fulfill the workforce requirements of the Employer. In the event the referral facilities maintained by the Unions do not refer the required number of qualified applicants requested by the Employer within a twenty-four (24) hour period after such request is made (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted), the Employer may withdraw the request and employ applicants from other sources.
The Employer has executed a hiring hall agreement with the Union. Copies of that agreement are made apart hereof by reference and are available at the Constructors’ Labor Council of West Virginia, Inc. upon request.
4
Section 10:	Work place. Employees shall be at their work place at the starting time, and shall remain at their place of work performing their assigned duties under supervision of the Employer and shall be returned to their vehicle by quitting time. The Employer shall have the right to determine the work place. There will be no organized coffee breaks, rest periods or other non-working time established during working hours. Employees will be afforded coffee breaks at their work place provided that the coffee break does not disrupt job progress. It is agreed and understood that coffee breaks, rest periods or other non-working time will not create a general work stoppage. It is agreed and is the intent of the parties that there be a full day's work for a fair day's wage. When working a ten (10) hour shift, Employees shall receive a ten (10) minute unorganized break at their workstation. The break shall be coordinated by the Contractor so not to impede or impact project operations.
Section 11:	Ice water. The Contractor will make every reasonable effort to provide ice water from April 1 through October 31.
Section 12:	Notice of work status. Each employee shall furnish the Employer with a phone number or a point of contact where said employee may be reached for notice of work status. Employer agrees to not unreasonably withhold "lay-off slips" or "low earnings slips" if same is requested by an employee.
Section 13:	Saturday work. In the event Saturday is to be worked, notification must be given the Crafts prior to the completion of the Friday daylight shift.
Section 14:	Leave of absence. If an employee is injured and forced to leave the job, he shall be given a reasonable time to gather his personal belongings and tools. Employer agrees to grant the necessary leave of absence without pay in case of sickness or injury, and employee shall receive his former position, if available, upon recovery or the expiration of the leave.
Section 15:	On the job injury. If an employee is injured on the job, it is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide first aid and transportation of the employee to the nearest hospital or physician. Upon admittance to the hospital by a physician, responsibility of the Employer terminates and the employee is under the supervision and jurisdiction of the physician and the Workers' Compensation Program for treatment and reassignment to duty status. If the employee is allowed to return to work by the physician, and if the employee should require further examination or treatment during duty hours, then the Employer shall pay the employee for such portion of the work day that he is not on the job, provided that the employee may be requested to furnish adequate proof of his attendance for medical treatment. The Employer shall not be responsible for payment to the man for any time devoted to such examination or treatment before or after the normal workday.
Section 16: Trial period. New employees shall be on trial for a period of fifteen (15) workdays and Employer shall be the sole judge of their ability during such trial period. Employees retained after such fifteen (15) workday trial period shall be deemed to be regular employees. The Employer shall not discharge any Employee working more than fifteen (15) workdays without just cause. In the event of termination, any Employee working more than fifteen (15) workdays may request an investigation as to his discharge. Should such investigation prove that an injustice has been done, the Employee shall be reinstated and compensated at his usual rate of pay while he has been out of work.
ARTICLE IV Wages and Work Periods
Section 1: Start time, (a) Starting time of regularly scheduled shift shall be established by the Contractor between the hours of 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. or as agreed upon at the pre-job conference. A Contractor may elect to change the starting time, but must give the Union twenty-four (24) hours notification in advance. Notice shall be effective if orally given to the steward or confirmed in writing to the respective business agent. It is understood that
5
the Employer is not required to pay travel expenses, travel time, zone pay, or subsistence during the term of this Agreement.
(b)	It is recognized and agreed that on certain types of work due to owners' specifications, Governmental restrictions and/or traffic conditions, the work or part of the work must be done on multiple shift basis, in which event such shift will be permitted to conform with such restrictions as to starting time or time between shifts, which may be determined at the pre-job conference.

On temporary work on highway projects only, in the event of inclement weather, the Employee will only receive two (2) hours pay for reporting time or actual hours worked, whichever is greater.
Section 2: Workweek. Except where provided otherwise by the United States Government, forty (40) hours shall constitute a normal workweek and all hours worked over forty (40) per week shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2). On Heavy construction projects with gross contract value greater than $3,000,000.00, the Employee shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) for hours worked over eight (8) hours on eight (8) hour shifts or at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) for hours worked over ten (10) hours on ten (10) hour shifts. Nothing herein shall be construed as guaranteeing any employee eight (8) hours of work per day on eight (8) hour shifts or ten (10) hours of work per day on ten (10) hour shifts or forty (40) hours of work per week. All productive work performed on Sunday shall be computed on a double time basis, and not less than four (4) consecutive hours of work shall be given on Sunday. See "Triple Shift Exception" - Section 3. It is understood that the Employer is not required to pay travel expenses, travel time, zone pay, or subsistence during the term of this Agreement.
Saturday will be considered the make-up day on eight (8) hour shifts and will be paid straight time if the Employee has not worked a forty (40) hour week prior to Saturday. Friday will be considered the make-up day on ten (10) hour shifts and will be paid straight time if the Employee has not worked a forty (40) hour week prior to Friday. If the Employee provides the Employer with written notice twenty-four (24) hours prior to a make-up day that he does not want to work the make-up day, then the Employee will not be penalized for not working the make-up day. On heavy projects with gross contract value of greater than $3,000,000.00 only, all construction work performed on Saturday will be paid at time and one-half unless Saturday is considered a make-up day.
It is agreed and understood that Employees performing non-productive work such as curing concrete and dewatering will be paid straight time regardless of the day non-productive work is performed.
The Employer and the Unions agree that chronic and/or unexcused absenteeism is undesirable and must be controlled. The Employer may terminate, at its discretion, for chronic and/or unexcused absenteeism. The Employer shall be consistent with regard to termination for absenteeism.
Section 3: Triple shift, (a) When three shifts are established and operated, the first or daylight shift will consist of eight (8) hours' work, plus one-half (1/2) hour for non-paid lunch.

Section 4: 8 or 10-hour shifts. When two 8 or 1 O-hour shifts are established and operated, a one-half (2) hour free lunch period will be provided. Therefore, employees will be on the project site for 8-1/2 hours or 10-1/2 hours, but will be paid only for 8 or 10 hours. In the event of the utilization by the Contractor of three shifts, the language provided in Section 3, Paragraph (a) of this Article will prevail.
Section 5:	Overtime. The Employer shall determine when overtime shall be worked and by whom. The Employee shall not be required to work overtime unless detrimental to the construction project. Where Employees are required to work overtime beyond the normal shift, the first period shall consist of two (2) hours' work, plus one-half (1/2) hour fiee lunch time and subsequent periods shall consist of three and one-half (3-1/2) hours' work plus > one-half (1/2) hour paid lunch time.

Section 7:	Weekly pay. Employees are to be paid weekly. The workweek shall begin with the daylight shift Monday and payment of wages shall be made not later than Friday of the following workweek. The Contractor and the Union shall mutually agree upon the day on which the Employees shall be paid. Employees who report for their paycheck on a day when there is no work scheduled because of weather or other causes shall not be eligible for reporting pay. All paychecks will be available at the start of the day shift on the established payday. The employee may ask the Contractor to mail his check to his home on a non-work payday and the Contractor will mail said check prior to 12:00 noon on said day.
Section 8:	Lunch Period. The Lunch period will be routinely held between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. unless mutually agreed upon otherwise at the pre-job conference.
Section 9:	Termination/iay-offs. An employee whose employment is terminated or who is laid-off for the "convenience of the employer" shall be paid within one (1) hour of the time of termination or at the end of the shift, whichever is first, unless extraordinary circumstances prevent the timely preparation of a final check.
