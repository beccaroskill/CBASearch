a.	When hand delivered, proof of service must accompany the appeal to arbitration. The date of receipt will be used to determine the date of the appeal for hand-delivered appeals.
b.	When mailed, the appeal must arrive in an envelope with a U.S. Postal Service Postmark. The U.S. Postal Service Postmark will be used to determine the date of the appeal for mailed appeals.
2.	For the purposes of this Article, time limits are calculated in calendar days, and deadlines which fall on a day which is not a University/campus business day will automatically be extended to the next business day. All time limits may be extended by written agreement of the parties in advance of the expiration of the time limit. The union's failure to meet any time limit, or extension to a time limit , will render the Appeal to Arbitration ineligible for further processing and the University's Step 3 answer will be considered final.
3.	If the appeal to arbitration is withdrawn or an arbitration hearing otherwise does not take place, the University's Step 3 answer will be considered final.
4.	The decision of the arbitrator on any issue properly before her/him shall be final and binding.
5.	An appeal to arbitration shall not prohibit efforts by the University and UPTE to resolve the grievance during the time the appeal is pending and until such time that an arbitrator has rendered her/his decision.
6.	UPTE shall have full authority to settle, withdraw or otherwise dispose of any grievance brought on behalf of the union and/or on the behalf of employees. An agreement by the parties to settle, withdraw, or otherwise dispose of a grievance appealed to arbitration shall be binding upon the grievant(s).
7.	Where two (2) or more grievances are appealed to arbitration, all grievances by or related to the same employee(s), or grievances which relate to the same incident, issue or course of action, may be consolidated by agreement of the parties.
8.	TIME LIMITS
a.	INITIAL FILING - An appeal to arbitration must be filed within thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of the University's Step 3 decision to the union. Appeals which do not contain the appropriate union signature will be considered ineligible for appeal to arbitration.

E.	SCOPE OF ARBITRATION
1.	Unless there is an agreement by both parties to modify the scope of the hearing, the issue(s) to be heard by the arbitrator shall solely and in its entirety be restricted to the issue(s) stated by Step 3.

In such case the parties shall use the selection process described in Section D. above to select two arbitrators. The first arbitrator will be selected to hear the issues of arbitrability and the second arbitrator will be selected to decide the merits of the case if the issues are determined to be arbitrable. Unless either party requests a full and complete arbitration proceeding on the arbitrability issue, the first arbitrator shall issue either a bench decision, or upon either party’s request, a written decision with 7 calendar days of the completion of the arbitrability hearing. In the event that the first arbitrator, as a result of the hearing referenced above determines a matter to be
- 8 -
arbitrable, the first arbitrator shall have no authority to decide the issues pursuant to the merits of the case. A hearing on the merits of the case will be scheduled with the second arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.
3.	If, following the University's acknowledgement of UPTE's appeal to arbitration in A.8.b, the University raises for the first time issue(s) of arbitrability a single hearing on the issue of arbitrability and the substantive facts will be held, unless the parties agree otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the grievance to be not arbitrable, the substantive facts of the case need not be heard and the grievance shall be denied. If the arbitrator finds in favor of arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive issues raised.
4.	Section E.1. and Section E.2. above, shall not prevent the parties from agreeing in writing to combine the arbitrability hearing with the hearing on the merits of the case.
5.	If the union requests a postponement of the scheduled arbitration hearing following the University's raising issue(s) of arbitrability, the hearings on arbitrability and facts, if any, shall be separate, and the provisions of Section E.3. above, shall apply.

ARTICLE 4 CAMPUS CLOSURE
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	Consistent with its management rights, the University has the sole, non-grievable right to curtail or shut down some or all of its activities, on a location-by-location basis, for periods of specific duration. By way of example and not limitation, such curtailment periods may represent: opportunities for energy/cost savings; adjustments to reduce levels of work activity due to transition periods in the academic calendar; “seasonal” or “holiday” influences on scheduled work activities; the occurrence at or on University facilities of major public events; and/or the occurrence of emergency or “forces of nature” situations adversely affecting normal University operations.
2.	When feasible, the University shall provide UPTE and affected members of the bargaining unit with 45 calendar days advance notice of a closure. In the event an alleged violation of the notice is grieved/arbitrated, any remedy or arbitrator’s award or decision acknowledging improper notice shall be limited to an amount of back pay and/or reinstatement of benefits which would make employees whole for the number of days the notice was deficient.
B.	PAY STATUS
During a total or partial closure or curtailment of operations described in Section A., above, whether or not the University is able to anticipate such event, one or a combination of the following pay-status options may apply to affected employees.
1.	Employees may elect to use accumulated vacation leave during the closure period. Newly-employed unit members will be allowed to use accrued vacation even if the required six continuous months or quadriweekly cycles on pay status have not been completed. Employees without sufficient accrued vacation time will be allowed to use up to three days vacation leave prior to actual accrual.
2.	Employees may elect to use accrued compensatory time to cover the scheduled time off or to offset the use of vacation time.
3.	Employees who do not use vacation or compensatory time off may elect to take a leave without pay during the closure. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 41, Vacation, and Article 36, Sick Leave, if an employee is in leave-without-pay status due to a location closure which is three consecutive days or less in duration, such a full-time or part-time employee shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave at her/his normal rate.

C.
UNPAID STATUS
Employees who do not select from Section B1., 2., or 3., above or who do not qualify for Section B.1., 2., or 3., above, shall, for the period of time necessary, be placed in a leave-without-pay status. The hourly accrual provisions in Section B.3. above, related to location closure(s) shall also apply to employees who are placed in leave-without-pay status.

The parties recognize that the actual salary rate adjustment may vary slightly due to rounding. For contract year 2003-2004, the processing shall occur as soon as practicable but not more than 90 calendar days following the first pay date following the effective date of this agreement.
2.	Salary increases, when provided, will be provided to eligible non-probationary employees in career HX positions whose salary is not at the maximum of their respective salary range and in accordance with a and b below.
a.	During the term of this agreement, any Campus or Medical Center may, with a thirty-day notice to the union, and in accordance with campus procedures, implement a merit award program subject to availability of additional funding. The union may request to meet and discuss the implementation within the thirty-day notice period.
b.	Employees within the salary range who are not eligible for the full amount of the within range increase shall be compensated as follows:
1)	The employee’s individual salary rate shall be raised to the maximum of the range and the amount above the range shall be paid in a one-time, non-base building lump sum and coded in the payroll system as covered_compensation, or
2)	The employee’s individual salary rate shall be raised to the maximum of the range and the amount above the range shall be paid as a base building increase above the maximum of the range or
3)	The maximum of the classification range shall be increased to encompass the full value of the increase the employee would have received had the employee not been at the top or near the top of the previous range.
The selection of option 1), 2) or 3) above shall be at the non-grievable, non-arbitrable discretion of the campus or Medical Center.
3.	Salary ranges will be adjusted in accordance with Appendix A, effective July 1, 2003 or nearest bi-weekly pay date.

B.	ZONE COMPENSATION
The salary ranges for the HX unit shall be a zone-based structure. A zone is a subdivision of the range establishing a minimum salary rate that corresponds to years of continuous UC experience in the current HX bargaining unit classification at the campus/Medical Center or continuous experience in the HX bargaining unit. When a salary range is adjusted, then the zone shall also be adjusted correspondingly.
1.	Zone Implementation:
a.	Initial zone placement of incumbents shall be at the sole non-grievable discretion of the University and shall be determined by each location based on years of continuous UC experience in the current campus/Medical Center bargaining unit classification or continuous experience in the HX bargaining unit. For rehired or inter-campus transfers, most recent date of hire at the current campus/Medical Center will be used.
b.	Employees shall be guaranteed initial placement to at least the minimum of their respective zone as determined in Section B of this Article and shall be placed within three years from the date of the agreement.
c.	Zone placement will be adjusted annually, if applicable, effective July 1 (or the nearest biweekly pay date) of each contract year. If the employee’s performance is rated as less than satisfactory in the most recent performance evaluation, then the University may determine not to move the employee to the next zone.
d.	Pharmacist job family classifications shall be exempt from the zone compensation program.
e.	Upon upward reclassification and/or promotion an employee shall receive a salary increase to the minimum of the range of the new classification or 5%, whichever is greater.

ARTICLE 6
CORRECTIVE ACTION, DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
Corrective Action is an action designed to improve conduct or performance, which does not involve an adverse impact on rights, pay, or benefits. Discipline is an action imposed on a non-probationary employee when corrective action has proven ineffectual or when the employee's misconduct or failure to perform satisfactorily is serious enough to warrant discipline. The University has the authority to discharge or to take other appropriate disciplinary action against a non-probationary employee for just cause.
B.	TYPE OF ACTIVITY
The University may use an oral reprimand or counseling memorandum as corrective action. Discipline may involve a written warning, suspension without pay for up to five working days without prior notice, suspension beyond five working days with notice, salary reduction, demotion for failure to meet performance standards, as defined in Section C., below, or discharge. Employees who are suspended without pay for up to five working days, and who wish to contest the suspension, must grieve within the time limits established by the grievance procedure of this Agreement. Corrective actions are not subject to the grievance or arbitration procedures of this Agreement.
C.	DEMOTION
The University may demote an employee to a lower classification, with concurrent reassignment to work of lesser duties and responsibilities, based on a demonstrated failure to meet the performance standards of the higher classification. Such action shall take place only after reasonable attempts to correct the deficient performance have failed. Demotion shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.
D.	INVESTIGATORY LEAVE
The University may place an employee on investigatory leave with pay in order to review or investigate allegations of conduct which, in the University's view, would warrant relieving the employee immediately from all work duties. An investigatory leave with pay shall not be considered corrective action or discipline as defined in this Article.
E.	NOTICE
1.	When the University intends to suspend for more than five working days, reduce an employee’s salary for more than 30 working days, demote, or discharge an employee, written notice of its intent shall be given to the employee. Such notice shall be made either by delivery of the notice to the employee in person, or by placing the notice of intent in the United States mail with first class postage paid in an envelope addressed to the employee at her/his last known home address. In either case, a copy of the notice of intent shall be sent by United States mail, first class postage paid, to UPTE. It shall be the responsibility of the employee to inform the University in writing of any change of home address. Whether delivery is made in person or by mail, the notice of intent shall contain a proof of service indicating the date on which the notice of intent was personally delivered or mailed. Such date of personal delivery or mailing shall be the "date of issuance" of the notice of intent.
2.	The notice shall:
a.	Inform the employee of the action intended, the reason for the disciplinary action and the effective date of the action;
b.	Include a copy of the charge and material upon which the charge is based; and
- 18 -
c.
Inform the employee of the right to respond and to whom to respond within the time limit in Section F., below, either orally or in writing in accordance with Section F., below.
F.	EMPLOYEE RESPONSE
1.	The employee shall be entitled to respond, orally or in writing, to the notice of intent described in Section E., above. If the written notice of intent is delivered in person to the employee, the employee's response must be received within ten calendar days from the date of issuance, in accordance with instructions given by the University in the written notice. If the written notice of intent is mailed to the employee and UPTE, the employee's response must be received within 14 calendar days from the date of issuance.
2.	After review of the employee's timely response, if any, the University shall notify the employee of any action to be taken. Such action to be taken may not include discipline more severe than that described in the notice of intent; however, the University may reduce such discipline without the issuance of a further notice of intent. When such action includes a suspension without pay for five days or longer, a copy of the letter of discipline/suspension will be sent concurrently to UPTE.
G.	PERSONNEL RECORDS
1.	A counseling memorandum may be placed in the employee's personnel records.
2.	A copy of a written warning given or mailed to an employee shall be placed in the employee's personnel records. The University agrees that written warning shall be accompanied by a proof of service. Written warning shall be destroyed after two consecutive years during which there have been no further written warnings issued to the employee.
3.	There shall be no charge for the first copy of the contents of the employee's personnel file.
H.	REPRESENTATION
1.	A non-probationary employee shall have the right of representation at any scheduled investigatory meeting the outcome of which may be a disciplinary act of written warning, suspension without pay, demotion or discharge. The University shall advise an employee of any scheduled investigatory meeting the outcome of which may be a written warning, suspension without pay, disciplinary demotion or discharge. An employee may request a representative of the employee's choice other than a University employee who has been designated as supervisory, managerial, or confidential to be present when there is reason to believe that a meeting may result in disciplinary action as defined above. If the employee's preferred representative is not available to attend a meeting scheduled by the University, the employee shall arrange for an alternative representative for the meeting. If no alternative representative can be found for the scheduled meeting, the University may reschedule the meeting within eight calendar days, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
2.	The term "meeting" does not include the occasion in which the University only presents an employee with written confirmation of the results of the prior meeting referenced in Section H.1., above.
ARTICLE 7

2.	UPTE may change the amounts to be deducted from unit employees’ pay once per calendar year. Any annual changes in the amounts to be deducted for UPTE dues or agency fees shall be certified to the University, in writing, at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the effective date of such change.

The payment of fair share fees and union dues through payroll deduction will continue even if the collective bargaining agreement expires.
1.	Union Dues
a.	The University will deduct from the pay of union members who have submitted a written individual authorization for the deduction of union dues, the monthly amount certified by the Union to be the dues required for the employee’s membership in the Union.

b.	Dues deductions shall be effective following the University’s receipt of the authorization form and completion of the appropriate programming and/or payroll changes.
c.	An employee may at any time cancel her/his authorization for payroll dues deduction by presenting her or his written request for termination and cancellation to the designated University office. The University will send a copy of the written request for cancellation of dues deduction to UPTE.

1)	UPTE shall determine the validity of the employee’s status as a conscientious objector.
2)	If UPTE agrees to the objector status of the employee it shall provide monthly to the University proof of payments made to Charitable Organizations.
C.	PROCESSING PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS FOR DUES AND FEES
1.	For each dues/fee deduction check submitted to UTPE, each campus/lab/hospital shall deduct from the total dues amount remitted, an administrative fee of $.07 per employee for who dues deductions are being made in addition to $10.00 for each check remitted. These costs will continue to be charged to UPTE on an ongoing basis.
- 20 -
2.	Each campus/lab/hospital shall remit to UPTE, in the form of a check to an address designated by UPTE, an amount representing the dues/fees deductions less any reduction(s) referenced in Section C.1. above. Accompanying the check shall be a standard electronic and printed deduction report, which shall contain by campus/lab/hospital, by local number, an alphabetical listing of the UPTE unit members for who payroll deductions were made. The report shall include the employee identification number, employee name, bargaining unit code, campus code, employee within unit salary, and amount withheld. Any costs associated with changing the deduction report referenced above shall be fully paid by UPTE. The report shall be provided electronically via the FTP site.
D.	CORRECTION OF ERRORS
1.	If the University fails to make appropriate authorized payroll dues or fee deductions, or any part thereof, the University shall correct the deduction amounts within 30 days of notice from the Union.
2.	If the University’s error resulted in deductions less than the correct amount, the University shall make the additional required deductions to make up the difference between the actual and correct amounts in accordance with current payroll policy regarding additional deductions. However, additional deductions shall not exceed two times the normal dues amount in any given pay period.
3.	If the error results in payment of more than the correct amount and the Union has received the funds, the Union shall reimburse the employees accordingly.
E.	OTHER DEDUCTIONS
Payroll deductions shall be made for UPTE-sponsored programs pursuant to the provisions of the University’s Accounting Manual requirements. For insured benefit programs the section of the Accounting Manual entitled "Special Regulations for Non-University Insured Benefit Program” applies. For other than insured benefit programs the section of the Accounting Manual entitled "Employee Organizations" applies.
F.	INDEMNIFICATION
It is specifically agreed that the University assumes no obligation other than that specified in §A., above, or liability, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article. UPTE shall inform the University when the amount of the monthly dues changes. Such notice should be sent in time to provide for appropriate programming. Further, UPTE hereby agrees that it will reimburse the University for any cost and indemnify and hold the University harmless from any claims, actions, or proceedings by any person or entity, arising from deductions made by the University pursuant to this Article.

c.	The grievance form (see Appendix H) shall be furnished to the employee by either UPTE or the University designee, although failure of a University Representative to provide a grievance form upon request shall not constitute cause for an extension of the time lines for filing, nor shall the employee of UPTE be able to grieve the University’s failure to provide a grievance form.
1)	Only one subject matter shall be covered in any one grievance. A formal grievance must identify the specific Article(s) and section(s) of this Agreement alleged to have been violated; describe the action(s) which allegedly violated the identified Article(s) and Section(s), together with the date(s) of the action(s); and describe the remedy requested.

F.
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE - FORMAL REVIEW
1.	Step 1:
a.	All grievances (individual, group, or union) must be filed either by U.S. mail or hand delivery, and received by the Labor Relations Office at the campus/hospital/laboratory which employs the grievant(s) within 30 calendar days after the date on which the employee or UPTE knew or could be expected to know of the event or action giving rise to the grievance. Informal attempts of settlement to resolve shall not extend time limits including the initial 30 day filing limit.
b.	Grievances received after the filing deadline will be processed solely for the purposes of determining whether the grievance was untimely. Any formal grievance which is not received in accordance Section F.1., or this section, shall be reviewed only in accordance with the review procedures in Section Q.
c.	University Review:
1)	The University's written response will be issued to the grievant and the representative, if any, within 15 calendar days after the formal grievance is filed. If the response is not issued within this time limit, or if the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievance may proceed to Step 2.
2)	Resolution of the grievance at Step 1 or earlier, although final, shall not be precedent-setting.
d.	Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedures:
1.	An employee alleging sexual harassment may elect to substitute a campus/hospital/laboratory Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure for Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure. An employee who elects to use the Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure may return to the grievance procedure only if they filed a grievance within the 30-day time limit for filing. An employee who elects to resume the regular grievance procedure in place of the Sexual Harassment Complaint Resolution Procedure shall do so by sending written notice to the University. The University's Step 1 Grievance response will be issued within 15 calendar days after the notice is received by the designated University official.
2.	Grievances that allege a violation involving sexual harassment may, at the grievant’s option, enter the grievance procedure at Step 2.
2.	Step 2
a.	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the grievant or the Union may proceed to Step 2 by filing a written appeal with the Labor Relations Office within 15 calendar days of the date the written response is issued or, if not issued, is due.
b.	Unless the parties agree otherwise, the designated University local official shall convene a meeting with the grievant(s) and the grievant's representative, if any, to attempt to resolve the grievance. The meeting shall be convened no later than 15 calendar days following receipt of the appeal to Step 2. During the Step 2 meeting, the parties shall discuss information and contentions relative to the grievance.
c.	During the Step 2 process, the parties may agree in writing to amend the alleged violations stated in the original grievance.
- 24 -
d.	If requested by the grievant, a second UPTE representative may participate in the Step 2 meeting. In the event a second UPTE representative attends, only one representative may actively participate in the grievance meeting, and the University shall pay release time for only one representative.
e.	If a grievance that alleges a violation of Article 6 - Corrective Action, Discipline and Discharge only is not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2, UPTE may appeal directly to arbitration in accordance with Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure.

3.	Step 3
a.	All grievances that are not satisfactorily resolved at Step 2 may be appealed to Step 3. The appeal must be filed with the Director of Labor Relations in the Office of the President within 15 calendar days of the date the University’s Step 2 written answer was issued or, if no University answer was issued, within 15 calendar days of the date the University’s answer was due.
b.	The Step 3 appeal shall identify all unresolved issues, alleged violations and remedies and shall be signed and dated by the grievant or their representative. The subject of the grievance as stated at Step 2 shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter of the appeal to Step 3.
c.	The Office of the President Office of Labor Relations official shall issue the University's written answer to a Step 3 appeal within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the appeal. The answer will be issued to the grievant when self-represented, or to the employee’s representative.

Such a grievance must be filed within 30 calendar days of the action that gave rise to the grievance.
4.	Appeals to Arbitration
If an appeal to arbitration is not post marked or hand delivered within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the University's step 3 answer, section C. of this article shall apply.
G.	UNION GRIEVANCES
UPTE shall have the right to present grievances under this procedure on behalf of an individual employee, on behalf of a group of employees, or on behalf of itself. It shall be the Union’s responsibility to inform an employee that it is bringing a grievance.
H.	GROUP GRIEVANCE
A group grievance is defined as a grievance that covers more than one employee, and that involves like circumstances and facts. A group grievance must be so identified on the grievance form at Step 1. If an employee wishes to withdraw from a group grievance represented by UPTE, the employee shall notify UPTE. UPTE shall in turn notify the University in writing if the employee is to be withdrawn.

Settlement offers made at any stage of this procedure, including informal resolution, shall not be introduced as evidence in subsequent steps, and shall not be precedent setting.
K.	RETROACTIVITY
Settlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as equities of a particular case may demand. In any case where it is determined that the settlement shall be applied retroactively, except for the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall not in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than 30 calendar days prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step 1.
L.	EXCLUSIVE PROCEDURE
The Grievance Procedure set out in this Article shall be exclusive and shall replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the alleged violation of this Agreement.

Q.	REVIEW OF GRIEVANCES CLOSED FOR PROCEDURAL DEFECTS
When the University determines a grievance is ineligible for further processing due to procedural defects, including but not limited to timeliness, UPTE may make a written appeal to the Office of the President Labor Relations within 30 days of the postmark of the notification to the grievant(s). This appeal is solely limited to a review of the procedural issue(s).

2)	The employee(s) who has been designated for layoff in accordance with Section D.2.c.1), above, shall be provided all rights under Section D.4., and Section D.5., below, beginning at the time of notification of Indefinite layoff.
d.	Where electronic job placement bulleting boards are in use, the University shall provide bargaining unit members access to such placement bulletin boards to the same degree as such bulletin boards are made available to other staff employees.

1)	For indefinite layoff, the University shall give 60 calendar days notice if feasible. The University may pay up to 30 days of the 60 day notice period in lieu of notice. In no event shall an employee receive less than 30 day notice of indefinite layoff.

5)	If an employee refuses an offer of reemployment at the same or greater appointment rate, at the same or higher salary level as determined by the salary range maximum, and at the same or higher rate of pay earned by the employee at the time of layoff within ten (10) calendar days, or

Previous time on layoff status prior to rehire shall be deducted from the employee’s period of eligibility.
e.	The right to preference for reemployment terminates:
1)	Upon the employee’s retirement; or
2)	At the end of the eligibility period; or
3)	If a HX employee refuses recall under the provisions of Section D.4., Recall, above; or

A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	The University retains the right to subcontract all or any portion of operations. When the University decides to subcontract, and such subcontract will result in the layoff of employees in the bargaining unit, the University will provide UPTE with a copy of the Request for Proposals (RFP) seven (7) calendar days after it is issued. In the event no RFP is issued and the subcontract will result in bargaining unit employee layoffs, the University will give at least sixty (60) calendar days notice prior to the commencement of work by the contractor.
2.	Prior to the commencement of the work that has been subcontracted and following receipt of a timely request from UPTE, the University shall meet with UPTE to discuss the effects of subcontracting upon bargaining unit employees who may be laid off. Failure to conclude such discussions, if any, prior to the date on which the subcontracted work begins, shall not preclude the University from implementing the subcontracting on the date agreed upon by the University and the subcontractor or the layoff of employees pursuant to Article 13 - Layoff and Reduction in Time.
B.	DISPLACEMENT OF EMPLOYEES
1.	Except as provided below, the University of California will not contract out services that result in the layoff of non-probationary career bargaining unit employees.
2.	Examples of instances in which a contract for such services may be appropriate include:
a.	The need to obtain special services and equipment that are not available internally;
b.	The need to obtain special expertise or efficiencies that are better provided through an outside contractor than by the University; and
c.	Financial necessity.
3.	Where financial necessity is the reason for the exception, before contracting for work which is fully or partially supported from state funds, including those at the teaching hospitals, the University shall first seek funding from the Legislature to address the financial necessity.
4.	When the University has determined to contract for services it will provide UPTE with a copy of any RFP within 7 calendar days after it is issued pursuant to A.2., above. Such notice shall demonstrate the appropriateness for the contract, in accordance with section B., above.
a.	If UPTE asks to meet with the University about the proposed contract for services, such a meeting will occur as soon as practicable following the University’s receipt of the request. The meeting will not delay the commencement of the contract.
b.	If UPTE believes that the University failed to comply with the provisions of Section B., above, it can file a formal complaint with the Office of the President, Office of Labor Relations. The office of the President shall make the final determination as to whether the
- 81 -
contract meets the conditions in Section B. The Office of the President decision is not grievable or arbitrable.
C.	EFFECT OF CONTRACT ON EMPLOYEES
To minimize the effects of layoff, when a non-probationary career bargaining unit employee is notified of layoff because the University entered into a contract for services that the employee performed, the University will make available another bargaining unit position for which the employee is qualified. The position will be at the same campus/hospital/Laboratory from which the employee was laid of. Where the provisions in this article are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 13 - Layoff and Reduction in Time, the provisions of this Article and Section shall control.
1.	The available position shall be offered at the same duration, percent time, and appointment type held by the employee when displaced.
2.	The available position shall be offered at the same base rate of pay earned by he employee when displaced.
3.	The right to be offered a position pursuant to this section shall begin on the date an employee is notified of layoff (displacement).
4.	The right of the displaced non-probationary career employee to be offered a position pursuant to his section shall terminate upon acceptance or refusal of the offered position at the same base rate of pay.
5.	A displaced non-probationary career employee who refuses an offered position at the same base rate of pay shall be placed in layoff status.
D.	LEGISLATION/SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET LANGUAGE
The language of this Article will be effective only when the Supplemental Report to the 2001 Budget for the State of California or any comparable successor act is not in effect. To the extent this Article is in conflict with legislation regarding subcontracting at the University, the legislation shall control.
E.	Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prohibiting action, which must be taken to establish or maintain eligibility for any federal program, contract or grant - including the contract requirements contained in the agreement between the University and the Department of Energy - where ineligibility would result in a loss of federal funds to the University of California.

UNIVERSITY BENEFITS
A.	GENERAL CONDITIONS
1.	Eligible employees may participate in a number of benefit programs generally available to other eligible employees of the University.

B.	RETURN FROM WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS LEAVE
When possible, an employee granted a Work-Incurred Injury or Illness Leave must provide the University with 30 days notice of his/her ability to return to work. Upon receipt of the release to return to work, the University shall either reinstate the employee to the same or a similar position in the same department or will determine what accommodation, if any, will be reasonably provided upon expiration of the leave.

3.	The additional payment made to an employee to provide the employee with full salary prior to receipt of disability payments shall be deemed an advance temporary disability payment within the Workers' Compensation Act. An employee who receives an advance temporary disability payment shall reimburse the University for such payment. The reimbursement is used to restore the proportionate sick leave and vacation credit as appropriate.
D.	EXTENDED SICK LEAVE
1.	An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments on account of a work-related injury or illness and who has exhausted all accumulated sick leave shall receive extended sick leave payments from the University in an amount equal to the difference between payments from Workers' Compensation and 80% of basic salary plus any shift differential which the employee would have received. If such employee returns to part-time University duties, the earnings plus any temporary disability payments, if less than 80% of basic salary plus shift differential, shall be supplemented to 80% by extended sick leave payments, provided the employee continues to be medically authorized for Workers' Compensation temporary disability. Total extended sick leave payments shall not exceed 26 weeks for any one injury or illness.
2.	An eligible employee who does not have sufficient accumulated sick leave to cover the three calendar days' waiting period for receiving Workers' Compensation payments shall receive extended sick leave payment to cover any part of the waiting period not covered by sick leave.

E.	EFFECT ON OTHER CONTRACT PROVISIONS
1.	An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and supplemental sick leave or vacation as provided in Section C., above, is considered on regular pay status for all purposes except completion of the probationary period. Sick leave and vacation accumulated during this period may be used as soon as they are accumulated.
2.	An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and extended sick leave benefits as provided in Section D., above, is considered to be on regular pay status for all purposes except completion of the probationary period.

If the employee separates from University employment without returning to work, no payment shall be made for such vacation credit.
4.	An employee shall not use vacation, sick leave, or extended sick leave to supplement Workers' Compensation payments beyond a predetermined date of separation or leave without pay. Any vacation credit remaining on the date of separation shall be paid on a lump-sum basis.
