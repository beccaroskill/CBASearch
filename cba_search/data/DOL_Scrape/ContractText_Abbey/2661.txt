engage in lawful concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. As a duly elected body exercising governmental power under color of law of the State of Wisconsin, the Board undertakes and agrees that it will not directly or indirectly discourage or deprive or coerce any teacher in the enjoyment of any rights conferred by the act or other laws of Wisconsin or the Constitutions of Wisconsin and the United States; that it will not discriminate against any teacher with respect to hours, wages, or any terms or conditions of employment by reason of his/her membership in the Association, his/her participation in any activities of the Association or collective bargaining or negotiations with the Board, or his/her institution of any grievance, complaint or proceeding under this Agreement, or otherwise with respect to any terms or conditions of employment.
B.	If negotiation meetings between the Board and the Association are scheduled during a school day, five (5) members of the Association's negotiating team will be relieved of all regular duties without loss of pay, as necessary, in order to permit their participation in such meetings; and the Association shall pay for one-half (V2) of any substitute teacher cost.
C.	In order for the Association to properly administer this Agreement for the benefit of the teachers and the welfare of the school system, the Association will have access to all school buildings and to all teachers, provided that the exercise of this right will not interfere with the educational program. The Association will furnish the Board with a list of authorized representatives within ten (10) days following ratification of this Agreement, provided, however, that the Association may, from time to time, modify such list in writing.
D.	The Board will, consistent with its statutory duty to collectively bargain with the Association as the bargaining representative of the teachers, and within its legal obligation to provide information and data, provide the Association with access to any public document which may be necessary for the Association to formulate programs or process grievances under this Agreement.
E.	The Association will be provided, upon request, with copies of minutes of official Board meetings and all other documents related to matters set forth in Section D above that are distributed to Board members at official meetings as soon as possible after such meeting.

F.	The Association has the following rights:
1.	The Association and its representatives shall have the right to use school buildings and facilities for organizational meetings and activities directly related to the Association's responsibilities and functions as the exclusive collective bargaining representative, at reasonable hours and locations, provided that such use does not interfere with school functions or activities or previously scheduled community activities. The time and place of all meetings shall be arranged in advance with the building principal. The Association will pay any additional cost necessitated by such use.
2.	The Association shall have the right to post matters directly related to its responsibilities and functions as the exclusive collective bargaining representative on existing bulletin boards in the faculty lounges in each school building.
3.	The Association shall have the right, subject to all applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Postal Service, to communicate with bargaining unit members regarding matters directly related to its responsibilities and functions as the exclusive bargaining representative through use of the interschool mail service and the teacher mailboxes. Copies of all such material will be given to the building principal, but his/her advance

approval will not be required. The Association will also have the right to use the interschool mail to distribute material of the aforesaid type, provided that such material shall not be detrimental to the school nor to individuals involved in administration of the District.
G.	Dues Deduction and Fair Share
1.	It is agreed and understood by and between the parties hereto that the Board will deduct from the annual earnings of all those teachers who have on file with the District a voluntary written dues deduction authorization signed by the teacher, the amount of the Association's dues as certified in writing by the Association to the District, subject to the following conditions:
a.	Dues shall be deducted:
1)	In the case of a teacher who is employed before the commencement of school in any school year, commencing with the first pay period in September, one twentieth (1/20) of the dues certified by the Association as the current annual dues uniformly required of all teachers; and
2)	In the case of a teacher who is employed after the commencement of the school year, an amount of the current annual dues uniformly required of all teachers computed on a prorated semi-monthly basis for each semi-monthly pay period.
b.	Such written authorization by a teacher may be revoked by the teacher by written notice to the Association and the District during the thirty (30) day period immediately prior to the anniversary date of such written authorization. In the absence of such revocation, sent and received in accordance with the foregoing, the authorization shall be renewed for additional yearly periods.
c.	Any change in the amount of dues to be deducted shall be certified by the Association to the District no later than one (1) week before the effective date of such change.
d.	In the event a teacher leaves the employ of the District before the required number of semi-monthly dues installments have been deducted, or in the event an unforeseen circumstance causes the individual to receive no paycheck or a paycheck which is not sufficient to cover the dues deduction before the necessary semi-monthly installments have been deducted, the Association shall assume the responsibility for any further amounts due it.

ARTICLE V
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
A.	Definitions.
1.	A "Grievance" is a claim based upon an event or condition which affects the wages, hours, and conditions of employment of a teacher, group of teachers or the Association as to the interpretation, meaning or application of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
2.	A "grievant" may be a teacher, group of teachers, or the Association.
3.	A "Party in Interest" is the aggrieved person and any person who might be required to
take action or against whom action might be taken in order to resolve the claim.
B.	Purpose.
The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, equitable solutions to the problems, which may from time to time arise affecting the welfare or working conditions of teachers.
C.	General Procedures.
1.	Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated at each level should be considered as a maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits specified may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.
2.	In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school term, which, if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school term, could result in irreparable harm to a party in interest, the parties agree to make a good faith effort to reduce the time limits set forth herein so that the grievance procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school term or as soon thereafter as is practicable.
3.	In the event a grievance is filed so that sufficient time as stipulated under all levels of the procedure cannot be provided before the last day of this Agreement, should it be necessary to pursue the grievance to all levels of the appeals, then said grievance shall be resolved under the terms of this Agreement and this Article, and not under the succeeding Agreement.
4.	At all levels of a grievance, after it has been formally presented, at least one (1) member of the Association shall attend any meetings, hearings, appeals, or other proceedings required to process the grievance.
D.	Initiation and Processing.
1.	Level One. The grievant may first discuss his/her grievance with his/her immediate supervisor. If such discussion does not provide a satisfactory resolution, the grievant may formalize his/her grievance in writing. The grievant must file his/her grievance in writing with his/her principal or immediate supervisor either directly or through the
Page 12 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
Association's designated representative, within forty-five (45) days except in instances in a suspension or discharge in which the grievant must file his/her grievance in writing within fifteen (15) days after the facts upon which the grievance is based became known, or the act or condition on which the grievance is based became known, or the act or condition on which the grievance is based occurred. If in any event the grievance is not filed within this forty-five (45) day or fifteen (15) day time frame, respectively, then the grievance will be considered as waived. A dispute as to whether a grievance has been waived under this paragraph shall be subject to arbitration pursuant to this Article. The principal or immediate supervisor shall give a written response, along with the reasons, to the grievant within five (5) school days of receipt of the written grievance.
2.	Level Two. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Level One, the grievant may appeal to the Superintendent in writing within five (5) school days after the receipt of the decision at Level One. The Superintendent will meet with the grievant and an Association representative in an attempt to resolve the grievance within ten (10) school days after receipt of the appeal. A written decision, along with the reasons, shall be given to the grievant within the same ten (10) day period, beginning from the date of receipt of the appeal.
3.	Level Three. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Level Two, he/she may after receipt of the decision by the Superintendent request that the Association submit his/her grievance to arbitration. Submission of the grievance by the Association to arbitration shall be to the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) with a copy to the District Superintendent. Such submission shall be made within five (5) school days after receipt of the decision by the Superintendent or fifteen (15) school days after he/she has appealed to the Superintendent, whichever is sooner. The WERC shall submit a panel of five (5) names from the WERC staff to the parties who will then be bound by the rules and procedures of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (WERC) in the selection of an arbitrator and the conduct of the arbitration procedures. However, the arbitrator shall render the award promptly, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, not later than thirty (30) days from the date of closing the hearings, or if oral hearings have been waived, then from the date of transmitting the final statement and proofs to the arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator, in either case, will be final and binding upon the parties. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to or subtract from or modify any term(s) of this Agreement. The cost of the arbitrator and the transcript shall be split equally between the parties.
4.	Initiation of Group Grievances. If, in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a group or class of teachers, the Association may submit such grievance in writing to the Superintendent directly and the processing of such grievance will be commenced at Level Two. The Association shall designate the individuals for whom the grievance is being processed at the time of filing.
E.	Rights of Teachers to Representation.
1.	No reprisals of any kind will be taken by the Board or by any member of the administration against any party in interest, any Association representative, or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
Page 13 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
2.	Nothing herein contained shall be construed as limiting the right of any individual teacher, or any group of teachers having a grievance, from presenting, in person, or through representatives of their own choosing, such grievance to any appropriate member of the administration, and having such grievance adjusted without intervention of the Association provided the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Association has been given the opportunity to be present at such adjustment and to state its views. Such grievant shall be liable for the one-half (^) of any arbitration costs which would have been paid by the Association had it processed the grievance. No individual teacher or group of teachers may process a grievance beyond Level Two without the written consent of the Association.
3.	Any party in interest may be represented by himself/herself, or at his/her option by a representative selected by the Association. When a teacher is not represented by the Association, the Association shall have the right to be present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure.
F.	Grievance Mediation.
Upon processing a grievance to arbitration, the parties may agree to grievance mediation prior to the selection of any arbitrator. In grievance mediation, each side shall make an informal oral presentation of the case along with any stipulated documentation. The mutually agreed upon mediator shall render an advisory opinion to the parties on the merits of the case. The grievance mediator shall not serve as arbitrator of the grievance should it be processed further to final and binding arbitration. In the event the grievance is not resolved by mediation, it may be moved to arbitration within ten (10) days of the mediator's advisory opinion. The oral advisory opinion shall be issued immediately upon the conclusion of the oral presentation and shall not be communicated or in any manner revealed to the arbitrator of the grievance.
G.	Miscellaneous.
1.	Decisions rendered at Levels One and Two of the grievance procedure will be in writing setting forth the decision and the reasons therefore and will be transmitted promptly to all parties in interest and to the Association. Decisions rendered at Level Three will be in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section D-3 of this Article.
2.	The documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of grievances shall not be placed in any individual's personnel file and shall not be used when making evaluations of teachers' performance, recommendations for promotions or job applications, or when considering renewal of employment contracts.
3.	When it is necessary at Level Two or Level Three for a representative or representatives designated by the Association to attend a meeting or hearing called by the Superintendent or his/her designee during the school day, the Superintendent's Office shall so notify the immediate supervisor of such Association representatives; and the representative(s) shall be released without loss of pay for such time as his/their attendance is required at such meeting or hearing.

f.	Documentation will only be required where the employee’s total deferrals (and Age 50+) for the calendar year are in excess of the 402(g) limits;
g.	The employee agrees to provide documentation certifying compliance with applicable IRS rules and regulations from the employee’s TSA vendor within thirty (30) calendar days, if requested by the District;

rollovers, and permitted service credit transfers into and out of the Plan to the extent permitted by the Plan; and
m.	The salary reduction agreements, the District’s TSA Plan and administrative procedures, and vendor agreements are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference and may not be modified except by agreement of both the District and the Association.

The District will provide the association with reasonable notice concerning any such modification.
9.	Professional Liability Insurance
The Board shall continue to provide for teacher professional liability insurance and employee errors and omission insurance under not less than the existing provisions and at not less than the current limits of five million (5,000,000) dollars respectively.
10.	Worker's Compensation Insurance
a.	If a teacher employed by the District becomes entitled to Worker's Compensation pursuant to Chapter 102 of the Wisconsin Statutes, the Board shall continue to pay the teacher's full salary during the period of disability, whether or not such period extends beyond the teacher's term of employment, up to a maximum of one hundred and ninety (190) workdays; however, such payment of full salary shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amounts paid to the teacher as worker's compensation. This provision shall not be in addition to the benefits set forth in Article VII, Section A-1.
b.	Benefits paid to the teacher by the District shall not result in the loss of any accumulated sick leave benefits.
11.	Insurance Committee
a. The Board and the Association shall establish a permanent Joint Insurance Committee. Such Joint Insurance Committee shall be comprised of six (6) members, two (2) of whom shall be appointed by the President of the Association, one (1) of whom shall be a representative of AFSCME, and three (3) of whom shall be appointed by the Board. The Board and the Unions shall each appoint one (1) member for a one (1) year, one (1) member for a two (2) year and one (1) member for a three (3) year term.

1)	Study existing insurance programs available to District employees and recommend the specifications for continuing or changing such program(s) that it feels are appropriate or meritorious both to the Board and the Unions prior to the commencement of negotiations each year; and
2)	Act as an Appeals Committee. An appeal is a request for binding third (3rd) party review of the denial of benefits, whether by predetermination authorization, which is required for work in excess of two hundred (200) dollars, or by the failure to pay benefits by the underwriter of the dental program. The Committee, acting as an Appeals Committee, shall make a full and complete review of each appeal and issue its decision, in

writing, within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written request for an appeal, unless circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case the decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of a request for review. As of July 1, 2008, the District and the Association will include as part of the Appeals Committee a third party impartial mediator, who is mutually agreed upon.

Page 33 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
2.	Teachers shall only be assigned to positions which they are legally qualified to hold. Teaching duties shall not be performed by personnel outside the teacher bargaining unit except in the case of day-to-day substitutes or where the District cannot otherwise offer course/program (e.g., if no qualified teacher can be found to teach Portuguese), the District could offer the course/program through a distance-learning option.
3.	Assignments will note:
a.	The school and grade level(s) for regular education elementary teachers;
b.	The school, grade, and subject area(s) for regular education Grade 6 middle school academic block teachers; for regular education Grade 6 academic block teachers filling vacancies subsequent to the 1997-98 school year, the assignment will note the school and grade;
c.	The school(s) and subject area(s) for grades 6-12 regular education teachers;
d.	The school(s) for kindergarten teachers; and
e.	The school(s) or location(s) and assignment for special area and special education teachers. (See Section B-1-d for a listing of the applicable positions for these areas.)
4.	Reassignments or transfers will follow the procedures set forth in Sections B and C of this Article.
B.	Voluntary Transfer and Reassignment
1.	For the purpose of this Agreement the following definitions apply:
a.	A "vacancy" shall be defined as any newly created unit position or a unit position previously held by a teacher, which the District intends to fill.
b.	A "transfer" shall be defined as the movement of a regular education teacher to a different building(s) or the movement of any teacher to a different teaching discipline (e.g., regular education to learning disabilities or vice versa). A voluntary transfer can only occur through the posting process.
c.	A "reassignment" shall be defined as a change of assignment for regular education teachers within a building. For special area and special education teachers, a reassignment shall be defined as a change of assignment within their current area (i.e., change of school site or grade level). Reassignments shall occur prior to the posting of any vacancies.
d.	Special area and special education teachers include:
1)	At the elementary and secondary level: library/media specialists, guidance counselors, ESL/Bilingual, Title I reading, social workers, school psychologists, speech/language pathologists, special education, program support (including supportive resource teachers, curriculum, ED, LD, CD, etc.), occupational therapists, and physical therapists.
2)	At the elementary level: Early Childhood Special Education, Head Start, physical education, vocal music, instrumental music, and art.
3)	At the secondary level: School Age Parent Program (SAPP).
2.	No vacant position shall be filled by a person not currently employed by the District as a "teacher" (bargaining unit employee) if a qualified teacher applies for such vacant position, provided, however, that a qualified teacher is available to fill the vacancy created by such transfer or reassignment. Teachers of the emotionally disturbed and English as a Second Language shall, after three (3) years of employment, be granted a transfer, if requested, to a different subject area for which they are certified even if a
Page 34 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
qualified teacher is not available to fill the vacancy created by such transfer provided they have more seniority than other applicants. (See Memorandum of Understanding, Appendix 8.) Special Education, ESL, ESL/Bilingual and Reading Recovery teachers hired after January 1, 2000, may not voluntarily transfer from the position for which they were hired for a period of three (3) years.
3.	No teacher shall be laid off or forced to remain on layoff status because of the voluntary transfer of a teacher from one area of certification to another.
4.	After internal reassignments have been made by the principal or supervisor, all known assignments for the next school year shall be made in writing to each teacher one week prior to the first arena staffing.
5.	Teachers who are in excess in a building when assignments for the following year are being made and are, therefore, "To Be Assigned" need to be assigned prior to any vacancies being filled from the outside. If additional positions subsequently become available prior to August 22 within the school from which they were excessed, the most senior excessed teacher(s) will have the right to return to said building.
6.	Teachers interested in voluntarily transferring into the Head Start program may apply at any time to the Head Start council for approval. However, an application must be made prior to March 1 of the year in which a transfer is sought. Subject to Federal regulations, the Head Start council will determine the standards necessary for approval. Subsequent to said approval the District will evaluate requests for transfer according to section D-1 of this Article.
7.	Teachers assigned to more than one (1) school shall have the ability to reassign in their home school only.
8.	Teachers with less than full-time contracts shall not be able to reassign to a vacancy within the building(s); and
9.	Job-share teachers will not be able to reassign out of a job-share to a vacancy within the building(s).
10.	When acting on requests to transfer, up to two (2) individuals, per year, who hold Varsity head coaching riders may, at the discretion of the District, be given preference on positions in the buildings in which they hold said head coaching riders. This clause takes precedence over all other clauses in this Article.
C.	Posting of Vacancies
1.	After assignments are determined for the ensuing school year and after reassignments have taken place, the District shall cause to be posted in all school buildings, including DOB, the following lists, which shall be bid upon at the first arena-staffing meeting and in subsequent postings:
a.	All known teacher vacancies in the District for the next school year.
b.	All administrative, departmental and unit leaders, and additional compensation vacancies for the next year.
The Superintendent shall, at the same time, cause copies of all lists to be mailed to the Association.
2.	Following the last arena-staffing meeting, the Superintendent shall cause to be posted regularly a listing of all additional vacancies. Teachers shall be given consideration for positions posted in C-1-a and b if an application is submitted on a form (See Appendix 6) that is available in each school building, the District Human Resources Office and the Association office. The form shall be submitted to the Human Resources Office
Page 35 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
within five (5) days of each posting. If offered a position, the teacher must confirm or reject the offer immediately. If a teacher is the most senior qualified candidate on multiple postings, he/she shall be given the opportunity to select the position of his/her choice.
3.	All notices of vacancies shall contain the date of posting, a description of the position, including grade level, subject area and specific courses to be taught, name and location of the school, certification requirements of the position, name of person to whom the application is to be returned and date by which the application is to be returned. In no case shall such date be less than five (5) days from the posting.
4.	Whenever vacancies occur during the normal summer months when regular school is not in session, the following procedure shall be followed:
a.	Prior to the end of the school year, teachers who are interested in being considered for reassignment during the summer shall submit their prioritized request(s) to the building administrator or supervisor. The form for reassignment will be provided to all teachers. (See Appendix 6B.)
b.	The Association and all teachers will be notified of summer vacancies via the teacher’s District email account. A copy of the posting as well as directions to complete the application form will be attached to each email. The teacher will electronically submit an application for each position they are interested prior to the closing date and time listed in the posting.
c.	If the most senior bidder, the teacher must confirm or reject the offer at the time of the telephone call. All unsuccessful bidders will be notified via email.
D.	Miscellaneous
1.	In acting on requests for voluntary reassignment and/or transfer, the following qualification criteria will be applied:
a.	Individual qualifications;
b.	Instructional and co-curricular requirements;	and
c.	Staff availability and experience.
Where the foregoing factors are substantially equal, the preference in assignment or transfer shall be given to the applicant with the greatest number of years of continuous service in the District.
2.	The parties recognize that when vacancies occur after August 22 and during the school year it may be difficult to fill them from within the District without undue disruption to the existing instructional program. If the Superintendent in his/her discretion so determines, such a vacancy may be filled pursuant to Article XXVII until the end of the school year, at which time the position will be considered vacant. Said positions shall be posted in the first posting on April 1.
3.	Teachers who have already been granted two requests for transfer for any one (1) school year may not apply for another transfer for the same school year.
4.	No more than twenty percent (20) of the regular education staff in a building may transfer in any one year.
5.	All voluntary transfers require a minimum commitment of two (2) years, provided there is no administrative change in the building to which the teacher has transferred.
6.	Assignment Exchange
a.	Conditional: A limited term assignment exchange into a different certification area than the current can be effected in order to avoid layoffs. Teachers desiring
Page 36 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
such limited term exchange assignments for which they are certified may do so effective at the beginning of any school year providing the exchange has prior approval of the immediate supervisors and the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources. Such limited term assignment may be terminated if a vacancy(ies) occurs for which for which one or other of the involved teachers are eligible and elect to accept reassignment.
b.	Permanent: Teachers desiring to exchange assignments for which they are certified may do so effective at the beginning of any school year providing the exchange has the prior approval of the immediate supervisors and the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources.
c.	To a Regular Classroom: Teachers from Special Education programs or curriculum support staff may exchange assignments for which they are certified effective at the beginning of any school year providing the exchange has the prior approval of the immediate supervisors and the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources. This exchange provision is provided for staff to renew a classroom experience and then return to their previous position.
7.	No later than September 1, the Superintendent shall cause to be prepared system-wide certified staff listing including the new positions for the next year, vacancies and existing positions filled for the next year, the names of persons reassigned, transferred, and newly appointed, and the positions they have been given. A copy of such schedule shall be forwarded to the Association within five (5) days of completion.
8.	If a teacher's request for a voluntary transfer has been denied, he/she will, upon
request, receive a written explanation of the reasons therefore from the Superintendent or his/her designee within five (5) days of said request.
9.	New teachers beginning employment after July 1, 2002 will serve in a school or special area for two years before being allowed to transfer.
10.	Association members who apply for posted positions in the categories of Program Support Teachers, Professional Learning Coordinator, Teacher Mentor Recruiter, Dean of Students, Teacher Coaches (as per the District’s Strategic Plan), Department Coordinators, Guidance, Social Work, School Psychologist, Diversity Liaison, Coordinator of Curriculum Development, and Curriculum Support Teacher will go through an interview process and may be selected based upon the interview. If a bargaining unit member(s) is not granted the posted position, a rationale will be given to the applicant and the Association. The Association will have the right to argue and present a case, but the selection process is not grievable.
E.	Involuntary Transfer and Reassignment
1.	No teacher will be involuntarily transferred or reassigned by the Superintendent without a written notice from the Superintendent or his/her designee, which will include the reasons for the transfer or reassignment. No teacher may be transferred or reassigned without cause.
2.	When an involuntary transfer or reassignment is necessary, seniority will normally be followed in determining the individual transferred or reassigned; however, a teacher's current area of instructional and co-curricular competence, major or minor field of study, grade or subject from which transfer or reassignment is contemplated and other relevant factors will be considered in determining which teacher is to be transferred or reassigned. The Superintendent or designee may involuntarily transfer and/or reassign
Page 37 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
teachers with five (5) years or less experience into positions for which they are certified in order to minimize the number of employees laid off, fully or partially.
3.	Notice of intent to involuntary transfer or reassign will be given to teachers as soon as practicable.
4.	Teachers who are being involuntarily transferred will be given up to one-half (V2) day off per year for the purpose of visiting school(s) when they are the most senior applicant for the position(s).
5.	Involuntary transfers or reassignments after the first four (4) weeks of school when the students are in session shall occur only under emergency situations. In such cases the Association shall be notified of the intended transfer(s) or reassignment(s) and the reasons therefore prior to its (their) being effected.
6.	Teachers transferred or reassigned after the beginning of the school year shall have not less than one (1) day without students or regular duties to organize materials and programs for the new assignment.
ARTICLE X
STAFF REDUCTION
A.	When the Board determines to reduce the number of staff members, appropriately certified teachers shall be placed on layoff status based on inverse seniority. Seniority is defined as the length of service as a certificated teacher within the District, as of the teacher's first working day during his/her last period of continuous employment. A teacher whose position is eliminated shall apply in writing to the Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources for positions posted in Article IX, C-1-a, or if no vacancies exist shall replace the teacher with the lowest seniority anywhere within the District in the area in which such teacher is certified.
B.	Teachers being considered for layoff will be given a preliminary indication prior to May 6 and will be notified prior to May 20 of the school year prior to the projected layoff; and the Association shall be notified of all such layoffs at that time. A layoff becomes effective on the first (1st) day of a layoff period and not on the date of the notice of layoff or during the period from the notice of layoff to the first (1st) day of layoff. Until the effective date of layoff, all notices of layoff are considered tentative subject to rescission by the District. Upon rescission, if after the effective date of lay-off, the District shall return the affected teacher to an open position for which he/she is certified for the next school year as per Article IX, Section C.
C.	Certified as used in this Article shall mean that the teacher has on file the necessary certificate or can provide evidence by June 1 that the necessary certificate can be acquired by the beginning of the ensuing school year. Such teacher must file a letter of intent to obtain such certification with the Human Resources Office not later than May 1.
D.	For teachers hired after July 1, 1996, in the event more than one teacher has the same seniority date, all teachers so affected shall be ranked in accordance with previous teaching experience as a certified teacher. In the event no apparent difference can be determined using the other factors mentioned above, a lottery will be held to determine final and permanent seniority ranking.
E.	Teachers shall be recalled in the inverse order of their release, and all benefits to which a teacher was entitled at the time of layoff (including but not limited to incremental steps on the salary schedule and accumulated sick leave) shall be restored in full upon re-employment within the recall period.
Page 38 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
F.	Work previously performed by teachers on layoff status shall not be performed by persons not in the employ of the District.
G.	Teachers on layoff status shall be notified for recall by registered mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, to their last address of record, and be notified of the availability of position(s) and will be recalled before any new employee fills that position. An affirmative reply must be received by the District within ninety-six (96) hours of the receipt of such notice. Failure of delivery, for any reason, relieves the Board of its obligation to subsequently recall such teacher. The Association shall be apprised of all recall notices at the time they are sent. A teacher refusing recall and assignment to any full-time position for which he/she is certified shall have forfeited right to recall and/or layoff benefits unless the teacher was recalled prior to the effective date of this Agreement. In the event a laid-off teacher who has accepted a teaching position in another Wisconsin School District is recalled, such teacher, upon submitting a letter of commitment to return to the District's employment the school year immediately following, shall be given a nonpaid leave of absence until the beginning of the next school year and a replacement teacher shall fill the vacant position in the interim.
H.	Laid-off teachers shall retain the right to call back for a period of three (3) years after August 1 of the year in which the layoff occurs.
I.	Laid-off teachers may continue group insurance coverages (if applicable) available through the Board during the recall period by reimbursing the Board for premium costs. Failure to forward premium payment to the Board on a previously stipulated schedule will terminate this option.
J.	Laid-off teachers shall be given the first opportunity to be employed to replace regularly employed teachers on leave. Laid-off teachers serving in such capacity shall retain all rights and benefits (including seniority accrual) accorded teachers on layoff status and, in addition, shall have their recall period extended by the length of their replacement teaching.
K.	By November 1 of each school year, the Board will cause to be published and posted in each building, and provide a copy to the Association, a seniority list. This list shall also itemize, after each name, such teacher's area(s) of certification. A finalized alpha list and a list by certification area shall be provided the Association by February 1 of each year. This list shall include all corrections, deletions and additions of teachers for the school year.
L.	In the event a teacher accepts a position with the Board outside of the teacher bargaining unit, he/she shall retain the unit seniority rights he/she had accrued at the time of accepting such position.
M.	Teachers on layoff status from full-time teaching positions shall be recalled to full-time teaching positions provided that such teachers shall have the option of accepting any part-time teaching position that may exist without jeopardizing their recall status for any full-time position.
N.	The District shall provide the Association by September 15 a current list of those teachers who have retained recall rights.
ARTICLE XI
EVALUATION PROCEDURES
A.	The Board and the Association agree that evaluation has as its primary purpose the improvement of the school program by assisting each teacher to improve his/her professional competencies. The Board shall continually evaluate teachers to assess job performance.
B.	Guidelines for evaluation shall be published and made available to each teacher as soon as possible each school year.
Page 39 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
C.	The administration will designate, in writing, the immediate supervisor for each teacher within thirty (30) days of the beginning of each school year. In the event of any change of the immediate supervisor, the teacher will be advised of same in writing at the time of the change.
D.	All monitoring or observation of the work performance of a teacher for formal evaluation will be conducted openly and with full knowledge of the teacher. This provision shall not be construed, however, to limit a supervisor or other administrators from calling to the attention of a teacher, on a timely basis, matters observed by the supervisor during the regular course of the teacher's duties.
E.	Teachers will be given a copy of any evaluation report prepared by their evaluators within ten (10) days of any classroom observation upon which the evaluation report is based, and will, at their option, be entitled to a conference to discuss said report. In no event shall the teacher fail to receive the report later than one (1) day before such conference. No such report will be submitted to the Central Office, placed in the teacher's file, or otherwise acted upon without the prior conference with the teacher, if requested. No teacher will be required to sign a blank or incomplete evaluation form.
F.	The teacher shall acknowledge that he/she has read all evaluations and other materials placed in his/her personnel file by affixing his/her signature on the file copy. Such signature does not necessarily indicate agreement with the content of such material.
G.	In cases in which the teacher feels his/her evaluation was incomplete or unjust, he/she may put his/her objections in writing and have them attached to the evaluation report that is placed in the personnel file.
H.	The District shall keep one (1) personnel file at the Central Office for each employed teacher. Building principals/supervisors may keep a file on teachers for which they are the immediate supervisor. However, no materials shall be transferred to a different principal/supervisor, which are not in the central office file.
ARTICLE XII
NONTEACHING DUTIES
A.	Teachers shall not be required to perform nonteaching duties at extra-curricular and co-curricular activities (including sports events), chaperon after-school activities, supervise groups, and participate in other school activities outside of the teacher workday. Teachers may be requested to supervise students and/or activities during the normal teacher workday at a time outside of their teaching time.
1.	Teachers performing such nonteaching duties, authorized by an appropriate administrator in writing or verbally, either directly or through a designee, shall be granted compensatory time on an equal time basis.
2.	Compensatory time may be used at any time during the workday when the teacher is not assigned or scheduled to work with students or is expected to attend scheduled staff meetings or conferences. Teachers will notify their building principal prior to taking compensatory time. Compensatory time may be accumulated; however, such time is expected to be used as soon after it is earned as is practicable. Unused compensatory time will be carried over to the following year. Compensatory time earned in one building may be used during a time when the teacher is assigned to another building.
3.	Pay practices for all compensated nonteaching duties shall be $10.82 per hour for the 2007-08 school year and $11.14 per hour for the 2008-09 school year with a minimum
Page 40 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
of $21.63 for the 2007-08 school year and $22.28 for the 2008-09 school year per event.
4.	Nothing in this section shall preclude the utilization of nonbargaining unit personnel in the performance of such nonteaching duties.
5.	Teachers who volunteer to perform "nonteaching duties" shall not be eligible for compensatory time. "To volunteer" for the purpose of this Article shall mean that the teacher provides the impetus for an activity and merely advises the supervisor to obtain acquiescence. Such action shall be construed as a volunteer action. However, if the supervisor, under whatever guise, assigns the added work, it shall not be considered "to volunteer."
6.	Teachers who have accumulated more than seven and one-half (7 ^) hours of compensatory time at the end of any school year shall be paid for that time in excess of seven and one-half (7 ^) hours at their individual hourly pay rate. Payment will be made on the June 16 or June 30 payroll each year, and the amount will be based on the previous year's salary.
B.	Secondary Lunch Period
1.	Teachers are entitled to a duty-free, uninterrupted lunch period of not less than thirty (30) minutes scheduled during the student lunch period(s).
2.	Noon duties performed during the teacher's duty-free lunch period shall be voluntary with compensatory time on an equivalent time basis.
C.	Elementary Lunch Period
1.	Teachers shall not be required to supervise students during the lunch period. However, a teacher may be requested to serve as teacher-in-charge in the absence of the building principal during the lunch period and shall earn compensatory time.
2.	Teachers accepting work during their thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period will receive compensatory time.
3.	On days of inclement weather or unavailability of noon hour supervisors, the principal may assign teachers the supervision of children during the lunch period, exclusive of their thirty (30) minute duty-free lunch period, and compensatory time shall be granted.
D.	In emergencies teachers may be required to supervise students beyond times indicated within the workday and compensatory time will be granted. However, compensatory time will not be granted in case of fire drills, bomb scares, tornado warnings, or other similar events.
E.	No compensatory time shall be granted for extended homerooms held for orientation of pupils at the beginning of the year, student elections, grade card distribution and return, and a locker inspection.
ARTICLE XIII
TEACHING HOURS

MEMORANDUM AGREEMENT
The Green Bay Education Association (hereinafter the Association), the exclusive collective bargaining agent for teachers in the Green Bay Area Public Schools, (hereinafter the District) and the District hereby agree to the following provisions aimed at alleviating the continual problems of staffing the exceptional educational needs-emotionally disturbed (EEN-ED) classrooms and the English as a Second Language (ESL) classrooms,
Now, therefore, the District shall:
1.	agree that teachers hired as emergency licensed EEN-ED teachers prior to June 1, 1988, and that teachers hired as emergency licensed ESL teacher prior to November 1, 1989, shall be eligible to transfer or be reassigned to teaching assignments for which they are certificated for the 1990-91 school year provided that they have more seniority than other applicants;
2.	utilize the Memorandum Agreement dated June 1, 1988, as the basis for employing emergency licensed EEN-ED teachers employed for the 1988-89 and 1989-90 school years; however, that the provisions listed in the last paragraph of this Memorandum shall also apply to all emergency licensed EEN-ED or emergency licensed ESL teachers once they have completed three years of teaching in the Green Bay Area Public School District;
3.	provide, beginning with the 1990-91 school year, a program of pre-service and inservice activities for newly employed emergency licensed EEN-ED and ESL teachers to include:
not less than one and one-half (1 ^) days of orientation preservice activities, immediately prior to the beginning of the initial school year, aimed at acquainting EEN-ED and ESL teachers under emergency license provisions with the various educational strategies and classroom management techniques appropriate for the specialty; and
provide appropriate inservice activities during the course of the school year to enable emergency licensed EEN-ED and ESL teachers to fulfill their 22.5 hours annual inservice requirement; and
arrange a "buddy" system in which each emergency licensed EEN-ED and ESL teacher shall be assigned an experienced, fully certificated ED or ESL teacher to assist the emergency licensed teacher in problem solving, demonstration teaching, lesson plans and IEP development/implementation, and other appropriate concerns of the EEN-ED or ESL program. "Buddy" teachers shall receive compensatory time for the time spent assisting the emergency licensed ED or ESL teachers. The time spent must be pre-authorized in writing by the appropriate administrator; and
4.	arrange for appropriate college courses to be taught during the school year in Green Bay outside the workday, in order that the emergency licensed EEN-ED and ESL teacher can obtain the six college credits each year for two years required in order that the emergency license can be renewed. The emergency licensed EEN-ED or ESL teacher shall be responsible to attend and pay tuition for such coursework; and
5.	the District shall pay the cost of the renewal of the ED and ESL emergency licenses for the second and third year of teaching.
These procedures shall also apply, in appropriate means, to emergency licensed EEN-ED and ESL teachers employed during the school year.
The Association shall:
Page 99 of 105
2007-09 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT INDEX
PAGE
1.	agree that such emergency licensed EEN-ED and ESL teachers shall be required as a condition of continued employment to maintain eligibility for emergency license renewal for a period of three (3) years from the date of initial employment, unless an EEN-ED or ESL certificated replacement teacher becomes available, at which time the emergency licensed EEN-ED or ESL teacher shall be
given the option to be reassigned or transferred to an open position for which he/she is certificated. If no such position exists, such teachers shall be laid off in conformance with the Staff Reduction provisions of the current teachers collective bargaining agreement; and
2.	agree, however, that in the event the emergency licensed EEN-ED or ESL teacher experiences problems in his/her teaching assignment, which result in potentially disabling job-related stress and/or unresolvable classroom management problems, he/she may appeal the three (3) year EEN-ED/ESL assignment commitment. A hearing of the facts shall be held with the appropriate administrative personnel and the Association's executive director, who shall be a non-voting participant. A decision shall be made on reassignment based on the merits of the case. The decision shall not be appealable.
Be it further understood that teachers assigned under the above provisions shall have the opportunity to transfer or be reassigned to a position other than EEN-ED or ESL after the three-year requirement is completed. However, if a teacher continues in the EEN-ED or ESL assignments after the three years, the District shall provide reimbursement based on the tuition cost of obtaining undergraduate credits at UW-Green Bay. For teachers who continue in the EEN-ED or ESL assignment after three years, the District shall reimburse the tuition cost of obtaining six (6) undergraduate credits for the year(s) in which the credits were taken. The reimbursement shall be as provided below:
Year 4 - Reimbursement for tuition cost of obtaining up to six (6) credits taken in Year 1, 2, 3 or 4.
Year 5 - Reimbursement for tuition cost of obtaining up to six (6) credits taken in Year 2, 3, 4 or 5.
Year 6 - Reimbursement for tuition cost of obtaining up to six (6) credits taken in Year 3, 4, 5 or 6.
Reimbursement for the tuition cost of obtaining up to six (6) credits will be made at the end of each contract year beginning with Year 4. Such reimbursement shall not exceed eighteen (18) undergraduate credits over a three- year period. These credits shall be creditable for advancement on the teacher salary schedule.
