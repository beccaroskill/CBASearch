Acceptance of the definition of "length of continuous service*' by the Union J constitutes on its behalf of the employees in the bargaining unit a dear, specific and unequivocal warver of its rights and the rights of employees it represents, under Section | 13746 of the Education Code and its successors, if anyt including, but not limited to, I Section 45308 of the Education Code.
Effective April 4, 1994, it is agreed and understood by and between the District and the Union that the following procedure will be followed when two (2) or more employees render probationary service on the same day:
1.	In the event that two or more employees render probationary service in a classification on the same day, the order of employment shad be determined by lot drawn by the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services, or designee,
2.	The drawing by lot will be done in the Personnel Services Office, and present at such drawing will be the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Servioes/Designee, the! Union P resid ent/Desig nee, and a third person, to be appointed by the Assistant Superintendent, Personnel Services.
3.	In the event that an employee has previously been a substitute employee in the District in the classification being filled, such substitute service will be considered in the j allocation of hire date for seniority purposes,	I
For example, if three (3) individuals are hired on the same date and one of them has been a substitute employee for nine (9) months, and another one has been as substitute employee for six (6) months, and the third individual has had no substitute! experience, the individual with the nine (9) months of substitute service will be counted as having seniority over the other two individuals. In no event is it to be construed that the original date of substitute service will be the original date of hire. The date of hire will be the date which the employee is approved for permanent employment in this District. I

Accordingly, it is the intent of the District to acknowledge length of service as a substitute employee only as it pertains to assigning a date of hire,
4,	When the order of employment has been established, such a notice shall be entered on the employee's record.
5.	This procedure is to be utilized only for the purpose of assigning a date of hire when there are multiple applicants. All other rules and procedures will continue in effect pursuant to present Board Policy and laws.
GROUNDS DEPARTMENT EQUIPMENT OPERATOR VACANCIES
1.	In the event that a vacancy occurs within the Grounds Department in one ofj the Range 15 positions, the vacancy will be filled immediately on an interim basis by the! Supervisor of the Grounds Department. Seniority wilt be taken into consideration, amongst! other factors of skill and ability and physical fitness, but it shall not be the controlling factor] in the selection process. Employees assigned to these positions shall be compensated at Range 15 to commence with the first day of service.
2.	The District agrees to staff the Grounds Department with the number of positions that are required to operate daily the existing equipment and to perform the more independent responsible grounds and gardening work that can reasonably be considered appropriate under the current job description. The distinction in the equipment that is I appropriate for Groundskeepers (Range 12} and Equipment Operator (Range 15) is the] concept of ‘ hand equipment’ (e.g., hoes, rakes, brooms, and other hand-held tools such as trimmers, etc ) as opposed to larger than hand-held equipment (e.g., large power movers, power edgers, power trimmers, trucks, skip loader, back hoe, and tractors).

3.	In the event of temporary absences within the department, it becomes necessary to assign Range 12 Groundskeepers to Range 1S Equipment Operators, the

STEP 2:
The standard approach identified rn clause 4 for determining the schedule and! amount of repayment per pay period will be implemented except where the employee I requests a case-by-case analysis due to hardship.	|
STEP 3:
Where the implementation of the standard payback approach would create a severe hardship due to such factors as fluctuation in payroll impact on fringe benefits change in the standard work year, reduction in classification or hours, or a major episodic financial hardship, the Payroll Department will work with the employee to develop a reasonable repayment plan which will recover the overpayment as soon as possible. If scheduled Payroll Department deadlines prevent the consideration of such hardship before the payroll i warrant is processed, the District will make every effort to utilize alternative payment! procedures to correct any arrears or ameliorate approved hardships.	!
CRITERION: STANDARD PAYBACK APPROACH	I
a.	If the amount to be recovered is less than five percent (5%) of net income fan the pay period, it may be recovered in one lump sum.	I
b.	If the overpayment occurred in less than one year and the amount is morel •; than five percent (5%) of a pay period, it will be recovered by deductions in the number of j j pay periods equal to the number of pay periods in which the overpayment occurred.
c.	If the overpayment occurred over a period of more than one year, the recovery will normally be accomplished by equal payments, scheduled to be completed either by the end of the fiscal year or the end of the tax year, whichever is later, unless the amount of the payments deducted would exceed fifteen percent (15%) of net income.
d.	If approaches “a" through “c* do not fit the circumstances of amount of the overpayment, a meeting will be arranged to develop a reasonable recovery plan.

Exceptions:
Notwithstanding the
standard payback approaches identified
above,
the
overpayment can be recovered from “back pay3' or other payment in arrears
(not including
current overtime pay). The overpayment will be recovered in one lump sum to avoid
creating of a new overpayment. This provision will apply except on a case-by*case basis
where an approved hardship exists as noted in Step 3 above.
2) All of the above provisions will be suspended whenever the district terminates
an employee or receives a tetter of resignation or *an approved leave of absence request for six months or more, Jn such cases recovery of overpayment will be scheduled for completion by the effective date of the leave of absence, resignation, or termination, if at all
possible.
‘(Specific exceptions to the above are leaves under the provisions of California Family Rights Act, Family Medical Leave Act, industrial Accident (USWA Article 28, FTA Article 12.12), Military (USWA Article 26, FTA Article 12.11).

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (REVISED)
It le agreed and understood by and between the Fontana Unified School District (•District*) and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 8599 (•Union*), as follows:
Whereas, the District frequently has openings for aides at school sites, and
Whereas, frequently there are more applicants for these positions than there are available openings, and
whereas, it is the desire of the District and the Onion to first offer these positions to employees who are already employed in that same class at the site where the vacancy exists,
Now therefore, effective December 11, 1989, it is agreed and understood by and between the District and the Union that when an aide position becomes vacant at a site, the following procedure shall be followed:
1.	The vacancy shall first be posted by the site administrator at that site only for a minimum period of five (5) days;
2.	Applications shall be accepted by the site administrator only from employees who are currently employed at that site;
3.	The site administrator and at least one teacher from the appropriate department shall interview those applicants, and
4,	The site administrator shall select the successful candidate pursuant to Article 10 of the collective bargaining agreement, to wit;
1,	Skill and ability to perform the work as demonstrated by prior experience and competence,
2,	Physical fitness,
3.	Length of Continuous Service,
when, in the judgement of the District, a junior employee exceeds a senior employee in connection with factors 1 and 2 listed above, then the District may select the junior employee for promotion.
When factors 1 and 2 above are equal, length of continuous service shall be controlling.
106
5,	If, after adhering to these procedures, either no applications are received from employees at that site, or, in the judgement of that site administrator, a suitable candidate cannot be found from the site-only applicants, then the position in question may be posted District-wide pursuant to the provisions of aforementioned Article 10 of the collective bagaining agreement*
It is further agreed that this agreement shall exclude all campus aide positions and further, that this agreement shall remain in effect until such time as the District and the Union shall by mutual agreement modify said agreement*

Recognizing th^t changes in'payroll procedures for employees many times result in unforeseen difficulties for employees, and
Recognizing that it is the desire of the District and USWA Local 8599 to prevent such difficulties, and
Recognizing that such difficulties often negatively impact employee morale and loyalty.
The Fontana Unified School District and (jswa Local 8599 hereby agree that all future changes in payroll procedures and policies which affect employees’ actual dollar amounts received per pay period, or which affect the number of paychecks employees receive in a fiscal year, or policies and procedures which in any other manner may alter amounts or frequency of paychecks, shall include union input and shall not be implemented until and unless such opportunity to participate in proposed changes in policy or procedure has been accorded to the Union,
This agreement shall not be interpreted to mean that payroll procedures are subject to formal negotiation procedures. The sole purpose of this agreement is to provide both parties with an opportunity to present proposals and voice concerns regarding payroll procedures so that fewer employee difficulties arise when in the course of conducting District business, changes are necessary in payroll policies.
Finally, it is agreed that the employees whose names appear below shall, from this point forward, in each succeeding fiscal year, continue to be compensated on an "actual earnings" basis rather than the District’s present "even-pay* policy* This practice shall continue on a year-to-year basis and does not require each individual employee to request such payment each year. If an affected employee requests removal from this procedure, or because of a change in work status no longer qualifies for such special consideration, that employee shall subsequently be precluded from returning to such status absent a new agreement to that effect.

MEMORAfOJktOF UNDERSTANDING
WHEREAS, the District and the Union have recently participated in a joint pilot program for daytime custodians at the elementary level, and
WHEREAS, this pilot program has proven to be effective and successful, and WHEREAS, it is the intent of the District and the Union to implement this pilot program throughout the district where feasible,
It is therefore agreed as follows:
1.	Daytime Custodian positions will be offered to Range 12 Custodians who are currently working the cafeteria load at the selected elementary schools indicated below.
2.	In the event a cafeteria load custodian declines the above position, the day position shall then be offered to the next most senior District-wide, Range 12 Custodian working at that specific site.
3.	if all Range 12 Custodians at that site decline the daytime position, the District shall open that daytime position to all Range 12 Custodians throughout the District. The selection for the daytime custodian shall then be made pursuant to our current custodial transfer policy, the net result of which will be the least senior custodian at that site being involuntarily transferred to another site to accommodate the new custodian transferring in.
4.	The offer to assume the daytime custodian position shall be offered to the person performing the cafeteria load at each site as of January 10,1991.
5.	The Union understands and acknowledges that the custodian transferred into the new day shift shall no longer receive the five percent B-shift differential pay, effective upon the date the daytime custodian assumes his new duties.
6.	The District will delete one B-shift Range 12 Custodian per affected site, and will create one Range 13 Senior Custodian at each affected site. Each custodian who assumes the new day position shall be reclassed to Range 13 Senior Custodian, with no change in their step and/or hire date.
7.	The following elementary sites shall implement daytime custodians pursuant to this agreement:
Juniper
Maple
Oak Park
Cypress
North Tamarind
no
Oleander
Randall-Pepper
Shadow Hills
Tokay
PaSmetto
Virginia Primrose
West Randall
As a result of current understating, the following schools are presently unable to participate in the elementary daytime custodian program:
Chaparral
Jurupa Hills
Live Oak
Locust
Poplar
Redwood
South Tamarind
If. in the future, any of these schools are able to enter this program, all of the above procedures shall be adhered to and followed when selecting the intitial daytime custodians for those sites.
8.	These procedures for selecting daytime custodians shall be effective only for the initial selection of a daytime custodian at each elementary site. Vacancies which occur when the original daytime custodians vacate their positions shall be filled pursuant to the then-current Collective Bargaining Agreement which addresses job vacancies, and the custodial transfer policy which is contained in the Custodial Handbook. The implementation of this District-wide program effectively ends the pilot program currently underway at Maple and Oak Park Elementary Schools, and upon implementation of this new program, those daytime custodians currently receiving B-shift differential pay at those sites shall cease receiving such pay.
9.	All parties agree to meet in the future as necessary to address any problems or concerns which may be a result of this daytime custodian program. Any decision to delete or substantially modify the daytime custodian position at an elementary site shall first be preceded by a meeting between the Union personnel* management representatives, and affected site administrator.
10.	Finally, the Union agree that by executing this agreement it shall not file, advance or encourage members to file grievances and/or take any other action.
in
whether civil or administrative, to challenge any provisions, including seniority, of this agreement.

Because questions have arisen this year regarding this same matter, I checked with Irene Keating, Food Service Coordinator at Fohi, to determine whether or not these procedures were, in fact, followed last sum men Irene stated that yes, these were the correct procedures, and they were utilized during the summer of 1990. Therefore, the procedures referenced below will be adhered to this summer when calling substitute food service worker employees.
1,	FOOD SERVICE WORKERS -
a.	First, by district seniority, ali Range 7 Food Service Workers shall be called on a rotating basis.
b.	Second, if no Range 7 Food Service Workers are available, then Range 10 Elementary Kitchen Operators who are on the summer sub list may be called in the same process as in *a‘ above.
2.	ELEMENTARY KITCHEN OPERATORS -

118
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
TRANSPORTATION ATTENDANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM
The program would start on 9/1/95 and end on 6/30/95
Attendance Incentive: All employees with no more than the following hours of absence of illness, personal necessity or industrial accident in 1995-96 will receive the following bonus at the end of the year. (Dr. Harshman is making arrangements so that bonus payments are in a special check to reduce the impact of withholding J (Please note that each employee is eligible to qualify in only one category.)
Oue to the disparity in the number of hours worked by each driver and the difference in impact of one day’s absence based on the number of hours worked, the committee developed two categories based on driver work hours.
Incentive for all Drivers
Each driver would be placed in one of the two categories below based on the number of hours worked for more than six months of the year This would mean that if a driver worked for more than six months of the year In the 6-8 hour category, they would be placed in that category for determination of incentive. If a driver worked for more than six months of the year between four and up to five
and three-quarter (5.75) hours, they would be placed in			the four	to six hour
category.	Hours	6-8 regularly	Hours	4-5.75 regularty
	Used,	assigned hrs,	Used	assigned hrs.
Zero hours used	0	$300.00	0	$300,00
Less than or equal to xx hours used	12	$275.00	3	$275.00
Less than or equal to xx hours used	20	$250.00	13	$250.00
Less than or equal to xx hours used	23	$225.00	18	$225.00
(Payments will be prorated for employees with work years of less than 12 months.)
Though payments are the same as the M&O program, compensation time could not be used to make up absences because Transportation must obtain substitutes when drivers are absent. Furthermore, due to the use of mandatory vacation days drivers would not be able 16 use vacation time to cover sick leave or personal necessity absences in the same fashion that is available for M&O employees. Therefore, the number of hours of absence in each category of eligibility for incentive payment has been somewhat increased to take account of this difference in the lack of flexibility available to employees of the Transportation Department.

MOU - Transportation Incentive Program Page 2
Incentive Plan for Non-Bus Driven-Van_Driver.Garaw and Transportation Staff
Zero hours used
^ess than or equal to 8 hours used
Less than or equal to 16 hours used
Less than or equal to 24 hours used
$300.00
$275.00
$250*00
$225*00
This portion of the program Is identical to the M&O Attendance Incentive Program.
ABSENCE DISINCENTIVES:
Employees with excessive absences would be ineligible for extra assignments such as field trips for one rotation* Excess absence was identified as more than 12 days per year, a day being defined according to each driver's "regularly assigned hours.” After reaching the excess absence level, an employee would lose eligibility for extra assignments for one full rotation of the seniority list for each instance of absence.
All employees in the Transportation and Garage departments would be required to obtain medical verification for absences due to sick leave when more than 12 days per year sick leave/personal necessity absence has been used.
IMPORTANT NOTE: HARDSHIP STATUS WAIVER
The committee recognizes that employees with normally good attendance are sometimes affected by hardship conditions which cause unusual incidents of excess absence. Therefore, the committee would set up a subcommittee to screen hardship cases and authorize exception from imposition of penalties for excessive absence in these cases.

FONTANA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 9660 Citrus Avenue Fontana/ California
October 17, 1985
MEMORANDUM TO: United Steelworkers of America, Local 8599
FROM:	Fontana Unified School District
SUBJECTS	Union Concern
Problem 1: There are alleged inherent inequities in the compensation being given to classroom aides over their year of employment* The inequities allegedly occur when comparing traditional school to the various tracks of the CSP,
Problem 2: Due to the different work years involved in CSP, many aides receive very small checks periodically throughout the year making it difficult'tc finance the costs of health and welfare benefits.
The District offers the fallowing solution to the Union Concerns:
The District recommends that the aides on the various CSP tracks take certain days of vacation throughout the year when they would be in a non-wbrk status in such a way that the vacation days w<ould correspond to traditional holidays* In so doing, CSP aides would qualify for additional holiday pay increasing their annual salary.
In regard to leveling the compensation received over the work year/ this approach to taking vacation days in relationship to holidays will provide more consistent salary on a check-bycheck basis.
This offer of settlement in no way sets a precedent for present or future concerns. This offer constitutes full and final settlement of this Union concern.
