SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT Article I
(a)	The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole bargaining agent for all of its Construction Employees in the performance of all work coming within the terms of this Agreement, subject to provisions of existing laws. The Employer agrees that, upon the Union’s presentation of appropriate evidence of majority status among its employees in the bargaining unit of the Employer covered by this collective bargaining agreement, the Union shall be voluntarily recognized as the exclusive collective bargaining agent under Section 9(a) of the NLRA for all employees within the bargaining unit of the Employer on all job sites within the jurisdiction of this Agreement.
In the event of such a showing, the Employer expressly waives any right to condition voluntary recognition on the Union’s certification by the NLRB following an NLRB election, unless a representation petition has been filed by a Petitioner other than the Employer prior to the Employer’s voluntary Section 9(a) recognition. The Employer expressly waives the right to seek an NLRB election during the term of this contract, or any right to abrogate or repudiate this contract, during its effective term.
