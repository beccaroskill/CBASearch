668
669 An apprentice may have their indenture canceled by the JATC at any time prior to completion as 670 stipulated in the registered standards. Time worked and accumulated in apprenticeship shall not 671 be considered for local union referral purposes until the apprentice has satisfied all conditions of 672 apprenticeship. Individuals terminated from apprenticeship shall norbe assigned to any job in any 673 classification, or participate in any related training, unless they are reinstated in apprenticeship as 674 per the standards, or they qualify through means other than apprenticeship, at sometime in the 675 future, but no sooner than two years after their class has completed apprenticeship, and they have 676 gained related knowledge and job skills to warrant such classification.

An active list of qualified
690 applicants shall be maintained by the JATC as per the selection procedures.
691
692 Section 4,10. To accommodate short-term needs when apprentices are unavailable, the JATC 693 shall assign unindentured workers who meet the basic qualifications for apprenticeship.
694 Unindentured workers shall not remain employed if apprentices become available for OJT 695 assignment. Unindentured workers shall be used to meet job site ratios except on wage-and-hour 696 (prevailing wage) job sites.

The first person assigned to any job site shall be a Journeyman Wireman.
A job site is considered to be the.physical location where employees report for their work assignments. The employer’s shop (service center) is considered to be a separate, single job site. All other physical locations where workers report for work are each considered to be a single, separate job site.
Section 4,13. An apprentice is to be under the supervision of a Journeyman Wireman at all times. This does not imply that the apprentice must always be in-sight-of a Journeyman Wireman. Journeymen are not required to constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative. Work may be laid out by the employer's designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice's skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
Apprentices who have satisfactorily completed the first four years of related classroom training using the NJATC curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site and receive work assignments in the same manner as a Journeyman Wireman-. An apprentice shall not be the first person assigned to a job site and apprentices shall not supervise the work of others.
Section 4.14.	Upon satisfactory completion of apprenticeship, the JATC shall issue all graduating apprentices an appropriate diploma from the NJATC. The JATC shall encourage each graduating apprentice to apply for college credit through the NJATC.

Section 12.13 Employers shall advise the Business Manager of the Local Union of the number of applicants needed.

The Appeals Committee is authorized to issue procedural rules for the conduct of its business, but it is not authorized to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the provisions of this Agreement and its decisions shall be in accord with this Agreement.
Section 12.17 A representative of the Employer or of the Association, as the case may be, designated to the Union in writing shall be permitted to inspect the Referral Procedure records at any time during normal business hours.
Section 12.18 A copy of the Referral Procedure set forth in this Agreement shall be posted on the Bulletin Board in the offices of the Local Union and the offices of the Employers who are parties to this Agreement.
