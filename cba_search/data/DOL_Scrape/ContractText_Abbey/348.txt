ERGONOMICS
too
Rolls-Royce Allison and the International Union. United .Automobile. Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America recognize that cumulative-trauma disorders (hereafter "C Ws" ) are an occupational illness. The parties also recognize that the control of CTDs is a complex issue often requiring the application of a number of different control methods and technologies that may differ from operation to operation. These include ergonomically appropriate design, which includes feasible engineering and administrative controls that materially reduce or eliminate job-related CTb stressors, employee and supervisory training and education, early recognition of the problem, early amd proper medical diagnosis, treatment and care.
Rolls-Royce Allison will continue to administer an Ergonomics Program for all UAW-represented employees utilizing guidelines established between The Company and the International Union, UAW. Rolls-Royce Allison recognizes the accomplishments of the joint ergonomics process and realizes the need to improve the process to further reduce work-related CTDs. The Company is committed to progressively pursue improving and enhancing the current process wilh the UAW. The purpose of the program is to deal cooperatively and constructively with the problem of CTDs in the workplace.
The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee CLJCj will assume responsibility for supervising and supporting the ergonomics program. The parties will establish a Joint Ergonomics
. Technician 1'eam. The LJC will identify the resources who wilt be trained to perform the responsibilities of the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, as needed, to administer the Ergonomics Program, based on the following formula:
	« of UAW-Represented Employees	1 # of Full-Time Ergonomics 1	Technicians
7S0-1999	|	1		
	2000 or more	I	2
If the level of ergonomic activity does not sustain the number of Joint Ergonomic Technicians assigned, the LJC can petition the NJC for a variance. In addition, the LJC can request additional interim resources if the ergonomic needs exceed the level the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team can be reasonably expected to accomplish in a timely manner. The UC may refer unresolved issues or concerns w the NJC.
The NJC will establish selection criteria for the Joint Ergonomics Technicians. The UAW Technicians will be selected from the local work force and appointed to the position by the Aerospace Department of the International Union within three months of ratification of this Agreement.

The status of the ergonomics process will be reviewed at the NJC meeting. Discussions concerning significant problems or roadblocks will take place at these meetings.
The parties agreed to use a jointly developed process for the use of outside consultants in situations where in-house efforts concerning reduction ofjob-relaied CTDs are not successful. The consultant's reports will be made available Co both the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team and the co-chairs of the NJC.
Based on the results of the job analysis program, the Company shall implement feasible measures to control CTD risk factors. A good-faith effort will be made to accomplish correction of identified CTD hazards at a particular job or work station within six (61 months after the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team determines that corrective action is required. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and the reasons need to be documented. The corrective action will include any combination of the following:
•	Engineering controls such as design, selection, location and orientation of tools, parts and equipment.
•	Administrative controls (eg., job enlargement, job rotation, and appropriate job assignment), io be used in the following manner;
As interim abatement measures pending engineering changes.
When engineering changes are determined to be insufficient to significantly reduce the CTD stressors, and
In those instances when an administrative control is the most effective fix among the possible choices for corrective actions.
The LJC will monitor the corrective actions being implemented and any unresolved issues or concerns can be referred to the NJC.
The Company will inform and instruct affected employees on the controls implemented at their work stations and how they are to be used.
102
The Company will maintain documentation of modification activity, including, the job or work station identified for modification, number of employees affected, the nature of modification, the projected completion date, the actual completion date and. where available, the cost of the modification when completed.

LOCKOUT POLICY
During the currenl negotiations the UAW and Rolls-Royce Allison discussed their mutual concern regarding fatalities and serious injuries to employees, including operators performing repair, service and maintenance activities on machinery and equipment. The parties agreed that, to be effective, the Lockout Energy Control program must be universally implemented and enforced throughout the Company. The parties reaffirmed that the elimination of the potential for injury from hazardous energy is critical to worker safety
It is the policy of Rolls-Royce Allison and endorsed by the UAW that:
•	Lockout is required where employees may be exposed to hazardous energy which coaid cause injury. Exposure means that the employee is in a position to be injured by released energy.
•	Where an employee is exposed to potential injury from expected machine energyhnotion. the exposure must be eliminated. If the exposure cannel be eliminated, the machine will be locked out.
The Company will maintain an effective Lockout - Energy Control program which will apply to all employees based on jointly developed implementation guidelines..
MONITORED POWER SYSTEMS
the UAW and Rolls-Royce Allison recognize the importance of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. Therefore, during, these discussions, the parties agreed to evaluate the results of pilots conducted in UAW-represented facilities to determine whether "Monitored Power Systems" could be integrated into the existing Lockout/Energy Control procedures. The fundamental process to be followed starts with performing an initial risk assessment on any process where "Monitored Power Systems" may be appropriately used.
UH
The use of these systems will be integrated into the existing Lockout'Energy Control procedures, when appropriate, to further reduce and eliminate the risk of exposure to employees. However, it is understood by the parlies that Lockout must still be performed whenever the exposure cannot be controlled or eliminated as determined by the risk assessment.
UAW-ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON HEALTH PROMOTION
The UAW and Rolls-Royce Allison will develop a health promotion program which will be made available for use by all UAW-represented employees. This program, to be supported by joint funds to the extent agreed upon by the Executive Review Board lor Joint Activities, is designed to focus on leading factors such as hypertension (high blood pressure), high levels of fat {cholesterol | in the blood, overweight, cessation of tobacco smoking, prevention of the spread of AIDS, and certain other factors, which place employees at high risk of disease. Among other tools developed to accomplish this is a health assessment questionnaire to be completed by participating employees.
Consideration for the inclusion of additional diagnostics such as tung function and/or glucose tolerance will be determined by the NJC. The NJC will monitor the program and its usage and make necessary adjustments to encourage participation.
FITNESS CENTERS
The Parlies recognize that General Motors and the UAW have developed a fitness center needs analysis for use by UAW represented facilities in determining the desirability of such a center al their location, tn addition, guidelines for fitness center operation have been developed and will be made available to UAW-represented facilities that operate or are desirous of operating such centers.

The parties agree that through the joint audit process, they will verify that all facilities have an effective emergency notification system and that it is periodically tested to achieve the best possible response time for Ihe emergency involved.
NEW TECHNOLOGY/SPECIflCATIONS
Rolls-Royce Allison and the UAW recognize the advantages of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. The parties will establish a joint team, under the direction ofthe LJC. to address health and safety concerns early in the development process. The main objective lo this “Design-ln“ effort is to develop design specifications for application across the Company, in the manufacturing processes, that incorporate health and safety program requirements. The joint learn will serve as a technical resource to work with the engineering group to assure that UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison health and safety program requirements are incorporated into the common design specifications,
in an effort to promote improved communications regarding such matters, as early as possible and preferably in the zero phase of the plarming process, a review of anticipated equipment and/or processes with the Shop Committee and the UC will be held. The Union will have an opportunity to discuss health and safety concerns with Management and make recommendations designed to improve the equipment and/or process, consistent with the design specifications where they have been established by the '•Design-In" activity. The UC may be required to travel to vendors, plants or other locations to review such equipment and/or process.
Machinery, equipment or processes will not be released for production without the written approval of the Plant Safety Administrator, Where required, lockout placards will be posted for ail applicable energy sources. The parties have committed themselves to continue the implementation of the UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison Lockout Placard Guidelines. These placards
los
will continue to be reviewed during a joint audit and should be reviewed during safety observation tours.	■
The LJC wilt consult with operators, skilled trades, engineers, supervisors or related personnel to ensure that required safeguards provide effective protection and do not interfere with their ability to perform their assigned tasks.	1	-
The NJC will oversee development of communications material regarding rite ''Design-in” safety activity for the UC. This materia! may include informational material, guidelines, standards checklists, or any other appropriate materia! to clearly communicate the design specifications.
The parties will continue their efforts to integrate health and safely in the 4-Phase Process and pursue the establishment of a Quality Network strategy to accomplish such integration.
CONTROL OF CHEMICAL EXPOSURES
The Parties recognize that future studies may be conducted by the Occupational Health Advisory Board (OHAB) focused on establishing exposure guidelines and controls for the use of machining fluids. As OHAB issues findings from the studies, the LJC will, to die extent possible, devise an action plan and make appropriate recommendations regarding machining fluid exposures. Such action plan may include medical surveillance for respiratory effects of machining fluids for employees who regularly work in operations with machining fluids, . including a standardized respiratory symptoms questionnaire and pulmonary function test.
The LJC will review process exhaust ventilation systems where air is recirculated, Such review wilt be in accordance with guidelines established by the NJC. Air testing win be performed when requested by the LJC. To the extent feasible, these tests will be incorporated in the previously described air sampling plan. Recirculation will not be permitted where employee health and safety cannot be assured.
Records of laboratory testing and coolant additions will be maintained and made available to the UC upon request.

Sourcing
During the 2900 negotiations, the Roils-Royce Allison and the Union discussed the critical link between sourcing actions and the impact on employment opportunities and job security. To that end. (he Company will work with and assist the Union at both the Local and Internationa! levels to preserve jobs, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing actions, and to create jobs for protected employees, ft is an objective of the Company to grow the business and the employment opportunities of its UAW represented workforce and to continue to rely- upon its employees and facilities as the source t>f its products.
During the life of the current agreement, the Company will advise, in writing, the appropriate Union members of the sourcing committee of any management outsourcing recommendations, including the number of potential jobs affected.
Additionally, data regarding incoming and outgoing work will be given to the International and Local Union in quarterly meetings. In addition, the Company will provide inquiry data access to the appropriate Union contact through the use of a computer terminal, if possible. In this manner, the parties can judge the success of mutual efforts toward improved job security. The Company agrees to incorporate the procedure and structure outlined herein when making Sourcing determinations during the current agreement.
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider the criteria of quality, technology, cost, timing, statutory requirements, occupational and related health and safety issues, the impact on long-term job stability, the degree to which the Company's resources can be allocated to further capital expenditures, the overall financial stability of the Company and the impact on related Rolls-Royce Allison < UAW represented facilities. Other factors considered by the Company before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on employment, and job and income security costs on both a short and long-term basts. Such criteria will give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on Rolls-Royce Allison I UAW represented employment levels and the job and income security of Rolls-Royce Allison 1 UAW represented employees. The parties will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used io address sourcing issues. Transfer pricing profits will not be considered in making sourcing decisions. Only appropriate return on investment and burden will be considered.
Following development of the sourcing criteria, the parlies may forma joint task force to ensure the full implementation of such criteria, and. on an as needed basis, to address any specific sourcing areas of concent identified by the Union, Pertinent criteria will be applied consistently in comparisons of internal and external supply capability. The Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing. The Union agrees to keep a!) such information confidential until the Company consents to its release. Further, in this regard, the
112
plant Chairperson will designale in welling those Union representatives who will have access to Ihe quote package and related information.
If the Local Committee cannot resolve a sourcing issue, it may file a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
In addition, ihe following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of the UAW members,
I.	Insourcing
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee identifies as that which the Committee identifies sis that which might be performed competitively within the location the locution based on the criteria outlined above. To assist in this process, the Union will be furnished a complete master file of commodities which will be Used to generate a list of parts similar to those currently manufactured by Rolls-Royce Allison/UAW represented employees that have been (1) outsourced or (2) are currently manufactured by non-UA W! Rolls-Royce Allison suppliers for Rolls-Royce Allison. This list will be updated and expanded io include supplier expiration dates, supplier location (city and state), annual volume and Union affiliation if known and will be furnished quarterly or as otherw ise agreed to by the parties. Thereafter, the parties will initiate efforts to ittsource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for protected employees and employees on layoff
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively judged by the above criteria, management will adopt the Committee's proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work, in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within 30 days of the decision to bring the work in-house.
2-	Outsourcing
Outsourcing as used herein means the Company’s sourcing of work from its facilities including work connected with current, new. or redesigned engines, fabricated and component parts,
When the quoting process begins, the Union win review and have access to the eniiic request for quotation package for this work along with the cost book information. Upon receipt of this package. Ihe Chairperson and the Personnel Director will indicate on the accompanying notice (Notice of Potential Outsourcing) that the information has been received. This notice will include a description of the work involved and will be sent to the Vice President and Director of the Aerospace Department of the UAW or other International Representative designated by the same and to the appropriate Rolls-Royce Allison manager.
Following the receipt of the request for quotation package (or in the infrequent instances where a quote package is not utilised), the local parlies will have the opportunity to jointly develop a plan
1)3
to perform the work competitively, judged bv the criteria listed earlier in this appendix. The Union will be provided lull and timely access to all appropriate data including financial information that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and the potential sourcing action. Prior to the submission of the initial quote response, the information contained therein will be reviewed by rhe local parties.
At the close of the quoting process, the local parties will be advised in writing of the most favorable quote response which best meets customer requirements and the terms and conditions therein. If this quote response is other than the one submitted by the local union, a written notice will be issued to the Chairperson which includes the reason for the potential outsourcing, the quote price from the affected location, if applicable the terms and conditions of the most favorable quote response, the potential jobs impact, and the anticipated impact date. Thereafter, the local parties will be given an additional 30 days, or longer when possible, to meet the terms and conditions of the quote response referenced above. A copy of this notice will be sent to the Vice President and Director of the Aerospace Department of the UAW or the International Representative designated byr the same and the appropriate Rolls-Royce Allison manager.
The parties feel that this process of notification and discussion regarding sourcing issues provides sufficient time to evaluate sourcing issues to insure that opportunities exist lo develop plans to retain the work. It is recognized ihal this process provides for earlier involvement in sourcing decisions than the previous 1993 National agreement (formerly Appendix 1.) and it is agreed that । the Union will have as much time to evaluate methods to retain the work as the 150 day notification process provided in the 1993 National Agreement.
I
|	If it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed
।	earlier in this appendix. Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep
I	the work in-house. The union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approvals or ratification
| within 30 days lo keep the work in-house.
1	The sourcing authority will nol enter into a contractual relationship with a non-Roils-Royce ■	AllisortiUA W supplier until such time as the appropriate management representative provides
written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the JOBS Committee has taken place.
Additionally International Union and Local Union input will be sough! by Rolls-Royce Allison as early as possible in the outsourcing decision-making process in order to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parlies to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the long-term job stability of employees and the financial viability of Rolls-Royce Allison. The Company agrees to a full disclosure to the international and Local Union of the procedures utilized in the sourcing activities.
3. Future Product Sourcing
114
I Inion input into early sourcing decisions will be sought by the Company. In that regard, the Union will be notified in writing by the Company al the point when a Program Manager has been named (or sooner if possible) of its intent to proceed with any new or redesigned engine program.
On a quarterly basis or more frequently if business needs dictate, a confidential review will be held concerning future product programs in an effort to provide the Union with early input into sourcing decisions. These meetings will be attended by the Director of the Aerospace Department of the UAW or designee and top level management of the Rolls-Royce Allison. Additionally, representatives from various corporate disciplines, e.g.. Marketing, Engineering, and Product Planning, may be invited to attend these meetings. At these regularly scheduled meetings, the parties will review any new program which is being pursued by the Company or which has been approved during the preceding quarter as a new business venture for the Rolls-Royce Allison.
Following the notification, a representative designated by the International Union (currently functioning ir> an appointed capacity) will work with members of various organizations within the Company to gain information and knowledge into sourcing discussions and sourcing determinations for those organizations. When there is a need for this representative to interface with an organization relative to sourcing discussions, the contact should be made through the Manager ofHourly Human Resources.
The Company agrees not to use the results of such discussions to obtain more attractive contract terms from outside suppliers tn lieu ofkeeping the work in-house.
If requested, higher level meetings or discussions on these matters will be scheduled.
The implementation of this process should provide the parties with the mechanism to lake advantage of every opportunity to use internal resources and create jobs for protected employees.
The commitments expressed in this appendix are intended to contribute significantly to our cooperatively working together to provide Rolls-Royce Allison employees improved job security by growing the business and employment opportunities.

Offset Requirements
During 2000 negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions regarding the competitive nature of the Aerospace industry and the fact that many of the industry competitors have been forced to reach innovative business arrangements in order to win and attract new business. Additionally the parties discussed the fact that many new Aerospace business opportunities exist in foreign countries. Often the governments of these foreign countries, through offset requirements, dictate that companies provide labor content within that country where the customer’s business is domiciled.
Recognizing these unique aspects of the Aerospace industry, (he parties agree that improving the competitive position of the Rolls-Royce Allison within the Aerospace industry is an important factor contributing to the Company’s ability to win and attract new work. The parties also recognize that issues such as offset requirements imposed by foreign governments and innovative business arrangements (i.c.- partnering, risk sharing, teaming and joint ventures} will require cooperation to secure and increase new work and thereby increase employment opportunities and improve job security. Ahy sourcing decisions associated with innovative business arrangements and the fulfillment of offset requirements are intended to provide growth in the volume of manufacturing work within the Company and increased employment opportunities.
In an effort to provide a clear and accurate view of what is mean) by innovative business arrangements and offset requirements, the following definitions of the referred to business practices is offered:
Partnering- This occurs when two or more parties come together in a business venture and share the risk and rewards of the venture in the same proportion over a very broad set of business parameters.
Risk-Sharing- This occurs when a party joins a business venture and assumes a share of risk only on the portion of the program that they are responsible for-
Teaming- This occurs when two or more parties come together to achieve a specific objective that is well defined.
Joint Ventures- A term utilized to describe variations on the above terms and one that encompasses business arrangements like partnering, risk-sharing and teaming.
Offset Requirements- Requirements, often imposed by foreign governments, that requires a company to provide labor content within that country where the customer's business is domiciled. For example, in order to sell engines to a third world country, the country could impose a requirement that certain parts and/or the assembly and/or testing be performed in their country.

Rolls Royce Work
At times, during the life of this agreement. Rolls-Royce Allison may be identified as a viable source of work on Rolls Royce products in production or development at Rolls Royce facilities. The parlies discussed that such opportunities act to increase the job security and enhance the employment opportunities of the workforce even when the work is of a fixed duration.
The parties also discussed the fact that the transfer of work from Rolls Royce facilities to Rolls-Royce Allison is governed by Foreign Ownership. Control and Influence (FOCI) regulations imposed by the US government. These FOCI regulations and the terms of the Special Security Agreement (SSA) imposed by the US government when Rolls Royce purchased Rolls-Royce Allison, require that business relations conducted between the two corporate entities be at arms length.
tn an effort to provide early input to the Union when Rolls Royce work is being transferred into Rolls-Royce Allison, the Company agrees to meet with the Union in advance of such work being transferred into an Rolls-Royce Allison facility and share information including the type of work being transferred, the anticipated volume of the work, the duration of the work 1 or length of the purchase order), the standard hour volume impact associated with the work, and any employment growth anticipated as a result of the work being transferred in. Additionally, the Company agrees to notify the Union in advance of work being removed from the facility by Rolls Royce. It is believed that these efforts of advance communication will act to improve the understanding by the workforce of the positive aspects of performing Rolls Royce work on either a short or long term basis.
Any discussion or notification referenced in this attachment is separate and distinct from the formal notification and discussion requirements of Document 2.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOB SECURITY (JOBS) PROGRAM
The Company and the Union are committed to enhancing the job security of Roils-Royce Allison employees. The Parties also recognize that such job security can only be realized within a work environment which promotes operational effectiveness, continuous improvement and competitiveness.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this JOBS Program and have pledged to work together, consistent with this Program and other provisions of the National Agreement to enhance the Company's competitive position.
The cornerstone of the JOBS Program is a commitment to pre-determined secured employment levels (SEL’s) and protection against indefinite layoff for eligible employees as expressly provided herein,
I.	SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM - The Company and the Union agree that:
(A)	The secured ernpl oyment level s (SEL' s) (i ,e.. num bers of eli gi ble employ ees or
positions covered by this Program as defined herein) initially shall be established as of the first Monday following the Effective Date of the Agreement for all skilled and nonskilled employees The transfer of an employee be tween ski I Jed and non-skilled will cause the SEE for the group receiving the employee to increase and the Other group from which die movement occurred to decrease unless the movement occurred to satisfy the SEE, in which case the SEL will remain the same in each group..
(B)	Baseline Secured Employment Levels for the Unit shall be equal lo the number of active employees with one or more years seniority at work and on roll in the Unit on the Effective Date, Such active employees will be SEL eligible and include employees not at work who are:
fl) on vacation.
(2)	receiving bereavement pay,
(3)	on jury duty.
(4)	on any leave of absence of 90 days duration or less.
(5)	on temporary layoff, and
(6)	any other employee having a direct attachment to the active workforce.
(C)	No employee will be laid off for any reason, other than described in 1(D). if such layoff would cause the number of active employees in the unit to fall below the
IIS
then current SEL or otherwise result in the layoff of one or more SEL eligible employees.
(D)	Paragraph 1(C) not withstanding, an employee protected from layoff by the SEL may be laid off fur any of the following reasons:
(1)	volume related declines attributable to market related conditions as described in Document No. 10, JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs • SEL, not to exceed 36 weeks over the life of the Agreement;
(2)	acts of God or other such reasons beyond the control of the Company;
(Ji the sale of a part of the Company's operations as an ongoing business;
(4)	the layoff of an employee recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary; or
(5)	plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled.
An employee impacted by atty of the above reasons is. if otherwise eligible, covered by the appropriate Supplemental Agreements which are attached to the National Agreement as Exhibits.
(El The number of employees protected by this JOBS Program will be the equivalent of the employees within the SEL who would otherwise have been laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph 1(D).
IL JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS - In recognition of the fact that job security can only result from joint efforts to improve operational effectiveness, the Company and the Union agree that:
(A)	For a period commencing with the Effective Date of this Memorandum of Understanding and for the life of the current Agreement, no employee within the SEL will be laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph <(D).
(B)	An employee whose regular job is eliminated will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the National Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement.
(C)	The number of employees protected from layoff due to the JOBS Program will be that determined in Paragraph 1(E). Each protected employee will be identified by application of the Local Seniority Agreement provisions as if such job security were not provided.
(D)	(i) Fo flowing the last pay ending period of each month (S EL evaluation date), the SEL and Baseline SEL shall be reviewed for each Unit and adjusted as required consistent with the provisions of the Memorandum. The SEL shall be compared with the Baseline SEL to determine attrition replacement obligations. If it is
114
determined that the active employment level is less than the SEL number for reasons other than the events excluded in Paragraph 1(D). a sufficient number of laid'off employees wi 11 be recalled front layoff in order to increase the active workforce to the new SEL. If there is no available laid-off employee, the position will remain unfilled and will be available in the event of a layoff due to a volume decrease described in 1(D). unless the JOBS Committee directs that it be filled by a new hire.
(2)	If on the evaluation date the SEL number results in less than a whole
number, the Engineering Method of Rounding will be used to determine the SEL.
(E)	If an event, other than those described in 1(D), would otherwise cause the number of active employees in a unit to fall below the then current SEL, the employees so protected, as provided for in J(C), will be placed on Protected employee status, live Parties recognize that events, other than those described in I (D). may occur during the course of this Agreement that will cause the number of SEL eligible employees to exceed the Company's production requirements. The parries further recognize that the scope of this program requires flexibility with regard to the assignment of such Protected employees and the selection of employees for training, (n this regard, the JOBS Committee {described in Section HI, below) will insure that assignments are made on a basis consistent with the seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement white meeting plant needs, minimizing work force disruption and enhancing the personal growth and development of employees. After a decision by the JOBS Committee a Protected employee may be (I) placed in a training program, (2) used as a replacement io facilitate the training of another employee, (3) given a job assignment within or outside the bargaining unit which may be non-lraditional, (4) placed in an existing opening or (5) given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Memorandum of Understanding
(F)	Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness will be
encouraged and supported by the Company and the International Union including, as may be appropriate, approval of requests to waive, modify or change the National Agreement.
(GJ A Protected employee will continue to receive their regular straight time hourly rale of pay. In the event a Protected employee is assigned io another classification, the employee will receive the rate of pay as provided by the Local Wage Agreement,
(H)	Protected employees' assignments will be considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference, except for assignments to fill openings resulting from volume increases. Experience gained from these temporary assignments will not be used to advantage such Protected employee over other employees for selection to fill
120
permanent vacancies, nor will the Protected employee gain seniority under Paragraph 62 of the National Agreement from such assignments,
(I)	An employee replaced by a Protected employee will receive their regular straight lime hourly rale of pay, and will be returned to the same classification and job assignment upon completion of the replaced employee’s assignment. In the event the employee has insufficient seniority to return to the formerly held classification, the employee will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Local Seniority Agreement.
(J)	If an employee would have been transferred pursuant to Paragraphs (63)(a), (63 Mb) or (153) of the National Agreement or placed in an Apprentice program were it not for participation in a training assignment provided by this program, the employee will be transferred to this classification upon completion of the training assignment. In the event the employee would have been selected for an E.l.T. or Apprentice assignment the employee's date of entry will be adjusted as if the employee’s assignment had not been delayed.
(K)	A replaced employee returned to a job assignment under this Program will be credited with all overtime hours the employee worked while out of the equalization group, bul not with the overtime hours the employee would otherwise have worked in the group had the employee not have been replaced by the
!	Protected employee.	.
(L)	A training assignment will be voluntary on the part of an employee being replaced by a Protected employee, unless such training is to develop or improve technical skills relevant to the employee's current job assignment or anticipated future job needs.	'
(M)	No Protected employee will be temporarily assigned to a job outside of the bargaining unit except on a voluntary basis, subject to the direction of the JOBS Committee.
(N)	(1)	The SEL will be increased by one position for (J) an employee in the active
workforce, as defined by Paragraph 1(B) who had less than one year seniority on the effective date of the Agreement who subsequently attains ।	one year of seniority; (2) an employee with one or more years seniority is

Notwithstanding the above, the JOBS Committee is authorized to establish special mechanisms, including SEL eligibility provisions, for the purpose of attracting new work.
(2)	The SEL will be maintained or.decreased for normat attrition's of eligible employees (quits, retirements, or deaths); in accordance with the following rules for replacement of such attrition:
a.	When the SEL is between 95% and 105% of the total of the Group's Baseline SELs established pursuant lo Section I (B). attrition wilt be replaced on a one-for-two basis by recalling an employee from layoff to fill the open SEL position. In the event there are no employees to be recalled, there shall be no obligation to hire, except when directed by the JOBS Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no obligation to replace attrition when the SEL exceeds 105% of its Baseline SEL
b.	When the SEL is 95% or Jess of the Baseline SEL. attrition will be replaced on a one-for-one basis:
I.	first, by allowing an ineligible active seniority employee at the affected facility to become eligible;
2.	Second, by recalling a seniority employee from layoff from the facility, or rehiring an employee with a Paragraph (64)(d) rehire right;
3.	Or third, by hire, as attrition occurs up to the net number of jobs outsourced minus those insourced (as defined in Document 2 of the Agreement and determined by the JOBS Committee) subsequent to । the Effective Dale, except when the affected Unit encounters i market-driven, volume-related layoffs, and provided further that if | (1) the number of eligible employees falls below 95% and (2) there ' is a net number of jobs outsourced, such positions will be filled within nine months, unless amended by the JOBS Commiitee. of the later of these two events. In no other instance will hiring of new employees be required to fill open SEL positions.
122
Employees recalled, hired, or rehired to replace atlriiion may be assigned within their Unit at Management discretion, subject to applicable seniority provisions of the Agreement. An open SEL positron resulting from attrition will be filled by recalling an employee from layoff, if there is no available laid-off employee, the position wit! remain unfilled and will be available in the event of a layoff due to a volume decrease described in 1(D), unless the JOBS Committee directs that it be filled by a new hire. The parties are required to meet, at least monthly, to discuss the reasons why open positions are created. The Local Parlies may be required to submit to the National Parties written detailed information to support their monthly joint reports. ThcSELsand Baseline SELs will be decreased by one for each attrition resulting from the acceptance of a special program set forth in Attachment A, and for each attrition in the event of a closing of a location.
c.	The SEL will receive additional credit to be added as agreed by the parties for new components businesses, subject to the conditions set forth in Document 89 “Credit Toward SEL" dated the effective date covering such matters.

(0)	Each employee who leaves the bargaining unit for a salaried position will be replaced immediately with no effect on the SEL by recalling an employee from u.	layoff For each regular salaried employee returning to the bargaining unit, the
SEL will be increased by one.
(P)	SEL eligiMe employees off roll wi 11 maintain thjir cligibiItty upon reinstatement.
(Q)	’ In the event there is an opening due to a volume increase, die available Protected employee with the highest seniority will be placed in this opening, unless the JOBS Committee determines the employee should first complete the employee's current assignmem. If seniority employees are on layoff from that plant, a number of such employees, equivalent to the number of Protected employees placed in openings due to volume increases will be recalled from layoff.
A layoff caused by an event described in Paragraph I (D) will have no impact on the number of Protected employees except for an employee who is protected from a layoff attributable to a market related volume decline in excess of 36 weeks. In those instances, Protected employees, having the least seniority, will be laid-off and replaced by an equivalent number of greater seniority employees who would otherwise have insufficient seniority to remain in the plant.
in the event the JOBS Committee determines that the number of Protected employees exceeds the number of expected openings at the plant within the next

Subcontracting of Skilled Trades Work
February 26. 2000
Mr. Ron Gcttclfinger
Vice President and Director
Aerospace Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Geitelfinger:
I
। It is the policy of Rolls-Royce Allison to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the labor, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Company does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors. This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
The Company hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employ ees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business, as tn the past.
in this regard, joint Management and Union work schedule and opportunity teams have worked very successfully in other locations. This approach has not only enhanced job security, but has allowed a better understanding as to the competitive challenges facing the panics. As such, the parties are committed to establish a skilled trades business team involving both Management and Union representation, who will work jointly to develop the most efficient approach to the work to be performed.	y
During the negotiations the Union discussed w ith the Company serious problems affecting the/ job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work. The Union complained that in certain instances the work force in maintenance and tool and die trades particularly was reduced through attrition and then work was contracted out to the point where there was insufficient manpower available within the plant to perform the work.
)
The essential elements in the complaints registered by the Union went to the question'of job security.
During the negotiations, the parties reviewed the competitive advantage of Rolls-Royce Allison's talented skilled trades workforce. Discussed were the Union’s concerns for the integrity of the apprenticeable trades, the job security of the skilled trades workforce, the content of skilled
ISO
trades work assignments, and the status of work functions historically performed by the bargaining unit.
At times it is not practicable for the Company to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance, tool and die and engineering skilled trades work, or contract it out. The Union recognises that in making such decisions the Company must consider, among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved. the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines.
In our discussions we agreed that employees' jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out. and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Company, moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so. in the performance of work which they have historically performed to produce its product and perform its services.
While Rolls-Royce Allison intends to provide this opportunity to its skilled trades workforce, the patties agreed that prolonged schedules involving substantial overtime were not in the best interest of employees or the Company and. as a result. Rolls-Royce Allison must consider the availability of its skilled workforce when scheduling potential overtime. The parties are expected to work out acceptable means by which Management will have reliable information as to the hours employees will work when planning such work schedules.
Accordingly, the Company states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work which adversely affects the job security of its employees and that it will utilize various training programs available to it, whenever practicable, to maintain employment opportunities for its employees consistent with the needs of the Company.
During Ute current negotiations Che parties also discussed the special procedure for processing subcontracting grievances as provided by Paragraphs (42a) and (46).
The parties agreed that should the Director of the Aerospace Department of the Intemaiional Union elect to handle such a case pursuant to Paragraph (42a) (2). and refer it hack io the Appeal Committee for negotiation pursuant to Paragraph (111), such negotiations shall be limited to the issues defined in the written record of the case.
The Company is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Company. Therefore, in making these deiciutirut.’fons. the Company intends always to keep ihe interests of Rolls-Royce Allison personnel in mind.
Very truly yours.

JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS - SEL
Mr. Ron Gette! finger Vice President and Director Aerospace Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
February 26.2000
Dear Mr. Gette Kinger
Subject: JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs - SEL
During the course of these negotiations, the Company and Union have provided Rolls-Royce Allison employees with substantially increased job security through the new SEL feature of the JOBS Program, which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market conditions. The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The Company acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable. In panicuiar. the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced production requirements to the UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plants in the event of overall market declines. The Company agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical.
In atty event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with local seniority agreements and. if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the current Rolls-Royce AllisonffJAW Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of determining SEL related protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, and tn turn just those declines that are not affected by Company sourcing choices of engines and components that compete with or act as replacements for engines and components produced by Rolls-Royce Allison employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. In other words, volume declines that arc attributable to the Company’s production and'purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, caplives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.I would be considered an exception io the overall volume related exclusion in Section [(DJofthe JOBS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Company provide the JOBS Committee adequate notice of any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all
152
information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the extent to which such decline is associated with a Company sourcing action and the appropriate number of SEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff. •
The Company recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Company also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to SEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.	-
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parlies in determining when volume related declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive. '
• Market Related Conditions - IncJudetf io this category- is customer preference of one gas turbine engine over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built Rolls-Royce Allison engines that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of an engine sold in the U.S. by Rolls-Royce Allison but not produced in a UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plant.
• Example of Market Related Conditions
There is a decline in economic activity which depresses retail sales of UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison engines Lower production levels require the layoff of employees. Plant A, employing 500 SEL-eligible employees, is the sole source of Engine Z for the U.S. market; it is required to layoff one shift, or 200 employees. The number of SEL-eiigiblc employees at the plant remains at 500. including 200 open positrons for laid-off employees.
While the plant Is down to one shift, the Company decides io outsource a component, which reduces employment requirements by 20 employees per shift. Twenty (20) employees are placed on Protected employee status. There is no impact on the SEL numbers.
U.S. engine demand picks up to pre-Jayoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 500.
As ihe second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downturn production levels, an additional 20 employees are placed on Protected employee status which now leaves a total of 40 employees. The SEL plant number remains at 500.
* Product Dlsconli nuance - Because of the in troduction of a ne w U. S ,-bui 11 Ro 11 s-Royce Allison engine or a non-al lied company engine not sold by Allison, sales of another Rolls-Royce Allison-manufactured engine may decline, and production of the latter engine must be
153
curtailed necessitating reductions tn employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1{D) of the Program.
• Example of Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Retail Preference
A new U.S -built Rolls-Royce Allison engine (or any other new nun-allied company engine which is not marketed by the Company) is introduced. Sales of Engine X decline by 50%. and production must be curtailed. The necessary reductions in employmem are made through layoffs, keeping the number of SEL-eligible.employees at the plant at the same level.
•	Faulty Product - Engine volume may decline because of faulty pans in an engine that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
•	Changes in Retail Preference - Rolls-Royce Allison volume may decline because of customer preference shifts - in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, eg.. small engine preference shifts to large engine, option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
•	Non-Rolls-Royce Allison Commercial Customer Preference- Cancellation or declines in product volume for Rolls-Royce Allison manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such volume reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
- Example of Non-Rolls-Royce All isort Commercial Customer Preference
Plant A produces components for certain helicopter engines. Volume is reduced as a result of a decline in gasoline consumption. One hundred fifty (150) employees are laid / off; 150 open volume-related positions are established.	,
Al the time production is back to pre-layoff levels the Company introduces two robots which replace 25 employees. According to SEL guidelines all of the 150 employees are recalled from layoff, 25 of them are assigned to Protected employee status, and the number of SEL-eligible employees remains equal to its pre-layoff level. , /
•	Non-Rolls-Royce Allison Produced Engines - If sales of a new or replacement engine manufactured by an allied company for Rolls-Royce Allison, that competes with an engine manufactured by the Company, results in reduced sales of the Company-manufactured engine, the action would not be volume related and layoffs under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program would not be permitted.
- Example of Non-Rolls-Royce Allison Produced Engines
I SI
The Company outsources an engine that it markets in competition with Engine W manuiactuted by UAW-Rofis-Royce Aflison employees. This results in reduced sales of Engine W. Employment requirements are reduced, but this event is not covered under Paragraph 1(D) of the JOBS Program and layoffs are not permitted. This protection also extends to employees producing UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison components which are manufactured for Engine W.
•	Other Components or Materials
It is recognized that reductions in engine production will often be accompanied by reductions in component production. When reductions in engine production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to engines sold by Rolls-Royce Allison but not produced in UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from a UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison and a non-UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plant, production declines at the UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plant will only be considered volume-related lo the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
- Examples:
(ll Plant A receives single crystal turbine blades from a UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plant and equiax turbine blades from a non-UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plant. A volume decline occurs in single crystal turbine blades because of customer preference for equiax turbine blades. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the turbine blades would not be considered like or similar components.
(2) Plant B receives a component that has plastic fastening brackets from a UAW-Rolls-Royce Allison plant and the same component but with steel fastening brackets from a non-UAW-Rolis-Royce Allison plant. The components are used interchangeably and
\ would be considered like or similar components. Therefore, any volume declines in this component production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered : volume related.
As implied by these examples, there are many variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework within which the JOBS Committee may review the applicability of Paragraph 1(D) to volume reductions.
If ihe JOBS Committee cannot agree on a situation being defined as volume related. i HaUCr may be appealed to the national parties for resolution.
Very truly yours.

Dear Mr. CieH el finger:
During the current negotiations. Ore parties discussed situations where the Local Union Has required to refund union dues to a Surge number of employees. This occurred when employees were laid off after a dues deduction had been made but before they had worked sufficient hours io Sie liable for dues under the UAW Constitution for that month.	.
The Company advised the Union that in those situations where it is known in advance that a large number of employees (itJO or wr;} are scheduled to be permanently laid off and are not anticipated to work the necessary hours to owe dues under the UAW Constitution, the Financial Secretary may request that the plant delay for one week the deduction of monthly dues. In similar situations where the number of employees being laid off is less than 100, the Financial Secretary may request that the regular deduction of monthly dues for these employees be suspended. These requests must be submitted to the plant Director. Human Resources one week prior to the payroll period that monthly dues deductions are made.
Upon request of the Manager. Employee Relations, the payroll department will initiate the required steps to accomplish this procedure.

Asa part of current negotiations. Rolls-Royce Allison informed the International Union, UAW that the following letter. concerning Notice to Laid Off Employees of Anticipated Recall would be published. The text of that letter is as follows:
"During negotiations, the parties discussed at length the problems involved in recalling large masses of employees back to work from layoff in situations such as the addition of a shift at a plant. Both parlies recognized the mutual interest that would be served by the focal management notifying laid off seniority employees in advance of such known mass recalls to facilitate the orderly recall when it in fact occurs.
"Accordingly, when mass recalls arc anticipated sufficiently in advance at a local plant, local management and the local union should discuss the matter of a prerecall notification to employees in an attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory ’•	method to implement the notice.

RELIEVING EMPLOYEE FOR COMM ITT E EPERSON DISCUSSION’
Consistent with the purpose of the Grievance Procedure, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an employee should be excused from the job in order to confer with the Committeeperson handling the employee's grievance. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the employee from the job. On many jobs discussion between the employee and the Committeeperson is entirely practical without the necessity for the employee being relieved. On the other hand, an employee working in an excessively noisy area should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss the grievance with the Committeeperson. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.

Dear Mr. GetteHlnger:
For many years the Company and your Union, in their respective Fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of race, color, religion, age. sex. national origin, handicap and sexual harassment and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated Paragraph (6) in their Agreement that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Rolls-Royce Allison and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject 11) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as ihe exclusive method for prompt resolution of all claims of violations of Paragraph (6). 12) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and {3) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems, (cl to seek solutions to mutual problems, id} to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice.
Accordingly, the parties agree to establish within thirty (30) days of the ratification of the Agreement dated today an Equal Application Committee.
The Equal Application Committee will be ctrntpased of two (2) representatives of the Union, one >f whom will be a member of <he international Union’s Civil Rights Committee, or a designee, nd (wo (2} representatives of the Company, one of whom will be active in the Company’s equal ■nployment opportunity programs. The Committee will meet as frequently as is mutually emed desirable or necessary and its functions shall be the following:
ret
a.	Review and discuss ways and means of encouraging empioyecs and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive method to resolve claims erf violations of Paragraph (6).
b.	Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems from arising or recurring.
c.	Maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state agencies for purposes set forth in the second paragraph of this letter.
d.	Review and discuss ways and means of implementing Rolls-Royce Allison's policy regarding employment of the handicapped.
e.	Recommend ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as die exclusive method for resolving claims of violations of Paragraph {da}.
f.	Suggest guidelines for Union and company representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievances alleging such claims,
g.	Recommend a means for determining the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
Where the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union is an employee of the plant wages will he paid for lime spent attending the quarterly meetings.
Copies of the minutes from these meetings will be made available to the Union.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral responsibility for assuring that all Rolls-Royce Allison employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom from discrimination us set forth in Paragraph (61 of the Agreement. Consequently, the function of the Equal Application Committee shall be advisory, consultative and cooperative. While the Company and the Union will welcome the recommendations the Committee may make. theCommittee may not commit cither party to a specific course of action. However, die Union agrees that it will encourage its members to utilize the grievance and arbitration procedure as the means of resolving claims or complaints against the Company which allege a violation of Paragraph {6).

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
During the course of current negotiations Rolls-Royce Allison and (he International Union. UAW reaffirmed their commitment to the Rolls-Royce Allison-UAW Orientation Program. The details of the orientation program are as follows;
"Men and women enter the work force today with little or no knowledge of what is expected of them as employees and as union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not been adequately prepared to cope with industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
"New employees come to Rolls-Royce Allison, with little or at best incomplete information about their employer and their union. They have little knowledge of the extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in collective bargaining between the UAW and Rolls-Royce AHison over a period of more than thirty years.
"Many new employees may he unaware of the commitment of Rolls-Royce Allison and the UAW to fair employment practices and to the application of the Agreement to all employees without regard to race, color, creed, age. sex or national origin. They are not familiar with basic contract provisions covering such subjects as transfer;, prrmtuiions, shill preference and seniority. They maybe unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid skilled trades jobs through the Apprentice and ElT programs. They tend to be unfamiliar with the obligations of the employee to his job. to the union and to his employer. Many are unaware of the importance of regular attendance, quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by all in getting the job done. Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their job and their relationship to their union and their employer.
"New employees usually have little knowledge of Rte long history of the UAW and of the administrative structure of the UAW at the International and local union levels. Tltev do not
iso
understand about their relationship lo the union, aboui the initiation fees and dues requirements and their rights wiihin the union contained in the UAW Constitution and guaranteed by right of appeal to the Union's Public Review Board.
"Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used.
"You have underscored these realistic considerations in our recent discussions. You have indicated that this may explain to some extent the high turnover and absenteeism being experienced in industry today among ihe new work force. And you have suggested that a properly developed and conducted orientation procedure designed to create an 'awareness of the dynamics of die labor-management relationship, and the years long effort to build a community of interest in resolving labor-management problems through orderly procedures...' might serve the best interest of the employees, the UAW and Rolls-Royce Allison.
“Accordingly, pursuant to the Union's suggestion, the Company will, in cooperation w ith the International Union, undertake development of a joint pilot orientation program to be presented to new job applicants prior to Ihe time they start their jobs.
"The content of the orientation program would be developed by the Company and the International Union and utilized when significant numbers of new employees are being hired.
"The Company and the International Union would determine how the various portions of the orientation program would be implemented. Some subjects might most appropriately be presented by a Management representative, some by a Union representative, and others by both Management and Union representatives.
"The orientation program would not be subject to the grievance procedure and could be terminated at any plant by either the international Union or the Company, in the event that the program at the plant was not being carried on in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of She program as established by the national parties. The joint orientation program would be limited to those subjects agreed to by the Company and the International Union and the establishment of such a program would not limit any other communication by Management with its employees or by the Union with its members,

Dear Mr. Get tel finger:
During the course of2000 negotiations. Rolls-Royce Allison and the International Union. UAW held extensive discussions about the subject of product quality. There is ongoing recognition on the part of both parlies to the Agreement that the cornerstone of job security for all Rolls-Royce Allison employees is the production of highest quality, customer-valued products. This is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality both on the national and local level, exemplified by the formation and institution of the UAW-GM jointly developed Quality Network, which the parties have determined to be applicable in its basic form to Rolls-Royce Allison. with revisions where it is mutually determined to be necessary.

PRODUCT QUALITY
February 26. 2000
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Daring the 2000 Negotiations, the Union expressed a desire for UAW members who have contributed significantly to improved product quality to be permitted to display on completed assembled engines and packaging and shipping containers a joint label or decal certifying that the product is proudly built by Rolls-Royce Allison workers who arc members of the UAW. During 2000 Negotiations, (he Company agreed to continue this approach to employee recognition.
During these negotiations, the Company informed the Union that Management will fully implement a jointly developed suggestion program based upon the Quality Network principles within six (6) months of the effective date of this agreement. The parlies recognize the necessity for joint leadership involvement at the plant and staff level inorder to achieve this commitment and to gain the support and confidence from employees io submit their ideas. The purpose of the suggestion plan is to provide employee recognition, and encourage continuous improvement, thereby enhancing long term job security, it is not the purpose of the suggestion plan to reduce employment levels.
The Rolls-Royce Allison/UAW Quality Council will review the Planned Maintenance Action Strategy and determine an implementation strategy for Rolls-Royce Allison within the first six (6) months following ratification of the 2000 Rolls-Royce Allison/UAW National Agreement. The purpose of planned maintenance is to improve safety, quality, throughput and reduce cost thereby enhancing overall job security. The parties further agreed that (he Roils*Royce Allison/UAW Quality Council will continually measure and guide progress toward full implementation during the life of this agreement.
During the term of the 2000 Rolls-Royce Alii son-UAW Agreement, the parties discussed the desire of the UAW representatives to provide an opportunity to input into Company marketing campaigns. It is the Company's intent to provide opportunities for such input in the future as a part of the Rolls-Royce Allison/UAW Quality Council process.
Further, the parties discussed at length the importance of Rolls-Royce Allison advertising campaigns involving or depicting UAW represented Rolls-Royce Allison employees, (he positive impact the message of such campaigns can have on our employees and customers. The Company
2txt
informed the Union that a mutually agreed to process would be developed to provide opportunity for UAW representatives to preview for input purposes such future Rolls-Royce Allison advertising campaigns involving or depicting UAW represented Rolls-Royce Allison employees.
The parties recognize the benefits of providing the Union the opportunity for input to the development and implementation of sales promotion activities, providing for joint participation by bargaining unit and salaried employees. Management informed the Union that a process would be developed to insure UAW representatives input to such programs tn (he future.

SUPPLIER CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
February 26. 2000
Mr. Ron Gctteifinger Vice President and Director Aerospace Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Mi 482 M
Dear Mr. Gellei finger:
During these negotiations, the UAW stated its interest in having the Company continue to recognise the importance of using suppliers which are good corporate citizens and which can be relied upon for quality products and reliable delivery. The UAW further pointed out that the Company's selection of and relationship with suppliers have a significant bearing on its relationship with the Union. In this regard, the Union stressed repeatedly, with respect to work which cannot be produced in-house, the importance of increasing significantly the Company's use of high quality, reliable suppliers which maintain good, fair and equitable relations with their employees.
Rolls-Royce Allison fully understands the Union's concerns in these matters, because quality products, uninterrupted delivery and good corporate citizenship -- by the Company and its suppliers — contribute significantly to the Company's success in the marketplace, and all of these fitetors have a direct bearing on the job and income security of UAW members.
Rolls-Royce Allison agrees that its relationship with the Union is of paramount importance to the Company's long-term success. The Company has told its suppliers and the business community in the past of the positive aspects of its relationship with the UAW and will continue to do so in the future. Rolls-Royce Allison, therefore, has no interest in embarking on a purchasing strategy that would detract from that relationship.
Correspondingly, the Unirm has, from lime to time, expressed to the Corporation its concern about certain aspects of the Company's relationship with particular suppliers in the area of quality, continuity of supply, and overall performance as a supplier including the maintenance of good relations by the supplier with its employees, fhe Union recognizes that the Company has expressed its view's and made suggestions to its suppliers as a result of the Union's concerns, all within the bounds of applicable legal principles.
202
The panics recognize ihal instances in which these matters arise are inherently' dependent upon ihe particular facts that are present in each situation and plan to continue to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis as they have in Che past, and incompliance with applicable laws.
In particular, the Company will continue to urge its suppliers to treat their employees in a good, fair and equitable manner and to avoid conduct which violates national or state labor and employment laws, in addition, the Company will, in a manner which is in compliance with applicable laws, notify suppliers of the importance the Company places on harmonious relationships between suppliers, their employees and any union that may represent them.

Dear Mr. Gettelfioger:
Ihe If AW and Rolls-Royce Allison recognize the need for a focused career development process for active employees as a key element in competitiveness and employment security. The career development process tnust address both internal career needs of individual employees and critical skill needs of the company. A focused approach beginning early in each employee's career could provide the employee with the skills and knowledge required by changing business conditions.
The parties have, therefore. agreed to the following:
1.	Voluntary individual employee assessments to determine interests, abilities and career development needs which may be met internally through a broader variety of on-the-job (raining, classroom technical training, training in basic computational skills and reading
■ and writing, classroom training leading to a special certification, associate or baccalaureate degree.
2,	An internal career development process for hourly employees which may provide for
broad job experience.
3.	Cooperation with community college, college, university and other educational and training facilities in the community in the development of career focused classroom and cooperative training programs for active workers.
4.	In the event that it should ever become necessary in the future, the parties may explore the development of career focused classroom and cooperative work programs for dislocated workers which would lead lo comparable employment.
This program will be supported by a combination of joint training funds and will be administered jointly by the Executive Board for Joint Activities and the Local Joint Training Committee.

Dear Mr, Gettelfinger;
During these negotiations the parties discussed at length the need to focus our current joint program representatives on specific programs designed to assist our employees and the management in implementation of an improved working environment.
Over the years, we have agreed to a number of different joint program representatives appointed by the Vice President and Director of the Aerospace Department. UAW. and. in some cases, by the local management and union leadership at the direction of the Co-Chairman, Executive Board Joint Activities to carryout and administer certain negotiated agreement programs in the following functions;
•	Health and Safety ■ » Joint Activities
•	Accommodating Dis/Abled People in Transition (ADAPT)
•	Employee Assistance Program
•	Human Resource Development
•	Joint Training
•	Quality Network
Rolls-Royce Allison, depending on employee population, may have employees assigned to the above functions, Each time new programs have been negotiated, people were assigned to perform the tasks associated with each program to the extent that we now have several well-trained experts tn those fields. The parties recognize that over the years priorities have shifted and. as a result, there is a need to carefully analyze the programs that currently require increased emphasis, such as, employee assistance, health and safety, etc. As a result, the parties have concluded that these well-trained resources can now be deployed or reassigned to programs requiring special attention.
Jus
it is recognized that each plant location has its own unique culture and needs; therefore, the local joint leadership group (Vtce-Presidem of Operations. Director of Human Resources, Local Union President and Chairperson of the Shop Committee) will determine where their current full time representatives will be allocated to best serve the employees of the organization. It is recognized that at some locations additional representatives may be required to perform tasks associated with the newly determined local focus and at others less. In any event, the total number of new and current full lime joint program representatives shall not exceed the number provided for below:
Plant Population
Up to MO
201 to 400

Ratto of 1:250
In the case of bargaining units between 1,001 to 5.000 and 5,001 and above, the number of representatives in a given bargaining unit will be determined by the number of represented employees i active, temporary layoff and Protected) divided by the appropriate ratio number. Where the fraction of the result is ,5 and above, the number will be rounded up to the next highest whole number and where the fraction is less than ,5. rounded down to the whole number.
Nothing in this agreement limits or is intended to interfere with any local mutually agreed upon projects or initiatives fulling outside the scope of this document that may provide additional staff resources to meet the specific objectives of the local parties.
The local parties will review their plan fra-deployment of these resources in accordance with specific guidelines issued by the National parties. All such representatives will be appointed by the Vice President and Director of Ihe Aerospace Department. UAW. Such plan will include the names and assignments for each of the local representatives assigned to Join! Programs and will be forwarded to the National parties for approval prior to implementation. Likewise, as individual plant needs and priorities change, the local parties are afforded the flexibility to submit revised plans for National approval.
When plant population changes occtti which would increase or decrease the number of representatives, such population changes must be in effect for a period of six consecutive months before such adjustment is made in the number of representatives, tn which case such adjustment will be made at the conclusion of the six month period.

ARBITRATION LETTER
February 26,2000
During the course of the current negotiations, the parties reviewed the Grievance Procedure provisions of the Agreement for the purpose of identifying certain problems that have been encountered under those provisions in processing grievances to arbitration. Generally, it was recognised that the procedure, as currently constituted, has worked well. The Union stated that some instances have occurred wherein grievances protesting an employees loss of seniority, discharge or a series of disciplinary layoffs leading to a discharge, have me! with delay in the procedure following their consideration at the Third Step and their resolution ar the Umpire Step.
In view of the above, the Company agreed to provide the Union with a monthly summary of appeal cases open on the Umpire's docket protesting the loss of seniority, the discharge of employees and also those protesting progressive disciplinary actions which involve an employee whose discharge is also under protest in an open appeal case. This information will enable both the International Union and Company Umpire Staffs to monitor the number of such cases on appeal to the Umpire at any given time and to lake remedial action on any particular cases which may be subject to undue delay.
The parties further agreed that in the event the Company and the Umorr could not agree upon art impartial umpire (0 hear a case, the parties will request a panel of five (5) umpires from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parlies will strike alternatively from the agreed upon panel with the final remaining umpire selected to serve as the impartial umpire to hear that case. The cost of the umpire will be shared equally by the Company and the Local Union,
(n addition, the parties agreed io schedule regular meetings between the respective Umpire Staffs to establish future scheduling, to explore alternatives that could increase the frequency with which plant appeal cases are addressed and to review other problems of mutual concern.

Dear Mr. Gettclfinger:
During the current National negotiations, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, (air and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of rhe fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW. by either its Executive Board. Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found dial such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the International Union may inform the Company's Labor Relations Staff in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the Grievance Procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
it is agreed, however, that die Company will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either are already barred under the provisions of the Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or that relate to the period between the lime of the original disposition and the time of ihe reinstatement us provided herein. Il is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Company in the Grievance Procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, State, or municipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Impartial Umpire or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Company and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parties under the terms of the Agreement, except as specifically limited herein, and does not

QUALITY NETWORK IMPLEMENTATION REDEPLOYMENT AND MEANINGFUL WORK
During the term of Ute 1990 GM-UAW National Agreement and through the direction of the North American Operations (NAO) UAW-GM Quality Council the focus of the QualityNetwork evolved and changed from development to implementation. During this same period. GM North American Operations experienced operating losses requiring more efficient practices > and a renewed focus on product quality.
implementation of Synchronous Workshops, Accelerated Workshops (i.e.. FICOS), Lean Manufacturing and other quality improvement activities. such as, best practices, resulted in health and safety, ergonomic, and Operatiemat improvements affecting quality and the cost of GM products and services. In many cases, these activities resuited in UAW-represented GM employees being placed in a JOBS Bank under the terms of the 1990GM-UAW National Agreement. The Union leadership felt they could not be party to asking their members co assist in 'working themselves out of a job" by supporting these efforts. In any joint effort, job security and "people issues" had to be considered so that people would be redeployed to meaningful work. The issue was discussed at the January 13. 1992. GM Quality Council meeting resulting in specific commitments to integrate synchronous efforts into the joint Qutdily Network Process and explore ways to employ people more effectively with meaningful work, and help improve the business.
When funding for the JOBS Bank was exhausted and the program discontinued. Management recognized that employee support and involvement in plant quality and productivity improvement activities were essential. As a result, on March 2,1993, after the JOBS funding was exhausted and employees in the JOBS Bank were laid off (although no Allison employees were so impacted), an "Employment Policy" was made effective which resulted in employees being retained at work and not laid off when such employees were impacted by jointly initialed product quality and operational effectiveness improvement efforts.
During (he 1993 negotiations. General Motors and rite UAW discussed the above events and the Union provided examples of successful redeployment processes. These redeployment processes, implemented at divisions and plants, resulted in people being retained at work and redeployed to meaningful assignments after they had been made available as aresult of quality and productivity improvements and other initiatives,
rollowing 1993 negotiations. General Motors and the UAW agreed to jointly develop guidelines sr redeployment processes, similar to those reviewed by the parties, to assist plant and staff cations with planning for redeployment opportunities. Such guidelines were intended to assist t local parties with lire development of plans that put first emphasis on redeployment oi ployecs to meaningful assignments, which included regular productive assignments and "non-‘ittonal" work, as well as efforts to competitively retain or insourcc new work.
123
According!y during these negotiations, Roils-Royce Allison and the UAW stated their intent to not place employees in underutilized or unproductive assignments or only contemplate utilization of the job security provisions of the National Agreement Further, the parties agreed to review the UAW/GM developed document '‘Guidelines for Redeployment and Meaningful Work" (QN-S22511 and evaluate its applicability to Rolls-Royce Allison in developing redeployment plans.

Dear Mr. Gette) finger.
During the current negotiations the UAW complained that procedures set forth in Paragraph (J83)ld) are not being satisfactorily implemented by Management in many instances.
This letter is intended to clarify the intent and purpose of this provision:
1.	The "advance discussion" except where time and circumstances prevent it. will take place "prior to Jetting the contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work." before any decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out, The "advance discussion" will include information as to "why Management is contemplating contracting out the work." ft is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only "contemplating contracting cut the work" when the "advance discussion" lakes place. Management should not have made any decisions concerning whether or not to contract out the work before such "advance discussion" is held.
„	-1
2.	Management should advise the local Union of the "nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason or reasons (equipment, manpower etc J. why Management is contemplating contracting out the work.". The conditions of "manpower, skills, equipment and facilities" and also as to whether the Company "can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits may be entailed in the determination as Io whether a particular contract should be let out or not. it is necessary that Management advise the local Union in the "advance discussion" concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decisionmaking.
115
3.	If ip the "advance discussion" it is clear that Management is only "contemplating contracting out the work' and if in addition ail the pertinent information as noted above is supplied to the local Union, then local Union representatives will be given a better opportunity "to comment on Management's plans" and will also give an opportunity to Management "to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances,"
In addition the Union complained that in certain instances plant Management requested and contracted for mainienance service on leased equipment, and extended warranty arrangements or service contracts were being purchased which impacted the job security of seniority employees in skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while Paragraph (183)(b) covers the "fulfillment of normal warranty obligations by the vendor", warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracis are not covered by these provisions. Rather, such arrangements or service contracts covering work normally and historically performed by represented skilled trades employees are to be considered in the same manner as contracts for the performance of maintenance work and such decisions are covered by the provisions of Paragraph (183)(c) of the Agreement,

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
We have managed to find common ground on many of the issues involved in these negotiations. Nowhere has that been mote evident than in our mutual treatment of issues involving education and training and other programs of joint interest to better our employees and enhance their job security by strengthening the competitive position of Rolls-Royce Allison. Our deliberations in this area are in step with congressional and private sector initiatives toward a new era of cooperative labor relations.
in this regard, cooperative labor relations with respect to the joint arena can be accomplished only when activities are jointly approved, developed, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Furthermore, decisions must be arrived at in a setting which is characterized by the parties working together in an atmosphere of trust; making mutual decisions at all levels of administration which respect the concerns and interests of the parties involved; sharing responsibility for the problem solving process; and sharing the rewards of common goals.
In these negotiations, we have provided funding for our joint programs which reflect this national policy of cooperative labor relations. We should continue to ensure that the projects, programs and events which are supported in whole or in pan with these joint funds do in fact keep us communicating on all levels, consistent with this objective.
We agree these funds will continue to be used to help solve mutual problems which may not be collective bargaining problems. They will continue to be used lo make Rolls-Royce Allison and its employees more competitive in a global economy. In this regard, we jointly sponsor conferences, workshops, seminars and meetings to promote cooperative efforts on related subjects, and where appropriate, invite academic, professional, government, labor and industry representatives to attend and participate. In addition, we understand that white these funds are intended for education, training and development of UAW bargaining unit employees, there are situations where it will be natural for some salaried employees to receive the same training or participate in the same program. Such expenses far non-bargaining unit employees may be funded with joint funds provided the parties agree.
Further, the jointly sponsored projects, programs and activities are designed to promote public awareness or Rolls-Royce Allison products (including the quality and reliability of such products I, Rolls-Royce Allison workforce and its role in producing high quality products, and the relationship between Rolls-Royce Allison and ihe collective bargaining representatives for Rolh-Roycc Allison employees.
We also recognize that as representatives of organizations such as the UAW and Rolls-Royce Allison, which are viewed by most as key to the vibrancy of local economies where our plants arc located as well as the national economy, we are expected to be responsible citizens and caring neighbors. Therefore, from time to time we have agreed to use these funds to assist the victims of disaster or the less fortunate in the communities where our employees live and work. We have also supported research projects or efforts by other training, educational or cultural institutions which will through education and exposure promote our goals of labor and management February cooperation in the workplace.
We have pledged that these joint funds will continue to be used to enhance all our employees involvement in, and appreciation for, decisions that affect their lives. We look to the UAW’s continued cooperation tn that regard in identifying and developing with us meaningful projects which witt assist their members, and our employees, in reaching that objective.
The parties further agree that new programs and activities designed to enhance the welfare and job security of UAW-represented employees may be funded by the Rolls-Royce Allison joint Funds, when authorized by the Company and the Internationa! Union under the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding joint Activities contained in the Agreement between Rolls-Royce Allison and the UAW.

APPRENTICE WORK ASSIGNMENTS
Inter-Organization
DATE:	February 26.2000
SUBJECT: Apprentice Work Assignments
During the current negotiations, the Union raised the question of apprentices being assigned to work alone. The panics agreed that good judgment and a rule of reason should be used when making these assignments.
As a result of these discussions it was concluded that, consistent with existing training methods and facilities in the plant, apprentices should not be assigned to perform work without a joumeyperson being present unless the apprentice has been trained to do the job: has been instructed in the proper safety procedures: and is considered competent to perform the assignment. Experienced joumeypersons will generally be available to assist the apprentice in many of the normal floor assignments until that level of competence has been reached. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices. Problems in this regard are a matter for review by the Rolls-Royce Allison-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.

RELATED TRAINING BONUS
Mr. Ron Gettel finger Vice President and Director Aerospace Department international Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettclfmger:
This will confirm the understanding reached during the current negotiations that within a reasonable period after a laid off apprentice. Employee-In-Training or Employee-In-Training-Seniority has been recalled to work at any Rolls-Royce Allison Plant, such employee will he paid an incentive bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses, required pursuant to Paragraphs (145) and (180), in which the employee was enrolled at the lime of layoff. In the event the employee is not recalled within a reasonable period of time, such employee may apply to the home plant for the related training bonus.
In addition, with prior Management approval and arrangements with the school, apprentices whom Management anticipates recalling to the apprentice classification prior to the expiration of the school term may be enrolled for one term and become eligible for an incentive bonus on the same basis.
This incentive bonus will amount to a figure to be arrived at by multiplying the number of class hours in each course times the employee s straight-time hourly rale less the amount, if any. paid to the employee for such related training prior to layoff.

LAYOFFS - APPRENTICES AND EMPLDYEES-JN-TRA1N1NG
ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON
February 26.2000
Mr. Ron Oeltei finger Vice President and Director Aerospace Department international Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr, Gettelfinger:
During the current negotiations the patties discussed a! length a problem encountered at some , plant locations where empioyees-in-t raining and apprentices are in training to become joumeypersons in the same skilled trades classification and there is cither a need for a reduction or increase in the number of such employees in a skilled trades classification.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing opportunities and training for employees through both the Rolls-Royce Ailtson-UAW Standard Apprentice Program and the Employee-InTraining Program consistent with the needs of the business. To preserve the continuity of the Apprentice Program, which has generally been viewed as the long run source of skilled trades personnel in the appreniiceable classifications, the parties have negotiated appropriate provisions in the Agreement to avoid unnecessary interruptions of the program. The Employee-Jn-Training Program is equally necessary arid has been continued by the parlies lo supplement the journeyperson work force at times of increased work load and during shortages of skilled trades personnel. Importantly, the Empioyee-In-Training Program also provides opportunities for persons to upgrade their skills and provisions have been negotiated enabling employees-in-training m continue their training and achieve joumeyperson status.
Employres-in-training may be reduced due to a reduction in force or displaced by a joumeyperson in accordance with Paragraph (174} or by an employee-in-training-seniority in accordance with Paragraph (175}, Apprentices may be reduced due to a reduction in force or displaced by journeypersons in accordance with Paragraph (138). In addition. Paragraph (139) provides that in the event of a drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled trades work force, additional apprentices may be reduced pursuant to a mutually acceptable layoff and recall plan agreed upon by the local patties. Likewise, temporary layoff situations are governed by locally negotiated provisions pursuant to Paragraph (1771.
235
Except for those situations covered by Agreement provisions, the following procedure will apply to the reduction of employees-in-traini ng and/or apprentices when neither journeypersons nor employecs-in-training-sehiority are reduced from the classification:
•	Employees-in-t raining who have accumulated less than (2) years credited work
experience in the classification in that plant will be reduced before any apprentice is reduced;
*	Employees-in-training who have accumulated (2) or more years of credited work
experience io the classification in that plant wifi not be reduced before ail apprentices who have not completed (4} periods of the shop training schedule have been reduced from that classification;
•	Al! empioyees-irr-waining in the classification will be reduced before any apprentice who has completed (4) periods of Pte shop training schedule is reduced.
The completion of (4) periods of the shop training schedule for apprentices and the credited work experience in the classification in that plant for employees-in-training for purposes of this procedure shall be based on a calculation made as of rhe fast Monday of the month preceding the month during which such a reduction occurs.
Similar consideration is to occur when there is a need to recall a number of employees to a classification where there are both employees-in-training and apprentices reduced from the classification.
Any complaints regarding the application of this procedure in any plant may be taken up with Local Management of that plant by the Local Shop Committee and if not resolved may be reviewed by the appropriate section of the International Union with the Company.

ADMINISTRATION OF PARAGRAPH (178)
lnter-0 rganiiatkm
Date:	February 26.2000
Subject; Administration of Paragraph ((78)
During the current negotiations the Union complained about improper administration of Paragraph (178) by local management.
These complaints centered around the hiring of skilled trades employees as jour ne y persons without sufficient checking by local Managemem of the documents presented by the applicants to assure they qualify for such status in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (178). They also complained that in some instances Management shifted die blame to the Union when such an employee had to be released because, upon further investigation, the information upon which Management relied to hire the individual did not meet the criteria of Paragraph (178).
In response to these complaints, the Company stated it would provide such documentation to the Local Joint Skilled Trades and Apprentice Commiitee and the matter will be thoroughly investigated before an employee is hired. In this regard, it was observed that establishment of such proof of status is often expedited when the applicant is a laid off bona ftde UAW joumeyperson. Additionally, the Company assured the Union that any explanation concerning the reasons a newly hired journeyperson employee must be terminated because of failure to meet the requirements of Paragraph (178) is to be based on those factual reasons and not on the fact that the Local Union may have questioned the matter.
The parties mutually agreed that both the local Management and the local Union must exercise fair but sound judgment when considering matters relative to Paragraph (178).

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING
Mr. Ron Geltelfinger Vice President and Director Aerospace Department Internationa) Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Getlel finger:
This will describe the methods to be used by the Rolls-Royce Allison Payroll Department in regard to withholding of Federal income la* from employee’s wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of vacation from employee's wages.
Grievance awards in excess of $500.00, but involving periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be withheld using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental cantings.
It should be noted that the lax withholding referenced above only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for FICA taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in oudtvion to >he amount withheld for Federal income lax.
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00 will be aggregated with the regular pay roll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on the total amount.
If a grievance award is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annual period. Thus, in such situations, Rolls-Royce Allison Payroll will use the annua! percentage table to calculate the income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.	;
For vacation payments made for time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e,, income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment.
2J9
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Ta* Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, of necessity. have to be reviewed for compliance with the above changes.
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to Rolls-Royce Allison Payroll by copy of this letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.

OVERTIME POLICIES
Inter-Organization
Date:	February 2 b. 2000
Subject:	Overtime Policies
To:	SBU Managers Human Resource Managers
As part of the current negotiations. Rolls-Royce Allison informed the International Union. UAW that it is the Company's intention to continue its previous policy regarding overtime practices. This policy will be applicable only to those employees who are not covered by the provisions of Paragraph (7 la) of the 2000 National Agreement.
There was considerable discussion in these negotiations about the claims of the International Union, UAW that too many employees who are required lo work overtime over extended periods are not excused from overtime work assignments even though they have legitimate reasons to be excused.
The Company pointed out that overtime serves a number of functions essential to the effective operation of Rolls-Royce Allison's tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances overtime must be worked in order to permit the plant lo meet schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant show work weeks for many employees. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet various deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer demand for Rolls-Royce Allison products.
Both the international Union and the Cumpuiy recognized that the nature of Ihe business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a supervisor's group is needed to fill Ihe jobs which are working overtime. When less than a full complement of employees is needed it is usually practicable for the supervisor to excuse employees who do not wish to work and confine the overtime assignments to those employees who do wish lo work. '
In situations where there are sufficient employees available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employees who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused front doing so. insofar as practicable.
255
Employee* who are required to work overtime should be given a* much advance notice ns i> practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary.
An individual employee’s personal problems in connection with working overtime should be given careful consideration and such individual needs should be recognized. The individual employee's request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period of time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the request is granted the employee will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employee can make personal plans accordingly. Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employee will only be made by mutual consent.
Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employee who is not assigned to a necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days will be excused from work on the next following Sunday provided the request for tire day off has been made before the end of the employee's shift on the previous Friday.

WEATHER CONDITIONS LETTER
Date:	February 26. 2000
To:	All SBU Managers

Subject-. Failure to Work Forty Hours as a Consequence of Severe Weather Conditions
The following is intended to address situations where employees fail to work forty (40} hours as a consequence of severe weather conditions. In general the following determinations will apply with respect to a plant shutdown or less than a simple majority of employees showing up on any given shift in an area in which severe -weather has occurred.
I.	In situations where the Company, by virtue of the declaration of a public emergency by a governmental body gives notification by public announcement (radio. TV. Newspaper) that it will not be open for operations, a maximum payment of eight (8) hours will be made to employees regularly scheduled to work during the period of the declared shutdown for each day of the declared shutdown. Such payments will be calculated based on the employee's assigned rate of record and will include any applicable shift premiums and COLA. In order to be eligible for such payment the employee must be considered a seniority employee under the relevant section of this Agreement.
2.	In situations where the Company has attempted to operate but has been forced to shut down due to the absenteeism of its employees, and such absenteeism is deemed by the parties to be attributable to severe weather conditions, a payment, calculated as the payment referenced in Paragraph I above, and reflective of the period for which they lost wages, will l<e made to employees who reported io work and -were sent home without having received a full eight (8) hours pay for the day in question due to the declaration of a shutdown, in light of employee . absenteeism. Employees who were scheduled to report on the day such a situation occurs will be eligible to receive a maximum payment of eight (8) hours for such an occurrence if they can demonstrate, through third party substantiation, that they were precluded from reporting to work due to "han" on driving in their city or county of residence. The term ■'ban" means that under a local law/otdinance being enforced, if caught driving in a.specified area, through which employees had no alternative but to travel to get to work on their regular shift, employees would be ticketed, fined and/or jailed.

INNOVATIVE WAGE STRUCTURE
February 26,2000
it. Roti Getteifinger /ice President and Director Aerospace Deparintent International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Getteifinger:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length issues that have arisen regarding the application of the Local Wage Agreement in the Company's plants. Historical differences have resulted in some wage rate variations which the parlies have attempted to address in previous negotiations. Likewise, the plant is engaged in various manufacturing operations having histories which resulted in classification structures that are not compatible with modem manufacturing methods and organizational structures.
In recognition that continuing improvements in the employee's quality of work life, quality of the product, and operational efficiencies are necessary and desirable, the parties have explored various methods to improve the wage structure within (be Company's manufacturing operations.
The parties agreed that innovative wage agreements could be instrumental in attaining these objectives and, accordingly, the National parties have agreed to work with and support any plant where there exists a mutual desire to explore such a concept.
Although not meant to restrict the full range of ideas and concepts which could be explored, the parties examined the concept of estabfishing three (31 non-skilled rates in a plant: sanitatiort/maintenancc. production, and utility. It was understood that appropriate transfer, seniority, shift preference, and other modifications are desirable and necessary to support such an innovative wage structure. This concept would be only one of the options available to a plant that desired to explore innovative wage structures, "Levels of Learning" or "Pay For Knowledge" systems would also be options to be considered.
There is a mutual desire on the part of Management and Union to explore any such innovati ve wage agreement concepts, they are specifically encouraged and authorized to discuss and propose such modifications. The National parties will provide any necessary assistance to the local Union and the local Plant Management. Any final agreement shall continue to be subject to the approval of the International Union and die Company, who will review these proposals in line with the concepts outlined in this letter.

Mr, Ron Geltelftnger Vice President and Director Aerospace Depart merit International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gette)finger;
This letter is to confirm certain agreements reached by Rolls-Royce Allison and the International Union. UAW, regarding the calculation of the Cost of Living Allowance pursuant to Paragraphs
I (101 )(d) through (10))(I) of the Agreement. I
1 The table in Paragraph (J 01 )(h) has been constructed to provide that J c adjustments in the Cost of Living Allowance shah become payable, sequentially, for each 0,3.0.2, 0,3. 0,2 and 0.3 change in the Index, and so forth, with that sequence of the five changes being repeated thereafter in the table so as to produce an average adjustment overtime of Ie for each 0.26 change in the Index, This table, which is based on (he Bureau of Labor Statistics' CPI-W (1967=1(10) iclcrcnee base, will be used for the first eight adjustments of the Agreement, beginning in March. 1997 through December. 1998,
Effective with the March, 1999 adjustment, this table will be converted to BLS's CPLW (1993->995 = 100) reference base. Beginning with the first next le that may become payable, the table will be modified further to provide that )e adjustments in the Cosi of Living Allowance shall become payable for each 0.06 change in the Average Index (1993-1995 = 100). The changes described herein are intended to maintain the same mathematical wage replacement ratio as exists, with 1967 = 100 at the time of the transition — and appropriate changes will be made upon publication of the official Index, if necessary.
In this regard, it is our intention to construct the tables in the following manner:
If the August - October 1998 Average Index falls at the bottom of a 0,2 or 0.3 bracket, or in the middle of a O.3 bracket, the starting value for the new table will be derived from ihe bottom of such bracket: and if it falls at the top of a 0.2 or 0.3 bracket, the new table's starting value will flow from the top of such bracket. These values are obtained by multiplying the appropriate top or bottom bracket value by the official BLS conversion factor and rounding to two decimal places.

Jf the Union claims that the Company's calculations in any particular instance were not made in accordance with the terms of this Letter of Understanding, it may pursue such claim in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (55) of the new National Agreement.

ENGINEERING METHOD OF ROUNDING
The following rules of rounding shall apply io the determination of the Consumer Price bides:
I.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is Jess than 5. the preceding digit is not affected. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.646 becomes 130,6.
2.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits not ait of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.557 becomes 130.6.
3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5. followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit reiaiiied is even. For example, when rounding to four digits.
130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.6500 becomes 130.6.

Dear Mr, Geitelfinger:
Subject:	Credit Toward SEL
The panics had extensive discussions during these negotiations concerning the Company's interest in increasing its competitiveness and growing its business, and the Union s interest in enhancing the job and income security of its members and expanding its Rolls-Royce Allison/ UAW employment rolls. We concluded that our goals in each of these areas ate not only compatible but achievable.
In recognition of this understanding, it was agreed that, in determining the SEL specified in Document 3, the Company may count UAW-represented active employees of an entity in which Rolls-Royce Allison has a controlling interest as “eligible employees'' in such calculations on a three-for-two bads (i,e,. every three of such employees will be counted as two "eligible employees ' in die SEL calculation I, provided that:
(I) such entities produce products or provide services that do not compete, directly or indirectly. with work covered by the Rolls-Royce Aiiison-U AW National Agreement. The Company will discuss with the Union, in advance, any products produced by or being considered for such ventures;
(2} investments in and product plans related lo such entities will not negatively impact investments and product plans associated with units covered under the Rolls-Royce AHison-UAW Agreement;
(3)	the wages and benefits of U aW-represented employees of such entities wilt be
competitive with the relevant industry segment or geographic area as appropriate:
265
< 4}	and, the wage s and bene fits of U AW -represented e mployees of such entities wi 11 be
competitive with UAW-represented employers in the relevant industry segment or geographic area as appropriate, and, further, that the wages and benefits of such entities will nor undercut the wages and benefits of UAW members working for such empfovers.
!n the case of entities having multiple locutions, only those plants/facilitie* satisfying the above conditions will be included in such calculations.
With regard to wages, the parties have agreed that the average wage rate of such an entity will be no less than the greater of: (i) the prevailing average wage for the top one-fifth of UAW-represemed employers in the relevant industry segment or geographic area as appropriate; or (2> the prevailing average wage for the toponc-fifth of companies in the relevant industry segment or geographic area in which the entity is situated as appropriate. These rates will be determined by surveys completed by independent organizations or consultants selected by the mutual agreement of the parties. The survey companies will be determined based on such factors as size, type of labor market and similarity of operations. The number of companies or operations in the survey will he large enough to be considered representative. Both parlies wifi have the opportunity to recommend representative companies for inclusion in the survey.
Disputes concerning all matters covered in this letter will he referred to the Company and International Union for review and resolution It is also understood that the Company may not implement the terms of this letter without the agreement of the Director of the UAW Aerospace Department.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
February 26. 2001_
During the discussions that led to the 2000 Collect ivc Bargaining Agreement, the parties held lengthy discussions regarding the grievance procedure and its proper implementation. Both parties acknowledged that the Grievance Procedure has worked well over the years in resolving problems when it was properly administered as outlined io the National Agreement.
The Union claimed that in some instances, the Grievance Procedure provisions have not been properly applied relative to the intent of the National Agreement. Specifically, the Union remarked that at some locations, grievances were allowed to accumulate at the various steps of the Grievance Procedure and/or were not answered in a timely manner at the lower steps of the procedure. The Union further claimed that in some cases Management representatives were not available for or were unwilling to schedule regular grievance meetings. The Company stated tlieirotineem that at times. Union Representatives demanded answers to grievances before Management had an opportunity to investigate the charges contained in the grievance.
As a result of the foregoing, the parties reviewed the contents of Document No. 44 and Document No. 45 and reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure th al grievances will not be unduly delayed nor allowed to accumulate al any step in the Grievance Procedure in any plant. Furthermore, it was recognized that both parties have the responsibility to meet reguiatly on grievances in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and that such meetings should not be postponed or delayed unnecessarily. In this regard, the panics agreed that complaints itt this area will be handled under the provisions of Paragraph (5a}of the Agreement. Before such problems are referred from the plant, however, the situation will be discussed between the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, the President of the Local Union and the Regional Servicing Representative. and the Director of Human Resources and Employee Relations Manager.

Daring the course of (he current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that some disciplinary interviews escalated into confrontation because tempers flared. The Union suggested that in these situations a ’’Cooling Off" period would be beneficial to al) concerned.
The Company and the International Union agreed that contemplated discipline should be discussed in a calm manner allowing for an objective evaluation of the facts. In those situations where emotions preclude this from happening, the parlies agreed that as a matter of practice and when possible such discussions should be postponed until such time that, in the opinion of Management, a constructive exchange of information could occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing the parties recognized that certain actions such as assault, or other serious acts of misconduct would render the "cooling off" period totally inappropriate.
Additionally, it was mutually recognized that providing or not providing a "roofing off" permit will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any term's of the National Agreement and will not be cited or relied upon by an employee, the Union, or Management as a basis for any claim.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
During these negotiations, there were discussions concerning subcontracting which resulted from inadequate communication about such matters. As a result of these talks. Management reaffirmed its commitment as follows:
During the current agreement we have experienced many problems in the plants in handling subcontracting matters, la many of these instances tire root cause of the problem is lack of communication,
Inadequate communication has occurred between Union and Management representatives in the past. The Rolls-Royce Allison-UAW National Agreement currently requires timely meetings in advance of the decision to subcontract work normally and historically performed by Rolls-Royce Allison skilled trades employees.
Plant level meetings with local union representatives relative to routine maintenance contracting are sometimes held after the contract has been let and insufficient useful information is provided lo the union for them to consider and make appropriate comments relative to Management's plana.
The Company intends to achieve world wide competitive status utilizing not only the skills of <tur employees bin ate the suggestions and ideas of ihe people and the unions as to how work can best be accomplished al the lowest possible cost with the highest possible quality andon time.
This approach to managing the business should be utilized throughout the Company al all levels: production, skilled and technical. Obviously such discussions should be held in a timely manner with appropriate numagemsru and union personnel.
Accordingly, please assure that an appropriate representative of management in Labor Relations is responsible for having adequate information about emit subetmt-mt (or the performance of skilled trades work covered by the subcontracting provisions of the agreement. Af’er
275
de ic rm ini ng that required discussions have been heid this representative would approve the----
contract prior to its being Set to an outside firm. This wilt requite complete understanding a cooperation of our contractual requirements by the plant’s engineering and purchasing person-““
Please be assured that all executives or others' involved with product teams are made aware our contractual requirements. A specific member of each team shah be given the responsihil it of informing Labor Relations well in advance of the actual beginning of ordering tooling. The objective is to enable Labor Relations to inform the union m advance of any impact on the bargaining unii.
There are numerous examples where complete, advance communications with the union and the skilled trades employees has resulted in important projects being completed on acompetitivc basis in terms of quality, cost and timeliness. The result has been a feeling of pride of accomplishment shared by the union, employees and the managers
Our relationships can only be improved by open, frank communications in all areas, particularly in carrying out our subcrmtracting responsibilities. The Operating Commitlee is in complete agreement that extraordinary attention must be given to our managerial responsibilities in this area. We are committed to utilizing the Rolls-Royce Allison/UAW Local M3 Memorandum of Understanding on Outside Contracting Procedure and. thereby, insure full communications are achieved.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
The following is the text of Rolls-Royce Allison whiten and published policy regarding sexual harassment.
’Rolls-Royce Allison has bad for many years a whiten and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based on age, race, color, religion or national origin, has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.
"All employees arc expected to deal fairly and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse of the dignity of anyone, through dhnk, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct, is offensive employee behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
"All Rolls-Royce Allison employees are entitled to a work environment in which words and actions do not have even the appearance of disrespect. Sexually-oriented jukes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people and. therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. Rolls-Royce Allison facilities must be free of hostility resulting from sexually-oriented behavior. It is the responsibility of management and each employee io mainlatn an environment free of hostility.
"As in ihe case of other unfair employment practices, if you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment, you may bring your concerns to the attention of either your immediate supervisor, personnel director or representative, or you may utilize appropriate and existing internal complaint procedures."

Rolis-Roycc AtliMfn and (he UAW are in agreement ihat complaints of' sexual harassment should be dealt with promptly and fairly under existing internal procedures as provided under Paragraph idaiof the Agreement.

Dear Mr. Getteifinger:
During the current negotiations the Union complained there has been inconsistent administration of the "normal warranty" provisions of Paragraph 18J(b j of the Agreement. The Union indicated that plant management insists on warranties beyond normal periods of time and that our skilled employees are not assigned to the new equipment or machinery until long after it has been tn the plant. This does not provide the opportunity for our own skilled trades to learn how to keep such equipment operating effectively.
The Company informed the Union that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that the equipment purchased by the Company performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract.
The parties agreed that many locations through cooperative efforts such as assigning UAW-RolLs-Royce Allison employees with vendors during installation and servicing, progressive training arrangements both onsite and offsite, etc. have resolved all their problems attendant to this issue. The Company and the International Union encourage each local union and local management to pursue such reasonable working agreements.

One of the issues discussed concerned utilization of TAP benefits to obtain educational credit for certain in-plant training. In this regard the parties agreed as follows:
In instances where employees, by virtue of their job assignment, are being provided with technical or professional training, the parties will jointly work with local recognized degree granting institutions to determine the possibility of obtaining credit for such training. Such credit would be applied toward recognized degree requirements only if the employee so desires. Additionally it is anticipated that costs for such credits will not normaliy equate to full credit hour charges at the institutions involved. Some examples of circumstances under which this understanding would be utilized are training programs associated with Health and Safety or Employee Assistance Program assignments and applicable Human Resource Center Developed Training Courses.

WORK ASSIGNMENTS - SKILLED TRADES

Det rent, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gert el finger:
During these National Negotiations, the parties discussed at length the necessity for the Company to become competitive in all aspects of the business. Among the issues discussed were the enisling skilled trades classification structure, work rules, and past practices.
With regard to the skilled trades classification structure, the Union expressed concern over basic skilled trades classifications being consolidated. The Company advised, however, that they intend to rely on the currently appremiceable skilled trades classifications us the basis for our skilled classification structure moving forward. Competitive advantages of a review of skilled trades classifications at Rolls-Royce Allison must be weighed and determined by the local parties in view of all attendant circumstances at this location. Appropriate training plans necessary to accomplish any consolidations must he submitted in a timely manner for approval by the appropriate section of the International Union.
With regard to work rules and past practice, the Company stated that many plants feel hampered in their efforts to enhance competitiveness in today's environment by historically restrictive practices which originated at a time when competition was less threatening. Given recent improvements in the area of job security, the need for such stringent work rules and delineation of job responsibilities has been reduced.
Therefore, the National parlies concur that Management and the Local Union should review existing work rules and practices, especially in the urea of Lines of Demarcation, ro insure that only those necessary to protect the safely of employees, the integrity of the basic trades, and the efficiency of operation in today’s competitive environment are carried forward. Incidental, overlapping, and other minor access type work are encouraged and should be discussed and handled locally consistent with sound business judgment.
504
If either of the local parties feel that abuses of the spirit and intent of this document exist, they may request the issue be reviewed via plant entry by appropriate representatives of the Aerospace Department of the International Union. UaW and the Company.

EDS WORK ASSIGNMENTS
February 26.2000
Mr. Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director
Aerospace Department
International Union. UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit. Michigan 48214'
Dear Mr, Gettelfinger:
Rolls-Royce Allison and Electronic Data Systems entered into a contractual agreement which defines the business relationship between the two entities. Under the terms of this agreement. EDS has assumed responsibility for the management, operation, provision and maintenance of computer and information processing services and communication services. EDS is an independent supplier to Rolls-Royce Allison. Jt is also the intent of the parties that the Rolls-Royce Allison User Organization continues to be the customer of EDS.
As such, it is of particular importance to bear in mind that EDS. under the terms of this business agreement, remains separate and distinct. It becomes, in part, oar responsibility to offer assistance in die successful operation of this relationship. Specifically, this relates to our acknowledging the fact that EDS is not a party to our National and Local agreement with the Union representing Rolls-Royce Allison employees. EDS does recognize the historical nature of Rolls-Royce Allison job functions and agrees that those job functions associated with manufacturing processes, which have been historically performed by Rolls-Royce Allison hourly personnel, should continue to be performed by bargaining unit employees.
We can relate this to a case in point - the installation and maintenance of the new voice communication system. The role that EDS plays in this situation is the traditional role of the local telephone company. Structural preparation remains the responsibility of Rolls-Royce Allison and is most often accomplished utilizing batgaining unit employees. The other job functions associated with this voice communication system, in most cases, are not functions historically performed by our bargaining unit and are. therefore, the responsibility of EDS.
Also, our understanding concerning bargaining unit work does not limit the fulfillment ot warranty obligations by vendors. Such warranty obligations and/or other work performed by employees of an outside contractor, including EDS employees will be handled pursuant to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements pertaining to outside contracting, where applicable.
Wt>
In summary, we have met with EDS to discuss our mutual concerns. We have arrived at an understanding assuring the continuation of historical practices as they relate to Rolls-Royce Allison job functions associated with manufacturing processes. We feel that this position is fair and will best accomplish our joint goals and recognizes the traditional role of bargaining unit employees.
As always. I appreciate your comments and suggestions. Please refer any questions to Labor Relations. ■
During the 1993 Negotiations, the Union raised several instances wherein they felt that EDS misapplied the concepts outlined in the above letter, oftentimes when there was a change in local Account Managers, and specifically with regard to the applicable notification requirements outlined in the subcontracting provisions of the Agreement. The Company observed that much of the work al issue is non-core in nature, but reiterated its intent to continue the concepts outlined above.
Furthermore, necessary arrangements will be made to review these concepts and contractual commitments with the Rolls-Royce Allison EDS Account Manager.
Very truly yours.

EAP- EARLY INTER VENTION
Mr. Ron Getteifinger	,
Vice President and Director
Aerospace Department
International Union, UAW 8000 E. Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Get tel Tin ger:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed and noled that in many instances the early indicators of an employee suffering from medical and personal problems such as those associated with substance abuse, for example, are manifested in disciplinary situations involving violations of the Shop Rules, In those initial stages it is generally the first line supervisor and the district committeeperson who are first exposed to the potential of such underlying causes behind employee behavioral problems.
Although the parties acknowledge Management's responsibility to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where violations of the Shop Rules occur, it is also recognized (hat local management and union representatives at alt levels are necessarily charged with the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral problems may be linked to medical and personal causes and to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. In many cases this could be accomplished through referral to the local Employee Assistance Program Committee.
Very truly yours.

Dear Mr- Shoemaker:
During our discussions regarding the content of the new 1997 Allison/UAW National Agreement we found that several paragraphs and appendices of the 1993 GM/UAW National Agreement apply to situations pertaining to multiple bargaining unit locations. Since Allison Engine Company hourly employees are currently represented only by Local 933 of the UAW, those paragraphs are not applicable to our present circumstances and are not being included in the 1997 Allison/UAW National Agreement.
However, it' these circumstances change in the future, we have agreed that the paragraphs and appendices listed below should be reviewed by the parties to determine their relevancy to the then existing circumstances.	•
Following are the applicable paragraphs, appendices and Documents which were not carried over from the 1993 GM/UAW National Agreement to the 1997 Allison/UAW National Agreement for the above stated reasons.

OVERTIME
February 26.2000
Mr. Ron Gettel finger Vice President and Director Aerospace Department Internationa) Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 4B214
Dear Mr. GetteJfinger:
During the 2000 negotiations the parlies discussed both the Union’s and Management's concerns about the scheduling of overtime work in Rolls-Royce Allison,
On the one hand Management recognized the legitimacy of the Union’s concern that production not be scheduled on a sustained basis on overtime rather than recalling laid off employees or hiring new employees. On the other hand, the Union recognized that the scheduling of overtime serves an essential purpose in many situations in order to meet temporary or seasonal increases in sales, at new model start-up. and to make up for production lost due to factors beyond the parties' control, such as interruptions in the supply of parts. Also the parlies recognize the need for overtime on vital tooling and maintenance projects which often must be accomplished quickly on tight time schedules in order to avoid interruptions ordclays in production and layoffs of production employees.
As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed to establish a procedure for regularly reviewing overtime work schedules. This review will be accomplished between representatives of Rolls-Royce Allison and the International Union, UAW. The review is intended to assure that overtime work is not scheduled at a plant on an ongoing basis in cases where there are practical and economical alternatives. The alternatives to overtime considered by the parties may include employment increases, innovative shift arrangements, or improvements or additions to the plant's equipment which could eliminate a bottleneck; or Ihe parties may conclude that the reasons for the overtime are temporary or unavoidable and that there are no practical or economical alternatives.
.t|tl
The purpose of this review procedure is to assure a timely and thorough review of overtime work schedules and provide for a balanced consideration of the interests of both parties.
Very truly yours.

JOBS PROGRAM ATTRITIONAL CREDIT-UNIQUE SITUATIONS
February 26. 2000
Mr. Ron Getteifinger
Vice President and Director
Aerospace Department (mentational Union. UAW 8000 E. Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Getteifinger:
During these negotiations, the parties agreed that the principle of replacing attrition as defined in Document 3 of this agreement will be continued. However, it was recognized that exceptions to this concept are appropriate in unusual situations. For example, if Rolls-Royce Allison has a large number of Protected employees who cannot be effectively utilized, yet more Protected employees would be required because of the attrition replacement concept embodied in the Agreement, it may be appropriate not to do so.
Accordingly, this will confirm our understanding that the national parties are specifically empowered to investigate unique situations and evaluate requests for full attritional credit, and implement mutually satisfactory adjustments to Document 3, Section II (N) (2).
Very truly yours.

UAW-ROLLS-ROYCE ALLISON MEMORANDUM OF COMMITMENT TO PRODUCT QUALITY
During ihe past several years, the Company in cooperation with UAW leadership, together with the men and women of Rolls-Royce Allison, have worked together in a spirit of teamwork to improve product quality. This spirit of cooperation has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality of the Company's products and services.
Further, the ponies recognize that the production of the highest quality, customer-valued products is essential to secure the Company's position in the market and assure job security. The Company stated that high quality products have to be the result of a total quality process if Allison is io continue co be the world leader in the production of gas turbine engines and components.
The Rolls-Royce Allison process for total quality management is the Quality Network - the one process for total customer satisfaction and enthusiasm. Although Management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Network, it is recognized that UAW leaders and members are valuable partners in the development of the process, the action strategies, and its implementation plans.
Such participation is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both on the national and local levels, exemplified by the institution of quality councils at the Company and Operations level. Further, the parties during discussion of this document have restated their commitment to the Quality Network process and to the successful implementation of this jointly developed quality strategy. This process includes continuously improving the quality of everything we do and eliminating waste in the manufacture of products and in services provided, and as a result, will serve to enhance the job security of all Rolls-Royce Allison employees.

High quality products result from a well managed process that motivates employees to work together within a spirit of teamwork Io continuously improve customer satisfaction. In this process, it is recognized that seeking opportunities for continuously improving product quality must he the foundation for customer satisfaction. It is acknowledged that it is ultimately management's responsibility to establish and assure product quality requirements and provide the processes for continuous quality improvement that support all employees and are based on the Beliefs and Values.
it is recognized that performance of high quality work is everyone's responsibility, and as a result, it is intended that the Quality Network Representatives and UAW leadership working together with local management will reinforce other ongoing quality improvement activities.
JI4
Finally, the parties discussed the necessity for all Rolls-Royce Allison employees to take individual responsibility for product quality, Management's business planning process will include the necessity for providing employees with the appropriate training, methods and systems, materials, and equipment in an appropriate environment to perform their work. It is then incumbent upon employees to exercise diligence and properly perform their work to produce the highest quality, customer-valued products.
The genera! guidelines for the parties to provide additional support to employees in this quality improvement process are set forth in the letters dated February 26,2000, and entitled "Quality Network" and "Product Quality", and published as Documents 40 and 41 respectively In this Agreement.

STATE ME NT ONTECHN CLOG t CAL PROGRESS
During negotiations the International Union has claimed that certain work which is performed at some plant locations where the UAW is the certified bargaining representative i>1 certain employees has been improperly assigned to non-represented employees of Rolls-Royce Allison.
The Company is mindful of Ihe Union's concern regarding the scope and work content of job classifications of employees in the UAW bargaining unit and how such may be affected by advancing technology. Accordingly, the Rolls-Royce Allison-UAW' Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee will meet periodically to discuss matters concerning new or advanced technology that cannot be resolved locally and are referred to it by local unions or local managements as well as claims of erosion of the bargaining unit.
Since the first National Agreement of June 24, 1940. many necessary changes >n methods and pntcesses have hod ait impact upon the scope and work content of job classifications of both represented and non-represented employees.
Advancing technology has created, and will continue to create, new and more complex problems hearing upon the work contenl of job classifications of employees represented by the Union.
h is not the Company's policy to assign to nun-represented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned lo represented employees al a particular plant locution. The Company recognizes that mere novelty or Ilie sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds for withdrawing work from represented employees. Similarly, the Company does not believe that the perimeters of the bargaining unit at a particular plant locution should be expanded simply by the ini rod uc lion of new technology.
It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function including the introduction of computers, energy management systems, modem, art to part, tool culling paths and fiber optics or other new or advanced technology will not serve to shift the work fund ion from represented to tton-represented employees. Therefore,
I.	W'here a work funciion at a plant location preceded the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was assigned at the lime of certification, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
1JK
2.	Where a work function was introduced at a plant location following the certification of the Union, the work function will he assigned as it was originally assigned, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
The Company and the International Union are in agreement that the assignment of represented or non-represented employees depends upon the work function involved and trol necessarily upon the work tasks required to accomplish such work function.
Notice and Discussion
The Company agrees to advanced written notification to local unions at locations planning the introduction of new or advanced technology so as to permit meaningful discussion of its impact, if any, upon skilled or non-skilied employees.
The Management will describe for the Shop Committee the extent to which such technological changes may affect the work performed by represented employees al the plum location involved. The Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the International Union will be provided a written description of the technology involved, the equipment being introduced, its intended use and the anticipated installation date(s). During the discussions the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may include other Local Union representatives such as the Health and Safety Representative, a representative from the Local Joint Skill Development and Training Committee, a member of the Local Apprentice Committee, or other employees, as necessary, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved. Accordingly, the parties agreed upon the following examples of situations where notification should be given:
A) The first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant technology.
Bl Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
Cl Introduction of a new application of existing technology which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
The parties also highlighted that the National Agreement provides for notification to lake place as fur in advance of implementation of the technological change as is practicable. This is not only io enable the Strap Committee to discuss the impact such introduction of technology has on the bargaining unit, but also to discuss timely implementation of employee training to prepare them to perform their appropriate functions.
329
Training
The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility that new, technologically impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it In view of the parties' interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, as part of the advanced discussion, the parties shall seek to identify appropriate specialized training programs so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel.
Dispute Resolution
The following paragraphs set forth a means of resolving disputes concerning particular problems occasioned by advancing technology.
Where the initial introduction of new or advanced technology al a plant location occasions a question of whether:
1)	certain new work should be assigned to represented employees,
2)	affects the job responsibilities of represented employees, or
3)	otherwise impacts the scope of the bargaining unit.
Management and the Shop Committee will attempt to resolve the matter without resorting to the grievance procedure. Management will cooperate in Ihe Shop Committee's investigation and evaluation of impact issues raised due to the introduction of new or advanced technology. Comments by the Shop Committee will be carefully evaluated by the Management in accordance with the Company's policy relative to the assignment of work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at the plant location. If the issue remains unresolved, it may be introduced into the second step of the grievance procedure as provided in Paragraph (31) of the National Agreement,
Settlements made by the local parties concerning the assignment of work functions as between represented and non-represented employees in relation to the new or advanced technology discussed will be forwarded to the International Union and will be reviewed by the Rolls-Royce Allison-UAW Skilled Trades & Apprentice Committee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the settlement. In the event either the Company or (be Intcmaticmal Union dees not approve the settlement following the review by the National Committee, the subject matter in dispute will be referred to the Management-Shop Committee Step of the Grievance Procedure and processed in accordance with ihe applicable provisions of the Grievance Procedure,

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger.
During recent negotiations, the International Union, UAW, requested that the Company clarify its position regarding sexual orientation.
In Rolls-Royce Allison, we have had an on going commitment to maintenance of a workplace that is challenging and productive for all employees. Our focus also is to treat all employees equitably and not to allow discrimination of any kind within our facilities. This letter is to assure you that the Company has policies in place that prohibit discrimination in employment in the basis of sexual orientation.
Rolls-Royce Allison's Jong standing policy statement covering Equal Employment Opportunity reads as follows:
"The policy of Rolls-Royce Allison is to extend employment opportunities to qualified applicants and employees on an equal basis regardless of an individual's age, race, color, sex, religion, or national origin.
"Hiring and employment practice and procedures implementing this policy arc the responsibility of the employing units. However, these practices, procedures and decisions are to be, at all times, in conformity with the Company’s Equal Opportunity Employment Policy."
In summary, Rolls-Royce Allison’s policy on Equal Opportunity Employment requires that wc treat all people with dignity and respect and prohibits discrimination of any kind, including discrimination based on sexual orientation.
352
All employees are expected to deal fairly and honesty with one another to ensure work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse of the dignity of anyone through slurs or other derogatory or objectionable conduct, including that based on sexual orientation, is offensive employee behavior and has no place in Rolls-Royce Allison. Additionally, any claim of harassment having its basis as sexual orientation maybe taken up as a grievance under the appropriate provisions of the Rolls-Royce AJiison - UAW National Agreement.

C. Seniority Issues
I.	The production MSE classifications will be considered a part of the non-intercbangcahlc occupational group in the Local Seniority Agreement.
a.	When seniority employees are transferred to MSE classifications for the first lime the employees will retain seniority in the classification from which they were transferred until such tune as they have demonstrated the basic requirements of the MSE classification to which they have been transferred or a period of thirty (30) days, whichever is less.
61

b.	When seniority employees are transferred from a MSE classification in one MSE cell to the same classification in another MSE cell they will establish seniority immediately upon transfer,
2,	As the new MSE classifications are populated by employees, such employees will establish a recall or flow right back to a classification that has been combined into one of the new MSE classifications after demonstrating specific competency in the new cell assignment and by applying for such recall or flow right as spec died in the Local Seniority Agreement.
D. Training Requirements
The parties recognize that in order to properly implement MSE cells and improve the operational effectiveness of Rolls-Royce Allison, and in order to successfully utilize the flexibility growing out of the newly combined MSE flexible machining functions agreed to by the parties, a training effort must be undertaken which requires a joint commitment by both management and the union.
I.	Baste Comprehension
In order to accomplish the above, the parties wifi esiublisb u joint task force which will jointly determine the training necessary to demonstrate basic comprehension of the materials and the ability to perform the basic requirements for each of the following generic production job categories, us well as the time limits for accomplishing the training.
a. Machining b. Inspection c. Furnace and Plating Operation d. Assembly and Test e. foiling and Forming
2.	Specific Cornprehension
Thereafter, the joint task force will work with representatives from each Smalt Business Unit ISBU) and service department to determine the training necessary to demonstrate the full comprehension of the materials and the ability to perform the specific requirements for each classification in the MSE cells or service department in order for employees to satisfactorily accomplish the work for which they are responsible, as well as the time limits for accomplishing the training. The joint task force will develop the specific training plan and timing requirements for each MSE cell as it is being implemented so that each employee transitioning to the cel! will be aware of the time limits he or she may anticipate for acquiring specific comprehension.
W
JWJE Twitiliiul
3.	After the appropriate training, as defined above, has been either developed or acquired by the joint task force, appropriate mutually developed evaluation procedures will be implemented to insure that employees assigned to the new classifications have received required basic and specific training and are fully equipped to perform all aspects of the job,
4.	it is understood that an employee who has satisfactorily performed the work associated with any of the classifications which have been combined to form one of the new MSE classifications for a period of six |6) months or more will be considered to have basic comprehension of the materials and the ability to perform the basic requirements for placement within that classification. Thereafter, the employee wiii be given training necessary to demonstrate the full comprehension of the materials and the ability to perform (he specific requirements within the cd) jo which he or she is being assigned. After having satisfactorily completed the training in the specific requirements for the joh the employee will begin the training for the "Certified Quality Operator" designation within his or her MSE classification as described in the Local Wage Agreement.
5.	When an employee is transferred to an MSE classification requiring demonstrated comprehension of the material and the ability to perform the work and is not able or willing to satisfactorily complete the mutually developed evaluation procedure, he or she will be transferred in accordance with the Local Seniority Agreement
6.	The parties also recognize that the implementation of this MSE training plan, us well as all of the other training necessitated by Ihe implementation of the Business Process Reengineering throughout the Company and the renewed emphasis on employee development for all Polis-Royce Allison hourly and salaried employees since our acquisition by Rolls-Royce, necessitates a dedicated joint training facility which cun be used to satisfy these increased training requirements. The parties have committed themselves to jointly determining the requirements for such a training facility and the most appropriate method of implementing a plan to provide such a facility. The funds necessary to construct such a facility, or refurbish existing Rolls-Royce Allison facilities, will be provided from the funds acctued in accordance with the provisions of the 1993 Rolls-Royce Allison UAW Agreement.
E Skilled Trades Support
During these negotiations the parties extensively discussed the skilled trades support necessary to successfully implement (he MSE cellular manufacturing concept. The parties recognize that skilled trades service to the MSE cells can best be accomplished by seif directed skilled trades work teams. In an effort to transition to this type of working environment, the parlies agree to establish a pilot MSE service group which will be used to formulate the guidelines to be used in forming future skilled trades MSE service groups. This initial MSE service group will function as a separate skilled trades zone. The 1997 collective bargaining agreement and all supplements will govern these groups.
61
VJETrafuuicjfl ^finrfwnj
F.	Transition of Indirect Support Functions
During these negotiations the parties recognized that over a period of time celt operators will begin to assume certain duties currently performed by hourly support personnel anchor salaried employees. Some of the functions MSE cell operators will eventually assume include:
I.	Setting up and operating numerically controlled and conventional machines and special processes directly associated with the cell.
2.	Accepting sign-off responsibility for the quality of the parts they are producing either on an in-process basts or on a final inspection basis.
3.	Control ting the cell inventory, including movement of parts and material within and between the cells comprising an SBU using an appropriate conveyance device, tracking inventory and work in progress (WIPI. establishing schedules and establishing and maintaining control boards. Such operator assignments wilt not preclude the assignment of employees classified as Inventory Controller to a particular SBU where the geographical location of the various SBU ceils makes such an assignment more appropriate or the particular work flow necessitates such an assignment.
4.	Performing routine preventative maintenance and lubrication of machinery during normal operations.
5.	Training other operators.
6.	Maintaining and dispersing supplies of perishable tooling and other work related supplies within the SBU. ,
7.	Maintaining a clean and orderly work area.
The parties recognize that this transition will occur over a period of time and that ultimately groups of employees currently performing these support duties in the traditional manner will be transitioned to production positions within future MSE cells.
G.	Unforeseen Issues
The parties have pledged themselves to ensuring that the transition of duties identified above will occur at a pace guided by the implementation of MSE cells. Any problems associated with the implementation of this MSE Transition will be addressed by the Shop Committee and Labor Relations in their regularly scheduled shop committee meetings and a solution to the problems will be determined by that group in a continuing spirit of cooperation.
H.	Termination Clause

OUTSIDE CONTRACTING PROCEDURE • ELECTRIC MOTORS
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
During the 1990 Local Negotiations the parties discussed the repair of electric motors by bargaining unit employees. It was agreed that when skilled trades employees are performing repairs on machines which have electric motors and it is determined that the motor is in need of repair, the skilled trades employees on the job will make the initial determination whether th? motor should be repaired in-house or sent to the outside for repair. If determination of lire tradesmen is that the motor should be sent outside for repair, this fact will be recorded on a form which will accompany the motor during the repair process and be used for subsequent tracking of the motor's repairs. This settlement is not intended to eliminate the motor shop.
