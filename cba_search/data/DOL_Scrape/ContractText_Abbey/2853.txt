(d)	With their paychecks for the first full pay period in January of 2005, employees then on the payroll shall receive a lump sum gross payment equal to one percent (1%) of their new January, 2005 base annual wage.
(e)	An economic reopener may occur sixty (60) days before any of the scheduled increases by agreement of the parties if payment as scheduled could create reductions in service or other financially induced problems due to the City's revenue and expenditure picture, or at the request of Local 7 if the average percentage base wage increases for any other City union exceeds the effective increases for Local 7 employees P.E.R.S. contributions included. If agreement cannot be reached within thirty (30) days after commencement of the reopener, the parties shall select an arbitrator using the selection procedure set forth in section 2117.23, "Arbitration". The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing and render a decision following the provisions of the Ohio Public Employee Collective Bargaining Law at Section 4117.14(G), notwithstanding the provisions of 4117.14(D)(1).
(f)	An employee who is promoted or who works above his classification in a classification within the Local 7 Bargaining Unit will receive the Promotional Starting Rate of the class to which the employee has been promoted for the employee's 1st 2080 hours in that classification unless the Promotional Starting Rate of the new classification is either less than four (4%) percent greater than the rate the employee was earning in his/her regular classification, or less than the 75%, 85%, or 95% rate for the classification. If the Promotional Starting Rate of the new classification is not at least four (4%) percent greater than the rate the employee was earning in his regular classification, then the employee will receive a four (4%) percent increase over his/her present rate. If the promotional starting rate is less than the 75%, 85%, or 95% rate for the classification, then the employee shall be paid at the nearest step rate that is at least four percent (4%) greater than the employee's current rate. At no time would a permanent employee earning the promotional start rate be paid less than an employee in that classification in the division with less seniority who is in one of the step rates. When an employee has served 2080 hours as an alternate to a position to which the employee is subsequently promoted, he/she shall continue to receive the full rate.
