(D)	In the event the National Labor Relations Act is amended while this Agreement is in force, so that an employee may lawfully be required to become a member of the Union in less than seven (7) days, then such shorter period of time shall immediately become operative notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this Article.
(E)	The Union agrees to furnish competent workers upon the request of the Employer in accordance with this Agreement, provided no violation of the Agreement exists on the part of the Employer. A violation will be determined by the following settlement of dispute Procedures.
