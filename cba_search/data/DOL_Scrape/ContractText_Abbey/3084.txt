Work-Period. The normal work period shall be 10 working days of 8 hours each. A department head with prior approval of the County Executive Officer and the Human Resources Director may establish or eliminate a different biweekly work period of 80 hours after giving one pay period written notice to the representative, if any, of the employees affected.
A.	Effective July 1, 1999, SEIU agrees that the County shall retain exclusive control to determine employee work schedules and hereby waives any right to grieve schedule assignments during the remaining term of this agreement.
B.	Professional Hours-DPSS. The parties agree that flex schedules shall be made available for Social Service Workers I, II, III, IV, and V, Employment Services Counselor I and II, in D.P.S.S. under the following conditions:
1.	Employees are required to work a full 40 hours per week and a full 80 hour biweekly work period or be in pay status.

8
2.	No overtime shall be paid for over 8 hours worked per day. The application of
Section 2(A) of this Article shall not apply as it pertains to overtime after 8 hours in a day. The only overtime that shall be paid under this Memorandum shall be that of the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act for approved overtime work which is over 40 hours per week.
3.	In order for an employee to be under the flex hours provision, he/she must continue to maintain the work load assigned within the 40 hour work period. The department may establish core hours of work. In addition, employees must agree to clear their schedule to attend staff meetings, training classes or any other meetings or events which the department requires the employee to attend. It is mandatory for an employee to complete the client contact sheet daily and follow any other requirement in the department’s policy, procedures and handbook. It is incumbent on the employee to keep abreast of all events which affect his/her schedule. Probationary employees and employees who do not meet the required work standard where closer supervision is necessary shall not be eligible for the flex hours scheduling. The department has the absolute and exclusive right to return an employee to the previous or normal work period should an employee not comply with the conditions of this memorandum. Should a grievance be filed against the department for the removal of an employee from this flex schedule the burden of proof is upon the employee to show that the department did not have cause for such action. Cause is based on failure of the employee to follow conditional requirements stated in this memorandum. Removal from the flex time schedule shall not be interpreted as disciplinary action.

	M	T	W	Th	F	M	T	W	Th	F
Hrs.	9	7	10	6	8=40	12	8	9	7	4=40
80 TOTAL HOURS BIWEEKLY
Section 2.	Overtime
A.	Overtime Work Defined. Overtime work is authorized work in excess of 8 hours in one day, or in excess of the maximum hours of the established work day in other than a normal work period, or in excess of 80 hours in a work period, or work performed when the employee is called back to meet an emergency on a holiday or is in a stand-by or call duty status. It does not include regularly scheduled work on a paid holiday for which the employee is entitled to equal compensatory time off.
B.	Authorization for Overtime Work. Performance of overtime work may be authorized by the Board of Supervisors or by the department head or a designated subordinate.
9
There shall be no favoritism in the assignment of overtime work.
C.	Departmental Records. Each department head shall keep complete and detailed records as to the attendance and pay status of each employee. This shall include actual hours of overtime work for each employee in each work week, with justification in each case, and shall also include compensatory time off. The daily record for an employee in a normal paid working status may be kept on a negative basis, that is, with no entry except for overtime, compensatory time off, sick leave, vacation, leave of absence, and like items.
The initial record, any secondary records, such as a summary of the work week or of the pay period, or other compilation from the initial record, and the departmental copy of the attendance report for each pay period together with any subsequent correcting reports, shall be preserved and retained in a condition to be audited for the three most recent full fiscal years, and thereafter until any official inquiry concerning the same has been finally concluded.
D.	Reporting and Calculation. Actual hours of overtime work shall be reported on each attendance report. The Auditor shall maintain the record of overtime credit at one and one-half times such actual hours. Actual hours of compensatory time off shall be reported on each attendance report. If payment is to be made, the number of hours of overtime credit to be paid for shall be specified.
E.	Compensation for Overtime Work. Accumulated overtime credit in excess of 120 hours at the end of any pay period shall automatically be paid for. Accumulated overtime credit after 40 hours may at the election of the employee, be accumulated as overtime credit as provided herein, or the employee may elect to be paid such overtime. Accumulated overtime credit of 120 hours or less may be taken in compensatory time off, subject to management approval, and this method of reducing accumulated overtime credit is encouraged. With approval of the County Executive Officer, accumulated overtime credit of 120 hours or less may be paid for. Paid overtime credit shall be at the hourly rate currently applicable to the employee. Upon termination, accumulated overtime credit shall be paid for. Overtime caused by duly authorized continuing and regular work periods longer than 80 hours, or by seasonal overtime work, if authorized by the County Executive Officer in advance, shall be currently paid for.
F.	Fringe Benefits not Affected by Overtime. Overtime work shall not be a basis for increasing vacation or sick leave benefits, nor shall it be a basis of advancing completion of the required period for probation or salary step advance. Where overtime results from necessary irregular work schedules, it may be included in computing the minimum time for salary step advance which would otherwise be delayed beyond the normal period.
G.	Overtime Provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Employees in classifications which are not exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be compensated for overtime consistent with the Act. Such employees shall receive compensation for overtime worked under the foregoing County provisions when the hours worked are not considered overtime under the Act.
10

11
notwithstanding any other provision of this Memorandum, the following provisions shall apply:
1.	Any Officer, in order to perform the work of the department or a civil defense function, may employ emergency employees without reference to the salary or classification plans at rates which appear to be prevailing for the type of work to be performed at the time of their employment.

Such an incumbent in a department primarily concerned with land surveying who is a licensed land surveyor may be likewise compensated. The incumbent of a professional architect position
27
or facilities project manager who is not required by the classification plan to be licensed, but who is licensed to practice architecture by the State of California, shall be compensated at an hourly rate which is two steps higher than that specified for such position, at the option of the employee’s department head.
L.	Inconvenience Differential.
Each employee of the Transportation Department of the Transportation Land Management Agency assigned to a traveling crew while its work headquarters is temporarily at the Blythe or Thermal Road Yard, and whose normal residence is in a distant area rendering daily travel impracticable between their residence and such temporary work headquarters, shall receive $12.00 for each pay period in addition to their regular compensation. Any employee whose regularly assigned headquarters are in the Blythe or Thermal Road Yard shall be entitled to the same inconvenience differential at the same rate and conditions. Eligibility for such additional pay shall be determined by the Director of Transportation with the concurrence of the Human Resources Director, unless the Board of Supervisors shall otherwise provide by resolution.
M.	Female Prisoner Search and Meal Assignments. An employee working for the Sheriff’s Department in the classifications of Supervising Office Assistant I and Supervising Office Assistant II shall be compensated at the rate of $.25 per hour when assigned and the employee agrees to assume such assignments as perform female prisoner searches and serve meals to female prisoners in the absence of a female deputy or correction personnel. Such assignments must be authorized or verified by the department head or a designee in writing. This differential does not apply to vacation, sick leave, Workers’ Compensation leave or holiday pay.
When such assignments are no longer needed or the employee is not required to perform these functions, the department head shall terminate the special compensation.
N.	Implementation of New Payroll System. SEIU understands and agrees that the County may implement a new payroll system which will be date based, as opposed to hour based. The County agrees to provide as much advanced notice as practicable so that concerns SEIU may have over problems associated with the systems implementation shall be an agenda item for discussion at the Unit specific Labor/Management Committee.
1.	On or about July 1, 2001, the County will implement People-Soft, a new payroll, accounting, and budgeting system. Changes related to People-Soft include:
a.	Dates for increases in leave accruals, probationary periods, anniversary dates, merit increases, step advances, and similar events shall be based upon service dates rather than hours, i.e. 1040 hours shall become 6 months and 2080 hours shall become one year.
b.	Leave accruals, i.e. sick leave, vacation pay, will continue to require that the employee be in a paid status for each day during the pay period to receive the full accrual for that pay period.
28
c.	Some other benefits will be granted even though the employee is in a paid status for only one day during the pay period, i.e., flexible credit allowance.
d.	The start of the biweekly pay period will change from Wednesday to Saturday. As a result, the check for the first pay period under People-Soft will, for most employees, cover seven rather than ten workdays.
ARTICLE V
PAY PRACTICES
Section 1.	Step Advance
A.	The compensation of every person employed in a regular position on a step basis shall be considered for increase upon their anniversary date, except as herein otherwise provided.
B.	For employees appointed prior to January 9, 1992:
The first anniversary date shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of 6 months in a paid status in the position as a result of original appointment, or as the result of a promotion or reclassification which involved a salary increase. Reemployment at a rate other than that of the first step of a range shall not be considered an original appointment for purpose of fixing the anniversary date. In such cases the anniversary date shall be the first day of the pay period following one year in a paid status, not including overtime, after such re-employment unless otherwise specified in the Resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
The second anniversary date shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of an additional one year in a paid status, not including overtime, and subsequent anniversary dates shall occur at like intervals.
C.	Employees appointed on or after January 9, 1992:
The first anniversary date as a result of an original appointment shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of one year in a paid status in the position not including overtime.
The first anniversary date as a result of promotion or reclassification which involved a salary increase shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of 6 months in a paid status in the position not including overtime.
Re-employment at a rate other than that of the first step of a range shall be considered an original appointment for purpose of fixing the anniversary date.
29
The second anniversary date shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of an additional one year in a paid status, not including overtime, and subsequent anniversary dates shall occur at like intervals.
D.	The provisions of this section shall be subject to other specific provisions of this Memorandum concerning change of anniversary elates.
E.	Two pay periods before the anniversary date of each employee holding a regular position on a step basis, except as to an employee compensated at the rate of the highest step, the Human Resources Director shall inform the department head in writing on an appropriate form that the employee will be eligible for salary increase.
Prior to the anniversary date the department head, after review with the employee involved, shall inform the Human Resources Director in writing on the appropriate form whether or not the department head allows the increase. If the increase is disallowed, the form shall contain the signature of the employee acknowledging notice of the disallowance and the reasons therefore. The department head may disallow a step increase only after the performance evaluation is reviewed and approved by the Human Resource Director or a designee. The Human Resources Director shall promptly act on each increase allowed and the employee shall be paid at the increased rate from the anniversary date. If, through error, the anniversary date of an employee is overlooked or a notice herein required is delayed or omitted, a resulting failure to increase the compensation may be cured by then taking the action hereinabove required, provided the same is completed within the next two pay periods after said action should have been taken, and the employee shall be paid at the increased rate from the anniversary date. If the department head disallows such increase, the department head shall review the matter at least quarterly, and may allow the increase effective on the first day of any pay period after that in which the increase could have been allowed. The responsibility for submitting a written allowance of increase, after disallowance, shall be with the department head. The anniversary date shall be postponed until an increase is allowed. Such salary increases shall be given only on the affirmative decision of the department head, which shall be made only on the basis of continued satisfactory performance in the position.
F.	With the same procedures as in the foregoing Subsection, on the first day of the pay period following the completion of 6 months in a paid status, not including overtime, the salary of a seasonal employee shall be increased. On the first day of the pay period following the completion of an additional one year in a paid status, not including overtime, employee’s salary may again be increased, and thereafter in like intervals. The hours in a paid status need not be continuous, provided no interval of more than one year shall occur when the employee is in an unpaid status.
G.	Every anniversary salary increase shall be to the rate of the second next higher step, except when there are less than two steps remaining, it shall be to the last step.
Section 2.	New Employees
30
A. Except as otherwise provided by this Memorandum, a new employee shall be appointed at the first step of the salary range. The department head with the prior approval of the Human Resources Director and the County Executive Officer may appoint a new employee in a specified class to any step within the salary range if the employee has: (1) qualifications substantially greater than the minimum for the class; and (2) experience, which if it had been obtained in the position applied for, would have made the employee eligible for the advanced step proposed. When the Human Resources Director and the County Executive Officer authorize a position to be filled at such step higher than the first step of the range, the Human Resources Director and the County Executive Officer may also advance all incumbents of positions in the same class earning less than the step so authorized to the same or one of said higher steps, fixing the minimum initial salary on such advanced step. The anniversary date shall be the first day of the pay period which is not less than one year in a paid status thereafter, not including overtime. When such an incumbent employee is already on that step, his/her anniversary date shall not change.
B.	Notwithstanding the provisions of (A) above, there shall be up to an additional 4 steps (approximately 11%) which shall be reserved for those specific classifications in a specific Department designated by the Human Resources Director, subject to approval by the County Executive Officer, as "difficult to recruit." Further, different locations or regions may qualify for difficult to recruit designation or for different levels (i.e. percentages) of compensation under a difficult to recruit designation. In addition, the County agrees to make every effort to give first consideration to existing employees who have indicated an interest in a specific position and/or location designated as difficult to recruit.
This designation shall be granted based upon a determination by the Human Resources Director, subject to approval by the County Executive Officer, on a specific classification and specific Department basis, that a serious recruiting or retention problem exists for specific classification(s) in a specific Department, or that the increases granted to subordinate "difficult to recruit" classifications in the specific Department has created serious compaction problems, and that a percentage increase up to and including 4 steps (approximately 11 %) would assist the County in recruiting and retaining employees in the specific classification(s) in that specific Department. Advancements to any of these ranges in the specific Department shall not be automatic nor shall such a determination have any bearing on the same or similar classifications within the Department or in any other Departments with same or similar classifications. Upon such determination and approval, any increase granted pursuant to these provisions shall be implemented in the specific Department as follows:
1.	Upon prior authorization of the Human Resources Director, the initial salary placement for newly hired employees in the specific classification in the specific Department may be at any step on the salary range for his/her classification up to and including a step on the salary ranges established pursuant to Section 2(B) above.
2.	In the event the salary granted to a newly hired employee in the specific classification in the specific Department pursuant to Sub-Section (B)( 1) above exceeds that for any present permanent, regular full-time or regular part-time employee in the specific
31
classification in the specific Department who is being compensated at the top of the salary range for that specific classification(s), such employee(s) shall be placed on the same salary range and step as that granted to the new employee.
3.	All other regular full-time and regular part-time employees assigned to the affected classification(s) in the specific classification in the specific Department, who have completed less than one year of service at the top, or at any other step, of the salary range for that classification, may, upon a review of their qualifications and approval by the Human Resources Director, have their salary adjusted to an amount no less than the lowest salary received by a similarly qualified employee hired as the result of an open recruitment to fill a vacancy in that classification in the specific classification in the specific Department.
Notwithstanding, the paragraph above, if an employee newly hired into a "difficult to recruit" classification has less experience in the work of the classification and/or education/training applicable to the work of the specific classification than an incumbent employee in the same specific classification in the specific Department, the incumbent employees' wage will immediately be increased to the level of the newly hired employee.
4.	Subsequent merit increases for employees not compensated at the top of the salary range(s) for the specific classification in the specific Department affected by the provisions of this subsection may be granted pursuant to the standard procedures for step advances as set forth in the applicable memorandum of understanding. Employees may receive annual reviews as set forth in such MOU, but merit increases cannot be given beyond the top step as set forth in this MOU.
In the event the Human Resources Director determines the circumstances that created the recruiting or retention problems for any or all classifications in the specific classification in the specific Department no longer exist, he shall advise the County Executive Officer of his findings. If the County Executive Officer concurs, he shall declare the provisions described above inoperative for such specific classification(s). At that time, the salary for any employee compensated at a rate above that to which he or she would otherwise have been entitled shall be frozen and shall not be increased until the regular salary for the specific classification exceeds the rate established pursuant to the provisions described above.
Section 3.	Re-employment
A.	Upon recommendation of the employing Officer and approval of the Human Resources Director, a former regular employee may be re-employed in the same class of position which he/she previously occupied, at the same step of the salary range as the step applicable at the time of his termination, provided they were terminated in good standing.
B.	Re-employment after military service shall conform to the requirements of the Military and Veterans Code, but in other respects shall be in accordance with this Memorandum.
32
C.	Whenever a former regular employee is or has been re-employed within twenty-four months after termination he/she may, on recommendation of the employing Officer and with the approval of the Human Resources Director and the County Executive Officer, be allowed accrued sick leave and accrued time toward earned vacation, not exceeding the amount thereof which was lost at the time of termination, and his/her anniversary date for step advance may be expressly fixed, subject to other provisions of this Memorandum relating to delay and disallowance thereof, by allowing credit for all or a portion of the applicable period of service prior to said termination. A former employee who is reemployed and who did not withdraw his or her initial retirement contributions at the time of his/her termination, shall not be required to make an additional initial retirement contribution for the previous period of covered employment with Riverside County.
D.	Re-employment of Retired Persons. An employee who is retired under the State Employees Retirement Act and who is receiving retirement benefits shall not be employed or re-employed in any position for compensation without the prior written approval of the Human Resources Director. Consistent with the requirements of the State Employees Retirement Act for discontinuance of retirement benefits, the retiree may be employed or re-employed.
The Human Resources Director may allow the employment or re-employment for up to 120 working days in any calendar year, without loss of benefits, as specified in Section 21153 of the Government Code. That section permits the temporary employment only during an emergency to prevent stoppage of public business, or because the restored employee has skills needed in performing specialized work of limited duration. During the employment or re-employment the retiree is to be paid at a rate not less than the minimum, or more than that paid other employees performing comparable duties.
When a retiree under the State Employees Retirement Act is employed or reemployed, his/her retirement status must be specified in the documentation of appointment to a permanent or temporary position.
Section 4.	Promotion. On promotion, the salary shall be at a rate on the new salary range which is 2 steps higher, or immediately greater than 2 steps higher, than that paid on the range for the former position where the new range is able to accommodate the increase. The effective date of all promotions shall coincide with the first working day of a pay period. The anniversary date shall be determined as if the date of promotion were the date of employment.
Sections. Transfer. On transfer, the salary shall be the same as that paid previously. The anniversary date shall not change.
Section 6.	Demotion
A.	On demotion, the salary shall be at the rate of the same step on the new range as was applicable to the previous range. The anniversary date shall not change. The effective date of all demotions shall coincide with the first working day of a pay period.
33
B.	Permanent employees who, within one year following a promotion, voluntarily demote to their previously held classification may return to the step of the previously held classification from which they promoted. Demotion under this section shall be with the mutual agreement of the employee and involved department head(s) and an opening must exist. The anniversary date shall not change.
Section 7.	Reclassification
A.	The salary of an incumbent of a position reclassified to a class on the same salary range shall not change. The anniversary date shall not change.
B.	The salary of an incumbent of a position reclassified to a class on a higher salary range shall be at the rate which is 2 steps higher, or immediately greater than 2 steps higher, than that paid on the range of the former position, where the new range is able to accommodate the increase.
The anniversary date shall be determined in accordance with this Article, except that the first anniversary date shall be the first day of the pay period following the completion of 6 months in a paid status, not including overtime, in the new classification. Thereafter, anniversary dates shall be on the first day of the pay period following each additional one year in a paid status.
C.	The salary of an incumbent of a position reclassified to a class on a lower salary range shall not change unless such salary would exceed the maximum of the new range, in which event it shall be reduced to the maximum. The anniversary date shall not change.
D.	The effective date of a reclassification shall coincide with the first working day of a pay period.
Section 8.	Temporary Promotion. A regular employee may be promoted on a temporary basis to fill a vacant position as a result of a leave of absence of the incumbent of that position, or pending appointment of another person to that position. Such promotion is designated "temporary promotion". The salary of an employee temporarily promoted shall be determined as if the temporary promotion were an original appointment to the position.
When the absence ceases or the vacancy is filled, the employee shall return to their regular position, and their salary and anniversary date shall be re-determined as if the temporary promotion had not occurred. Any step increases which would have been due in their regular position shall be allowed.
Section 9.	Conformance to Plan. No regular employee shall be assigned to exercise the powers or perform the duties of any classification other than their own classification for an accumulated period of 480 hours or more during any one calendar year. Such accumulated hours of such assignment(s) shall be credited toward qualifying experience for
34
possible promotion only when such assignments have been authorized or verified by the department head or designee in writing.
Section 10.	Payroll Errors. The County shall make every reasonable effort to resolve payroll errors within one pay period.
The County agrees to meet with SEIU at mutually acceptable times and places to review payroll related problems.
Section 11.	Board Policy C-26: SEIU agrees that the County may apply Board Policy C-26, Hiring/Retention Bonus, to any classification as deemed necessary by the County.

5.	Sick leave may be used for absence reasonably required by complications of pregnancy, continuing through delivery and reasonable period of recovery therefrom, to be determined in accordance with a written report or reports of the employee's personal physician, specifying the expected date of delivery and the date that the employee should cease work. In the event the department head believes there are unusual circumstances, or that the full performance of the employee's work without undue hazard is such as to require a longer period of absence, and on the department head's written request to the Human Resources Director, the determination of the period shall be subject to review and change by a physician employed or provided by the County, including a medical examination of
39
the employee if required by such physician. The cost of this examination shall be paid by the County. In no event shall an employee return to work after pregnancy prior to a date to be fixed by her physician in a signed statement that she is physically able to perform the duties of her position.
B.	Proof of Illness
1.	When in the judgment of the department head or designee, good reason exists for believing an employee may be abusing sick leave the employee shall be placed on notice in writing. The employee shall also be placed on a medical certification program and be allowed paid sick leave by producing a certificate of a physician, dentist, or other legally authorized person to provide health care services on the same level as a physician or proof satisfactory to the department head. Such certificate shall include a written statement signed by a physician, dentist, or other legally authorized person to provide health care services on the same level as a physician, stating the day(s) of the illness/injury and that the illness/injury prevents the employee from being able to work.
(a)	Employees on a medical certification program shall have their sick leave usage reviewed at least annually. If the review shows substantial improvement they shall be removed from the category of having to provide the certificate for each absence.
(b)	Every regular employee shall be able to use accrued vacation, compensatory time, or holiday time when sick leave has been exhausted due to extended illness or injury unless they are on a medical certification program in accordance with B.1 of this section.
2.	An employee off work or contemplating to be off work due to illness or injury for an extended period of two (2) weeks or more shall provide a comprehensive health statement as to length of absence from the employee's health care provider stating any duties an employee cannot perform and any restrictions or light duty requirements.

D.	Reason for Usage. Use of accrued sick leave shall be allowed for the purpose of preventative medical, dental care, and care of the family. Family is defined to mean a spouse, domestic partner (registered with the Secretary of State and providing a Declaration of Domestic Partnership), child, child of a domestic partner, parent, brother, or sister of the employee.

40
employing agency and the Public Employee's Retirement System, unused accumulated sick leave shall be paid for at the rate of fifty percent (50%) of the current salary value thereof for each such person who has had five full years of service in a payroll status provided, however, that the total payment shall not exceed a sum equal to 960 hours of full pay. Payment resulting from death shall be made to the persons entitled to otherwise, in accordance with the Probate Code. Eligibility for a payout under this section is made at the time of separation from County employment and not at a later date.
F.	Post Employment Plan: Effective pay period beginning July 8, 2004 (pay date August 4, 2004), for each regular employee covered under this Memorandum of Understanding who is separating from County employment, the County shall provide a Post-Employment Plan wherein the payable value of qualifying final accrued leave balances will be deposited, up to the legal limit in a Special Pay Account and/or a VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association). Qualifying leave balances include annual leave, vacation, extra vacation, holiday balance, and the payable amount of sick leave. Compensation time for overtime is not a qualifying leave balance for the purposes of the Post Employment Plan. Special Pay Accounts are tax-deferred investment funds. The employee may also elect to place some or all of the funds into a VEBA account which may be used for future health care costs, in lieu of the Special Pay Account.

Section 7.	Hearing Procedure - Minor Discipline
55
A. When disciplinary action results in a suspension of eighty (80) working hours or less, a pay reduction equal to eighty (80) hours or less of gross salary, or a written reprimand in lieu of suspension of eighty (80) working hours or less, the appeal shall be determined under the following provisions:
1.	Appeals shall be heard by a person assigned by the State Conciliation Service or another third party neutral (either hereinafter referred to as a neutral) as agreed to by the parties. The neutral's decision may be verbal or in writing. The neutral’s decision shall be binding on both parties, neither of which shall have the right of further appeal.
2.	Only the employee and one (1) non-attorney representative and the department head or a designee and the Human Resources Director or a non-attorney designee shall take part in the presentation of any appeal, unless the employee is an attorney who is self represented. Nothing herein shall prevent an attorney testifying to facts of which the attorney has personal knowledge and that which the attorney may be competent to testify.
3.	The appeal hearing and disposition of the appeal shall be informal, the object being to settle the appeal promptly by the parties. The parties shall have the right to offer evidence by witnesses at the hearing subject to the discretion of the impartial party. The neutral may consult with witnesses informally and otherwise investigate the controversy.
4.	The neutral may modify the disciplinary action, but in no event shall have the authority to increase the disciplinary action imposed to be greater than in Section 7(A) herein.
5.	The judgment of the neutral shall be rendered within five (5) working days of submission of the controversy to him/her. Provided, however, the parties may mutually agree to extend the time in which the judgment may be rendered.
6.	The neutral's authority shall be limited to deciding the issues submitted by the parties. The neutral shall have no jurisdiction or authority to add to, delete from, or modify any written provisions of any Memorandum of Understanding.
7.	All costs for the service of the neutral, if any, including but not limited to, per diem expenses, travel and subsistence expenses, a transcript, and the cost of the hearing room will be borne equally by the County and SEIU.

Section 8.	Hearing Procedure - Major Discipline
A.	Appeals filed in cases of termination, suspension exceeding eighty (80) working hours, or pay reductions exceeding eighty (80) hours of gross salary shall be heard by a neutral.
56
B.	The parties shall maintain a jointly negotiated list of no fewer than seven nor more than eleven neutrals who shall be selected by the striking method. The only remaining name after the striking process shall serve as the neutral. If unable to agree on who should strike first, the first name shall be struck by the party winning the toss of a coin. If the neutral chosen is unable to serve within a time frame acceptable to both parties, the last name struck will serve as the neutral. As soon as possible, a representative from SEIU and the County shall meet to establish the list of up to eleven neutrals.
C.	The hearing shall be set by the Human Resources Director, or designee, and employee representative, or employee, within a reasonable period based on the neutral’s availability and other scheduling factors.
D.	The employee and the department head may be represented by counsel or other representative, provided, however, if the employee is in a representation unit wherein an Employee Organization has been awarded exclusive recognition pursuant to the Employee Relations Resolution, unless represented by counsel, the employee may be represented only by the exclusive employee organization.
E.	It shall be the duty of any County Officer or employee to attend a hearing and testify upon the written request of either the employee, the department head, or the neutral, provided reasonable notice is given the department employing the officer or employee. The Human Resources Director, or designee, shall arrange for the production of any relevant County record. The neutral is authorized to issue subpoenas.
F.	All appeal hearings involving the dismissal of an employee shall be reported by a stenographic reporter. All other appeals need not be reported but either the employee or the department head may, at their own expense, provide a reporter for the hearing.
G.	The expenses of the neutral and transcripts, if required, shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall make arrangements for and pay expenses of witnesses that are called by such party, except that any County employee called as a witness shall be released from work without loss of compensation or other benefits to attend the disciplinary hearing.
H.	A SEIU member who elects not to be represented by SEIU at the hearing shall provide to the Human Resources Director, or designee, an advance deposit of $500 per day of hearing, prior to the hearing being scheduled.
I.	Any arbitration expense incurred as the result of a postponement or cancellation of a hearing shall be borne by the postponing or canceling party.
J.	Within 21 days following the submission of the appeal, the neutral shall submit written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the decision to the parties together with a copy of the appeal and a summary of the evidence taken at the hearing. The decision of the neutral shall be final subject to the right of either party to seek judicial review under Section 1280 et. seq. of the California Code of Civil Procedure.
57
1.	The neutral shall confine the decision to issues raised by the statement of charges and responses. The neutral shall act in judicial, not legislative manners. The neutral shall not amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or subtract from the provisions of the Memorandum but, rather, shall interpret and apply its terms.
2.	The neutral will not substitute his/her discretion and judgment for that of management for sustained charges unless the neutral finds that discrimination, unfairness, capriciousness, or arbitrary action by the County is proven.
3.	In the case of suspension/reduction in compensation or demotion, if the action is modified or rescinded, the appellant shall be entitled restoration of pay and/or fringe benefits in a manner consistent with the neutral's decision.
4.	In the case of discharges, if the neutral finds the order of discharge should be modified, the appellant shall be reinstated to a position in the classification held immediately prior to discharge subject to forfeiture of pay and fringe benefits for any period of suspension imposed by the neutral.
5.	If the neutral finds the order of discharge should be rescinded, the appellant shall be reinstated to a position in the classification held immediately prior to discharge and shall receive pay and fringe benefits for all of the period of time between the discharge and reinstatement.
6.	The County shall not be liable for restoring pay and fringe benefits for any period(s) of time the appellant was reduced or removed from duty which results solely from the appellant's request for written briefs in the arbitration proceedings.
7.	Restoration of pay benefits shall be subject to deduction of all unemployment insurance and outside earnings which the appellant received since the date of discharge which would not have been earned had the appellant not been disciplined. The appellant shall supply such outside employment earning records during the period of time in question when requested.
8.	The neutral shall render findings sufficient both to enable the parties to determine whether and on what basis they should seek review and, in the event of review, to apprise a reviewing court of the basis for the neutral’s decision. If the neutral fails to do so either party may request in writing within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the decision that the neutral render such findings.
Section 9.	Evidence and Procedures Applicable to All Hearings
A.	Hearings need not be conducted according to technical rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs.
58
B.	Hearsay evidence shall be admitted and may be used for the purposes of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence, but shall not be sufficient in itself to support disciplinary action as defined in Section 1 .a. herein, unless it is the type of hearsay admissible over objection in a civil action. The rules of privilege shall apply to the same extent to which they are recognized in civil actions.
C.	Irrelevant and unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded.
D.	The rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil actions. In addition, communications between Human Resources Department employees, non-attorney advocates, Management or employees of County departments involved in an arbitration, and communications between the union representative and the employee who is the subject of a personnel action shall be confidential and not subject to disclosure in a personnel hearing.
E.	Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation. Any written statements, declarations, or affidavits admitted as evidence shall be made or sworn under penalty of perjury.
F.	Employees not testifying in their behalf may be called and examined as on crossexamination.
G.	The employee and the Department Head shall have these rights:
1.	To call and examine witnesses;
2.	To introduce exhibits;
3.	To cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issue, even though the matter was not covered in the direct examination;
4.	To impeach any witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify; and
5.	To rebut any derogatory evidence.
H.	The hearing shall be a private proceeding among the County, the employee and the employee organization.
I.	The intention of the parties is that appeals or arbitration hearings be adjudicated as efficiently and economically as possible. Historically the parties have found that the use of legal counsel in the appeal/arbitration process can result in excessive delays, longer hearings, and increased costs. The parties to an appeal hearing or an arbitration hearing hereby commit to instructing their legal counsel to conform to the intention of this
59
Memorandum and to take all necessary steps to expedite the appeal/arbitration hearing and minimize the cost of the hearing.
In cases involving hearings in excess of three (3) days the parties must engage in a case management process with the neutral. The case management meeting must be held at least thirty (30) days prior to the first scheduled date for the hearing and may be held telephonically. The neutral shall consider:
(a)	the simplification of the issues,
(b)	the possibility of obtaining admissions which might facilitate the hearing,
(c)	the quantum of damages, in the appropriate case,
(d)	any preliminary application by either party,
(e)	any other matters that may aid in the disposition of the action or the attainment of justice.
At the case management conference the neutral may, whether or not on the application of a party, order that:
(a)	a party file and deliver, within a fixed time, to each other party as specified by the neutral, any relevant documents,
(b)	any preliminary applications be brought within a fixed time or by a specified date, (c) a statement of agreed facts be filed within a fixed time or by a specified date, (d) a party deliver a written summary of the proposed evidence of a witness within a fixed time or by a specified date,
(e)	experts who have been retained by the parties confer, on a without prejudice basis, to determine those matters on which they agree and to identify those matters on which they do not agree,
(f)	the hearing be adjourned,
and, on making an order the neutral may give other directions that he/she thinks just or necessary.
If the neutral, upon application by either party to the appeal hearing, determ inesthat legal counsel for the other party has unnecessarily prolonged the hearing and/or increased the cost of the hearing beyond the reasonable expectations of the parties at the commencement of the hearing then the neutral is authorized to impose sanctions on the offending party including, but not limited to, ordering such offending party to pay all or part of the non-offending party’s increased costs of the hearing, to pay all or part of the nonoffending party’s attorney fees, to pay all or part of the non-offending party’s cost of the neutral, to pay all or part of the non-offending party’s costs of the transcripts, or such other relief that the neutral deems appropriate in the circumstances.

C. PROCEDURE
Section 14.	Steps. The following procedure shall be followed by an employee submitting a grievance petition:
A.	Discussion with Supervisor. Prior to filing a written grievance petition, the employee shall, within ten working days from the date of the event leading to the grievance, discuss the matter with his/her immediate supervisor.

A.	After submission of a request for review, SEIU and the Human Resources Director, or designee, shall attempt to agree on a neutral.
B.	The parties shall maintain a jointly negotiated list of up to eleven neutrals who shall be selected by the striking method. The only remaining name after the striking process shall serve as the neutral. If unable to agree on who should strike first, the first name shall be struck by the party winning the toss of a coin.

If the neutral chosen is unable to serve within a time frame acceptable to both parties, the last name struck will serve as the neutral.
C.	If either party wishes to have a transcript of the arbitration proceedings, the requesting party will be solely responsible for all costs associated with the transcript. If both parties request a transcript the cost will be shared equally.
D.	The expenses of the neutral, if any, shall be shared equally by the parties. Each party shall make arrangements for and pay expenses of witnesses that are called by such party, except that any County employee called as a witness shall be released from work

3.	If laid off out of seniority.
E.	If an employee who has received official notice of layoff has previously held regular status in another job classification within the department, and was not removed therefrom for disciplinary reasons, such employee shall, upon request, be given a transfer or demotion within the department to such other classification in lieu of layoff unless such action cannot be accomplished without authorization of another position or displacement of an employee with greater seniority. The affected employee must request such transfer or demotion within seven days of written notification of layoff by personal delivery or mailing of a certified letter.
Regular employees who elect to demote under this provision shall be placed on the step nearest their present salary within the range of the class to which they are demoting provided such step shall not exceed present salary.

VETERAN'S SERVICES
POLICY & PROCEDURES
DRESS CODE
Our department is here to serve veterans, their dependents and survivors. While we realize we cannot meet all needs or obtain all benefits sought, we owe it to our clients to provide courteous, competent and compassionate assistance at all times. In short, we care for these people because they're special and they need our help.
One way we communicate our attitude towards our clients and to others is by the way we dress and our general personal appearance. Understand that it is quite possible to compromise concern and good intentions in the mind of the object of that concern is our dress and demeanor is perceived as being unprofessional, unkempt, overly-casual, slovenly, or in relative bad taste based on acceptable professional and community standards. The key is how we are perceived by our clients; the standard is how professionals with whom our clients have done business - lawyers, doctors, morticians, VA personnel, insurance agents, realtors, teachers, other government service providers - dress and comport themselves.
If the standard for our dress and comportment is to be what our clients expect or feel comfortable with, let us realize that our clients cover the social spectrum, from bereaved widows of retirees to homeless veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder to young home buyers to war orphans. If there is a common denominator it is that they all look to us as professional service providers. Our appearance, therefore, must meet their most demanding standards while not distancing the occasional, more relaxed expectation.
Management is responsible for employee behavior and performance. Accordingly, management, by example, leadership skills and exhortation will set the tone for department appearance.
74
GENERAL GUIDELINES: Effective immediately the following general guidelines will apply at all times.
A.	Dress and grooming must conform with acceptable professional community standards and be consistent with the highest expectations of the most exacting clients;
B.	Dress and grooming will at all times be modest, professional, non-provocative and appropriate enough so as not to offend or overly arouse clients or co-workers.
C.	Work clothes should not restrict but should allow the worker to perform all tasks within their job specifications.
D.	Apparel should be clean and in good repair, buttons buttoned, zippers zipped, shirttails tucked in.
The Director will counsel anyone whose dress and general personal appearance does not reflect the spirit of these guidelines. Unacceptable violations will not be tolerated, and the violator may be requested to return home on their time to change into more appropriate attire.

90
any Employee shall be the amount as listed on Appendix A, attached hereto, as may be amended from time to time.

Employees whose last hire date is on or after November 11,2004 (pay period 25-04) will be required to select a medical plan as part of their Flexible Benefit election each year, and will not have the option of waiving all medical coverage. Those who fail to timely elect medical coverage will be placed in the lowest-priced employee-only medical plan available.

County Monthly Contribution	$465.00
Health Insurance Premium for a single party as of 12/11/03	206.00
Dental Insurance Premium (single party)	18.00
Cash Back	241.00

Employees working 30 to 39 hours per week, 75% of the applicable County of Riverside Flexible Benefits Program contribution for full-time regular employees per month per employee.
