schedules being considered prior to volunteering for flexible work schedules. The nurse may limit her or his agreement to specific types of flexible schedules.

In establishing a flexible schedule, the Hospital will avoid any disruptive impact or alterations in scheduling of hours, shifts, holidays, vacation or weekends for a nurse who is not on a flexible schedule, it being the intention of this Section that flexible schedules are to be a supplement and not a replacement for the basic 80 and 8 patterns.
Alternative Weekend Schedules: Hospital may establish flexible scheduling plans providing work schedules of only two twelve (12) hours shifts every weekend. A nurse may agree to work additional shifts; but such agreement shall not be a condition of being accepted for available Alternative Weekend Schedules.

5.	For purposes of Section 16 D. a nurse on an Alternative Weekend Schedule shall be considered to be regularly scheduled for seventy-two (72) compensated hours per payroll period.

6
shift and, in accordance with Section 16 B., will be given one and one-half (1 1/2) hours credit toward benefits for all hours lost.
6.	Vacation and sick leave used shall be paid and be deducted from the nurse's accumulated vacation and sick leave at the same rate as it is accrued. A nurse will, therefore, receive eighteen (18) hours of pay for each twelve (12) hour weekend shift taken as vacation or sick leave.
7.	A nurse electing an alternative weekend schedule may be scheduled to work on each holiday falling on a weekend.
8.	Holiday pay shall be based on the number of hours regularly scheduled under the Alternative Weekend Program.
9.	Section 3 D. relating to the Weekend Bonus and Section 4 L. relating to the Weekend Premium, and Section 4 J. relating to Shift Differential, shall not apply to the two (2) twelve (12) hour shifts for which a nurse is normally scheduled; but will apply to any additional weekend shifts a nurse agrees to work.

12.	A nurse may revoke her or his consent to an alternative weekend schedule pursuant to this program by giving written notice in accordance with Section 3 H. The nurse shall be entitled to return to an open available position for which the nurse is qualified and which has an equal number of hours per payroll period as the nurse had prior to electing the Alternative Weekend Program.
The Hospital shall likewise give a nurse notice of equal length in the event the Alternative Weekend Program were discontinued. If the Program is discontinued at the conclusion of a pilot or trial period of specified length not to exceed six (6) months, the nurse shall be returned to the position she or he held prior to the pilot period. If Alternative Weekend Schedules are otherwise discontinued, the nurse, in a manner consistent with Section 38 B., shall be offered vacant or new registered nurse positions within the Hospital which have an equal number of hours per payroll period as the nurse had prior to electing the Alternative Weekend Program for which the nurse is reasonably qualified.
7
13.	A nurse participating in this Alternative Weekend Program may, with Hospital approval, trade hours with a nurse who is not on an Alternative Weekend Schedule. Each nurse Involved in the trade will be paid at that nurse’s regular rate of pay excluding the Alternative Weekend Schedule Premium and in accordance with that nurse's standard for overtime eligibility. A nurse on an Alternative Weekend Schedule who trades hours with another nurse who is scheduled to work a twelve (12) hour shift between 7:00 p.m. Friday and 7:00 a.m. Monday shall continue to receive pay as set forth in this Section 3 I. Any nurse who agrees to work a scheduled shift for a nurse on an Alternative Weekend Schedule shall be paid at the rate of pay the nurse would otherwise receive for weekend work.

If a nurse is called to work while on-call off premises, she or he will be guaranteed not less than four (4) hours' pay. Such four (4) hours shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 172) the nurse’s regular rate of pay to the extent that the total of hours worked and guaranteed exceed eight (8) hours in one (1) day or eighty (80) hours in a payroll period.
In areas where on-call duty is part of the nurse's work agreement, overtime language will apply for the first hour of a call shift when the call shift immediately follows a worked shift; off premise on-call language will apply when overtime exceeds one (1) hour into the nurse’s call shift.
B.

They will enjoy the same prorated relief and night shift payments as those for full-time nurses.
B.	Part-Time Holidays: A part-time nurse who works on New Year’s Day, Easter, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, or the nurse’s birthday will be paid, in addition to the regular rate of pay for the hours worked, one (1) hour of straight time pay for each hour worked on the holiday.

3.	Part-Time Sick Leave: Regularly scheduled part-time nurses as described in part C of this Section 6 who have averaged thirty-two (32) compensated hours or
23

The Hospital may request reasonable evidence of such illness. Sick leave will be granted for absences from work only on a day scheduled as a work day.
D.	Transfer Between Part-Time and Full-Time: A change in status from full-time to parttime or from part-time to full-time shall not work a forfeiture of earned benefits. A change in status from full-time to part-time or from part-time to full-time shall not work a loss of credited standing to earn benefits, which benefits are contractually provided in the status to which the nurse has changed. Credited vacation standing earned as a part-time nurse who has changed to a full-time nurse status will be determined on the basis of credit for one (1) year's service for each two thousand eighty (2,080) compensated hours.
E.	Casual Part-Time: There shall be established and maintained within each Hospital, a pool of casual part-time nurses employed by the Hospital to be utilized to supplement the regularly scheduled staff. A casual part-time nurse shall be called or scheduled to work in a manner mutually agreeable between the nurse and the hospital. A casual part-time nurse is not assured the availability of work on a regular continuing basis; but a casual part-time nurse is not obligated to report for duty each time he or she is requested to work. Casual part-time nurses may be assigned a station unit or may be utilized to float among nursing units.

A Casual part-time nurse shall be given a minimum of two (2) hours advance notice of the cancellation of any shift of work for which the nurse has agreed to work.
A Casual part-time nurse is required to show evidence of current licensure in the State of Minnesota to the staffing office at each renewal date. The nurse also must complete Mandatory Education, BCLS Testing, the unit skill competencies required, and health screening (i.e. Mantoux) on an annual basis. This time will be paid.
Casual part-time nurses will accrue vacation provided the nurse works a minimum of four hundred sixteen (416) hours per anniversary year.
Casual part-time nurses are eligible for the $50.00 weekend bonus when working more than four (4) weekend shifts during a given four (4) week period. This four (4) week period covers the current posted schedule. Bonus status is determined at the time of shift commitment. Weekend bonus shifts include all shifts worked between 1500 Friday
24
and 0700 Monday. Shifts worked for regularly scheduled staff will not count toward weekend bonus.
Nurses hired to Casual part-time status prior to 6-1-98: To maintain casual parttime status, a nurse shall not be unavailable to work for a period greater than two (2) consecutive months unless such nurse requests and is granted a leave of absence.
Nurses hired to Casual part-time status after 6-1-98: To maintain a casual part-time status a nurse must be available (and needed by staffing) to work two (2) shifts per four (4) week schedule, one (1) of which are evening, night, or weekend. Call shifts may be used to meet these requirements. A minimum of two (2) shifts per four (4) week schedule must be met even if all available shifts are evening, night, or weekends. Hour exchanges with regularly scheduled staff are not considered as part of the requirement. A casual part-time nurse may choose to work a two month requirement of shifts within a one month period and not work again for a month.
A casual part-time nurse will work at least one (1) holiday per year. Every other year will be Thanksgiving or Christmas.
Each casual part-time nurse will commit to the required two (2) shifts within two weeks after the posting of each four (4) week schedule. These two (2) shifts are dependent on hospital needs and/or staffing office request
Casual part-time nurses may commit to work shifts for regularly scheduled staff at any time. However to maintain casual status the casual requirements must be met by the end of the four (4) week period.
It is the employee's responsibility to maintain casual part-time status by contacting the staffing office to commit to the required shifts.
If a casual part-time employee has been inactive (not committing to two (2) shifts a month) for more than two (2) months the hospital will notify the employee in writing that their casual status is being terminated due to not meeting the requirements of this position. This requirement will be referred to the Labor/Management Committee and be subject to evaluation and change over the length of this contract.
F.	Application of other Contract Provisions: Except as otherwise expressly limited or qualified by this Section 6, or another section of this Contract Agreement, a part-time nurse shall be entitled to the benefit of the other sections of this Agreement.
G.	Eligibility and Accumulation of Benefits: For purposes of this Section 6 and Section 30, compensated hours shall include all hours for which a nurse is paid except off-premises on-call hours. An overtime hour shall be counted as a compensated hour on the basis of one (1) hour per each overtime hour paid.
In addition, compensated hours shall include hours which Section 15, Leave of Absence. Subparagraphs A,, D., E., G., and I. provide are hours worked or hours for which length of service increments accrue.	.
25
H.	Increase in Part-Time Hours: A regularly scheduled part-time nurse who, over a six (6) month period, is consistently scheduled for or consistently works more shifts than the number confirmed pursuant to Section 4 C., or the most recent amendment to that employment understanding, shall, upon request of the nurse, have her or his confirmed number of work shifts increased up to the average number of shifts actually worked in the preceding six (6) months. If there are nurses holding recall rights to available hours, confirmation of increased work shifts to a nurse under this provision shall be delayed until qualified nurses holding recall rights to available hours have been offered recall. The above notwithstanding, no nurse shall be regularly scheduled for greater than fulltime hours.
7.	ROTATION AND SHIFT OF CHOICE:
Nurses with ten (10) or more years of seniority as defined in Section 16 will be afforded the opportunity to work a permanent shift assignment of the nurse's choice subject to the need to provide proper staffing on all shifts. In order to provide greater opportunities for nurses to select a shift of choice, the Hospital will create more straight shifts. The parties recognize that complete implementation of this provision will need to be phased in, and that the period of implementation will be governed by the following:
A.	The Hospital will review the current schedules on each unit in order to determine if additional straight shifts may be offered. It is recognized that to the extent that permanent day shifts are created on a unit, the balance of the staff on such units may be required to work additional relief and night shifts occasioned by the establishment of the permanent day shifts. Provided that any change in schedules to create additional straight day shift positions will not require nurses with less than ten (10) years of service to rotate to more than a total of fifty percent (50%) reliefs or nights.
B.	No confirmed work agreement as provided in Section 4 E. specifying the number of hours per payroll period and shift rotation of a currently employed nurse will be involuntarily changed.
C.	Eligible full-time nurses in seniority order on the unit will first be offered their shift assignment of choice; thereafter eligible part-time nurses on the unit in seniority order will be offered their shift assignment of choice.
D.	Each unit will develop and provide a specific plan for development of shift of choice nurse positions to the Staffing Advisory Committee. The Staffing Advisory Committee of each Hospital will monitor the progress and implementation of this provision in their Hospital. The Joint Committee on Interpretation will meet at least six (6) months and twelve (12) months following conclusion of this Agreement to review questions of Contract application relating to implementation of this provision and will meet thereafter as needed.
E.	The nurse may elect an assignment of days, reliefs, nights or a rotating assignment including days and either reliefs or nights. Rotating shift positions will be decreased but not eliminated.
F.	A nurse may use this election to fill an available position having a flexible work schedule □r an alternate weekend schedule but may not use the election to require the creation of new flexible work schedule or alternate weekend schedule positions.
26
G,	If a permanent shift assignment becomes available because of changes in the schedules of nurses currently employed on a unit which has no open unfilled positions, the available permanent shift assignment will be first offered to nurses on that unit. Otherwise all openings, including those offering permanent shift assignments, will be offered and filled in accordance with Section 18, Schedules and Posting.
H.	Nurses at the date of this Agreement who have a 7:00 a.m, starting time shall not have such shift time changed without the consent of the nurse.
I.	A nurse electing a rotating shift of choice shall not be scheduled for more than three (3) starting shift times per four (4) week period. A nurse electing a straight shift of choice shall not be scheduled for more than two (2) starting shift times per four (4) week period. The foregoing provisions shall be modified to the extent necessary if the number of 10-year nurses on a unit would mean an inability to cover the required shifts.
Insofar as practicable, rotating shift assignments and weekend assignments will be made equally among the nurses employed on each unit.
8.	HOLIDAYS: (Full-Time Nurses, Eighty (80) Hours Per Pay Period)
A.	Paid Holidays: Nurses will be granted the following seven (7) holidays with pay: New Year's Day, Easter, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and the Christmas holiday. Full-time nurses shall be provided with three (3) personal floating holidays each contract year at a time mutually agreed upon between each individual nurse and the Hospital.
B.	Christmas and New Year’s Holidays: For purposes of this Section 8 and also Section 6, Christmas shall be deemed to extend over a forty-eight (48) hour period from 0700 on December 24th through 0700 on December 26th; New Year's Day shall be deemed to extend over a thirty (32) hour period from the start of the relief shift which beginning on December 31 through the end of the relief shift which began on January 1.
A nurse who works on the Christmas holiday shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) pay for all hours worked on the holiday and eight (8) hours of compensatory time off for one (1) scheduled shift during this forty-eight (48) hour period. If a nurse works more than eight (8) hours in one (1) shift during this forty-eight (48) hour period, she or he shall receive in addition to her or his regular rate of pay one (1) hour of holiday pay for each hour in excess of eight (8) hours. Back-to-back shifts shall be deemed to be one (1) shift for purposes of this Section. If a nurse works more than one (1) shift during the fortyeight (48) hour period, the first shift shall be the one for which holiday pay is received.
Full-time nurses choosing to take two (2) shifts off during the forty-eight (48) hour Christmas Holiday period may:
a)	Fill in eight (8) hours of benefit hours.
b)	Pick up extra shift of their choice, c) Fill in eight (8) hours credit time.

27
works more than eight (8) hours in one (1) shift during this thirty-two (32) hour period, she or he shall receive in addition to her or his regular rate of pay one (1) hour of holiday pay for each hour in excess of eight (8) hours. If a nurse works more than one (1) shift during the thirty-two (32) hour period, the first shift shall be the one for which holiday pay is received.

If a nurse works on any of the other holidays specified in this Agreement, she or he will be paid, in addition to the regular rate of pay for the hours worked, one (1) hour of straight time pay for each hour worked on the holiday or will be given one (1) hour of compensatory straight time off within a two (2) week period before or within a two (2) week period after said holiday for each hour worked on the holiday, the nurse to choose the method of reimbursement or combination of methods.
C.	Holiday on Dav Off: If a holiday falls on a nurse's day off, she or he will be paid eight (8) hours of straight time pay for the holiday or will be given eight (8) hours of compensatory straight time off within a two (2) week period before or within a two (2) week period after said holiday, the nurse to choose the method of reimbursement.
D.	Time Off in Lieu of Holiday Pay: A nurse electing compensatory straight time off in lieu of holiday pay shall be paid for such compensatory day during the pay period in which the compensatory day off is taken.
E.	Holiday During Vacation: If a holiday falls during a nurse’s vacation, or falls on a nurse’s day off, the nurse will choose one of the following:
1.	Take the holiday as holiday pay and have vacation day banked.
2.	Take the holiday as vacation pay and request another day off as a holiday in the
pay period preceding, during or after the holiday.
To request the use of your holiday time, submit a request form (Time Off Request Form) indicating three (3) choices in order of priority. If none of these choices can be granted, the nurse will be contacted to facilitate an alternative option. If no alternative can be agreed upon or the nurse does not request specific days to be used for the holiday, the holiday will be used to reduce the number of vacation days used.
F.	Holiday Scheduling: Except in cases of emergency or unavoidable situations where it would have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service, nurses shall not be required to work more than half of the following holidays: New Year's Eve relief shift, New Year's Day, Easter, Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve relief shift, and Christmas Day. .
G,	No Holiday Work for Fifteen-Year Nurse: A full-time nurse who has fifteen (15) calendar years of service or with 24,960 (12 years) seniority hours shall not be required to work on the holidays specified in Section 8 of this Contract Agreement.

A.	Vacation Accrual: General duty nurses who have completed one (1) full year of continuous service in the Hospital will be granted two (2) calendar weeks' vacation with pay; after completing two (2), three (3) or four (4) full years of continuous service will be granted three (3) calendar weeks’ vacation with pay; and after completing five (5) or
28
more full years of continuous service will be granted four (4) calendar weeks' vacation with pay.
Assistant head nurses who have completed one (1) full year of continuous service in the Hospital will be granted two (2) calendar weeks' vacation with pay: after completing two (2) or three (3) full years of continuous service will be granted three (3) calendar weeks' vacation with pay; and after completing four (4) or more full years of continuous service will be granted four (4) calendar weeks' vacation with pay.
Vacation shall be accrued from the nurse's most recent date of employment by the Hospital. A nurse may utilize earned vacation after completion of six (6) continuous months of employment. Thereafter, vacation may be utilized as it is accrued in accordance with vacation scheduling provisions in this Contract.
Vacation shall be accrued based on compensated hours as such hours are defined in Section 6 G. The accrual rate for full-time and regularly scheduled part-time nurses shall be determined by dividing the annual number of hours of vacation to which a nurse would be entitled based on the above schedule by 2,080 hours and shall be as follows:
(1)	Two (2) weeks' vacation - .0385 vacation hours accrued for each compensated hour. Annual maximum compensated hours counted - 2,080 hours. Annual maximum vacation accrued - 80 hours. Effective June 1, 1996, the annual maximums shall be deleted.
(2)	Three (3) weeks' vacation - .0577 vacation hours accrued for each compensated hour. Annual maximum compensated hours counted - 2,080 hours. Annual maximum vacation accrued -120 hours. Effective June 1,1996, the annual maximums shall be deleted.
(3)	Four (4) weeks' vacation - .0769 vacation hours accrued for each compensated hour. Annual maximum compensated hours counted - 2,080 hours. Annual maximum vacation accrued -160 hours. Effective June 1, 1996, the annual maximums shall be deleted.
During the first year of employment, staff and assistant head nurses shall accrue vacation at the rate of .0385 hours of vacation for each compensated hour.
During the second and third years of employment, staff and assistant head nurses shall accrue vacation at the rate of .0577 hours of vacation for each compensated hour.
During the fourth year of employment a staff nurse will continue to accrue vacation at the rate of .0577 hours of vacation for each compensated hour.
During the fourth year of employment and thereafter, an assistant head nurse will accrue vacation at the rate of .0769 hours of vacation for each compensated hour.
During the fifth year of employment and thereafter, a staff nurse will accrue vacation at the rate of .0769 hours of vacation for each compensated hour.
29
B.	Terminal Vacation Pay: Nurses who have completed six (6) months or longer of continuous service in the Hospital, including nurses of leave of absence otherwise qualifying, will receive terminal vacation pay prorated from the above schedule, providing that they give the Hospital one (1) month's written notice in case of voluntary termination of employment.
C.	Vacation Scheduling: The primary factor governing the scheduling of earned vacation shall be availability of RN staff to provide patient care on each nursing unit. If two or more nurses on a station unit request concurrent vacation times and staffing for patient care does not allow granting of all requests, and such conflict is not resolved on a mutually agreeable basis between the nurses involved, the vacation shall be given to the nurse making the earlier request for such vacation. In the case of simultaneous requests, the nurse on a station unit having greater length of employment in the Hospital as defined in Section 16 shall be given preference. Where a Hospital utilizes an annual defined vacation signup period, all requests submitted during such period shall be considered as simultaneous requests. Consistent with the foregoing, the Hospital may maintain and reasonably enforce a nondiscriminatory policy specifying the way in which requests for the same or overlapping periods of vacation time shall be given consideration.
No other qualifications on the scheduling of vacations shall be applied except as set out in this Agreement or as required by unavoidable situations in which granting of requested vacation time would have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service.
Earned vacation shall normally be taken within a twelve month period following the anniversary date when such vacation was earned. Provided, however, that earned vacation shall be carried over to a subsequent year if a nurse is unable to take accrued vacation within the foregoing time period because of the inability of the Hospital to grant such vacation time due to staffing needs.
10.	SICK LEAVE:
A.	Sick Leave Accumulation: Nurses will be entitled to sick leave with pay for personal illness, not to exceed the accumulated amount. Sick leave will be earned and accumulated at the rate of one (1) day for every month the nurse is continuously employed, until ninety (90) days of sick leave have been earned and accumulated. Effective June 1,1996, the accrual rate shall become one (1) day for every 173.3 hours the nurse is continuously employed. So long as a nurse has ninety (90) days of accumulated and unused sick leave to her or his credit, she or he will earn and
. accumulate no further sick leave. If and when any of the accumulated sick leave is used, then the nurse will accumulate sick leave at the rate herein specified until she or he again has reached an accumulated credit of ninety (90) days of accumulated and unused sick leave.
B.	Sick Leave Accrual Payout:
1.	Registered Nurses who have ten (10) calendar years of service and who have a sick benefit accrued above (720) hours will be paid, in June of each year, 50% of
30
their sick time accrued above 720 hours (up to 48 hours). Following this payout, the (720) hour cap will be reset.
2.	At age 60 or older, a Registered Nurse who has accumulated 720 hours of sick leave will be paid a $4,000.00 payout upon retirement.
C.	Verification of Illness: The Hospital may request reasonable evidence of illness. General requirements of a physician's certificate for proof of sickness shall not be made, but individual nurses may be required to furnish such certificates, provided that such nurse is given advance notice that the certificate will be required. A nurse shall not be required to explain an illness at the time sick call-in is made. Such explanation may be required at a later time based on a review of a pattern of sick leave use. Sick leave will not be granted for absences from work on the day immediately preceding or following a holiday, weekend or days(s) off when the nurse is not scheduled to work unless reasonable evidence of such illness is presented to the Hospital. No nurse shall be penalized for legitimate use of sick leave, or be subject to discipline based solely on the number of sick leave days used. The preceding sentence shall not prevent the use of counseling relating to sick leave.
D.	Sick Leave When Eligible for Long Term Disability: Sick leave shall be paid up to the accumulated amount or until the nurse is eligible to receive long term disability benefits pursuant to Section 30 B. of this Agreement. A nurse who has unused sick leave available at the time of eligibility for long term disability payments shall retain such sick leave.
E.	Sick Leave While Receiving Workers’ Compensation: A nurse receiving workers' compensation may elect to use that amount of accumulated sick leave necessary to make up the difference between income received from workers' compensation and from any alternate employment at the Hospital and the regular and current rate of pay for her or his position in the bargaining unit at the commencement of her or his leave.
F.	Sick Leave While on Vacation: In situations of serious illness or injury, while on vacation time, nurses may be able to utilize sick time in place of vacation time. Nurses should submit verification of illness or injury to HealthEast Occupational Health Department for case-by-case review and approval.
11.	PROFESSIONAL PAY OR TIME OFF PLAN:
The parties have agreed to a professional pay or time off plan to be used by nurses for professional development, continuing education, or personal renewal.
Effective June 1, 1995, regularly scheduled full-time and part-time nurses with fifteen (15) years through nineteen (19) years of continuous calendar service with the Hospital in the bargaining unit shall accrue professional pay or time off at the rate of .0115 hours accrued for each compensated hour, excluding off-premise call hours. Regularly scheduled full-time and part-time nurses with twenty (20) years or more of continuous calendar service as defined in this Section, shall accrue such pay or time off at the rate of .0192 hours accrued for each compensated hour. As used in this Section, continuous service with the Hospital in the bargaining unit means continuous calendar service including any period of layoff but excluding any period of service in a classification not included in the bargaining unit. Service shall be continuous for nurses who have transferred from another Hospital and credited with seniority
31
	earned at the other Hospital pursuant to the Contract provisions or other agreements made at that time. Continuous service for nurses affected by a merger, consolidation, or other restructuring shall be based on the seniority arrangement made or in effect at the time of such event. Professional time off shall be taken at a mutually agreed time during the period between Labor Day and Memorial Day unless other dates are agreed between the nurse and Hospital. A nurse may elect to convert accrued hours to cash at such times and under such arrangements as may be mutually agreed between each Hospital and the Association. In making such agreement, consideration shall be given to the payroll system capabilities of the Hospital. Professional time off or pay may be taken as accrued, but no later than six (6) months following the end of the nurse’s anniversary year of employment during which the hours were accrued. Accrued and unpaid hours shall be included in terminal pay.
12.	ADOPTION BENEFIT: For adoptions finalized after June 1,2000, HealthEast will reimburse adoption expenses of $1,500.00 per household per adoption. Nurses who are authorized to work thirty-two (32) hours or more a pay period are considered benefit eligible. The reimbursement is payable when the adoption is finalized and proof of adoption is provided to HealthEast. Adoptions of children or step-children as a result of marriage are not eligible for the reimbursement benefit. Staff are eligible for up to twelve weeks of unpaid parental leave for adoption.
13.	CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY; The Hospital and the Association are committed to a belief that early recognition and intervention of chemicalabuse and dependency are in the best personal and professional interest of the nurse, of the Hospital, and of the public. To this end, chemical dependency shall be treated for all purposes under this Contract as a personal illness. A. Chemical Dependency Evaluation: If the Hospital has reasonable cause to believe that a nurse is chemically dependent, or the Hospital had documentation of counseling the nurse regarding previous behavior patterns, the Hospital will refer the nurse to the Hospital Employee Assistance Program. The nurse may, in the alternative, elect to secure a required evaluation by a professional qualified in chemical dependency of the nurse's choice. A nurse may be placed in a paid leave of absence status for work time lost during a period of investigation, chemical dependency assessment, or in the period during which the results of a drug or alcohol test are pending in instances where it is believed to be in the best interest of patient care for the nurse not to continue in active ' on-duty status. The foregoing is subject to a maximum of five (5) days of paid leave. Unless declined by the nurse, the Hospital will make a referral of the nurse to the Minnesota Nurses Association's Peer Support Program for Nurses. The nurse will also be given written information concerning the Peer Support Program and encouraged to initiate personal contact with this Program. B. Drug and/or Alcohol Testing: Any Hospital that elects to engage in drug and/or alcohol testing for registered nurses shall provide sixty (60) days' notice to the Association and shall provide the Association with copies of (1) Supervisory Guidelines for Drug and
32
Alcohol Testing of Employees in Reasonable Suspicion Cases, (2) Hospital Guidelines for Post-Treatment Program Testing for Alcohol and Drugs, and (3) behavioral observation checklists for use by supervisors. Other relevant information concerning the drug and alcohol testing process will be available to the Association upon request. The policy under which such testing is conducted is that policy which has been agreed upon between the Association and the Hospitals and is incorporated into this Agreement as Appendix B. That policy shall not be changed during the term of this Contract except by the express written mutual agreement of the parties.
No drug or alcohol testing will be requested by the Hospital solely based on a pattern of previous workplace behaviors. A request to the nurse to take a drug or alcohol test as part of an assessment may be made only in the event of observable work-related behavior that is documented at the time the request is made^ A decision to request a test from a nurse shall be made by two non-bargaining unit Hospital representatives who have received training regarding implementation of the Hospital’s Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy, except where only one such person is available. Under normal circumstances, the request for testing will not be attended by Hospital security personnel. .
At the time that a request for a drug or alcohol test is made, the Hospital will advise the nurse in writing of her or his rights to the presence of an Association representative, and if the nurse so chooses, will make a prompt, reasonable effort to secure a representative for the nurse, and will document those efforts.
The occurrence of a workplace accident or injury will not be considered reasonable cause for testing unless the accident, injury, or the circumstances surrounding either, is significant rather than routine.
C.	Treatment: If, following an assessment or evaluation, it is recommended that the nurse receive treatment for chemical dependency, she or he may use the benefits provided by Section 10, Sick Leave, Section 15 A., Personal Illness, Injury and Disability, and Section 30 A. and B., Insurance Benefits. At conclusion of the leave, the nurse will be returned to work in a position as provided in Section 15 A.; except that a nurse shall not be returned to a position on a chemical dependency treatment unit until completion of two (2) years of being chemically free. This nurse will be returned to a position of like classification, hours, and pay, and may return to the first available position on the chemical dependency treatment unit after the two (2) year period has passed.
D.	Return to Work: The conditions of the individual nurse's return to work shall be jointly developed by the nurse, Hospital representatives, and unless declined by the nurse, Association representatives. A professional involved in a nurse's treatment program may also participate. An agreement setting forth return to work conditions shall be in writing and shall be retained for protection of the nurse's rights under this Contract. This return to work agreement may include the testing for drugs and alcohol without prior notice for a period of up to a maximum of two years during and following any referral for chemical dependency counseling or treatment.
The Hospital may notify the Minnesota Board of Nursing in instances where the nurse exhibits behaviors suggesting chemical dependency. The Hospital will fully cooperate with any conditions of practice imposed by the Board of Nursing and with requirements
33
for supervision and reporting made by the Board. The Hospital will continue the nurse in leave of absence status during any period in which the nurse's license to practice is under suspension.
E.	Discipline: A nurse shall not be disciplined solely for being chemically dependent nor will a nurse be disciplined solely for refusing a request for which there is not reasonable ' cause for requesting the test. A nurse may, however, be subject to discipline for action related to the chemical dependency. Any such discipline shall be for just cause as provided in Section 19 and shall include consideration of all relevant facts including the relevant facts of the symptoms of chemical dependency. The Hospital will agree to defer any investigatory and disciplinary meetings with the nurse until it is determined, in consultation with the treatment professionals, that the nurse is able to fully participate on her or his own behalf.
F.	Confidentiality: Any referral and related records and discussions of the Peer Support Program, the Hospital, the Hospital's Employee Assistance Program (including any agency with whom the Hospital contracts for employee assistance) shall be completely confidential and not disclosed without authorization of the nurse. Throughout ail steps of the drug or alcohol testing procedure, the right to confidentiality of the nurse will be maintained. Information provided by the nurse at the time a request for testing is made may not be disclosed except as permitted by law, or used for any purpose other than evaluating the propriety of testing for drugs and alcohol and evaluating the testing results. A specially trained physician utilized by the Hospital to evaluate positive test results, whether employed by the Hospital or an outside source, shall only report to the Hospital the physician's determination whether or not the positive test results are explainable for reasons other than drug or alcohol use and, if requested, the level of drugs or alcohol present in the sample. Information upon which the physician bases this determination shall be available only to the physician and the nurse. By written authorization, the nurse may agree to release the information to a specified Association representative.
G.	Training for Designated MNA Representatives: The Hospital shall make the training program it provides to "trained supervisors" or "trained resource persons" prior to implementation of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy available to MNA designated members, or provide a similar training program to MNA designated members. In either event, the training program shall be made available for up to twenty MNA designated members at each Hospital. The training will be provided on work time and at no cost to the nurse.
The Hospital will advise the Association if subsequent training concerning the Hospital's Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy is provided to its "trained supervisors" or "trained resource persons," and the Association may designate up to twenty (20) members per Hospital who did not receive the prior training to attend. The Association will provide to the Hospital the names of its members who have received training provided by the Hospital and who may be contacted by a registered nurse in conjunction with a request for drug or alcohol testing.
Any controversy arising over Hie interpretation or application of this provision shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of Section 27, Grievance Procedure.
34
H.	Information Requests: The Hospital shall provide to the Association summary information regarding the number of nurses tested, the number of positive tests and the reasons giving rise to the testing. Such information will be provided in such a way to not disclose the identity of the nurses tested. The Hospital will also provide such information with respect to a grievant whose alleged drug or alcohol use or abuse is the subject of a grievance or arbitration proceeding, upon receipt of a written authorization to this effect from the grievant. The Hospital will provide employee information which is relevant and necessary to the Association for the proper performance of its duties as bargaining agent, to the extent such information does not violate the confidentiality and privacy safeguards of applicable laws.
14.	HEALTH PROGRAM:
A.	Employment and Annual Physical: A physical examination including chest X-ray, Mantoux test, if indicated, will be given a nurse within one (1) week of her or his employment and repeated annually without cost to the nurse. The nurse will be given a report of the examination and a confidential record will be kept by the Hospital.
B.	Hepatitis B Vaccinations: The Hospital will provide, without cost to the nurse, Hepatitis B vaccine to all nurses desiring such vaccine. A nurse will not be required to get such vaccine through her or his personal physician or health clinic. Following completion of the vaccination series, the Hospital will, if requested by the nurse, perform a serum antibody titer to verify that immunity has been attained.
C.	Paid Time Off After Exposure to Infectious Agents: A nurse who has suffered an exposure in the workplace to an infectious agent, and as a result is not permitted to work during an incubation period or other period of time as determined by the Hospital or other agency, shall be kept whole for loss of salary and benefits including pension and seniority. The nurse will not be required to use her or his sick leave during this period of absence from work.
D.	Exposure to Blood or Body Fluids: Following a job-related exposure to blood or body fluids, the Hospital will provide, upon request of and without cost to the affected nurse, screening for AIDS. Such screening shall be done by a reputable independent laboratory and confidential results shall be provided to the nurse. Results shall not be a part of the nurse's personnel or employee health record.
Any policy developed by the Hospital relating to the post-exposure management of blood-borne disease shall be consistent with the following:
(1)	The affected nurse shall be responsible to notify the designated department or personnel as soon after the exposure as is feasible. If consent to test from the patient has not been previously obtained, the Hospital policy shall identify the individual or position of the individual responsible to attempt to obtain consent from the patient who was the source of the exposure. The exposed nurse shall not be required to attempt to obtain the consent.
(2)	If the HIV or HBV status of the source patient is not known, consent and testing shall be accomplished as soon as possible.
35
(3)	Testing of the nurse for HIV and HBV antibodies shall be voluntary except as may be required by law. The confidentiality of the exposed nurse will be maintained at all steps throughout the procedure set forth in the policy. All laboratory work will be obtained, tested, and reported in such a manner that the identity of the exposed nurse is protected to the maximum extent. Test results will be communicated promptly to the exposed nurse, and any result will be communicated privately.
(4)	If the source patient is determined to be HIV positive, refuses to be tested, is high risk, or is unknown, follow-up testing shall be made pursuant to CDC guidelines.
(5)	The policy and any procedure developed for its implementation shall recognize the potential for significant stress associated with the exposure. The affected nurse shall receive the same support and consideration as would be provided to any other patient or client of the Hospital.
(6)	The policy shall provide for presentation of information relating to treatment options available. The nurse will be advised at the time of reporting of the exposure of her or his right to utilize the nurse's personal physician.
15.	LEAVE OF ABSENCE:
A.	Personal Illness, Injury and Disability: A leave of absence without pay will be granted to nurses for personal illness, injury or disability (including work related illness, injury or disability) for a maximum period of twelve (12) months.

A nurse on a personal illness, injury or disability leave and receiving workers' compensation may agree to accept a temporary alternate position different from the nurse's previous position. Agreement to such alternate position shall not constitute a forfeiture of the nurse's right to return to her or his previous position or classification as provided in this Section 15 A.
Except as provided in Section 15 A. (4), all hours worked by a nurse covered by this Contract in a temporary alternate employment position not otherwise covered by this

The Hospital will not permanently fill the nurse’s position during the period of leave of absence.
C.	Bereavement Leave: A leave of absence of three (3) days without loss of pay will be granted to nurses in case of death in the immediate family (parents, parents-in-law, brothers, brothers-in-iaw, sisters, sisters-in-law, sons, daughters, grandparents, grandparents-in-law, grandchildren, husbands, wives, stepparents, stepsons, stepdaughters, qualified domestic partners, dependent members of the nurse’s household and such others as may be agreed upon between the nurse and the Hospital) for the purpose of attending the funeral.

A nurse who desires to return to a different position at the conclusion of the leave must make such request at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of the leave.
This subparagraph D. shall be fully applicable in instances of adoption.
E.	Jury Duty and Subpoenaed Witnesses: A nurse called to serve on a jury, or subpoenaed to serve as a witness in any court on a subject arising out of the nurse's employment at the Hospital, shall be reimbursed for the difference between the amount paid for such service (exclusive of travel pay) and her or his compensation for regularly scheduled work hours necessarily lost because of such service.

Upon obtaining such additional degree or completing such practitioner program, and after returning to work at the Hospital granting the educational leave and completing an additional one (1) year of service at such Hospital, the nurse will be given credit for purposes of vacation, length of service and salary increments In an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the length of the educational leave. Regular credit will be earned by the nurse for time worked before and after her or his educational leave of absence.
G.	Voluntary Leaves Before Layoff: Before resorting to any layoff procedure, the Hospital will offer the nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request leaves of absence without pay of not more than ninety (90) calendar days. During such leave of absence, vacation and length of service rights shall continue to accrue. The Hospital will not permanently fill the nurse's position during the period of leave of absence.
H.	Military Leave of Absence: A nurse who is a member of the military reserve shall be granted leaves of absence without pay to enable the nurse to fulfill obligations for one weekend per month plus two weeks per calendar year (or the equivalent time) for temporary military duty. The nurse may be offered the opportunity to, but may not be required to, work extra unscheduled weekend shifts in place of normally scheduled
38
	weekend shifts missed because of military duty. A nurse electing to do so will be entitled to the weekend bonus. In addition, a nurse who serves on active duty and who returns to work within ninety (90) days after discharge from military service will be returned to her or his previous position or to the position of like classification and pay to which the nurse would have been entitled but for the absence due to military duty. The nurse will be credited with hours towards benefits, including seniority and pension, and length of service salary increments for the period of active duty (including the ninety (90) days post discharge) based on the authorized number of hours per payroll period, or the average number of hours worked per payroll period during the thirteen (13) payroll periods preceding the active duty, whichever is greater.

J.	Association Activities: Leaves of absence without pay of reasonable duration shall be provided nurses for the purpose of attending meetings, conferences and conventions of the Association on a local, district, state or national level. The number of nurses attending such functions shall not exceed a reasonable number at any one time and the granting of such leaves shall be predicated on the Hospital's staffing requirements.

During the period of leave, the hospital may permanently fill the nurse's vacated position. Upon return from leave, the nurse will be given the first opportunity to return to his/her former position, if open and available. If the former position is no longer available, the returning nurse can apply for any open position for which he/she is qualified.
16.	LOW NEED DAYS AND LAYOFF:
Reduction of registered nurse staff may be made only in the event of a diminished number of needed nursing care hours. Unanticipated declines in patient needs may result in the need to temporarily reduce hours, but it is recognized by the parties that the basic policy shall be to use the layoff procedures of this Contract to accomplish staff reductions when a reduction in patient needs is reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time. Non
39
bargaining unit personnel shall not be utilized to replace any bargaining unit nurse whose hours are so reduced.
A.	Definitions: As used in this Section 16, the following terms shall be defined as follows:
(1)	"Clinical Group" means a unit or group of units which require similar nursing skills.
(2)	"Qualified" means the ability to independently provide safe, direct patient care for the standard case load on the unit within a reasonable period of orientation not to exceed four (4) weeks; but said term does not require proficiency in all technical skills or the performance of leadership roles.
(3)	"Seniority" means the total compensated hours accrued by a nurse since her or his most recent date of employment into the bargaining unit at the Hospital. Compensated hours, as qualified in this paragraph, shall include all hours for which a nurse is paid. Each overtime hour worked shall be counted as one (1) compensated hour. Off-premises on-call shall be counted at the conclusion of each W2 year at the rate of one-fourth (1/4) of the on-call hours paid. In addition, compensated hours shall include hours which Section 15, Leave of Absence, subparagraphs A., D., E., G. and I. provide are hours worked or hours for which length of service increments accrue.
The above notwithstanding, seniority for a nurse who transfers to a non-supervisory and non-managerial nursing position that is not covered by the Contract Agreement and is in the same hospital in which the nurse is employed in a bargaining unit position, shall accrue no further seniority. The nurse's accrued seniority shall be maintained on the nurse's record and shall be restored to the nurse if she or he transfers back to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year. The nurse may not exercise frozen seniority for any purpose under this Contract while in the non-bargaining unit position. If the nurse does not return to a bargaining unit position within one (1) year from the date of the transfer out of the bargaining unit, all bargaining unit seniority is lost.
A revised and up-to-date listing of the seniority for each nurse in the bargaining unit will be posted by the Hospital each six (6) months and provided to the Minnesota Nurses Association.	‘
B.	Voluntary Low Need Davs and Leave: Before resorting to Part D. of this Section or any layoff procedure, the Hospital will offer the full-time and part-time nurses an opportunity to voluntarily request a low need leave of absence without pay for up to ninety (90) calendar days. The Hospital will not permanently fill the nurses' position. In addition, the Hospital may, on a day-to-day basis offer individual low need days to full-time and part-time nurses. A nurse taking low need days pursuant to Parts B. and D. of this Section shall be given credit toward all benefits provided by this Contract and the Pension Plan for the hours lost.
C.	Floating in Lieu of Mandatory Low Need Davs: If additional low need reductions are needed, nurses will be given the opportunity to float to available assignments in other units for which they are oriented or otherwise qualified.
40
D.	Mandatory Low Need Davs: If additional reductions are indicated, low need days shall be taken by the least senior regularly scheduled part-time nurse scheduled for the particular unit and shift where the reduction is necessary.
No regulady scheduled part-time nurse shall be required by the Hospital to take more than three (3) low need days per Contract year. If the least senior part-time nurse on a particular unit and shift has been assigned three (3) low need days, the next least senior part-time nurse scheduled for the particular unit and shift may be assigned the low need day. In any case, the total of low need days under Part D. of this provision shall not exceed three (3) per Contract year for any regularly scheduled part-time nurse.
A part-time nurse regularly scheduled for sixty-four (64) compensated hours or more per pay period shall be considered as a full-time nurse for purposes of this Section and shall not be assigned low need days. A nurse to be assigned a low need day pursuant to this Part D. shall be given a minimum of two (2) hours advance notice before the beginning of the shift.
Casual pan-time or temporary nurses shall not be assigned to work on units for which the nurse receiving low need days is oriented or otherwise qualified. Part-time nurses having hours reduced shall be given first opportunity for subsequent additional work hours that may become available to replace work hours lost.
E.	Layoff: A layoff is activated when a nurse is unable to match his/her scheduled hours and unit. A unit is defined by Layoff and Recall Guidelines. In the event that it is necessary to lay off nurses due to lack of work, the least senior nurse(s) in the employ of the Hospital shall be laid off first. The layoff shall continue in order of least seniority toward most seniority until the needed reduction in nursing care hours has been accomplished. Any reduction in the number of scheduled hours shall be considered a layoff except as provided in paragraphs B. and D. above. It is specifically agreed that less senior nurses are to be completely laid off before more senior nurses are to be affected by a layoff except as expressly provided as follows:
(1)	It is agreed that the operation of this Section 16 shall not have the effect of depriving patients of needed nursing service. A nurse may be retained out of seniority, however, only if nurses with greater seniority do not have the ability to become qualified.
(2)	A reduction of hours rather than a complete layoff may be used if necessary to provide appropriate coverage for weekends or for operating rooms, visits or procedures. Reductions shall be made by reducing the hours of the least senior nurse remaining on the unit to thirty-two (32) hours per pay period and proceeding in that manner in reverse order of seniority until the necessary reduction has been achieved. Reductions in reverse order of seniority to less than thirty-two (32) hours may be made at the discretion of the Hospital.
Before effecting a reduction of nursing care hours on any unit, all nurses shall be offered voluntary leaves of absence as provided in Section 15 G. of this Agreement. In effecting a reduction of nursing care hours on one or more units, the Hospital shall use
41
a system whereby all affected nurses in order of greater seniority shall be offered all of the following choices:
(11) Vacant positions for which they are qualified.
(22) Qualified nurses will be given the opportunity to choose two (2) of the following three (3) options: FTE, shift, and/or unit. She/he will be offered positions reflecting this choice.
(33) Nurses may accept complete layoff and retain full rights to recall.
A nurse displaced by a more senior nurse under (22) and (33) above would then, in seniority order, be offered option (11) through (33).
In exercising seniority rights under steps (11), ( 22), and (33) the nurse will be offered a position for which qualified according to the step selected, such position to be determined on the basis of the nurse's position preference, greater seniority and the need to minimize multiple displacement of nurses.
Concurrently with the offering of steps (11) through (33), nurses shall be offered the option of accepting reduced hours in their unit. A nurse accepting such reduction shall be considered on layoff and retain all recall rights. Before or at the time a nurse is offered vacancies or replacement opportunities, the nurse will be provided a description of available positions which includes the unit assignment, shifts and number of scheduled hours.
As long as any nurse remains on layoff, the Hospital shall not newly employ nurses into the bargaining unit and shall not transfer or temporarily assign non-bargaining unit nurses into the bargaining unit until all nurses holding recall rights who are qualified shall have been recalled. After a full or partial recall of all qualified nurses on complete layoff who retain recall rights, this provision shall not prevent the new hire of nurses needed to provide appropriate coverage for weekends or for operating rooms, visits or procedures. Such newly hired nurse shall be limited to not more than thirty-two (32) scheduled hours per pay period as long as any more senior nurses on the unit have not been fully restored to her or his number of scheduled hours before layoff.
Scheduled hours on a unit shall not be increased for non laid off nurses without offering such hours to nurses from that unit who are on partial layoff. If a nurse from a unit has been completely laid off, scheduled hours of thirty-two (32) or more per two-week pay period shall not be added for non laid off nurses until nurses on complete layoff have been recalled.
Nurses on layoff who are presently qualified, shall be given first opportunity to work intermittent shifts that are available, before such shifts are offered to casual part-time or non-bargaining unit nurses. To the greatest extent feasible, such shifts shall be offered to nurses on layoff in order of seniority up to but not exceeding the number of scheduled hours per pay period before layoff. Intermittent shifts reasonably expected to occur over a continuing period of time shall not be used in lieu of recall of nurses who retain recall rights. An offer for intermittent shifts shall not be considered a recall.
42
When floating is needed, the Hospital will endeavor to take into consideration a nurse's interest in becoming qualified in another unit of the Hospital.
As part of on-going communication between the Association and the Hospital, the Hospital will notify the Association as soon as it determines that a layoff may occur. The parties will meet to review relevant data and to jointly develop the procedures for applying this Section 16 E. to the specific situation.
A nurse and the Association will be given two (2) weeks’ written notice in advance of any layoff.
Involuntary transfers of nurses shall not be used to circumvent the layoff provisions of this Section 16.	'	.
A nurse who is laid off shall have the right at the time of layoff to receive appropriate prorated vacation with pay upon written request to the Hospital therefore.
A nurse on layoff status who has been benefit eligible and has worked an average of .4 FTE for the first four pay periods following layoff, shall continue on a benefit eligible status so long as she or he continues to work an average of at least .4 FTE per four pay periods either through intermittent shifts or because of recall. In the event that the nurse refuses a recall to a regularly scheduled benefit eligible position for which she or he is qualified, the nurse shall lose the benefit eligible status. Exceptions to the loss of benefit eligible status may be made in cases of extenuating circumstances.
In the event of a pending layoff or major restructuring, in addition to other contractual options, each senior nurse in affected or related clinical areas will be given the option of early retirement with the employer portion of health insurance (single coverage) continued until attainment of age 65. For purposes of this paragraph, senior nurses are defined as nurses (.7 or above FTE) at age 58 or above who have attained the monthly salary increment for twenty (20) years employment.
F. Recall: Notice of recall shall be in writing to a nurse, with simultaneous copy mailed to Minnesota Nurses Association. Recalls shall be in order of seniority with the most senior nurse in layoff status recalled first. Recall shall continue in order of most seniority to least seniority until all nurses have been fully restored to their number of scheduled hours before layoff. A nurse shall be allowed up to one (1) week to report to work after receipt of a notice of recall. A nurse who has been recalled or offered a position different than the position from which the nurse was laid off may accept or reject such different position without loss of recall rights under this Contract Agreement. A different position means either a different unit or shift or number of scheduled hours. A nurse recalled to the same position who declines the offer of recall shall lose all seniority rights.
A nurse unable to respond to notice of recall to the same position due to a reason justifying a leave of absence, shall be transferred to appropriate leave of absence status.
Seniority shall be lost if the nurse is not recalled from layoff within one (1) year. Provided, however, a nurse may have seniority rights extended for an additional period
43
of one (1) year by giving written notice to the Hospital within thirty (30) days before the expiration of the first year of layoff.
17.	JOB PROTECTION. MERGERS AND REDUCTION OF BEDS:
Determinations or actions by a hospital or by a government, community or hospital's agency or agencies which recommend or require the elimination or reduction of patients beds or facilities presently in operation are determinations made and actions taken with the stated intention of serving the welfare of the community. Determinations or actions by a Hospital include actions by parent or affiliates or entities which have the power to effectively direct such determinations or actions in a contracting Hospital. Consequently, it is the policy of the Hospital and Minnesota Nurses Association that determinations made and actions taken to serve the community and patients should not be at the expense of individual registered nurses employed at an affected institution. In the event that such determinations or actions including corporate merger, consolidation, or reorganization of services, directly or indirectly will cause an elimination or a reduction in the number of registered nurses in present, or if greater in future bargaining unit positions in any classification on a station unit, the following principles shall apply:
A.	Notice of Merger, Consolidation or Reorganization: The Hospital shall give the Association written notice of such action or determination immediately upon any notice to the Hospital whether said notice is preliminary, tentative or final. The Hospital will also give the Association immediate written notice of any decision to authorize a corporate merger, consolidation or reorganization of services involving the Hospital. In these connections, the Hospital will cooperate in providing the Association with relevant background information and alternative courses of action available. The individual nurses who will be affected shall receive written notice with a copy to Minnesota Nurses Association as soon as the action to be taken is ascertained.
B.	Offer of Reassignment Within the Hospital: Nurses from an affected area which is being reduced or eliminated shall be offered reassignment, along with other affected nurses, to other vacant or new registered nurse positions in the same classification (an "opening") within the Hospital for which they are reasonably qualified. The term "reasonably qualified means the ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period of orientation and in-house training not to exceed four (4) weeks. Such orientation and training shall be at no cost to the nurse. Reduction of nurses on an affected area and the offering of reassignment in the Hospital shall be made on the basis of seniority in the Hospital as defined In Section 17 of the Agreement.
The Hospital will not promote or employ new nurses or use casual part-time or temporary nurses until all affected nurses have been placed or given the opportunity to qualify for registered nurse openings which are available or become available in their respective classifications. A nurse may voluntarily choose to exercise her or his length of employment rights for an opening in a lower registered nurse classification.
C.	Reductions to Follow Layoff Procedure: If there are not sufficient registered nurse openings to place all nurses employed at the time of the change, or if nurses are not able to qualify for such positions, as the same are described in the foregoing paragraphs, the reduction of registered nurse positions in the Hospital shall be made according to the procedure of layoff and recall established by Section 16, Low Need Days and Layoff.
44
D.	Offer of Employment in Hospitals Controlled by the Same Corporation: if a nurse cannot be offered placement under paragraph B, and C. above, offers for employment , shall concurrently be made by Contracting Hospitals controlled by the same corporate body as the Hospital which employed the nurse who was laid off or who received notice of layoff. Offers of employment under this paragraph D. shall be made during the period that the nurse retains recall rights under Section 16.
Any offer of employment under this paragraph D. shall be treated for all purposes, including seniority, as a transfer within the same Hospital and not a re-employment.
E.	Offer of Employment in Other Contracting Hospitals: If there are not sufficient openings in Contracting Hospitals controlled by the same corporate body, an affected nurse will concurrently be offered employment in the bargaining unit at any other Contracting Hospital which has openings for which the nurse is reasonably qualified during the period in which the nurse retains recall rights under Section 16. Employment of a nurse under the provisions of this paragraph E. shall be with full credit for all length of service credited by the former Hospital employer for purposes of salary, educational increments and vacation eligibility.
The Hospital having the reduction of beds or services shall use its best efforts to assist displaced nurses in finding suitable registered nurse positions with other hospitals or health care facilities. Such efforts shall include continuing investigation of potential job openings and communication with other facilities as to availability, training and experience of affected nurses and advising nurses of such information received.
F.	Negotiation on Application of This Section 17: The parties recognize that the provisions of this Agreement may not fully anticipate the nature of such changes as they are occurring or may occur in the future. It is agreed, therefore, that for any action for which notice may be required under the foregoing paragraph A., Minnesota Nurses Association and the affected Hospital(s) will meet for negotiation and mediation of the application of this Section 17 and relevant Contract provisions to the then instant situation.
Any unresolved dispute arising from such negotiations and mediation will be determined in accordance with the arbitration procedure set forth in Section 27, Grievance Procedure, of this Contract Agreement.
G.	Removal from Bargaining Unit: No action by a Hospital(s) or an affiliated entity shall result in a unit, service or group of nurses being removed from the bargaining unit earlier than thirty (30) days after Minnesota Nurses Association and the nurses to be affected have been provided written notice of the action and any change in Contract coverage the Hospitals) or affiliated entity will effect. The Hospital(s) will cooperate in providing the Association with relevant background information.
H.	The provisions of this Section shall in no way limit, circumscribe, modify, or reduce rights or benefits of a nurse under other sections of this Contract Agreement.
45
I.	At the time of major work place changes, the Hospital will extend to a nurse who is within one (1) year of anticipated retirement, accommodations to allow the nurse to continue her or his same or similar work until retirement.
18.	SCHEDULES AND POSTING:
A,	Posting of Work Schedules: Time schedules shall be posted fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the nurse's scheduled work. The posted schedule of hours shall not be changed without consent of the affected nurse(s).
B.	Requested Additional Hours: A regularly scheduled part-time nurse desiring more work hours may request such additional hours prior to posting of each time schedule. Regularly scheduled part-time nurses so requesting shall be scheduled for available non-overtime and non-weekend-bonus work shifts before such shifts are offered to casual part-time nurses. For nurses working less than sixty-four (64) hours per payroll period, the extra shift(s) shall, with two (2) hours' notice to the nurse, be cancelled prior to the implementation of Section 16 D. but such cancelled shift shall be counted as one of the three (3) allowable low need days.
C.	Posting and Filling of Positions: If a nursing position is or will be open, the Hospital will post on the bulletin board a notice for a period of at least seven (7) days before permanently filling the position. Said notice shall include a listing of the station unit, the number of shifts per payroll period, the shift rotation, the required qualifications for the position and the person to whom to apply.
All job offers shall be made by the Human Resources department only. In addition, Human Resources will contact nurses not selected for positions in person or by telephone. If personal contact is not possible, notification will be in writing within approximately 14 days of the position being filled.
In filling any such bargaining unit position, the primary consideration shall be whether the applicant meets the required qualifications to perform the duties of the open position. The transfer of a nurse to the position for which the nurse has been accepted will be reviewed on an individual basis but shall not exceed a period of 60 calendar days. This period may be extended by mutual agreement between the nurse and the Clinical Director(s) involved. Subject to the foregoing, nurses meeting the required qualifications shall be given preference over nurses not currently employed by the Hospital, and as between nurses employed by the Hospital, preference shall be given to the most senior nurse within the bargaining unit.
19.	DISCIPLINE AND TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT:
No nurse shall be disciplined except for just cause. Except in cases where immediate termination is appropriate, the Hospital will utilize a system of progressive discipline. A nurse's participation in the Economic and General Welfare Program or eligibility for longevity benefits will not constitute just cause for discharge or other discrimination.
If an Oral Warning is given, it shall be confirmed in writing, identified as disciplinary action, and a copy shall be given to the nurse. A copy of any Written Warning shall be given to the nurse and the Hospital shall simultaneously send a copy to the Minnesota Nurses Association. Whether or not a Warning is grieved, a nurse has the right to make a written response which will be maintained by the Hospital with any copy of the Warning.
46
A nurse participating in an investigatory meeting that reasonably could lead to disciplinary action shall be advised in advance of such meeting of its purpose. The nurse shall have the right to request and be granted Minnesota Nurses Association representation during such meeting. At any meeting where discipline is to be issued, the Hospital will advise the nurse of the right to have Minnesota Nurses Association representation at such meeting."
Upon written request of the nurse or the Association, all written documents relating to any oral or written disciplinary warning will be removed from the nurse's personnel file at any time after three (3) years from the date of the most recent incident providing no further warnings or other disciplinary action have been given in the intervening period. Upon request of the nurse, a MNA representative may be present at time requested documents are removed. Warnings and other documents may be removed sooner by mutual agreement between the Hospital and the Association. Once removed items will not be put back in employee file. In no case will a warning which would, if requested, be removed from the nurse’s file be considered in future discipline or in arbitration proceedings.
Demotion from the classification of Assistant Head Nurse to a lower classification for disciplinary reasons, or on the basis of the nurse’s performance, shall be for just cause.
The Hospital will give a nurse two (2) weeks' written notice (exclusive of terminal leave) prior to termination of employment or suspension unless said termination or suspension is for misconduct. Minnesota Nurses Association will be given written notice of any termination or suspension at the same time the affected nurse is given written notice.
The nurse will give the Hospital two (2) weeks' written notice for termination of her or his employment in any event, and a nurse claiming terminal leave will give one (1) month's notice as provided in Section 9.
20.	PROMOTIONS. TRANSFERS AND NEW POSITIONS:
A.	Notice of Promotion or Transfer: The Hospital will give a nurse and Minnesota Nurses Association two (2) weeks' written advance notice of any promotion or transfer out of the bargaining unit. Said written advance notice shall indicate specification of the position from which and to which the nurse will be promoted or transferred. Upon request, the Hospital will promptly provide the Association with the written position description for either such position.
B.	New Non-Executive Position; The Hospital shall give the Association written notice of the establishment of any new non-executive position requiring a registered nurse. Said written notice shall be accompanied by a copy of the position description, whether such description be preliminary or final, and shall be mailed to the Association fourteen (14) days before such position is posted. Said notice will include the Hospital's initial determination as to whether such position will be included in the bargaining unit.
Upon request of either party, the Hospital and Association representatives will meet to discuss and consider the bargaining unit status of the position in question.
Considerations will include, but not be limited to, the relationship of the position to existing bargaining and non-bargaining unit positions and the workability of including the position in the bargaining unit including, but not limited to, compensation, work schedules, and seniority. The Hospital and the Association may make such mutual
47
agreements as they deem appropriate which involve terms and conditions of employment related to identified barriers. In arriving at any agreement which would constitute an exception to the then existing seniority provisions of the Contract Agreement, Minnesota Nurses Association shall establish a process for consultation with the Association leadership of the local facility nurses, and any recommendation by Minnesota Nurses Association after such consultation will be given due consideration by the Hospital in attempting to arrive at an agreement on the seniority matters.
The Hospital agrees to provide the Association with any additional relevant available information.
If the parties are unable to agree on including or not including the new position in the Contract, either party may request the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in any attempt to resolve the issue. If no agreement is reached as a result of the assistance of FMCS, the unit clarification procedure of the National Labor Relations Board may be used by either party.
C.	Notice of New Program or Business Venture: The Hospital, or its parent or affiliate, shall give the Association prompt written notice of any new program or business venture as soon as a decision to initiate the program or venture is made. Such notice shall describe the anticipated registered nurse positions in the new program or venture, and the Hospital's initial determination as to whether such positions will be included in the bargaining unit.
The Hospital, its parent or affiliate, will meet upon request with the Association to explore questions of Association representation. The procedure set forth in the foregoing subsection B. of this Section 20 will be used to process such questions.
D.	Inclusion of Other Nurses in Bargaining Unit: The Hospital will meet with the Association upon request to determine the interest associated with including certain groups of nurses in the bargaining unit. If mutual interests exist, the parties will meet at the local level to apply the process described in the foregoing subsection B. of this Section 20.
21.	JOINT COMMITTEE ON INTERPRETATION:
A.	In order to minimize or avoid dispute over the meaning, interpretation or proper application of the terms of this Agreement, a joint committee of HealthEast and the Minnesota Nurses Association is hereby established to consider any questions of interpretation or application of the terms of this Agreement that may be referred to it.
B.	Committee members will be a designated subcommittee of the HealthEast Labor/Management Committee.
C.	The Committee will meet as necessary to consider any questions of interpretation or application of the terms of this Agreement referred to it. The parties hereto will furnish the clerical and other facilities necessary to type, duplicate and disseminate copies of the determinations of the Committee.
D.	Any party to this Agreement may refer to the HealthEast Labor/Management Committee any questions concerning the meaning, interpretation, construction or
48
	application in any situation, of the terms of this Agreement. Such reference will be in writing and will state the facts involved, if any, and the question at issue as clearly as possible. The HealthEast Labor/Management Committee may require any party to furnish additional information respecting any question referred to it. The committee will render all answers or decisions in writing, and will be delegated through the HealthEast Labor/Management Committee. E.	If the Committee cannot agree upon the proper disposition of any problem referred to it, then the Committee shall promptly notify the parties and refer the problem back to the parties for disposition pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement. F.	If any matter submitted to the Committee involves a grievance, then the time within which such grievance must be submitted to the Hospital pursuant to Section 27, Grievance Procedure, shall not begin to run until the date that the determination of the Committee is communicated to the parties.
22.	INTENT MANUAL: The purpose of the Intent Manual is to provide a history and more detailed understanding of Contract language. The Intent Manual is part of the Labor Agreement and also subject to the Grievance Procedure Article in matters of dispute.
23.	STAFFING ADVISORY COMMITTEE: A Staffing Advisory Committee shall be established in each Hospital. The Committee will consist of members designated by the Hospital and Nursing management, and an equal number of staff nurses and assistant head nurses selected by the bargaining unit. Hospital representatives shall include nursing executives, nursing supervisors and staffing personnel. Hospital administration and Human Resources personnel may be asked by the Committee to participate. Bargaining unit members will be representatives of varied clinical areas. The Committee shall meet monthly and minutes will be kept and made available to staff and assistant head nurses on each station unit. Staff and assistant head nurses selected to serve on this Committee will be paid at straight time for meeting time spent in serving on this Committee. Minnesota Nurses Association staff members may attend and participate, at the request of staff and assistant head nurse members. The purposes of the Committee shall be to review and discuss staffing matters and to provide direct input to Nursing Administration in formulating staffing policies and making staffing decisions. Issues to be covered include, but are not limited to: (1) At each Hospital there shall be maintained and used to determine needed nursing staff, a system of patient classification based on demonstrated patient needs and appropriate nursing interventions. Such system shall provide for the assessment of patient care needs by staff nurses on each station unit. In applying such system equal consideration will be given to immediate needs for staffing based on the judgment of the RN on the station unit. Patient classification system issues to be covered by the Staffing Advisory Committee will include determination and modification of the system, inclusion of nurse judgment as criteria, receipt and review of information describing the process of how the system translates into staffing for nursing care, and a review of the system at least annually.
49
(2)	A review of patient care activities and identification non-nursing functions.
(3)	Scheduling concerns including, but not limited to, holiday and vacation scheduling guidelines, on-call guidelines, floating and overtime concerns.
(4)	Development of a process to utilize “Concern for Safe Staffing Reports” as an acceptable tool to identify and address professional concerns related to staffing and to . improve staffing and scheduling process.
(5)	Define situations when a nurse may be required to work alone on a unit.
(6)	Routinely review the ability of the registered nurses to be released for breaks.
(7)	Monitor the use of outside agency nurses as it affects Registered Nurses.
Specific recommendations on guidelines will be presented to Nursing Administration. A report of the status of action by Nursing or Hospital Administration shall be reported at the following meeting and recorded in the minutes prepared for distribution to the station units.
24. NURSING CARE DELIVERY:
Management will recognize the ethical obligations inherent in the nurse/patient relationship and the accountability and authority of the registered nurse related to her or his individual and autonomous practice within the Nurse Practice Act.
Prior to the start of the shift, the charge nurse will identify a unit plan addressing admits, transfers, discharges, and individual patient needs. The designated nursing supervisor will collaborate with the bargaining unit charge nurse (or equivalent) in planning and overseeing the flow of patients and timing of admits. This collaborative process will include:
•	Evaluation of hospital-wide activity and patient flow
•	Knowledge of community constraints, if applicable (EMTALA, Code Orange, and other legally required admissions or situations)	'
•	Internal emergency situations
Recognizing the Importance of nurses' input into directing their practice, MNA representative, chair, or designee will be identified for participation in existing patient flow committee at each hospital. If no such committee exists, a proper forum will be identified to discuss such matters.
Only a registered nurse will assess, plan, and evaluate a patient’s or client’s nursing care needs.
No nurse shall be required or directed to delegate nursing activities to other personnel in a manner inconsistent with the Minnesota Nurse Practice Act, the standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the ANA Standards of Practice, or Hospital policy. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the individual registered nurse has the autonomy to delegate (or not delegate) those aspects of nursing care the nurse determines appropriate based on her or his assessment.
50
When a nurse is floated to a unit or area where the nurse receives an assignment that she or he feels she or he cannot safely perform independently, the nurse has the right and obligation to request and receive a modified assignment, which reflects the nurse’s level of competence.
The Association and the Hospitals recognize that changes in the health care delivery system have and will continue to occur, while recognizing the common goal of providing safe, quality patient care. The parties also recognize that registered nurses have a right and responsibility to participate in decisions affecting delivery of nursing care and related terms and conditions of employment. Both parties have a mutual interest in developing delivery systems which will provide quality care on a cost efficient basis which recognizes the accountability of the registered nurse in accordance with the Minnesota Nurse Practice Act and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.
The provisions of this Section have been established for the discussion and good faith consideration of the subjects included within the scope of this Section. It is the intent and desire of the parties that mutual agreement be reached on these subjects. If the Committee is unable to reach agreement, a mediator with background and experience in health care matters shall work with the Committee in attempting to find solutions to areas of disagreement. The mediator may be chosen from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or from other sources as the Committee may determine.
There shall be established in each Hospital a joint committee of labor and management representatives. This Committee shall be composed of an equal number of representatives of the Association and the Hospital. There shall be co-chairs-one designated by the Association and one by the Hospital. The senior nursing executive shall be one of the Hospital representatives. The Minnesota Nurses Association chairperson of the bargaining unit shall be one of the Association representatives. Association representatives selected by the bargaining unit to serve on this Committee shall be paid at straight time for meeting time spent in serving on this Committee.
This Committee shall meet on a regular basis to consider issues of mutual interest to the Hospital and the Association as may be agreed upon by the parties. The Committee may appoint a task force as it deems appropriate. Such task force shall include staff nurses with knowledge and expertise in a particular subject being considered. The Committee may also refer issues for consideration to existing Hospital committees. Minutes of meetings of the Committee, minutes of any task force established by the Committee, and minutes of internal Hospital committees, including committees at department levels or unit levels, that relate to the type of changes referred to in paragraph A. and B. below, shall be routinely shared with all members of the Committee. The Committee will have two areas of focus:
A.	Authority of Committee: The Committee, through use of a joint decision-making process, has the authority and accountability to specify the role implementation of the registered nurse in the patient care delivery system of the organization and the application of the nursing process in that delivery of patient care.
The scope of the Committee’s work in this area may include, but not be limited to, the development of a data set to understand patient outcomes related to nursing care. In addition, the Committee will consider utilization of evidence-based nursing research findings to evaluate current practices, introduce innovations in practice and create an environment to facilitate excellence. In the event of a dispute regarding changes in the
51
role of the registered nurse or the application of the nursing process, changes will not be implemented until conflict resolution process is observed.
B.	Changes in the System for Delivery of Nursing Care: If the Hospital is considering a change affecting the system for delivery of patient care that may affect how the nurses practice, the environment of practice, the interaction with assistive personnel, or the interface with other department and disciplines, it will notify the Committee in a timely and proactive manner. The parties will jointly review, discuss, and consider possible consultants to work with the Hospital and bargaining unit nurses regarding any changes in the system for delivery of nursing care, use of assistive personnel, or job responsibility of the registered nurse. Upon receipt of the notice referred to, the Committee shall review, discuss, and analyze the change for which the notice was given. If the Committee, upon exploration of the issue, identifies that changes proposed will impact implementation of the role of the registered nurse or application of the nursing process to delivery of patient care, it is the intent that those aspects will be considered under the guidelines in subsection 23 A. above. The Hospital shall provide the Committee relevant information necessary to evaluate the impact of any proposed change being considered and to make any recommendations relating thereto. The Committee will jointly analyze proposed changes and consider possible options to work with the parties regarding the change. The Committee will jointly review plans for evaluation of changes proposed.
C.	Staffing Adequacy: The Care Delivery Committee will review:
(1)	Trends for all Concern for Safe Staffing forms on a quarterly basis.
(2)	Data gathered related to patient acuity such as nurses' evaluation of staffing adequacy.
(3)	Census trends.
(4)	Other data as deemed necessary.
(5)	Any nurse's appeal to the Care Delivery Committee if he/she feels a Concern for Safe Staffing has not been adequately addressed.
The Care Delivery Committee will pursue the feasibility of an acuity-based staffing system.
Definition: Staffing adequacy is not simply measured by applying numbers and ratios, but rather by evaluating a constellation of factors. HealthEast Hospitals (the Employer) and the Minnesota Nurses Association Registered Nurses Bargaining Unit (MNA) agree on the shared goal of a safe, compassionate care experience, that is cost effective and high quality for all patients that the Hospital services. Both are committed to develop an atmosphere that fosters mutual decision-making. Nursing leadership believes that nursing judgment supersedes projected calculations. This belief, however, is best supported when staff trust that their input is valued by leadership and leadership trusts that the bedside nurses' assessment of patient or family needs is valid. Open communication fosters consensus. Cooperative relationships between management and the Registered Nurses will be strengthened through the Staffing Advisory Committee. The intent of this committee is to develop a framework ensuring that the Staff Nurse voice is heard regarding staffing needs.
As we focus on staffing needs the following factors may trigger further discussion/investigation. They include, but are not limited to:
52
(1)	The number of admissions, transfers and discharges per shift, per day, per month.
(2)	Inability to meet approved staffing grids on a regular basis.
(3)	Greater than a 15% increase or decrease in patient/surgicat volume for a period of one month.
(4)	A change in patient assignment throughout the shift resulting in assessments not completed in required time and failure to advance the plan of care or complete documentation.'
(5)	25% of staff working greater than 30 minutes of overtime on a particular shift on
a regular basis.
(6)	Inability to find adequate staff to fill core shifts.
(7)	Increased trends in medication errors and falls.
(8)	Increased vacancy or turnover rates greater than 15%.
(9)	A pattern of increasing need for Voluntary Low Need Days, or need for Mandatory Low Need Days.
(10)	RN to patient ratio at maximum level on the grid, and expected to absorb additional patients at least 50% of the time.
(11)	Increase in patient or family concerns for a particular unit.
(12)	Increase in RN work related injuries.
Once a trigger has been identified, the following guidelines may be used for further investigation, either with the Clinical Manager/Director or SAC, as appropriate;
(1)	Staffing adequacy completed for one month with results reviewed at SAC.
(2)	The appropriate data will be collected and reviewed based on the problem identified.
(3)	Assess patient needs and determine if variances are needed from the normal staffing pattern or patient assignments. Staffing adjustments can be made based on professional judgment by the nursing staff in collaboration with nursing leadership to best meet patient needs.
Any plan for change will include joint measures to determine their effectiveness and a time frame for evaluation, indicators of effectiveness will be jointly developed, and will include staff satisfaction; financial impact and patient care quality. A report of these conclusions will be made to the Care Delivery Committee.
The Hospital will make reasonable and continuing efforts to minimize the need for bargaining unit nurses to perform non-nursing functions supportive to nursing care such as housekeeping, dietary, clerical functions or the transport of supplies or stable patients.
Pilot programs involving the type of changes referred to in paragraph A. and B. that are being discussed shall be reviewed and considered prior to the initiation of the program. An evaluation of the pilot program shall be submitted to the joint committee prior to the extension or further continuation of the pilot program.
By mutual agreement, the functions of Staffing Advisory Committee and other committees as deemed appropriate may be merged with the Joint Committee for Nursing Care Delivery.
53
The Committee shall have no power to modify the terms of the Agreement nor to adjust grievances.
25.	ORIENTATION:
The Hospital and the Association agree that a planned systematic method of orientation to familiarize a newly employed or permanently transferred registered nurse will enhance the quality of patient care. There shall be an orientation program provided which shall be specified in writing and individualized based on the nurse's needs assessment, experience, and unit specific competencies and position requirements. To that end, the following shall apply:
(1)	Length of orientation shall be based on the nurse's experience and specific competencies.
(2)	Whenever feasible, orientation shall be conducted by the same person(s).
(3)	Determination of how an orientee's patient care assignment is counted toward staffing needs of a unit shall be based on the orientee's demonstration of specified competencies. Determination of how the preceptor is counted toward staffing needs shall be based on the orientee's demonstration of specified competencies.
(4)	A nurse shall not be placed in any charge nurse position until the nurse has demonstrated the competencies which have been specified for that charge nurse position.
26.	ASSESSMENT:
A.	Newly employed nurses will have a ninety (90) calendar day assessment period beginning on their first day of employment. Assessment period is defined as an ongoing evaluation of the progress toward functioning independently and demonstrating the specified competencies. The assessment evaluation will be performed by the appropriate manager and include specific input by the preceptor(s).
B.	If at any time during the ninety (90) day assessment period it is recognized that the Registered Nurse is not progressing towards completed specified competencies a conference will be held to discuss concerns. An improvement plan with goals and a timeline will be developed and reviewed. Upon request of the nurse, an MNA representative may be present.
C.	If it is determined that the nurse is not meeting the needs of the position he/she will be offered reassignment if an open position is available for which he/she may be qualified within four (4) weeks orientation.
D.	If no such position is available the nurse will be terminated and offered career guidance.	.
E.	This termination would not be subject to the just cause provisions of the contract.
27.	HEALTH AND SAFETY:
54
A.	Safety Policy: It shall be the policy of the Hospital that the safety of the nurses, the protection of work areas, the adequate education, and necessary safety practices, and the prevention of accidents are a continuing and integral part of its everyday responsibility. Further, the Hospital is committed to providing employees a work environment that is free from hostile, abusive, and disrespectful behavior.
It shall also be the responsibility of all nurses to cooperate in programs to promote safety to themselves and to the public, including participation on committees, and compliance with rules promulgated to promote safety and a violence-free workplace. This nurse responsibility shall include the proper use of all safety devices in accordance with recognized safety procedures.	.
B.	Equipment and Facilities: The Hospital will make reasonable effort to provide nurses with safe and adequate equipment, working environment and facilities.
C.	Infectious or Contagious Disease: Where infectious or contagious diseases are diagnosed or suspected, upon request of the Association, representatives of the Hospital shall meet promptly with the Association representatives to determine what step, if any, are necessary to safeguard the health and safety of the nurses, as well as the patients. A registered nurse who may be at risk of exposure to an infectious agent or agents as the result of responsibilities for the care of a patient shall be informed of that patient’s diagnosis or possible diagnosis by the Hospital according to the Hospital policy and procedure.
D.	Nursing Health and Safety Committee: A Nursing Health and Safety Committee will be established as a component part of the Hospital's basic Health and Safety Committee. The Nursing Health and Safety Committee shall consist of an equal number of representatives designated by the Hospital and designated by the bargaining unit. The Committee shall consider and develop recommendations on health and safety matters of particular concern to registered nurses, including but not limited to infectious diseases, chemical hazards, security and physical safety, radiation and education. The Hospital will cooperate in providing the Nursing Health and Safety Committee with relevant background information. Recommendations will be sent to the Hospital Health and Safety Committee for action. If those recommendations are not implemented, the Committee may bring the matter to the attention of the Chief Nurse Executive.
In addition to providing access to and copies of the OSHA 200 records and First Report of Injury forms as required by Statute or Rule and Regulations, the Hospital will furnish copies of its Right to Know plan and its over-all AWAIR plan.
E.	Physical Violence and Verbal Abuse: Each facility will have a trained response team(s) which will respond to all emergency situations where physical violence, the threat of physical violence, or verbal abuse occurs. A process will be developed to record and report these incidents of a non-emergency nature. These records will be evaluated by the Nursing Health and Safety Committee when the situation involves a registered nurse.
Employers will encourage registered nurses who are victims of assault in the workplace to recognize the potential emotional impact and offer counseling or other delayed stress debriefing.
55
In addition, a registered nurse who has been assaulted at work and is unable to continue working will be given the opportunity to be free from duty without loss of pay for the remainder of that shift.
28.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE:
The Hospital and Minnesota Nurses Association desire that each registered nurse have a means by which grievances may be given timely, fair and continued consideration until resolved. In order to facilitate confidence in this procedure, a nurse shall not be subject to criticism or reprisal for using the grievance procedure.
A grievance shall be defined as any controversy arising over the interpretation of or the adherence to the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
A.	Step 1. The nurse will informally discuss the grievance with the nurse's first level supervisor above an assistant head nurse.
B,	Step 2. If the grievance is not resolved at the time of the Step 1 informal discussion, it shall be reduced to writing and submitted to the Hospital's Personnel Department. The written grievance must be submitted to the Hospital within twenty (20) work days after the date of occurrence. A grievance relating to pay shall be timely if received by the Hospital within twenty (20) work days after the pay day for the period during which the grievance occurred.
Within twenty (20) work days after submission of the written grievance to the Hospital, a meeting to consider the grievance shall be held among representatives of the Hospital, the Association and the nurse.
The Director of Nursing Service, or such other non-bargaining unit person from the Nursing Service Department as the Hospital may determine, shall participate in the meeting as one of the representatives of the Hospital.
Within twenty (20) work days following the Step 2 meeting, the Hospital shall submit a written reply to the Association and the nurse.
C.	Step 3. If the grievance is not resolved in Step 2, Mediation will be encouraged but not required prior to arbitration. If the grievance is still not resolved in Step 2, either the Hospital or Association may refer the matter to arbitration. Any demand for arbitration shall be in writing and must be received by the other party within twenty (20) work days following receipt by the Association of the Hospital's written reply to the grievance.
Failure by the hospital to respond to the grievance within the timelines above will result in the process being addressed by the Labor/Management Committee.
The arbitration request shall be referred to a Board of Arbitration composed of one (1) representative of Minnesota Nurses Association, one (1) representative of the Hospital, and a third neutral member to be selected by the first two. In the event that the first two cannot agree upon a third neutral member within an additional five (5) days, such third neutral member shall be selected from a list of five (5) neutral arbitrators to be submitted by the American Arbitration Association.
56
A majority decision of the Board of Arbitration will be final and binding upon the Minnesota Nurses Association, the Hospital and the nurse. The decision shall be made within thirty (30) work days following the close of the hearing. The fees and expenses □f the neutral arbitrator shall be divided equally between the Hospital and the Association.
The Hospital and the Association or the representative of each designated in accordance with Step 3, may waive the requirement of a three-member panel and agree that the arbitration case may be heard and decided by a single neutral arbitrator.

40.	BREAKAGE:
It is not the policy of the Hospital to charge nurses for breakage of Hospital property.

The Hospital's basic policy shall be to use its registered nursing staff to the exclusion of temporary registered nurses from outside agencies except in unavoidable situations where no other means of providing necessary staffing are available.
Such temporary nurses shall be used only as a supplement to and not in lieu of Hospital registered nursing staff. Prior to utilizing a temporary nurse, the Hospital shall take all steps available to cover a shift or partial shift with its own nursing staff. Before making any use of a temporary nurse, the Hospital shall offer each shift or partial shift to the members of its own registered nursing staff who are qualified to perform the work.

If the discovery is first made by the Hospital less than twenty-four (24) hours before the opening, the Hospital shall communicate such offering by telephone calls to the qualified Hospital nursing staff.
No Hospital staff registered nurse will be denied available work because such work would incur overtime premium. A temporary nurse shall be required to have education, prior experience, and adequate advance orientation to the clinical service and station unit in the facility to which assigned to satisfactorily perform as a staff nurse on that station unit.
A temporary nurse shall not be assigned leadership or charge nurse responsibilities but shall be expected to otherwise perform substantially the same functions as Hospital registered nursing staff members.
The Hospital shall insure that there will not be increased assignment of any of its nursing staff to night, evening, holiday or weekend duty as a result of the use of temporary nurse personnel.
The Hospital shall maintain all necessary steps to reduce and minimize reliance on temporary registered nurses from outside agencies. The Hospital, upon request of the Association, will furnish information with respect to the number of day, relief, night, holiday and weekend shifts worked by temporary nurses.
If the Hospital, its parent corporation, or affiliated entity establishes or maintains a common float pool with another Contract Hospital or Hospitals to provide registered nurses to work in bargaining unit positions at any of said facilities, such nurses shall be covered in all respects by the terms and provisions of this Contract Agreement. Seniority and the bargaining unit to which such nurses will be attached will be agreed upon by the parties.
67
42.	LEGALITY:
To the best knowledge and belief of the parties, this Contract Agreement contains no provision which is in violation of Federal or State law or regulation. Should, however, any provision of this Contract Agreement at any time during its life be finally and effectively determined by a court or administrative agency to be inoperative because of any conflict with present or future Federal or State law or regulation, then such provision shall continue in effect only to the extent permitted and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
In the event that any provision of this Contract Agreement is rendered inoperative as described in the foregoing paragraph of this Section, the parties shall enter negotiations for the purposes of insofar as possible retaining the original intent and effect of any provision affected by such law or regulation.

A.	Health and Safety standards will be established taking into consideration workplace assessments set forth in the Action Plan related to this issue. Data and resources from NIOSH, Occupational Health Organizations, and recognized standards and guidelines identified by the parties may be considered. Over the first year of the Contract, both parties will work aggressively to mutually identify and prioritize areas based on relevant data which the parties have collected, analyzed, and evaluated. Over the second year of this Contract and based on the data, appropriate standards and engineering controls will be mutually developed and implementation begun in a concerted and mutual desire to reduce workplace injury and illness.
B.	The Hospital and the Association have identified shared interests that relate to maintaining an injured, ill or disabled nurse’s ability to continue meaningful productive work in a professional role which accommodates the nurse's disability and/or restriction(s). To that end, the parties further agree to the following:
1.	In all situations where there is a need to make accommodation to disability and/or restriction(s), the nurse will be advised of the nurse’s right to Minnesota Nurses Association representation. If the nurse rejects representation it will be documented in writing and signed by the nurse. A copy of said document will be provided to Minnesota Nurses Association before any scheduled meeting. If representation is rejected, the Hospital will, nonetheless, review options for accommodation with the Minnesota Nurses Association in order to facilitate mutual problem solving and consistency prior to a decision in all situations.
2.	The Association will be provided with all relevant information requested related to the accommodation of the Registered Nurse. Medical information will be released subject to written authorization of the nurse. Consistent with their status as employer and bargaining representative, respectively, the Hospital and the Minnesota Nurses Association will respect any confidential information being considered or disclosed.
3.	Nurses will be accommodated on an individual basis, with a focus on the nurse’s ability, rather than disability.
4.	In evaluating the ability to accommodate a disability and/or restriction(s), the Hospital will not rule out increasing the number of staff scheduled on a unit as a method of achieving accommodation.
5.	As part of these discussions and upon request of the Hospital, Minnesota Nurses Association will waive the posting requirements of Section 17, Schedules and Postings, relative to selected new or existing open positions which would allow the Hospital to accommodate a nurse who is currently a member of the bargaining unit in a bargaining unit position.
71
6.	A nurse who has not been, or in the future may not be, accommodated in a bargaining unit position, retains bargaining unit seniority for all purposes for as long as the nurse is accommodated outside the bargaining unit. The nurse shall be given preference in returning to any new or existing open bargaining unit position within four (4) years where the nurse is qualified and can be accommodated.	‘
7.	The parties agree to use the processes set forth in Section 26, Health and Safety Section 19, Promotions, Transfers and New Positions, relating to the inclusion of new or existing positions into the bargaining unit for any and all new or existing positions where nurses currently or previously in the bargaining unit have been transferred.
8.	The Hospital and the Association will jointly develop and periodically present education regarding the A.D.A.

BETWEEN
MINNESOTA NURSES ASSOCIATION
AND WOODWINDS HEALTH CAMPUS
May 6, 1998
It is the desire of HealthEast to continue and expand upon Minnesota Nurses Association (“MNA"), emphasizing a spirit cooperation, at the Woodwinds Health Campus (’'Woodwinds"), consistent with the requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.
The following principles and understandings will guide this relationship:
1.	The success of Woodwinds is fully dependent on its people. Hiring and retention of qualified, experienced, and dedicated personnel is essential. It is recognized that the best source of such trained workers is found in the existing employees employed at HealthEast. Therefore, to ensure a fully qualified work force, Woodwinds agrees to give preference in hiring for openings to employees already employed by and/or on layoff at HealthEast at other existing locations. Registered Nurse openings at Woodwinds excluding the list of positions described in attached Exhibit 1, will be posted at current job posting locations within HealthEast.
2.	It is critical for everyone to live this partnership agreement by understanding and demonstrating the characteristics of a healing and innovative care environment which meets the needs and adds value to the community.
3.	The work principles we intend to adopt will support a clinically skilled, diverse work force committed to service excellence and dedicated to developing a market competitive model of care that has been mutually designed and implemented.
4.	In building our current relationship, the parties wish to expand and develop an exemplary Labor/Management relationship which is responsive to the existing health care environment and of all the affected parties. To that end, we will mutually explore and create a new Labor/Management model that promotes:
(a)	the shared vision of the campus;
(b)	the development of new employment opportunities which provide employment security, job satisfaction, and quality outcome;
(c)	meeting the health care needs of the diverse populations in our community by developing systems that are responsive to patient needs and are cost competitive; and (d) minimizing disruption for the employees and our organization.
5.	Woodwinds agrees to recognize the MNA as the bargaining representative of its employees who will be employed at Woodwinds in a bargaining unit more fully described in the attached Exhibit 1. This recognition will comply with the terms and conditions of the National Labor Relations Act and be effective when the MNA achieves majority status as required by law. Majority status may be shown through a variety of methods including a petition, card count, or election. The method will be determined by the MNA. Time parameters for this process will not exceed 90 days of Woodwinds opening unless the parties mutually agree to an extension.
i
74
Recognition would be completed no later than 30 days after the time the MNA presents evidence of majority status,
6.	The parties agree to commence bargaining on terms and conditions to be applicable to registered nurses at Woodwinds, and this bargaining will commence at a time agreed upon by the parties and in compliance with the terms and provisions of the law. The parties will utilize a modified form of the interest based process. In the interim, the parties will research several Labor/Management cooperative and care delivery models and develop hybrid processes tailored to specifically meet our shared needs.
7.	The parties agree to meet, confer and negotiate this Letter of Understanding if state and/or federal laws exist making any part of this Letter of Understanding illegal.

APPENDIX B - DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY
HEALTHEAST HOSPITALS DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING POLICY FOR REGISTERED NURSES
PURPOSE: HealthEast is committed to maintaining a work environment which is free from the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs to protect the health, safety, and well-being of our patients, employees, and visitors. HealthEast has therefore adopted this Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy for Registered Nurses.
POLICY: HealthEast prohibits the use, possession, transfer, and sale of alcohol and/or illegal drugs while working, while on all premises owned or operated by the Hospital, and while operating any Hospital vehicle, machinery, or equipment. It also prohibits reporting for work, and working anywhere on behalf of HealthEast under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs.
Violation of this policy may result in discipline, up to and including discharge. "Illegal drugs'* means controlled substances, and includes prescription medications which contain a controlled substance and which are used for a purpose or by a person for which they were not prescribed or intended.
This policy does not Prohibit: (a) the moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages at Hospital-sponsored events, if any, where the Hospital has authorized alcoholic beverages to be served, and B. the possession of sealed bottles or cans of alcoholic beverages in employee vehicles on Hospital premises so long as this possession would be in compliance with state law if the vehicle were on a public street.	’
VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE: Registered nurses are encouraged to voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol related discipline or proceedings. An individual who does so will be granted needed time off for treatment, rehabilitation, or counseling in accordance with the current Contract Agreement. Registered nurses who voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol related discipline or proceedings will not be discriminated against because of this disclosure nor will any information which is disclosed be used as the sole basis for discipline.
SCOPE: This policy is applicable to all registered nurses of HealthEast and its subsidiaries, except those employees subject to mandatory drug testing by federal law or regulation. Except as to the sale and transfer of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, this policy does not apply to a registered nurse while on Hospital premises solely for the purpose of receiving medical treatment or visiting a person who is receiving medical treatme’nt.
GROUNDS FOR TESTING: Testing will be requested or required only under the circumstances described below. No test will be sought for the purpose of harassing a registered nurse. All tests are conducted by a laboratory licensed by the State of Minnesota and certified by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. No test will be conducted by a testing laboratory owned or operated by a HealthEast Contract Hospital. The laboratory will notify the Hospital only of the presence or absence of controlled substances and their metabolites and/or alcohol in the sample tested.
84
1.	Reasonable Suspicion - A registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo a drug and/or alcohol test if there is a reasonable suspicion that the registered nurse; (a) is under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs, (b) has violated the policy statement above, C. has caused himself/herself or another employee to sustain a personal injury, (d) has caused a work-related accident, or (e) has operated or helped operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work-related accident.
2,	Treatment Program - A registered nurse may be requested to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing if the registered nurse has been referred by a HealthEast Contract Hospital for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation. The registered nurse may be requested or required to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following the referral for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation.
NOTIFICATION: Before requesting or requiring a registered nurse to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing, the Hospital will provide the registered nurse with a copy of this Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy and provide the registered nurse with an opportunity to read the policy.
RIGHT TO REFUSE TO UNDERGO DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING AND THE EFFECT THEREOF; Any registered nurse has the right to refuse to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing. A registered nurse who refuses to be tested or whose behavior present meaningful completion of drug and/or alcohol testing will be subject to discharge or other disciplinary action in conformity with the current Contract Agreement. If a registered nurse refuses to undergo drug and/or alcohol testing, no test will be administered.
RIGHTS IN CASE OF A POSITIVE TEST: If the initial result on the drug and/or alcohol test is positive, the sample which was tested will be subject to a second, confirmatory test. No registered nurse will be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation solely on the basis of an initial test result which is positive.
If the confirmatory test result is also positive the registered nurse may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, in accordance with the current Contract Agreement and the following:
1.	First Positive Test Result on Confirmatory Test - A registered nurse will not be discharged based on a first time positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital unless he or she has been given the opportunity to participate in a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program and has refused to participate or has failed to successfully complete the counseling program.
2.	Subsequent Positive Result on Confirmatory Test - An employee who receives a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital and who has previously received a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital may be discharged, so long as a previous positive result occurred within the three preceding years.
If the result of the confirmatory test is positive, a registered nurse has the right to explain the reasons for the positive test and to request a confirmatory retest of the sample, to be conducted at the registered nurse's expense. Any registered nurse wishing to exercise these rights must do so within five (5) working days. Additional internal appeal mechanisms may be available.
85
If the initial result of the drug and/or alcohol test is negative or the confirmatory test result is negative, the registered nurse is considered to have satisfactorily completed the drug and/or alcohol test.
ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES: A registered nurse who is requested or required to undergo drug testing will be provided with a copy of the test results upon request. A registered nurse who is suspended without pay will be reinstated with back pay if the outcome of the confirmatory test or requested confirmatory retest is negative.
CONFIDENTIALITY: The fact that a registered nurse has been requested or required to take a drug and/or alcohol test, the result of the test, and information acquired in the alcohol and/or illegal drug testing process shall be treated in a manner consistent with the Hospital's treatment of other private, confidential information concerning employees. Voluntary disclosure by a registered nurse of the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol-related discipline or preceding wilt also be treated in a manner consistent with the Hospital's treatment of other private and confidential information concerning employees. This information will not be communicated by the Hospital to individuals inside or outside of the Hospital without the registered nurse's consent except to those who need to know this information to perform their job functions, and as permitted or required by law or regulation.	•

APPENDIX E
INTENT MANUAL
A.	On-Call Duty: During the life of this agreement, a staffing and scheduling sub-committee of the Labor/Management Committee will be called to address on-call Issues, where on-call is part of the work agreement.
HealthEast Call Pav Guidelines - Registered Nurses.
1.	HealthEast has a practice of guaranteeing nurses a minimum of four (4) hours at time and one-half (1%) when called to work while off premises on-call. The time and one-half (1%) rate is paid even though the hours worked may not be considered overtime.
2.	Call-back pay begins when employee arrives at the Hospital (rounded to nearest 15 minutes).
3.	Employees called prior to start of call shift will receive call-back pay even if notified in advance of call shift that they will be needed to work (note exception in guideline 4.) EXAMPLE: A nurse is on call from 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. on Saturday and is notified in advance on Friday that they will be needed to work at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday. Hours worked would be treated as callback and paid at time and one-half (1%) pay rate.
4.	Employees who voluntarily take off premise on-call in lieu of a scheduled shift (instead of voluntary or mandatory low need days) would receive call-back pay if called in to work less than one (1) hour prior to beginning of shift. EXAMPLE: A Maternity Care Center nurse voluntarily takes call from 3:00 p.m.-11:30 p.m. In place of her/his regularly ■ scheduled shift. If called in to work after 2:00 p.m. the nurse would receive call-back pay. If called in to work at or before 2:00 p.m., the nurse would receive regular pay for the 3:00 p.m.-11:30 p.m. shift.
5.	Off premise call pay during call-back: employees do not receive call-back pay and off premise call pay at the same time; off premise on-call hours are reduced by the number of hours of call back paid during the. call period. EXAMPLE: If on call from 11:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m. and nurse is called in to work from 3:00 a.m.- 4:00 a.m., nurse is to be paid four (4) hours call-back pay at time and one-half (1 %) plus four (4) hours off premise on-call pay.
6.	Employees may be required to work full four (4) hours when called in to work up to end of call shift.
7.	Employees who are on-call off premises and are called at home to answer a question are not eligible for call-back pay.
8.	In areas where on-call duty is mandatory, employees are expected to arrive at the Hospital within twenty (20) minutes of the time called to work. Employees are expected to be available for call at the beginning of call shift. EXAMPLE: If on-call shift is 7:00 a.m.-3:30 p.m. a surgery employee may be called at 6:40 a.m. and expected to be at work at 7:00 a.m.
9.	Nurses receive four (4) hours call-back pay for call-back during call shift preceding regularly scheduled shift. EXAMPLE: Nurse is scheduled to be off premise on-call from 11:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m. and is called to work at 5:00 a.m. Nurse then works regular ,
90
scheduled shift from 7:00 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Nurse is to be paid four (4) hours at time and one-half (17) and eight (8) hours of straight time. EXAMPLE: Nurse is scheduled to be off premise on-call from 11:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m. and is called into work at 11:00 p.m., works eight (8) hours and then works regular scheduled shift from 7:00 a.m. - 3:30 p.m. Nurse is to be paid four (4) hours at time and one-half (17z), four (4) hours at double time, and eight (8) hours at straight time. EXAMPLE: Nurse is scheduled to be off premise on-call from 11:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m. and is called in to work at 3:00 a.m., works four (4) hours and then works regular scheduled shift from 7:00 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Nurse is to be paid four (4) hours at time and one-half (1%), and eight (8) hours at straight time.
10.	Voluntary exchange of call hours will not result in additional call backs paid by the Hospital.
11,	Call-back hours cannot exceed number of hours on call. EXAMPLE: A nurse who is on-call from 7:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m. and is called in to work multiple times cannot be paid formore than twelve (12) hours of call-back pay, and off-premises on-call pay.
12.	In areas where on-call duty is part of the nurses work agreement, overtime language will apply for the first hour of a call shift when the call shift immediately follows a worked shift; off premise on-call language will apply when overtime exceeds one (1) hour into the nurses call shift. EXAMPLE: Operating Room Nurse is scheduled to work 7:00 a.m.-3:30 p.m. and to be on-call from 3:30 p.m. -11:00 p.m. Nurse works until 4:00 p.m. Nurse is paid eight (8) hours at straight pay and one-half (1/2) hour at time and one-half 114). EXAMPLE: Operating Room Nurse is scheduled to work 7:00 a.m. -3:30 p.m. and is scheduled to be on-call from 3:30 p.m. -11:00 p.m. Nurse works until 5:00 p.m. Nurse is paid eight (8) hours of straight pay and four (4) hours at time and one-half (114). This situation is treated as a call back even though the nurse did not leave hospital premises.
B.	Health Plans: A permanent subcommittee of the Labor/Management Committee will be commissioned to deal specifically with issues that develop during the life of this Contract Agreement regarding all the Health Insurance Plans. Part of the initial charge of this committee will be to provide education regarding the benefit and cost differences of all the Health Care Plans that exist.
C.	Sick Leave: The Hospital agrees to send a quarterly statement to each nurse that indicates available sick time balance and seniority hour accrual. Nurses will receive this statement through inter-office mail. The quarterly statement may be discontinued when the hospital provides the information electronically. Accessibility concerns should be directed to Human Resources.
D.	Flexible Scheduling Options:
1.	HealthEast and Minnesota Nurses Association have agreed to address recruitment and retention issues by focusing on flexible scheduling options to include some or all of the following:
-	Partnered positions (splitting a 14 day schedule).
-	Shared positions (split 1 F.T.E.).
-	12 hour shifts with every third weekend.
-	Shorter shifts to meet personal needs.
-	Flexible start times.
91
-	7 days on / 7 days off schedules.
-	Shared positions between facilities.
-	Seasonal employees,
-	Employees serving as vacation relief.
-	Short term incentives for off-shift fill-in.
Following R.N. survey data, upon receipt of H-works recommendations, and with staff Registered Nurse input, plans, as appropriate, will be developed by the site Staffing Advisory Committee Committees, under the guidance of the Joint Labor/Management Committee.
2.	HealthEast and Minnesota Nurses Association recognize that employee morale and continuity of care can be negatively affected when Registered Nurse staff is floated to accommodate agency (short or long term}. To enhance morale and continuity of care, we agree to:
a.	Revise long-term agency contracts to include the agreement to work more than one unit. Example: If there are no critical care patients or if census drops on that particular unit, the agency nurse will be floated to the other ICU unit at St.
Joseph’s Hospital, or to St. John’s Hospital Critical Care Unit, or would be floated to Telemetry at St. Joseph's or St. John’s. Final option would be to float to medical surgical units to ensure the no-cance! status. .
b.	It is the intent of the staffing office to contact unit staff, if floating is unavoidable, due to use of any agency staff.
c.	Floating of unit staff to accommodate agency staff will be monitored through site SAC committees.
E.	Health and Safety. To better assist Registered Nurses injured on the job, we jointly agree to the following:
1.	HealthEast will designate a contact person for Minnesota Nurses Association to discuss questions or issues related to disabled nurses.
2.	HealthEast will monitor the quality of service delivered by the Worker’s Compensation Insurance Carrier.
3.	HealthEast, in partnership with the Insurance Carrier, will develop a pamphlet to be distributed through the Occupational Health Department. The pamphlet will include an option for the Registered Nurse to contact Minnesota Nurses Association. Final draft to be presented and approved at Health East/M NA Health and Safety Committee.
4.	An educational program will be provided to HealthEast/MNA Health and Safety Committee on the type of contracts established with carriers and the process involved.
F.	Required Education Subsequent to Employment. Pre-planning for all mandatory education will be done as far in advance as possible with special emphasis on the following:
1.	Staffing up on education or skill days.
2.	The Education Department will communicate the preparation time, if necessary, designated as either new skill or refresher, allotted for each educational offering.
3.	In the event of problems with “Required Education Subsequent to Employment", an appeal process exists through the use of the Labor/Management Committee.
G.	Casual Part-Time Nurses. Casuals are not regularly scheduled and do not have a defined F.T.E. work agreement.
92
H.	Posting and Filling of Positions. On top of posting boards, a statement would indicate that all job offers are made by Human Resources.
I.	Tax Sheltered Annuity.
1.	Human Resources will set up a process to review fund offerings in the Fidelity Tax Sheltered Annuities program on an annual basis.
2.	Human Resources will also set up mechanism for employee input into fund review process.
3,	An announcement will be placed in HealthEast Today regarding updates on Tax Sheltered Annuities offerings.
J.	Assessment. The letter offering employment will include a statement indicating that there is an assessment period.
During Hospital Orientation, MNA will emphasize the Assessment Period.
If it is determined that the nurse is not meeting the needs of the position he/she will be offered reassignment if an open position is available for which he/she may be qualified within four (4) weeks orientation.
"Qualified" means the ability to independently provide safe, direct patient care for the standard case load on the unit within a reasonable period of orientation not to exceed four (4) weeks; but said term does not require proficiency in all technical skills or the performance of leadership roles.
K.	Bereavement. A nurse request for time off without pay for bereavement, will be worked outjointly between the nurse and manager in an attempt to accommodate the nurse's request, while assuring that patient care needs are met. Issues arising from this request will be promptly addressed by an MNA Representative and Nursing Leadership or designee.
L.	Sick Leave Use. The Contract references that no nurse shall be penalized for legitimate use of sick leave. Thoughtful discussion occurred regarding decrease in FTE appointment. The following process is recommended when addressing attendance concerns/decrease in FTE appointment:
1.	Identify the attendance concern.
2.	Open dialogue between nurse and manager will occur to discuss a plan of action with goals and establish a timeline utilizing the Employee Notice of Attendance Concerns form.
3.	Ongoing discussion will occur as it relates to the plan and goals.
4.	A decrease in FTE will be considered only if stated goals are not met. Such decrease will not be taken lightly. At any time during this process, a nurse may choose representation by MNA.
5.	If a nurse feels she/he has been treated unfairly they may utilize the below mentioned Appeal Forms:
■ Appeal Process for Disputes Involving Absenteeism
M.	HealthEast Float Pool. A common HealthEast Float Pool has been established to supplement Registered Nurse bargaining unit positions at designated HealthEast facilities. At the 1998 Negotiations, the following was agreed upon as guiding principles for the HealthEast Float Pool:
93
■	These positions are determined on Registered Nurse non-productive hours and will be reviewed annually at the Labor/Management meeting.	.
•	A unit core staff will be maintained.
•	The HealthEast Float Pool will not become the primary source of staffing.
N.	Staffing Guide. Where grids are used and when there are changes to be made for budgetary purposes, every effort will be made to communicate such changes prior to implementation using a process to be defined by Minnesota Nurses Association Care Delivery Committee. This process will allow for one or more of the following:
1.	An emergency meeting between Hospital Management and MNA Chairs, if the change needs to be immediate.
2.	An emergency meeting of SAC members.
3.	A regularly scheduled SAC meeting.
4.	A regularly scheduled HealthEast Care Delivery meeting.
It is intended that the above process will be further delineated at a future HealthEast Care Delivery meeting and that the process will stop at the point where any issues created by the change, are resolved. Further, the intent of bringing such changes to any emergency or regularly-scheduled meeting is for the purpose of information sharing and input from both Minnesota Nurses Association and management.
O.	Exchanges (Even/Uneven). Uneven exchanges shall not have the net effect of decreasing in any calendar year, the work agreement by greater than four (4) shifts per year for full time RN, (prorated for part time). Compliance review will occur on a six (6) month basis.
Definitions:
1.	Even Exchanges - Equal exchanges of shift between two (2) employees in the same pay period.
2.	Uneven Exchanges - Exchanges of shifts between two (2) employees resulting in a decrease of scheduled hours that pay period for one (1) employee. Uneven Exchanges will not have the net effect of decreasing the work agreement in any calendar year by more than the following:
Four (4) shifts: .8-1.0 FTE per 64-80 hour pay period
Three (3) shifts: .6-7 FTE per 48-56 hour pay period Two (2) shifts: .4-.5 FTE per 32-40 hour pay period One (1) shift: .1-.3 FTE per 8-24 hour pay period
P.	Vacation Around Holidays. Vacation around holidays will be granted on a limited basis and will be based on unit seniority; this includes the Christmas and New Year’s holiday.
Q.	Low Need Davs.
1.	Nurses will have ability to use vacation for Mandatory and Voluntary Low Need Days unless management identifies a financial hardship. If management asserts such a financial hardship, they will notify MNA Chairs.
2.	For purposes of counting Mandatory Low Need Days, a shift will be defined as the number of hours scheduled that day.
R.	Hospice Program. HealthEast and the Association agree to the following regarding the Hospice Program:
94
1.	If a nurse is called to work while on-call off premises, she or he will be guaranteed not less than two (2) hours pay (instead of four (4) hours),
