Preamble
This agreement, made and entered into by the and between the International Union of Operating Engineer’s, Local 351, AFL-CIO, (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”) and EMCOR Government Services (hereinafter referred to as the “Employer”), for the operation of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Western Currency Facility, Ft. Worth, Texas.
ARTICLE I RECOGNITION
Section LI Union Recognition: For purposes of bargaining over wages, hours and conditions of employment, the Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent, and representative for all employees coming under the terms of this Agreement, as long as such recognition shall not be in conflict with, or in violation of, any statute, law, ordinance of the government of the United States, the State of Texas, or any political subdivision thereof.
Section L2 Shift Leader: Employees in the Shift Leader position, which is included in the bargaining unit, have no authority to hire, fire or discipline employees, and will be instructed by the Employer to refrain from asserting that such authority exists within the classification. The Shift Leader directs the work of employees assigned to his shift during the absence of the Shift Supervisor. At all other times, the Shift Leader is to perform routine work of the classification he holds. The shift leader classification will be included in the semi-annual shift change opportunities. Employees who serve in the shift leader classification will maintain seniority within their former job classifications.
ARTICLE II
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Section 2.1	Management Rights: The management of the facility and the direction of the work force are vested exclusively in the Employer and, except as limited by specific provisions of this Agreement, the Employer shall continue to have sole and exclusive rights customarily reserved to management, including the right to hire, promote, suspend, discipline, or discharge for proper or just cause; the right to schedule operations, shifts, and all hours of work; the right to assign work and require overtime work; the right to select supervisory personnel and control their conditions of
6
employment; and the right to establish rules pertaining to the operation of the facility, and permissible conduct of employees.
The above-mentioned management rights are not to be interpreted as being all-inclusive, but merely indicate the type of rights which belong to and are reserved to management. It is understood that any of the rights, power, or authority the Employer had prior to the signing of this Agreement are retained by the Employer, except those specifically abridged or modified by this Agreement. The Employer will have the ability to contract out work for various reasons, but shall not do so for the purposes of reducing the workforce.
Section 2.2	Government Directive: Should the Government suggest or direct the Employer to perform a specific task, including but not limited to, changing, modifying, or adding additional provisions that could impact this Agreement, the Employer will meet and confer with the Union, but in no event will such change, modification, or addition be negotiable or subject to the grievance and arbitration article set forth in this Agreement. Moreover, should the Government require an employee to be removed from the facility, such removal shall like wise not be subject to the grievance and arbitration article. If within sixty (60) days of the notice of being removed from the facility the Union produces evidence that would justify the employee being allowed back into the facility, the Employer agrees to present the employee’s case to the Government for restatement back into the facility. If the Government stands on its removal of the employee from the facility after the Union’s evidence is presented, the removal is not subject to the grievance and arbitration article.
Section 2.3	Drug and Alcohol Testing: The Employer shall have the right to test for drugs and alcohol usage subject to the following conditions:
(a)	Testing only if there is probable cause, no random testing.
(b)	If a positive result in a drug test, a second test of the same sample will be
administered.
(c)	Employee refusal to take a test justifies immediate termination of employee.
(d)	Blood alcohol level of .08 and above, or prevailing Texas State law, provide absolute presumption that employee is under the influence of alcohol. The Employer may immediately terminate any employee found to be under the influence of alcohol.

This includes walkouts, picketing, slowdowns or any other interruption of work by the Union or by any employee. In turn, the Employer will not lock-out its employees. Both parties may seek legal redress in the event of a breach of this article.
While it’s the desire of the parties to maintain a functioning work environment, any break down of such should be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure for dispute resolution.
ARTICLE IV

8

Section 7.4	Equalization of Overtime: The Employer will, insofar as is practicable, during the term of this Agreement, and with due regard to production or service, equalize overtime among qualified employees who normally perform the work in the required overtime classification.
(a)	In order to keep up with the amount overtime each employee has worked or refused, an “Overtime Book” will be kept in an area designated by the employer for each employee to write down the overtime they work and for the Supervisor or Shift Leader to write down overtime refused.
(b)	When the employer needs to cover a particular shift, the Supervisor or Shift Leader shall reference the “Overtime Book” and offer the overtime to the employee with the least amount of overtime in the classification where the overtime is required.

Where an employee is not at the worksite to be offered the overtime in person, the Supervisor will attempt to contact the employee by telephone using the telephone number provided in the “Overtime Book”. If the employee is not personally reached when called, the employee will not be charged with the overtime, and the Supervisor will proceed to the next employee in the overtime book.
(f)	If any error is made in assigning overtime, whether the issue is raised
11
informally or by grievance, the resolution, if any, will be the employee shall be provided an opportunity to work the next available overtime.

Normally, the maximum amount payable pursuant to this provision is forty (40) hours per year per employee. The Employer will consider requests for extensions of jury duty pay beyond forty (40) hours on a case-by-case basis. Such extensions shall be in the sole discretion of the Employer.

JOB OPENINGS
Section 10J Posting: Whenever a non-temporary job opening exists in any job classification and no employee in that classification is eligible for recall or no employee eligible for recall responds after being provided with a recall notice, then a notice advertising such opening shall be provided to each Shop Steward, and shall be posted at the plant for a period of seven (7) calendar days. Such notice shall include salary scale and job title. The Employer shall also send a copy of the posting via certified mail to the

Employees who apply for the job opening shall be notified in writing regarding the Employer's decision within a reasonable period of time.
Section 10.2 Filling the Position: When the skill and ability are relatively equal among applicants, the Employer shall select from among those applying for the position, the most senior individual. Employees selected shall be placed on probation for that job for forty-five (45) consecutive calendar days. During this probation period, if the Employer judges the employee to be unsatisfactory, or if the employee desires, he shall be returned to his former position or one of equal pay or similar function, or if that position has been filled, he may bump a less senior employee in his original job classification, and if there is no such less senior employee, he shall be placed on a preferential hiring list.
Section 10.3	Rights of Laid-off Employees: Under no circumstances shall the Employer hire from the open market when employees on the recall list (those laid off in the previous twelve (12) months) are qualified to perform the duties of the vacant position and are ready, willing and able to be re-employed. The last qualified employee laid off from the job will be the first recalled to that job.
Section 10.4	Temporary Filling of Vacancy: Notwithstanding Section 10.2, the Employer may temporarily fill any vacancy while the procedures outlined in this article are being followed.
Section 10.5	Shift Changes: The Employer will offer a shift/schedule change by seniority during March and September of each year. Should the shift change provision lead to or become excessive and difficult to handle, the parties agree to meet and confer on how to best resolve the problem.
