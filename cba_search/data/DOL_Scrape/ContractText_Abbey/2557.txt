Although new employees in the installer classification hired on or before ratification will not be automatically advanced to $18.38 per hour, they will be subject to a maximum three-year progression to the top rate of pay.
Employees will be paid at the rate of two (2) times the regular hourly wage for all hours worked in excess of fifty-eight (58) hours in any one (1) week.
All wage rates are based on a work week of five (5) eight (8) hour days, or four (4) ten (10) hour days if mutually agreed, or its equivalent.

Any such bumping will take place in order of seniority of those affected by the layoff, with the most junior employee among all the other Service Areas in the applicable job title being the first person subject to being bumped as provided herein, i.e., the more senior employee cannot choose to bump any less senior employee among the various other Service Areas, but only the least senior employee among all the other Service Areas not impacted by the layoff who is in the same job title as the la id-off employee. The employee(s) who is bumped will then be the person(s) who is laid off, i.e., there will be no right of any further bumping by those who are bumped. If an employee chooses to bump another employee pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, he or she will be responsible for his or her relocation expenses.
Vacation and personal/sick pay for time earned but not taken will be paid to the laid off employee if requested at the time of layoff.
The company will provide fourteen (14) calendar days notice of layoff to the union and the originally affected employees. Such notice to the employees shall include the right to bump.

If this occurs, the junior most cabling technician/installation technician shall be laid off. The bumping employee shall be paid at the top rate of the installation technician job classification. Employees who elect to bump to a lower job classification will be given the first opportunity to be placed back in their former job title for twelve (12) months from the date of the downgrade on a seniority basis.
LONG TERM LAYOFF
A layoff in which it is anticipated the employee will not be recalled within the twelve (12) month recall period. The Layoff Lump Sum Payment will be paid immediately.

The employees must notify the Company of their decision to exercise their right to bump within five (5) calendar days of receipt of layoff notification. Bumped employees will be given seven (7) calendar day notice of their layoff.
Layoffs shall be made by job title and Service Area. Service Areas are defined in Exhibit 13.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
DRUG TESTING/BACKGROUND CHECKS
Section I.	Purpose of the Policy
To provide CC&N (“the Company”) with a positive and comprehensive approach to the resolution of workplace issues resulting from illegal drug and alcohol use. The ultimate goal of this procedure is to balance individual privacy with the need to maintain a safe, productive and drug/alcohol free environment.
Section II.	Policy
The use, sale, transfer, purchase, or possession of alcohol or any controlled or illegal substance (defined by the government’s list of controlled substances, except as prescribed by a medical provider) while on the job, or on Company property, or on the property of a customer, or operating a motor vehicle, equipment, or machines on working time is prohibited and is cause for disciplinary action. Unopened alcohol containers in a personal vehicle will not be considered a violation of this policy. Employees who are under the influence of any controlled or illegal substance or alcohol have the potential for interfering with their own as well as their co-workers’ safe and efficient job performance. Consistent with existing Company practices, such conditions may result in disciplinary action. This policy is not intended to prohibit the lawful use of medications prescribed for treatment by a licensed medical provider.
The Company will conduct drug/alcohol testing as described below.
Section III.	Reasonable Suspicion and Post Accident Testing
Reasonable Suspicion Testing
Employees may be requested or required to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the Company has a reasonable suspicion, determined by a totality of the circumstances, that:
1.	The employee is under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol by virtue of being clearly and visibly impaired as verified by two company observers and, if available, a union representative. Employees who are suspected of having illegal drugs or alcohol in their system will be escorted to a medical clinic by a Company representative, and when available, a Union representative.
2.	The employee has violated the Company’s drug and alcohol policy.

Post Accident Testing
A test may be required where the employee has sustained a work related injury resulting in lost time beyond initial medical treatment or is involved in a property damage accident while on paid Company time involving more than $1,000.00 to Company, public or private property. This also includes accidents in a Company vehicle at any time with damage exceeding $1,800.
Section IV.	Rights of Collective Bargaining Representative
The Company will notify the Union of all employees required to test. Upon the employee’s request, the Company will notify the Union of the results of, or refusal to test, and provide the Union with all other information acquired in the investigation and conclusions drawn from and actions taken based on the results or other acquired information.
Section V.	Rights of Employees
The following employee rights apply to testing conducted under either Section III or Section IV above.
1.	Right to Refuse Testing. Employees have the right to refuse to undergo drug and alcohol testing. The consequence for refusal to test for a violation of this policy as outlined in Section II will be the same as if the employee had a confirmed, positive test result. An employee may freely decline voluntary testing as part of the requirements set forth in Section VI without penalty.
2.	Certain Limits on Discipline. An employee may not be disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation on the basis of a positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmatory test. Further, an employee may not be disciplined on the basis of a confirmed positive test result except as follows:
(a)	If the confirmed positive test result for violation of this policy was not the first confirmed positive result for the employee on a test requested by the Company, the employee may be subject to discipline up to and including termination. Mitigating circumstances will be taken into account.
(b)	If the confirmed positive result was the employee’s first on a test required by the Company, he/she will be given an opportunity to participate in, the Company’s EAP program.
3.	Notice of Results/Opportunity for Response. Within three working days

The Company must notify the original testing laboratory within three working days of receipt of such notice from the employee of a requested confirmatory retest, and advise the laboratory to conduct the test or transfer the sample to another certified laboratory that the person tested has designated to do the confirmatory retest. If the confirmatory retest does not confirm the original positive test result, no adverse personnel action based on the original confirmatory test may be taken against the employee, and the Employer will pay for the cost of the confirmatory retest.
4.	Qualifications of Testing Laboratory. Drug tests will be performed by a laboratory that is certified by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) and performs testing procedures in compliance with NIDA guidelines. Blood alcohol tests will be performed by a laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists (“CAPS”).
5.	Chain of Custody. Strict chain of custody will be used to ensure the integrity of each specimen. The process will ensure individual privacy during the collection process and confidentiality of test results.

EXHIBIT 14 MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT LVCT Training Memorandum
CC&N is working with the Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant to offer a 2-year Certified Technician Training Program based out of Service Area 1. The purpose of the program is to train new technicians with the skills necessary to progress from cable technician to Installation technician.
Participation in the program will be voluntary and managed by CC&N. The first-year program will be offered to cable technicians in their second year of employment at CC&N. The second-year program will be offered to those completing the first-year program. A cable technician that would like to participate in the program but who missed the opportunity in their second year of employment, could enroll after company approval and based on class availability.
The classes are 12 weeks in length, occurring on Fridays weekly, starting in January each year and ending in April.
The first-year program will start in January 2018. Technicians attending the classes will be scheduled to work Monday through Thursday, 10 hours per day performing their normal work assignments during the 12 weeks of classes.
Starting in January 2019, there will be two classes - first year and second year. The participants in the first-year program will be working 10-hour days on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday; attending class on Thursday. Participants attending the second-year program will work 10-hour days Monday through Thursday attending class on Friday.
Technicians will be paid at their straight time rate for the 8 hours to attend classes. Travel time to and from the classes will be paid per the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
