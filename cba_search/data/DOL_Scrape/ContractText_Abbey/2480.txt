ARTICLE 7 (LAYOFFS)
Section 1	- Definition
Layoff: A layoff shall be defined as:

b.	A condition that has the effect of rendering an employee unqualified for their current position and able to report for work. (see Personnel Actions).
Layoff Status: The period, following an employee’s layoff effective date, during which the employee is ineligible for normal pay and benefits and waiting for recall. All employees in this status shall be added to the rehire list on their layoff effective date.
Employees may accept full-time employment from other employers while in layoff status.
Rehire List: A list of employees in layoff status, organized by seniority, showing their layoff effective dates, seniority dates, and longevity dates.
Employees on the rehire list shall have the right of first refusal for any job vacancy, in any job classification, for which they are medically qualified and meet the contractual hiring requirements.
New hires or transfers may not displace any employee on the rehire list unless such an employee declines to be recalled.
Employees shall be removed from the rehire list when they accept recall, refuse a recall offer for which they are qualified (except as permitted in this Agreement), or when their layoff status expires, whichever happens first.
Section 2	- Application of Seniority during Layoffs
When it is necessary to implement a layoff, employees shall be laid off in reverse order of seniority (i.e., last hired is first to be laid off) within their respective job classification.
13 of 38 (20170808V4)
The Company shall displace less senior employees in favor of more senior employees (provided the senior employee is medically qualified to perform the job). Employees left without a position shall be informed of their layoff effective date and placed on the rehire list.
Employees designated for layoff shall not displace/bump employees outside of their current job classification.
Section 3	- Recall from Layoff
Employees in layoff status shall be recalled in order of seniority.
Employees laid off due to the loss of medical or security clearance must notify the Company whenever their status changes.

The employee must reply to the Company within three business days, after receiving the notice, and declare his intent to return to work (on a date that is acceptable to the Company). If the Company does not receive a response within the required time period, they shall assume the employee has declined the offer.
Employees may decline recall offers, without prejudice, for the following reasons:
a.	The employee is not qualified for the position due to medical or security clearance reasons;
b.	The offer is for a lower hourly wage rate than the employee received before being laid off;
c.	The offer is for fewer hours than the employee worked before being laid off;
d.	The position is outside the employee’s job classification.
Employees accepting a recall offer within the same job classification they held when laid off shall retain their original seniority and longevity dates.
Employees accepting a recall offer for a job classification other than the one they held before being laid off shall retain their original longevity date, but shall have their seniority date permanently changed to match the date they start work in the new classification.
Section 4	- Severance Pay
If the Company provides a non-probationary employee with less than 30 calendar days of advance notice before laying them off, the affected employee shall be paid severance pay (if the employee does not resign before their layoff effective date).

Employees who choose to remain continuously employed with the Company are not entitled to severance pay (e.g. an employee who is bumped and immediately (i.e. within one work day) accepts a lower paying position in lieu of being laid off). In such case, the Company must allow the employee to start work/log paid time in their new position immediately (i.e. within one work day of leaving their old position).
Section 5	- Loyalty Pay

Employees who choose to remain continuously employed with the Company are not entitled to loyalty pay (e.g. an employee who is bumped and immediately (i.e. within one work day) accepts a lower paying position in lieu of being laid off). In such case, the Company must allow the employee to start work/log paid time in their new position immediately (i.e. within one work day of leaving their old position).
Section 6	- Severance/Loyalty Pay following Contract Termination

Employees on probation shall earn seniority and longevity from their date of hire and are free to accept or decline Association membership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Personnel already employed under this Agreement, who are selected to upgrade to a new position, shall not be subject to a probationary period.
Section 2	- Just Cause and the Application of Discipline
The Company shall not discipline or discharge any employee (other than those on probation) except for just cause.
The following questions shall serve as the test for “just cause”:
1.	Was the worker given advance warning of the consequences of his conduct?
2.	Was the rule, order, or standard reasonably related to employee performance?
3.	Was the alleged violation thoroughly investigated before discipline?
4.	Was the investigation fair and objective?
5.	Did the investigation reveal convincing proof of guilt?
6.	Was the employer’s discipline nondiscriminatory?
7.	Was the discipline reasonably related to the worker’s record and the severity of the conduct?
Discipline shall be accomplished in a constructive, progressive manner, so as to rehabilitate and correct an offender, if at all possible.
The Company shall provide affected employees with written documentation of any disciplinary action taken against them.
The Company shall provide discharged employees with a written record of the reasons for their discharge at the time they are dismissed (unless not possible due to arrest or other mitigating
16 of 38 (20170808V4)
circumstances; in which case the information shall be mailed to the employee’s address within two business days).
Disciplinary matters, including termination, shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration processes.
Section 3	- Weingarten Rights
Employees shall have the right to be accompanied and represented by the Association President and/or legal counsel at investigatory interviews, hearings, and/or meetings with the Company that relate to discipline.
Employees shall not be punished for requesting such representation.

The Company will confer with the Association regarding any potential change to the retirement plan recordkeeper.
Section 4	- Annual FAA Medical Exams and Associated Waiver Exams or Tests
The provisions of this section only apply to employees who are required to hold an FAA flight medical certificate to perform their job.
The Company shall reimburse employees for their annual FAA Class II flight physical exams plus any additional FAA physical directed test (i.e., EKG).
FAA medical exams and/or associated tests may be completed during normal working hours at a time that is scheduled by mutual agreement between the Company and the employee. In such case, the employee shall be paid normal hourly wages for work time missed up to four (4) hours.
Employees must submit a receipt for the cost of their medical exam directly to the Company for reimbursement within 30 days of the exam date.
33 of 38 (20170808V4)
If additional medical tests or procedures are required to satisfy FAA medical criteria, employees are required to file a claim with their personal insurance carrier first. After the carrier has paid their portion, the employee must submit a receipt with the FAA medical examination receipt to the Company to obtain reimbursement of the remaining out-of-pocket costs.
Section 5	- Tuition Assistance
As an employee of the Company, employees are eligible to receive tuition assistance after they successfully complete their probationary period. The maximum allowance of tuition assistance provided to an employee is $1,500 per calendar year. This plan applies to undergraduate and graduate courses. Courses must be pre-approved by the Company to enhance the current and future contributions to the Company. Reimbursements will not be made for textbooks or other costs not classified as tuition costs. The Company reserves the right to waive the probationary period.
To be eligible for tuition reimbursement, the employee:
•	Must acquire pre-approval.
•	Must submit a receipt for the class or classes and document that indicates he was awarded a passing grade for the class.
An employee who fails a class, receives an incomplete, or withdraws from a class without Company approval, will not be reimbursed for tuition.
In exchange for this benefit, employees are committed to continued employment for a minimum of one (1) year from course completion. If employee voluntarily resigns within this period, the Company will recoup the tuition reimbursement monies from his last paycheck.
ARTICLE 15	(PERSONNEL ACTIONS)
Section 1	- Promotions/Special Qualification Upgrades
The Company shall offer upgrades to current employees before seeking new hires or transfers to fill higher-paid vacancies.
If two or more equally qualified employees are eligible for an upgrade and express an interest, seniority shall govern who is selected.
An employee may refuse to accept an upgrade without prejudice as long as there is a more junior employee willing to upgrade. In such a case, the offer shall pass down to the next qualified candidate in order of seniority and the employee shall continue in their previous position.
If an employee’s position is abolished as a consequence of an upgrade, and the employee declines the upgrade, the employee shall be laid off.
34 of 38 (20170808V4)
Employees shall continue to be paid the normal hourly wages for their old position while enrolled in upgrade training. They shall be paid the hourly wage rate for their new, upgraded, position after they are fully qualified.
Duties not listed in the PWS for Hancock shall not be performed nor paid without negotiations resulting in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).
Section 2	- Demotions/Elimination of Special Qualification Duty
If the Company decides to remove special qualifications from positions within a job classification, it shall apply the removals to employees in reverse order of seniority (i.e., the last employee hired is the first to lose their special qualification).
In any case, the Company shall give affected employees two weeks of notice before reducing their pay to account for the loss of special qualifications.
Section 3	- Loss of FAA Medical Qualification/Medically Unable to Perform Duties
If an employee loses their FAA medical qualification, they shall remain in their current position and continue to earn their normal hourly wages for a period of 90 calendar days while they attempt to regain their qualification.
If the employee remains unqualified after this term, their pay shall be reduced to base pay plus health and wellness fringe for an additional period at the sole discretion of the Company. When the Company-specified period ends, the employee may be laid off.
If the employee is medically unable to perform duties associated with his position, he goes on unpaid FMLA status. The Company, in its sole discretion, may extend the Leave of Absence after the employee has exhausted the FMLA leave. This Company-approved Leave of Absence is unpaid.
If the employee is unable to return from the Company-approved Leave of Absence, the Company reserves the right to terminate the employee.
Section 4	- Loss of Security Clearance
It is understood by the Company and the Association that employees shall be subject to investigation for security clearance or national agency check and/or unescorted entry authorization under regulations prescribed by the Department of Defense or other agencies of the
35 of 38 (20170808V4)
United States Government as a necessary condition of employment. Employees denied such clearance (and/or unescorted entry authorization) may be laid off at the Company’s discretion.
ARTICLE 16	(CONTRACTING OUT AND GUEST WORKERS)
Section 1	- Contracting Out
The Company shall not contract out work, or bring in temporary guest workers from other worksites, if there are employees already at work (or on the rehire list) who can perform the work in question.
Section 2	- Temporary Guest Workers
Temporary guest workers shall be paid wages and earn paid time off in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. However, such workers shall be exempt from paying dues or agency fees.
Temporary guest workers shall not earn seniority and cannot exercise seniority-related rights under this Agreement.
The longest period any temporary guest worker (or series of workers covering a single position) may perform work under this Agreement is 90 calendar days. Longer periods require Association concurrence.
ARTICLE 17 (LEGAL)
The Company agrees to indemnify employees with respect to any claims made against them resulting from the performance of their duties, except where it is established that such action arose out of a willful or wanton dereliction of duty.
In the event that such proceedings result in any judgment or monetary award against such employees, the Company shall indemnify them in respect of payments made pursuant to judgments or monetary awards, and such indemnification shall include the assumption of the costs of any legal proceedings incurred by such employees resulting from the performance of their duties.
