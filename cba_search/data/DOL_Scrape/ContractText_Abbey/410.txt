WITNESSETH:
That, in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained, the parties hereto agree each with the other as follows:
ARTICLE I
RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative of all its nonmanagerial employees hereinafter called "employees," whose titles are included in the list of job titles in Appendix "E" attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement, for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages and hours of employment and other conditions of employment.
In the event of a merger or acquisition of Cincinnati Bell Telephone, whereby a controlling interest in Cincinnati Bell Telephone is obtained by another company, or in the event of the sale to, or the acquisition by, another company of substantially all the assets of Cincinnati Bell Telephone, the parties agree that such company shall become the successor to Cincinnati Bell Telephone, shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement between Cincinnati Bell Telephone and CWA, and shall assume all other duties and responsibilities of a successor (as that term is construed under the National Labor Relations Act). Cincinnati Bell Telephone agrees to require any such successor to accept the terms of this Collective Bargaining Agreement by written notice. A copy of such notice shall be provided to CWA at least (30) days prior to the effective date of any sale, transfer or assignment.
1
ARTICLE II DEFINITIONS
The definitions as set forth in Appendix "A" attached hereto shall be applicable to this Agreement and its associated appendices.
ARTICLE III
NON-DISCRIMINATION
1.	The Company will not discriminate against, interfere with, restrain or coerce employees because of membership or lawful activity in the Union.
2.	The Union will not discriminate against, interfere with, restrain or coerce employees because of nonmembership in the Union.
3.	In a desire to restate their respective policies, neither the Company nor the Union shall unlawfully discriminate against any employee because of such employee's race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin or because he or she is disabled, a disabled veteran or a veteran of the Vietnam era.
ARTICLE IV
JOINT CONFERENCES
1.	Meetings between representatives of the Company and representatives of the Union shall be held at the request of either party upon reasonable notice to the other party. Each party will give the other party the names of its duly authorized representatives and evidence of their authority to act.
2.	Requests for joint conferences shall state the purpose of the meetings and the subject or subjects to be discussed.
3.	Minutes or records of joint conferences shall be kept unless otherwise agreed upon by the Company and the Union representatives, but such minutes or records shall not constitute agreements between the Company and the Union.
4.	Union representatives, when attending joint conferences with Company representatives shall notify their immediate super-
2
visor in writing when the absence is to begin and for what period the employee expects to be absent.
5.	Authorized representatives of the Union, who are on the payroll of the Company, will be paid at their regular rate of pay for time spent in conference with representatives of the Company during the Union representatives' scheduled normal tour hours.
ARTICLE V
WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS

ARTICLE VI
ADJUSTMENT OF GRIEVANCES
1.	Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Company and the Union and except as provided in paragraph 5, grievances shall be conducted in accordance with the following three-step procedure:
First:	The Union's authorized representative shall meet with
the appropriate Team Leader/Specialist/Senior Manager and/or Director provided the complaint is submitted in writing or e-mail stating the nature of the grievance (time, date, description of incident, harm done to grievant, etc.) and the portion(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated, if applicable, to the appropriate Team Leader/Specialist/ Senior Manager (with a copy to Labor Relations) or, where the union cannot determine the appropriate Team Leader/Specialist/Senior Manager, to Labor Relations, on or before the expiration of thirty (30) calendar days from the date that the action causing the complaint occurred. Complaints not submitted in writing or via e-mail within this 30 calendar day period shall be untimely. The representatives of both parties shall use the utmost
3
effort to hold the first step meeting within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the Company receives the written or e-mail grievance. Matters not resolved at the first step may proceed to the second.
Second: The Union's authorized representative shall meet with the appropriate Director and/or Vice President, provided the Union's authorized representative notifies the appropriate Director and/or Vice President in writing or via e-mail (with a copy to Labor Relations) of the Union's intent to escalate the grievance to the second step. Such written or e-mail notices must occur within thirty (30) calendar days from the Company's answer to the Union at the first step. If such written or e-mail notice does not occur within this 30 day period, the grievance shall be untimely. The representatives of both parties shall use the utmost effort to hold the second step meeting within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the Company receives the written or e-mail notification of the Union's desire to conduct a second step meeting. Matters not resolved at the second step may proceed to the third.
Third: The Union's authorized representative shall meet with the Director of Labor Relations or his/her designated representative, provided the Union's authorized representative notifies the Director of Labor Relations or his/her designated representative in writing or via e-mail of the Union’s intent to escalate the grievance to the third step. Such written or e-mail notice must occur within thirty (30) calendar days from the Company's answer at the second step. If such written or e-mail notice is not provided within this 30 day period the grievance shall be untimely. The representatives of both parties shall use the utmost effort to hold the third step meeting within sixty (60) calendar days of the date the Company receives the written or e-mail notification of the Union's desire to conduct a third step meeting.
4
Although any representative of the Union and the Company, regardless of level, may be present at any step of the procedure, the presence of such representative(s) shall not affect the progress of the discussions through any subsequent step of the procedure.
2.	If the parties mutually agree, the Union may submit a statement of its case in writing within the applicable time limits stated above and forego a face to face meeting at any of the three step meetings, and the Company will respond in writing without a meeting,
3.	The Company agrees that (i) if a grievance is presented by a Union representative to the appropriate Team Leader/Specialist or other appropriate company representative, or (ii) if a grievance is presented which involves a question of the true intent or meaning of any provision of this Agreement or its amendments, or (iii) a grievance is presented regarding a commitment made by either party to the other in writing as qualified under paragraph 5 of this Article, thereafter no representative of the Company shall initiate a discussion or undertake an adjustment of the grievance with the employee without affording the proper Union representative an opportunity to be present when such discussion is held or adjustment undertaken.
4.	No untimely grievance shall be considered or adjusted pursuant to this Article or Article VII of this Agreement.
5.	Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to interfere with the right of any employee or group of employees as preserved by Section 9 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 to present grievances to the appropriate Team Leader/ Specialist or Labor Relations within 30 days from the date that the action causing the grievance occurred, provided, however, that no adjustment be made with the employee or group of employees as to any grievance involving a question of the true intent or meaning of any provision of this Agreement or its amendments or regarding a commitment made by either party to the other in writing, except by agreement between the proper Union and Company representatives.
5
ARTICLE VII ARBITRATION
If at any time, a grievance should arise between the Union and the Company regarding the true intent and meaning of any provision of this Agreement or regarding a claim that either party hereto has not fulfilled a commitment made by either party to the other in writing, or regarding the dismissal or suspension of any employee having one or more years of net credited service, and if after every effort has been made to compose the difference by joint conference, grievance adjustment or other procedure authorized under this Agreement, it appears that such difference cannot be settled or satisfactorily adjusted by any such means, the question shall be submitted to arbitration upon a timely written or e-mail request of either party to this Agreement to the other, specifying the provision or agreement involved and the act or omission upon which the complaint is based. The request for arbitration shall be considered timely if filed with the other party within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of the third step grievance answer.
Section 1	— Standard Arbitration Procedure
(a)	Within thirty (30) days after the request for arbitration the party seeking arbitration shall request in writing (with a copy to the opposing party) the Director of the American Arbitration Association to submit a list of seven arbitrators from which the parties shall jointly select an impartial arbitrator. In the event the parties are unable to select a mutually satisfactory arbitrator they shall request the Director of the American Arbitration Association to furnish a second list from which a selection shall be made.
(b)	The selected impartial arbitrator shall not be an officer, director, stockholder, or employee of the Company or of any company in the former Bell System that is referred to in the Mandatory Portability Agreement, nor shall he be a member, officer or attorney of the Union, or any other labor organization affiliated therewith.
(c)	Hearings shall be started within thirty (30) days of selection of the arbitrator and carried to conclusion as expeditiously as possible.
6
(d)	The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding and the Company and the Union agree to abide by such decision; however, the arbitrator shall have no power to add to, or subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement or any agreements made supplementary hereto; nor to establish or change any wage, but shall refer any such case back to the parties without decision.
(e)	The arbitrator shall, in a suspension or dismissal case, determine whether the suspension or dismissal was for just cause.
(f)	If no final decision is reached by the foregoing procedure, the Company and the Union agree that neither will take action before any court or commission without first resorting to all available conciliation services furnished by state or federal authority.
(g)	The compensation and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union. Each party shall bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses.
Section 2	— Mediation
After a timely request for arbitration of a grievance involving the discipline or discharge of an individual employee has been filed pursuant to the first paragraph of Article VII, the parties may agree to hold Section 1 of this Article in abeyance pending mediation of the dispute pursuant to the following:
1.	All aspects of this mediation procedure are voluntary. Either party may refuse to mediate a grievance and may withdraw from mediation at any time.
2.	Mediation will be scheduled only on the basis of a joint request by Union and Company representatives.
3.	A request for mediation must be made within fifteen (15) calendar days of a timely request for arbitration.
4.	Each party shall select one spokesperson to present its position to the mediator. Attendance at the mediation conference shall be limited to those people actually involved in the mediation process.
5.	The representatives of the parties are encouraged, but not
7
required, to present the mediator with a brief written statement of the facts, the issue, and the arguments in support of their position. If such a statement is not presented in written form, it shall be presented orally at the beginning of the mediation conference.
6.	Any written material that is presented to the mediator shall be returned to the party presenting that material at the termination of the mediation conference.
7.	Proceedings before the mediator shall be informal in nature. The rules of evidence will not apply, and no record of the mediation conference shall be made.
8.	The mediator will have the authority to meet separately with any person or persons, but will not have the authority to compel the resolution of a grievance.
9.	If no settlement is reached during the mediation conference, either party may obtain, from the mediator, a separate assessment of that party's position. If no settlement is reached and both parties agree, the mediator shall provide the parties with an immediate oral advisory opinion and shall state the grounds for such advisory opinion.
10.	The advisory opinion of the mediator, if accepted by the parties, shall not constitute a precedent unless both parties agree.
11.	If no settlement is reached at the mediation conference, the parties are free to arbitrate the grievance. If they do so, arbitration must be initiated under Section 1 of this Article within fifteen (15) calendar days of the final mediation conference.
12.	In the event that a discipline or discharge grievance that has been mediated subsequently goes to arbitration, no mediator may serve as arbitrator. Nothing said or done by the mediator, including any oral advisory opinion, may be referred to at arbitration. Nothing said by either party in the mediation conferences may be used against it at arbitration.
13.	The costs of the mediation process shall be divided between the parties equally.
8

C-1.00 STARTING RATES
C-1.01 Normally, applicants for employment will be engaged at the starting rates specified in the wage schedules. When an applicant has exceptional qualifications, either because of outside training or prior experience, a higher starting rate may be authorized.
C-1.10 ABSENCES IN EXCESS OF ONE MONTH
C-l .11 In all cases of continuous absence from the service exceeding thirty (30) calendar days (with or without pay or benefits), except absence on military leaves or paid vacations, no wage plan service shall accrue for that portion of the period of absence which is in excess of thirty (30) calendar days.
C-1.20 EFFECTIVE DATE OF WAGE CHANGES
C-l.21 All wage changes shall become effective as of the first day of the payroll period in which the change occurs, except that scheduled wage increases which fall due while the employee is on a leave of absence or drawing disability benefits shall be made effective as of the day the employee returns to active duty, provided,
(a)	the total period of absence does not exceed thirty (30) calendar days, or

C-1.30 PROGRESSION
C-1.31 Employees will be considered for each successive wage increase at the expiration of the interval indicated in the appropriate wage schedule, subject to the provisions of Section C-1.10. If this would result in the last increase to the employee's maximum rate being a fractional step of less than one dollar ($1.00), this fractional amount shall be given with the last full step.
C-1.40 DEFERRED WAGE TREATMENT
C-1.41 When, in the judgment of the Company, an employee's performance does not justify normal wage treatment, the employee's increase may be deferred, but at no time shall the rate be more than one (1) step under the normal progression rate. If an employee's performance does not justify normal wage treatment, this shall be made known to the employee and to the Union at least thirty (30) days in advance of the date the increase is withheld.

Depending on the improvement in the employee's performance, the normal rate and normal progression may be restored at any time after a minimum period of three (3) months of deferment. At the expiration of the initial minimum period of three (3) months at the deferred rate, the employee shall be advised by the Company whether or not he or she then qualifies for normal wage treatment. If not, the employee shall be advised thereafter at appropriate intervals. Deferred wage treatment shall require the approval of the director.

6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 6 months 12 months 12 months 12 months
“Current Company practices identify job titles within the above job classifications. The step-down does not apply to moves within the same job classification. The step-down is to be applied as follows:
30
(a)	The employee whose wage plan service or net credited service is equal to or greater than the next higher step on the new schedule will go to the next higher step, but shall not exceed the step down from maximum of the new wage schedule. The promoted employee who, as a result of this application, is not at the maximum rate for the new job will be considered for a scheduled wage increase Six (6) months following the promotion.
(b)	If after the step-down has been applied the employee receives no promotional increase, then the employee will receive $2.00 on promotion and will remain "off-schedule" until the next scheduled increase at which time the wage rate will be adjusted to the schedule amount associated with the employee's wage plan service.
C-l .63 In cases where the promoted employee is also due for a scheduled increase on the date the promotional increase becomes effective, consideration shall first be given to the scheduled increase, and, if granted, it shall be included in the employee's "present rate" for the purposes of this Section.
C-l .64 In the case of a promotion to a job classification within the bargaining unit, the employee who is considered best qualified will be selected with due consideration to ability, aptitude and seniority.
C-1.70 DEMOTIONS
C-l .71 Demotions will be treated with due consideration of all pertinent factors, including the reason for demotion, the employee's past performance, wage progress and net credited service.
C-l .72 An employee who is downgraded will have an adjustment in pay in accordance with the following:
31
(a)	The employee who is demoted without having had a prior promotion, will have the wage rate on the lower wage schedule determined using the employee's wage plan service.
(b)	The employee who has been promoted and subsequently downgraded through demotion or retreat, will have the wage rate on the lower schedule determined as though the promotion had not occurred.
C-1.80 TRANSFERS OTHER THAN A PROMOTION OR DEMOTION
C-1.81 All cases of transfers other than promotions and demotions will be treated with due consideration of all pertinent factors such as current job performance, the employee's qualifications, training, prior experience and net credited service.
C-1.90 CHANGES IN JOB TITLES
C-1.91 Whenever the Company determines it appropriate to create a new job title or job classification in the bargaining unit, or restructure or redefine an existing one, it shall be handled as follows:
(a)	The Company shall notify the Union in writing of such job title or classification and shall furnish a job description of the duties and the wage rates and schedules initially determined for such job titles and classifications. Such wage rates and schedules shall be designated as temporary. Following such notice to the Union, the Company may proceed to staff such job title or classification.
(b)	The Union shall have the right, within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from the Company, to initiate negotiations concerning the initial wage rates or schedules established as temporary by the Company.
32
(c)	If negotiations are not so initiated or if agreement is reached between the parties within sixty (60) days following receipt of notice from the Company concerning the wage rates and schedules, the temporary designation shall be removed from the job title or classification.
(d)	If negotiations are initiated and the parties are unable to reach agreement within sixty (60) days following receipt of notice from the Company, the issue of an appropriate temporary schedule of wage rates shall be submitted to a neutral third party, to be selected as set forth below, for determination of an appropriate temporary schedule of wage rates. Such temporary rates shall remain in effect until such job title or classification has been evaluated by the neutral third party.
(e)	The neutral third party referred to above shall be selected by mutual agreement from a previously selected panel of three arbitrators who possess acknowledged expertise in the area of job evaluation. A hearing shall be conducted before such third party within thirty (30) days after selection and such individual shall have sixty (60) days from the date of selection to make a determination which shall be binding on the parties as a schedule of wage rates. While it is not intended that such third party undertake a full and complete job evaluation study, he or she shall review other job titles or classifications and their wage schedules for comparison purposes and may make an on-site inspection of the workplace and conduct a reasonable number of interviews of incumbents.
C-1.92 Refer to D-12.40 for pay treatment of employees subject to job content downgrade.

C-2.01 Effective on the first general wage adjustment date, an adjustment will be made in basic weekly rates in each wage schedule. The amount of the adjustment shall be fifty-five cents ($.55) plus .65% of the scheduled rates applicable during the first year of the Agreement, rounded to the nearest fifty cents ($.50), for each full percent increase in the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics National Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, hereafter called "CPI-W" (1967 = 100), for May 1984 over May 1983. A partial percent increase shall be applied proportionately.
C-2.02 Effective on the second general wage adjustment date, a second adjustment will be made in basic weekly rates in each wage schedule. The amount of the adjustment shall be fifty-five cents ($.55) plus .65% of the scheduled rates applicable during the second year of the Agreement, rounded to the nearest fifty cents ($.50), for each full percent increase in the CPI-W (1967 = 100) for May 1985 over May 1984. A partial percent increase shall be applied proportionately.
C-2.03 In no event shall a decrease in the CPI-W result in a reduction of any basic weekly wage rate.
C-2.04 In the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not issue the appropriate Consumer Price Indexes on or before the dates referred to in C-2.01 or C-2.02, cost-of-living adjustments required by such appropriate indexes shall be effec
34
tive at the beginning of the first payroll week after receipt of the indexes.
C-2.05 No adjustment, retroactive or otherwise, shall be made as the result of any revision which may later be made in the first published figures for the CPI-W for May 1983, May 1984, and May 1985.
C-2.06 The cost-of-living adjustments are dependent upon the availability of the CPI-W in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the CPI-W for May 1983. In the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics changes the form or the basis of calculating the CPI-W, the Company and the Union agree to request the Bureau to make available, for the life of this Agreement, a CPI-W in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the CPI-W for May 1983, which was 296.3 (1967 = 100).

D-8.31 "Time off" includes vacation time, excused work days (paid and unpaid), personal holidays, and days in lieu of holidays which occur during a scheduled vacation week.
D-8.32 "Reserve time" is time off other than scheduled full weeks of vacation. Reserve time is to be selected on the second selection priority canvass in accordance with seniority. The period for which the "reserve time" may be scheduled and taken shall extend through March 31 of the calendar year following the year of time off eligibility.
D-8.33 Service requirements are the primary considerations when scheduling time off for any group of employees. Insofar as these requirements permit, employees may choose their time off in accordance with their net credited service within their administrative work groups or other appropriate group as determined by management. Where necessary, the Company may make changes in vacations already assigned. It is the intent of the parties that employees' selections will be granted to the extent practicable, consistent with force requirements and the needs of the business.
52
D-8.34 Prior to the beginning of the calendar year, management will canvass the work group to allow employees to select vacation weeks from the available dates. Only full weeks of vacation are included in the first selection priority. (Vacations of less than a full calendar week and split weeks are included in the second selection priority.) After all employees in the work group have been scheduled for full vacation weeks, management will canvass the work group to select other reserve time for which they are eligible.
D-8.35 A vacation week shall normally be a calendar week, Sunday through Saturday. An employee may, at his/her request and with management approval, begin vacation on a day other than Sunday. In addition, an employee may split one (1) or two (2) full vacation weeks into increments of one (1) day or more, provided service and force conditions permit.
D-8.36 Subject to the needs of the business and force requirements of the work group, time off scheduled under paragraph D-8.32 above may be rescheduled by an employee on the basis of the earliest request to the employee's immediate supervisor.
D-8.37 A full vacation week may be extended or rescheduled in the event of unforeseen personal illness or death in the immediate family. In order to reschedule a full vacation week, notice shall be given by midnight of the last day prior to the scheduled vacation.

If a former employee who has received a termination allowance is reengaged and the number of weeks since the date of separation is less than the number of weeks upon which his termination allowance was based (less vacation if any), the amount paid to the employee for the excess number of weeks shall be considered as an advance to him by the Company and shall be repaid through payroll deductions at the rate of ten percent (10%) of his basic wage rate each week until the amount is fully paid.

*	To be successful, the Company must meet its financial, customer service and Business Plan objectives.
*	To work together to achieve mutual goals within the Common Interest Forum in a way that demonstrates integrity, credibility and concern for employees and the Company.
Recognizing that rapid changes are occurring and will continue to occur in the telecommunications business, the Company and Union express their intent that a forum of common interest exist for the following purposes:

93
*	To discuss and review innovative approaches to enhance the competitiveness of all segments of the Company and improve employment security;
*	To communicate technological and operational changes, determine impact and recommend solutions;
*	To examine the major factors influencing health care costs and, as appropriate, recommend cost containment measures;

CONTRACTING OF WORK AGREEMENT
May 12,1996
Mr. Jeffrey A. Rechenbach, Vice President Communications Workers of America 20525 Center Ridge Road, Suite 700 Cleveland, OH 44116
Dear Mr. Rechenbach:
The Company herewith submits the following statements of policy regarding the performance of work associated with the installation and maintenance of communication facilities owned, maintained and operated by the Company.
1.	The Company is in accord with the Union that work considered telephone work should be performed by the employees of the Company.
2.	In recognition of its long established practice, the Company will continue to enter into contract with affiliated companies, connecting companies, other wire using companies, certain communications equipment manufacturing companies, municipalities and governmental agencies for the performance of work, some of which may be similar in nature to that normally performed by the Company's employees.
3.	The Company, under ordinary conditions, will not enter into contract with any Company or agency other than those referred to in the preceding paragraph to provide for the performance of work which is similar in nature to that normally performed by the Company's employees, if such action would directly result in the layoff or part-timing of active employees anywhere in the Company who would normally perform the work to be done under the contract, or delay the recall of laid off employees who are waiting recall into the affected occupation.
4.	When the Company is considering a contract with a Company or agency other than those referenced in paragraph two
95
(2) herein, to provide for the performance of work which is similar in nature to that normally performed by the Company's employees and which could have the effect of displacing ten (10) or more bargaining unit positions, the Director of Employee Relations will notify the appropriate union representative(s) that the Company is considering such a contract and he will provide the Union with information regarding the work involved, the scope and duration of the potential contract and the estimated costs for performance of the work by Company employees. Thereafter, the union shall have thirty (30) calendar days to present to the appropriate Company representative(s), a proposal to assign the work at issue to bargaining unit employees along with any data supporting the proposal. The Company shall notify the Union of its decision within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of the proposal.
This Agreement supersedes all former Agreements and commitments made by the Company on this subject.

DIAGNOSTIC MONITORING AGREEMENT
May 9,1993
Mr. Robert D. Johnson, Vice President Communications Workers of America 20525 Center Ridge Road, Room 400 Cleveland, Ohio 44116
Dear Mr. Johnson:
This will confirm the understanding reached in collective bargaining between Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company and the Communications Workers of America regarding the use of diagnostic monitoring.
As an indication of our mutual determination to achieve goals of improvement, we have committed that observations in the operating offices commonly known as "diagnostic monitoring" will not be performed from remote locations. Diagnostic supervision functions (including monitoring) will be performed at the position where the individual being observed is working when management determines it is necessary for training or instructional purposes.
Evaluative/Analytic observations taken in connection with the Operator Performance and Evaluation Plan (OPEP), and other observations taken for service management, will continue to be performed at remote locations on a statistical sampling basis as set forth in current operating practices under OPEP.
Very truly yours,
L. C. Hyer

EMPLOYMENT SECURITY LETTER AGREEMENT
May 9,1999
Mr. Jeffrey A. Rechenbach, Vice President Communications Workers of America 20525 Center Ridge Road, Room 700 Cleveland, Ohio 44116
Dear Mr. Rechenbach:
The Company recognizes that a talented and dedicated work force is one of its most important resources and as such is vital to the ongoing efforts of the corporation to remain competitive. The Company is aware that it is in its best interests to use business practices which place an emphasis on the effective and proper utilization of all its human resources.
In an effort to meet this responsibility, the Company has in the past always strived to maintain a secure and stable employment policy in the face of major changes in the economy and our industry structure. To date, these efforts at preserving employment security have been quite successful and of this, the Company is very proud. However, the Company is aware that the Union and many employees are still concerned about future employment security at Cincinnati Bell Telephone.
While it is not possible for the Company to make specific guarantees on employment security, it can agree that prior to the implementation of a force adjustment program, involving downgrades or layoffs in any job classification or title, the Company will make every administrative effort to alleviate the force surplus to avoid the need for the force adjustment program. As part of that effort, the Company will consider where practicable and economical, the following measures among others:
-	recalling contracted work which could be performed by surplus employees;
-	offering part-time hours to interested employees in those areas where that is feasible;
96
-	offering voluntary excused time without pay;
-	liberalizing corporate leave of absence policy;
-	handling surplus conditions, where possible, through attrition;
-	reducing, where possible, overtime costs;
-	implementing the Supplemental Income Protection Program.
If administrative efforts fail to alleviate the need for a program of force adjustment layoffs which affect regular employees in any work group or groups, the Company agrees to give the Union sixty (60) days written notice of its intention and to afford the Union this period of time to be heard thereon. The notice to the Union of the Company's intention to adopt a program of force adjustment layoffs shall remain in force for a period of six (6) months beginning on the date of the notice to the Union. Employees in those affected work groups will be identified as a candidate for lay-off in inverse seniority order. The Company agrees to lay-off temporary, Job Bank and occasional employees in inverse order of seniority before laying-off either regular full-time or regular part-time employees. Temporary, Job Bank and occasional employees shall have no recall rights.
Employees subject to layoffs in those affected work groups may choose to exercise force adjustment rights as provided for under this letter agreement or, accept a layoff and receive the benefits provided for under this letter agreement. The force adjustment rights are as follows:
(a)	Employees exercising force adjustment rights may choose to displace less senior employees having the same job title, within their assigned department and within their wage schedule.
(b)	Once the process described in subparagraph (a) is completed, remaining employees subject to lay-off may choose to displace less senior employees in positions within their department and within their
99
wage schedule where the senior employees have basic proficiency in the positions to which they wish to force adjust; or to a position within the department at the same or lower level which the employee has previously held or for which the employee is basically qualified.
(c)	Employees who are downgraded as a result of exercising rights to displace less senior employees pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall not be entitled to pay treatment for downgraded employees pursuant to D-12.40.
(d)	Once the process in subparagraph (b) has been completed, remaining employees subject to lay-off who have not met the requisite force adjustment criteria established in subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall be laid off in inverse seniority order and shall retain no additional force adjustment rights under this letter agreement.
Employees who are laid off may choose to take their termination allowance under the contract in a lump sum as provided for in paragraph D-12.21. Any employee who chooses such a lump sum option will be separated from the payroll and shall retain no recall rights.
In addition to the lump sum termination allowance set forth in paragraph D-12.21, an employee who elects to leave the service of the Company will be eligible for reimbursement from the Company for actual expenses incurred for relocation costs, tuition or training costs, or job placement expenses related to seeking other employment, or any combination thereof, up to an amount not to exceed $500 for each year of net credited service (prorated for any partial year of service) to a maximum of $2,500. Any such expense for which reimbursement will be made must be approved by the Company prior to being incurred and must be incurred within one (1) year from the date of termination of employment
100
except that reimbursement for tuition or training costs will be made for such expenses incurred within two (2) years from the date of termination of employment.
An employee who is laid off may choose to elect to receive their termination allowance in weekly income continuity payments which shall be payable for the number of weeks to which they are entitled, based on their net credited service, under paragraph D-12.21. Such payments shall continue until the payment eligibility is exhausted or until the employee is recalled. Upon recall, any remaining income continuity payments shall cease. Employees who choose this payment option shall remain on a corporate recall list for a period not to exceed two (2) years. Employees who are awaiting recall and receiving weekly income continuity payments shall continue to accrue seniority and net credited service, one (1) week for each week of termination allowance paid.
Employees on the recall list shall be considered for recall to available positions on a seniority basis. That is, the most senior person on the list will be recalled first into a position for which they are qualified. Employees who are eligible to be recalled for an available position will be contacted in seniority order, by the Company by telephone and by registered letter sent to their home address. Employees awaiting recall are responsible for making sure the Company has their correct address.
Any employee who refuses an offered position on recall which is equal in status and pay to the job from which he/she was laid off will be deemed to have quit his/her employment with the Company and any remaining termination allowance shall be forfeited.
An employee awaiting recall, who worked as a regular full-time employee at the time of his/her layoff who refuses a recall to a temporary position shall not lose further recall rights nor forfeit any weekly income continuity payments.
The Company further agrees that in filling all job requisitions the active recall list shall be canvassed for qualified employees to
101
recall prior to hiring new employees or promoting employees on the active payroll who are not awaiting recall.
An employee awaiting recall and receiving weekly continuity payments may refuse a recall offer to a position at a lower pay level than the position from which he/she was laid off and continue to receive weekly income continuity payments. After those payments are exhausted, any employee who refuses a recall offer at any pay level shall be deemed to have quit his or her employment with the Company. No additional recall offers will subsequently be made to such employee.

NEUTRAL EVALUATION LETTER AGREEMENT
May 12, 2002
Mr. Jeffrey Rechenbach, Vice President Communications Workers of America 20525 Center Ridge Road, Room 700 Cleveland, Ohio 44116
Dear Mr. Rechenbach:
The parties agree to implement, on a trial basis, the following neutral evaluation process. The trial period shall be for one year and include a minimum of eighteen (18) cases unless otherwise mutually agreed to and shall begin on the date that the parties have selected all ten neutral evaluators described below. The parties can agree to extend this trial period in a written document signed by both parties.
As soon as is reasonable, following ratification of this agreement, the parties will by mutual agreement select ten (10) arbitrators who will comprise a special panel of neutral evaluators ("evaluators") to be utilized for the purpose of this process. The parties will schedule neutral evaluation days with the evaluators, where the evaluator may hear up to four (4) dismissal and/or suspension cases per day. Both parties must agree to submit each case to neutral evaluation, the case must have been timely processed through the grievance procedure and a timely request for arbitration must have been filed with the other party. Each case will be limited to ninety (90) minutes as set forth below. The cases will be evenly distributed among the evaluators as practicality permits. The parties agree to equally share the compensation and expenses of cases evaluated, except in instances where cases are withdrawn less than twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the scheduled time for the evaluation. In such event, the withdrawing party will be responsible for any cancellation fees and/or expenses incurred.
Proceedings before the evaluator shall be informal in nature.
103
The presentation of evidence and the issues heard will be limited to that which has already been presented or asserted during the grievance process. Formal rules of evidence will not apply. The parties will be represented by Labor Relations Department employees and Union Representatives, and no official record of the neutral evaluation will be kept.
Each party may have no more than two (2) individuals attend the neutral evaluation proceedings; and, each party will be limited to a half-hour presentation. When unusual circumstances warrant, the parties may mutually agree, prior to the date of the evaluation, that one additional representative may attend for either party; or, that the presentation time for each party may be extended by a period not to exceed thirty minutes.
The evaluator will be provided one half hour to question both parties in the presence of one another, and to render his or her written advisory opinion. This advisory opinion will determine whether the Company acted with or without just cause, and where the disciplinary action lacked just cause, what if any, remedy should be imposed. Under no circumstances will the Company be liable for back pay for more than six (6) months after the date of the disciplinary action.
Within five (5) working days following the evaluator's advisory opinion, a party must notify the other party in writing if the party rejects the evaluator's advisory opinion; otherwise it will be treated as accepted by the party. In instances where the parties accept the evaluator's advisory opinion of no just cause, the Company agrees to implement the remedy within ten (10) working days. In instances where the parties accept the evaluator's advisory opinion of just cause, the Union agrees to withdraw the grievance in writing within ten (10) working days.
In instances where the Company or the Union rejects the evaluator's opinion the case will be deferred to the regular arbitration process. The party seeking arbitration must request a panel of
104
arbitrators within thirty (30) calendar days following the rejection of the evaluator's opinion. Neither the fact that a case went to neutral evaluation or the decision of the evaluator may be introduced as evidence at an arbitration hearing by either party. However, each party may use the evidence presented by it at neutral evaluation in any subsequent arbitration, but may not refer to testimony provided by the other party at neutral evaluation.
The parties agree that if the Neutral Evaluation process is retained after the trial period. Article VII, Section 2 (Mediation), shall no longer be effective and shall be removed from the collective bargaining agreement.

Brian G. Keating

PART-TIME EMPLOYEES AGREEMENT
May 12, 2002
Mr. Jeffrey A. Rechenbach, Vice President
Communications Workers of America
20525 Center Ridge Road, Room 700
Cleveland, Ohio 44116
Dear Mr. Rechenbach:
This memorandum will confirm the understanding reached in collective bargaining regarding the subject of part-time employees and supersedes all previous memoranda and/or instructions on that subject.
1.	Definition of Part-Time Employees
A part-time employee is one who is employed and is normally scheduled to work less average hours per week than a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group, working the same normal daily tour.
2.	Classification of Equivalent Workweek (EWW)
All part-time employees shall have a part-time equivalent workweek.
All new hires and regular full time employees reclassified to part-time will be assigned a part-time equivalent workweek based upon what the department views as their scheduling. The assignment of an EWW to an employee does not preclude working the employee less or more hours as the needs of the business may dictate.
The Employee Records Center (ERC) shall announce each October the EWW based on the average hours scheduled/worked for the preceding (12) month period, except that any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
106
EWW will be used to compute payments to that employee for sickness disability and accident disability benefits under the "Plan for Employees' Pension and Disability Benefits". For part-time employees, the EWW is also used to determine the percent of premium payments to be paid by the employee for coverage under the Medical, Dental and Vision Expense Plan.
52 week average hours scheduled / worked - The current 52 week average will be used to calculate payment for vacation, personal holiday and excused work days.
Disability payments will be based upon either the 52-week average hour's scheduled/worked or EWW whichever is higher.
"Part-time equivalent work week" will be determined by dividing the employee's total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6 rounded to a "part-time equivalent work week" classification of 16.)
3. Net Credited Service
In determining net credited service of a part-time employee or for a part-time employee who becomes a full-time employee, credit for 1 /5 of a week should be given for each day on which the employee was scheduled a normal tour, regardless of the number of hours scheduled on that day. However, no more than 1 calendar week of credit can be granted for time scheduled in a given week.
Example:
•	Determination of the total number of days on which normal tours were scheduled
(count a maximum of five tours per week):	75
•	Conversion of scheduled days to calendar days
7 calendar days/5 scheduled days =	1.4
107
•	Calendar days of credit calculated by multiplying total number of scheduled normal tours (75) by factor of 1.4=	105
Current NCS Date Example; 08/01/80
•	Count off 105 days back from 08/01 /80. The result will be a revised net credited service date.
Example: 04/18/80
Net Credit Service for part-time employees will be readjusted by the Employee Record Center (ERC) for the purposes of time off under the Sickness Accident Disability Benefit Plan (SADBP).
Note: A part-time employee's net credited service date must be predetermined each time such date is required for benefit purposes as it continually changes. Only the Employee's Benefit Committee establishes official net credited service dates. Unofficial net credited service dates are updated weekly and shown on the part-time Data Report. These dates should be used in the selection of vacations, personal holiday, termination allowance, sickness, disability pay eligibility, seniority, pension or any other benefits for which Net Credited Service is used under the labor agreement.
4.	Wage Plan Service
The progression intervals for part-time employees shall be at 6-month intervals from "Date of Hire". (Date of Hire is the unadjusted date you were employed by the company)
5.	Payment for Tours
a.	Regular Tour
Part-time employee whose tours occur in a clock period where the normal tour for a full-time employee is 8 hours should have payment for the time worked or "allowed" based upon the actual hours in the part-time schedule.
108
b.	Overtime Tour
Employees shall be paid for all hours worked outside their normal scheduled hours as special tour hours only when those hours exceed either 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week.
c.	Evening and Night Tour Differentials and Sunday Premiums
Evening/Night differential will be paid in accordance with D-5.01.
Sunday premiums will be paid to part-time employees in accordance with D-6.01
d.	Holiday Eve Premium
An employee shall be paid 2 times the regular wage rate for all hours worked in accordance with paragraph D-7.32 of the Agreement between the Company and the CWA.
e.	In-Charge Differential
Any part-time employee designated to be in-charge should be compensated in accordance with paragraph D-3.21 of the Agreement between the Company and the CWA.
6.	Vacations
a.	Eligibility

109
b.	Payment
The immediate supervisor uses the most current weekly part-time data report to determine the vacation hours to be paid. This information is shown as the Average Hours Scheduled/Worked on the report. When an employee wants vacation days, the average hours shown for the prior 52 weeks should be divided by 5, to determine the daily vacation hours to be paid. (Example: Employee wants two days of vacation -Average Hours Scheduled/Worked = 30.24 / 5 days = 6,048 hours or 6 hours vacation pay per day. Always round to the nearest quarter hour.)
Note: If the employee's vacation eligibility is that provided for after completing 6 months and 1 year from "Date of Hire", the averaging shall be for the 6-month period preceding the vacation.
c.	Payment in Lieu
Payment in lieu of vacation to part-time employees for reasons described in paragraph D-8.12of the Agreement should be on the basis of net credited service accumulated as shown on the current part-time Data Report.
d.	Coding
Coding for vacation hours for those employees whose normal scheduled days are less than 5 should be handled as follows: An employee requesting a full week of vacation should be coded vacation five (5) days a week prorated, even though they are normally scheduled less than five days a week.
7.	Holidays
a.	Fixed Holidays Eligibility and Payment
A part-time employee shall not be paid for time not worked on a holiday or for absence due to sickness (not under the Sickness and Accident Disability Benefit Plan)
110
unless such holiday or absence due to sickness occurs on a day of the week on which the employee is normally scheduled to work, subject to the provisions of paragraph D-7.24 of the Agreement.
b.	Payment
When the employee is scheduled to work on the holiday but is excused, payment shall be at the regular wage for the normal tour hours scheduled for that day.
When the employee is required to work on the holiday, payment shall be at the regular wage rate for the normal tour hours scheduled. In addition, payment shall be at the 1-1/2 times the regular wage rate for the hours worked during the normal tour, subject to the provisions of paragraphs D-9.01 (a) or D-ll .02 and at 2-1/2 times the regular wage rate for the special tour hours worked.
c.	Personal Holiday Eligibility and Payment
The part-time employee is entitled to select a personal holiday (6) months from "Date of Hire" and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph D-7.13 of the Agreement. Payment for the holiday shall be pro-rated on the relationship of the individual employees' part-time equivalent workweek to the normal workweek of a comparable full-time employee.
The 52-Week Average Hours Scheduled/Worked information is shown on the weekly part-time data report. The immediate supervisor uses the most current part-time data report to determine the eligibility for pay.
Example: 52 Week Average Hours Scheduled I Worked - 28.80 (52 week average hours scheduled/worked) / 5 = 5.76 or 5-3/4 hours of pay for the PHP.
111
8.	Excused Work Days
Each part-time employee who has at least six months of sendee from their "Date of Hire" as of January 1 of the calendar year, shall be eligible for four (4) Excused Work Days with pay and one (1) Excused Work Day without pay, based upon the ratio of any such part-time employees equivalent work week to the normal work week of a comparable full-time employee.
52 Week Average Hours Scheduled/Worked information is shown on the weekly part-time data report. The immediate supervisor uses this average on the most current report to determine the eligibility for pay.
Example: 52 Week Average Hours Scheduled/Worked -28.80 (52 week average hours scheduled/worked) / 5 = 5.76 or 5-3/4 hours of pay for the EWD.
9.	Benefits - Medical, Dental and Vision Care Plans
Eligibility
All benefits are figured on a prorated basis, depending upon the EWW classification the part-time employee falls into. The "part-time equivalent work week" classification of each part-time employee shall be reviewed by the Company no less often than every October 1 of each year and adjusted on a prospective basis, if appropriate. In determining whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Company will consider the actual average number of hours worked during the preceding twelve (12) month period and the likelihood that such number of work hours will continue for a reasonably foreseeable period of time except that any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
For part-time employees the following schedule will apply:
a.	Employees whose part-time equivalent workweek classification is sixteen (16) hours or less shall be eligible, by enrollment and payment of 100% of the premiums, for such coverage
112
b.	Employees whose part-time equivalent workweek classification is seventeen (17) through twenty-four (24) hours shall be eligible, by enrollment and payment of 50% of the premiums, for such coverage.
c.	Employees whose part-time equivalent workweek classification is twenty-five (25) hours or more shall be eligible for such coverage on the same basis as a regular full-time employee.

After the First 7 Calendar Days:
Payment is based on hours worked in the week the absence first occurs, or on the "part-time equivalent workweek" (whichever is higher). (Eligibility for sick pay after the first 7 calendar days is in accordance with the Employees' Benefit Plan.)
Coding
Coding for disability hours for those employees whose normal scheduled days are less than 5 should be handled as follows: An employee on disability should be coded five (5) days a week prorated, even though they are normally scheduled less than 5 days a week.
113
11.	Selection of Tours
Generally, employees with a part-time classification are hired for specific hours based upon the demands of the business. Seniority will determine selection of tours amongst the part-time work group.

May 9,1993 Mr, Robert D. Johnson, Vice President Communications Workers of America
20525 Center Ridge Road, Room 400
Cleveland, Ohio 44116
Dear Mr, Johnson:
Safety is a concern to the Company and the Union. The Company and the Union mutually recognize the need for a work environment in which safe operations can be achieved in accomplishing all phases of work, and the need to promote better understanding and acceptance of the principles of safety on the part of all employees to provide for their own safety and that of their fellow employees, customers and the general public.
To achieve the above principles, the Company and Union agree to continue the Safety Advisory Committee. The Committee shall consist of not more than three (3) representatives each from the Company and the Union (to be appointed by the Company and the International Union respectively). This committee shall meet from time to time as required but at least three (3) times per year.
In an ongoing effort to promote safety in the workplace, the Union and the Company agree that when a situation is alleged to exist that could cause a serious/fatal accident or a situation is alleged to exist where exposure to conditions could cause a serious/fatal occupational illness, a joint union-management inspection will take place at the request of either party.
The Company agrees to reimburse employees for the time they spend attending such committee meetings or engaging in joint safety inspections during the employee's scheduled normal tour.
Very truly yours,

SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME PROTECTION PROGRAM AGREEMENT
May 9,1993
Mr. Robert D. Johnson, Vice President Communications Workers of America 20525 Center Ridge Road, Room 400 Cleveland, Ohio 44116
Dear Mr. Johnson:
This will confirm the understanding reached in collective bargaining regarding the Supplemental Income Protection Program (Program).
1. If during the term of this Agreement, the Company notifies the Union in writing that technological change (defined as changes in equipment or methods of operation) has or will create a surplus in any job title in a work location which will necessitate layoffs or involuntary permanent reassignments of regular employees to different job titles involving a reduction in pay or to work locations requiring a change of residence, or if a force surplus necessitating any of the above actions exists for reasons other than technological change and the Company deems it appropriate, employees under the normal retirement age as defined in the Cincinnati Bell Pension Plan or its applicable successor Plan, as of the effective date of termination of employment (whether or not eligible for a service pension) in the affected job titles and work locations who have at least twenty (20) years of net credited service and whose age and years of net credited service, in sum, total seventy-five (75) or more as of the effective date of the termination of employment, may elect, in order of seniority, and to the extent necessary to relieve the surplus, to leave the service of the Company and receive Supplemental income Protection benefits described in paragraph 4 subject to the following
118
(a)	The Company shall determine the job titles and work locations in which a surplus exists, the number of employees in such titles and locations who are considered to be surplus, and the period during which the employee may, if he or she so elects, leave the service of the Company pursuant to this Program. Neither such determinations by the Company or any other part of this Program shall be subject to arbitration.
(b)	The number of employees who may make such election shall not exceed the number of employees determined by the Company to be surplus.
(c)	An employee's election to leave the service of the Company and receive Supplemental Income Protection benefits must be in writing and transmitted to the Company within thirty (30) days from the date of the Company's offer in order to be effective and it may not be revoked after such thirty (30) day period.
2.	Subject to the limitations in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 employees who so elect to leave the service of the Company and receive Supplemental Income Protection benefits may receive in combination with such benefits either (i) a retirement service pension if eligible for such pension or, if not eligible, (ii) a termination allowance, if otherwise entitled, in an amount determined in accordance with basic contract provisions, but not both.
3.	Supplemental Income Protection payments for employees who so elect to leave the service of the Company in accordance with paragraph 1 shall begin within one month after such employee has left the service of the Company to continue until (i) 48 payments have been made; or (ii) the end of the month in which the recipient attains normal retirement age as defined in the Cincinnati Bell Pension Plan, or its applicable successor plan, whichever occurs earlier.
119
4.	For employees who so elect in accordance with paragraph 1, the Company will pay monthly as Supplemental Income Protection payments; (i) eight ($8.00) dollars for each year of net credited service (including a pro-rated amount for any partial year of net credited service) plus (ii) forty percent (40%) of the final full-time basic weekly or equivalent wage rate for the employee's job title and location adjusted as set forth in paragraph 5 for any periods of part-time service of the employee. In no case, however, shall the monthly payment hereunder exceed in aggregate a total of $400.00 per month. In addition to the monthly benefits, for an employee who so elects in accordance with paragraph 1, the Company will pay a lump sum payment based on years of net credited service (pro-rated for part-time service as set forth in paragraph 5) as follows:
Less than 25 years	$2000
25 to 30 years	$2500
30 years and over	$3000
Such lump sum payment will be made within sixty (60) days after the employee has left the service of the Company or, at the employee's option, will be made in the first quarter of the calendar year following the employee's termination of service. The maximum amount of Supplemental Income Protection benefits payable including any lump sum payment shall in no event exceed a total of $22,200.
5.	The years of net credited service and the final full-time basic weekly or equivalent wage rate as used in the preceding paragraph for purposes of determining the monthly payment and the lump sum payment shall be pro-rated for any period of time during which an employee is employed on a part-time basis in the proportion of such employee's basic rate of pay during any such period to the basic rate of pay for an equivalent full-time employee in the same job title, classification, and work group during the same period in the same manner as calculated in the Cincinnati Bell
120
Pension Plan or its applicable successor plan.
6.	In no event shall the combination of Supplemental Income Protection payments (including any lump sum payment) and any termination, layoff or similar allowance paid exceed the equivalent of twice the employee's annual compensation at the basic weekly wage rate (or its equivalent) received during the year immediately preceding the termination of service. To the extent necessary, Supplemental Income Protection payments shall be reduced by the amount of any termination, layoff or similar allowance paid to the employee so that the combination of Supplemental Income Protection payments and termination or other allowance payments does not exceed the equivalent of twice the employee's annual compensation at the basic weekly wage rate (or its equivalent) for the year immediately preceding the termination of service.
7.	As used in this Program, "annual compensation at the basic weekly rate (or its equivalent)" or "basic weekly wage rate (or its equivalent)" do not include tour or temporary differentials, overtime pay, or other extra payments.
8.	In addition to the conditions set forth above, any payments to a recipient hereunder shall be suspended upon the happening of any of the following:
(a)	reemployment of the recipient by the Company;
(b)	employment of the recipient by an affiliate or subsidiary company within the same control group of companies as is the Company.
