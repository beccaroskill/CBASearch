ARTICLE 9 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
SECTION 1.	PURPOSE.
The purpose of the grievance procedure contained in this Article shall be to provide an orderly system of resolving employee grievances in a timely manner consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. It is the intent of the parties that there shall be full discussion and consideration of grievances, based upon information available at the time of the grievance conference. The parties shall make a sincere and determined effort to settle meritorious grievances and keep the process free of unmeritorious grievances.
SECTION 2.	GENERAL.
A grievance is a written complaint of violation of this Agreement or of any personnel policy, rule, regulation, procedure, condition of employment, or mutually accepted past practice alleged to be a violation of this Agreement, or a claim of discipline without just cause. In a grievance concerning past practice, mutuality shall be one of the issues for the Arbitrator if raised by either party.
Except as provided in Section 6 of this Article, an employee of the Bargaining Unit shall have the right to process a grievance through designated Union Representatives, or independently up through Step Two (2) provided that no discussion shall be had on the matter until the designated Union Representative has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to appear and present the Union’s position at any grievance discussion. On grievances filed independently, the Union reserves the right to appeal to Step Three (3) if not satisfied with the Step Two (2) answer. Grievance settlements with unrepresented grievants shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
When the Union through its designated representative accepts a written grievance settlement offer, processing the grievance shall end. No grievance settlement may be offered to a grievant unless the designated Union Representative is present. The Union may initiate a grievance alleging a violation in the application or interpretation of this Agreement.
Any resolution of a grievance prior to arbitration shall be without precedent unless otherwise agreed by the Union and the Employer. There shall be no appeal beyond Step Three (3) on initial probationary service ratings or dismissals of initial probationary employees which occur during or upon completion of the probationary period, except that grievances alleging prohibited discrimination against a probationary employee may be appealed by the Union to Step Four (4). Annual ratings are not appealable beyond Step Three (3). Counseling memoranda and reprimands are not appealable beyond Step Three (3).
The Union, the designated Union Representative(s), and the grievant(s) shall receive notice of the time and place of the mutually agreed upon grievance conferences, and shall have the right to appear and present the Union’s position at such conferences (subject to limitations specified in Section 3 of this Article regarding group grievances and in Section 7 regarding the appearance of the grievant at Step Three (3)). At Step Three (3), scheduling notices shall be issued at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the grievance conference date. The Employer need not notify the grievant if the Union has exercised its right to waive the grievant's attendance at the Step Three (3) conference and has so notified the Employer.
A copy of any grievance filed by a member of the Bargaining Unit shall be provided to the Union before the Step One (1) conference is held. The Union shall also be provided with all decisions and appeals of grievances filed by members of the Bargaining Unit.
The term “weekday" as used in this Article shall be defined as Monday through Friday inclusive, excluding holidays.
SECTION 3.	GRIEVANCE PROCESSING.
Grievances shall be presented in writing to the designated Management Representative on a mutually agreed upon form, if available, or by written memo, signed and dated by the grievant(s), indicating that it is a grievance. Receipt of such memo begins the time period for the Employer’s response.
Prior to the scheduled meeting with management at each step of the grievance procedure, the grievant, if scheduled to attend the grievance conference, and his/her Union Representative, if a member of the Bargaining Unit, shall be permitted a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed one-half (14) hour, without loss of pay or benefits for consultation and preparation for such grievance meetings, In the UIA, nothing in this Section shall prohibit the continuation of present practices in regard to preparation for grievance conferences. Requests for time under this provision shall include the identification of the grievance for which preparation time is being requested and the estimated period of time necessary for such preparation. Overtime for participation in the grievance procedure is not authorized. The Employer is not responsible for any travel or subsistence expenses incurred by grievants, witnesses, or Stewards in participating in the grievance procedure. However, if the Employer requires a meeting location other than the grievant's scheduled work site, that location will be mutually-agreeable between the parties. No employee shall leave his/her workstation without first requesting and receiving approval of the immediate supervisor. Approval for and scheduling grievance meetings shall not be unreasonably denied.
Failure of the Employer to answer a grievance within the prescribed time limits shall result in the grievance being appealed to the next step of the grievance procedure providing the Union notifies the designated Management Representative at that next step within fifteen (15) weekdays of the expiration of the time limits for management’s response at the lower level.
Time limits for scheduling grievance conferences, issuing grievance responses, and appealing to the next step may be extended by mutual agreement.
Grievances involving like circumstances and facts affecting a group of employees within the Bargaining Unit may, at the option of the Union, be filed as a group grievance. Group grievances shall be so designated at the time of filing. The group grievances shall, insofar as possible, identify all employees and/or classifications and all work locations covered. No more than two (2) grievants may appear without loss of pay or benefits to represent the group at any step of the grievance procedure. This shall not restrict the right of the Union to have necessary witnesses appear at Step Four (4).
A grievance shall state the issue involved, the relief sought, the date the incident or violation took place, and the Section(s) of the Agreement involved.
Only related subject matters shall be covered in any one grievance. A grievance may be amended at any time up to the conclusion of the Step Three (3) conference on the basis of facts previously unknown.
If a grievance appeal or response is mailed, it shall be considered as within the time limits if it is postmarked within the time limits.
At Step Two (2) and Step Three (3), up to two Union Representatives may appear at any conference or hearing, without loss of pay or benefits, to represent the grievant.
SECTION 4.	WITNESSES AND DOCUMENTS.
At least ten (10) calendar days before a scheduled arbitration, the parties shall exchange the names of witnesses each plans to call to testify.
The Employer agrees to release witnesses necessary for arbitration without loss of pay or benefits. Whenever possible, witnesses shall be placed on call and return to work upon completion of their testimony, in order to minimize time lost from work.
Upon request, the parties shall receive documents or records which the other intends to present at the arbitration.
Upon written request, the Union shall within a reasonable time receive specific documents or records available from the Employer not prohibited by law, and pertinent to the grievance at hand. Discretion permitted under the Freedom of Information act shall not be impaired by this Section.
SECTION 5.	RETROACTIVITY OF GRIEVANCE AWARDS.
Settlement of grievances may or may not be retroactive as the equities of the particular case may demand as determined by the Arbitrator. In any case where it is determined that the award should be applied retroactively, except for administrative errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days prior to the initiation of the written grievance.
SECTIONS. EXCLUSIVE PROCEDURE.
The grievance procedure set out in this Article shall only apply to and be exclusive for all grievances permitted under Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The grievance procedure set out above shall not be used for the adjustment of any dispute for which the Civil Service Rules or Regulations require the exclusive use of a Civil Service forum or procedure.
SECTION 7.	GRIEVANCE STEPS.
In work locations where no Steward or Chief Steward is selected because the small number or scattered distribution of Bargaining Unit employees in that location does not warrant such selection, employees have the option of waiving Step One (1) and Step Two (2) and may file grievances directly at Step Three (3). In such cases, a Chief Steward, Steward, or Alternate Steward in the jurisdictional area where the conference is to be held shall be released without loss of pay or benefits to represent the grievant at Steps One (1), Two (2), or Three (3).
Subject to the objection of the other party, a grievance may be filed at any step of the grievance procedure if the issue is not capable of being settled at a preliminary step. Grievances involving involuntary demotions, suspensions, discharges, seniority, or layoff and recall actions shall be filed directly at Step Three (3) of the grievance procedure, except that grievances involving recall of UI Examiners to temporary appointments or expiration of said temporary appointments pursuant to Article 13, Section 14, shall be filed directly at Step Two (2). Grievances involving scheduling and the return to furlough of permanent-intermittent employees pursuant to Article 19, Section 3, shall also be filed directly at Step Two (2).
Informal discussion of complaints between employees and/or Stewards and supervisors is encouraged prior to filing of written grievances.
Step One: All grievances shall be presented within ten (10) weekdays of the time the employee or the Union first became aware or, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have become aware of the cause of such grievance. The designated Management Representative shall meet with the grievant(s) and his/her Union Representative and attempt to resolve the grievance, and return a written response to the grievant(s) and his/her Union Representative within ten (10) weekdays of receipt of the written grievance from the grievant(s) or his/her Union Representative.
Step Two: If not satisfied with the Step One (1) answer, the grievance, to be considered timely, must be appealed to the designated Management Representative within ten weekdays from receipt of the answer to Step One (1). The designated Management Representative shall hold a grievance conference to discuss and attempt to resolve the grievance and return a written response within ten (10) weekdays of receipt of the written appeal from Step One (1). The grievant and authorized Union Representative(s) may participate in such conferences.
Step Three: If not satisfied with the Step Two (2) answer, the grievance, to be considered timely, must be appealed to the Departmental Appointing Authority or its designee within twenty-five (25) weekdays from receipt of the answer to Step Two (2). The designated Management Representative shall hold a grievance conference to discuss and attempt to resolve the grievance, and return a written response within twenty-five (25) weekdays of receipt of the written appeal from Step Two (2). The grievant and authorized Union Representative(s) may participate in such conferences. The Union, at its discretion, may waive the presence of the grievant at the Step Three (3) grievance conference.
Step Four: If not satisfied with the Employer’s answer in Step Three (3), only the Union may appeal the grievance to binding arbitration, within thirty-five (35) weekdays of receipt of the Step Three (3) answer.
At the request of either party, including the State Employer, prior to a scheduled arbitration hearing, the parties shall convene a pre-arbitration conference. Such a conference will be for the purpose of clarifying and stipulating the issue(s) to be arbitrated, if possible; attempting to resolve the grievance; or for any other purpose mutually agreed to. Either party may propose a settlement of the disputed issue(s). If a settlement proposal is made, it shall be discussed and considered, but shall not be admissible at arbitration. The designated State Employer Representative, at his/her discretion, may participate in the conference. The party requesting a pre-arbitration conference shall make the request at least ten (10) weekdays prior to the scheduled hearing, unless mutually agreed otherwise in writing.
The Arbitrator shall be selected and the hearing conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Upon mutual agreement, the expedited procedure of the AAA may be utilized. The expenses and fees of the Arbitrator and the cost of the hearings room, if any, excluding a court reporter if requested by only one of the parties, will be shared equally by the parties. If one party provides a copy of the transcript for the Arbitrator, they shall also provide a copy for the other party.
Upon mutual agreement of the parties, the services of a private umpire, arbitrator, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, or the Michigan Employment Relations Commission may be used to resolve grievances at this step.
The Arbitrator shall only have the authority to determine compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and remedy violations thereof. The Arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The authority of the Arbitrator shall remain subject to and subordinate to the limitations and restrictions on subject matters and personal jurisdiction in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The written decision of the Arbitrator shall be rendered within thirty (30) calendar days from the closing of the record of the hearing. However, when the Arbitrator declares a bench decision, such decision shall be rendered in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the arbitration hearing.
Except as provided in Civil Service Rules and Regulations, the decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement. If possible, arbitrators will submit their opinions and awards in both printed and electronic format.
SECTION 8.	ATTENDANCE AT GRIEVANCE CONFERENCES.
Attendance at and reasonable travel time to grievance conferences and arbitration by grievants and Union Representatives authorized by this Agreement shall be without loss of pay or benefits. Union Representatives outside classified employment may attend grievance conferences and hearings at the Union’s discretion. Where more than one (1) Union Representative is present, the Union shall designate a chief spokesperson.

It is understood and agreed that any alternative to indefinite layoff contained in this Article may be invoked in accordance with its terms.
The Employer will, when layoffs are being planned, inform the Union as soon as practicable, which under normal circumstances is hereby deemed to be not less than thirty (30) calendar days. In the UIA, such notice shall list the classifications and number of Bargaining Unit positions by work location that the agency intends to lay off. In the ESA, such notice shall include the classifications and number of Bargaining Unit positions by work location that the agency intends to lay off, 14 days in advance of such layoff or sooner if available. Upon request by the Union, the Employer shall meet and discuss the potential impact of layoff upon employees in the Bargaining Unit.
Layoff, bumping, and recall of an employee{s) shall be governed by the provisions of this Article.
SECTION 3.	GENERAL LAYOFF PROCEDURES.
A.	The Employer shall determine the location of positions and the number of employees which are to be laid off by class/level. Preauthorized levels in a class series shall be considered as one level. The Employer shall then identify the least senior employee(s) at the work location where the layoffs) are to occur who will be laid off or given the option to exercise their bumping rights as specified in Sections 5 and 6 of this Article. Layoff shall be within the Layoff Unit as listed in Appendix H. Within a Layoff Unit, layoff shall be by seniority as defined in Article 12, Section 2.

D.	Non-exclusively represented employees who have status in a Bargaining Unit class/level shall not be entitled to bump into this Bargaining Unit until they have exhausted all non-exclusively represented bumping as provided under the Civil Service Rules and Regulations and Civil Service approved Departmental Employment Preference Plans. Non-exclusively represented employees who have not gained status in a Bargaining Unit class/level shall not be entitled to bump into this Bargaining Unit, except as provided in Subsection C above for supervisors. Employees in this Bargaining Unit shall not be entitled to bump into a position outside of this Bargaining Unit, and employees of other exclusively represented Bargaining Units shall have no right to bump into this Bargaining Unit unless the Union, the Employer, and the bargaining agent for such positions outside the Bargaining Unit, in their respective discretions, enter into an agreement to permit such inter-unit bumping, but then only in accordance with the terms of such trilateral agreement. Nothing herein shall be construed as an obligation for either the Employer or the Union to enter into such agreement with any party who is not a party to this Agreement.
E.	No employee with status in his/her current class/level shall be laid off from the affected class/level until all employees without status in the affected class/level who are employed in the affected class/level are laid off.

date of this Agreement. The Appointing Authority shall establish and maintain transfer lists for permanent and permanent-intermittent positions respectively which shall be based on Bargaining Unit Seniority. An employee shall request transfer by notifying the Appointing Authority in writing, with a copy to the Union, of the work location(s), work unit(s) as designated ta| which the employee desires a transfer. Transfer requests received during the window periods of March, June, September, and December will have an effective date of the first calendar day of the month after the window period.

If an employee accepts a transfer, she/he may submit another transfer request during the window period after twelve months have elapsed from the effective date of the transfer. If the twelve months would elapse during a window period, a transfer request may be submitted during said window period. For example, if an employee transfers with an effective date from July 1 through September 30, 2003, she/he may submit a new transfer request in September 2004, which will become effective October 1,2004.
An employee who has accepted a transfer sha I not be eligible for another transfer for a twelve (12) month period from the effective date of the transfer, except when an unforeseen circumstance creates a clearly identifiable hardship, or when an employee has been bumped or recalled to another work location.
For purposes of this Subsection, hardship means a documented health condition of an employee or an employee’s immediaie family (defined as spouse, children, parents, or spouse’s parents) requiring the employee’s presence or availability in another location for an extended period of time. All hardship transfer requests shall be in writing to the employee’s Appointing Authority and clearly set forth the circumstances of the hardship.

An employee shall be able to make himself/herself available for transfer to up to five (5) work locations or work units during any one of the months listed above. If an employee declines a transfer to a work ocation which she/he had requested, the Appointing Authority may remove the employee from the transfer list for such location by giving the employee written notice. An employee may at any time remove his/her name from the transfer list for a work location previously designated.
Transfers within a Department or Agency shall take preference over transfers between Departments or Agencies.
If office(s) are reduced as the result of a new office being opened, vacancies shall be filled by selecting from the three most senior volunteers for each vacancy or involuntary reassignment by inverse seniority. Employees shall be

If there are fewer than three employees on the applicable transfer list, the Employer may check the appropriate recall list and consider both transfer and recall names. Such transfer requests shall take priority over recall, except that a transfer request from an
employee who meets the requirements for a class/level under Civil Service classification standards will be honored only if there are no names on the appropriate recall list. However, during a reduction in force, bumping shall take priority over transfer.

SECTION 5.	REASSIGNMENT IN THE UIA.
The following language of Section 5 will apply only if and only when the Unemployment Insurance Agency has returned to a network of statewide branch offices to carry out its mission.
All reassignments, assignments and transfers of Bargaining Unit employees in the UIA will comply with this Article and Section.
Reassignment is the permanent assignment of employees to another work location. When the Employer determines that, in order to accomplish its mission, it is necessary to reassign employees from one work location to another to correct a staffing imbalance between work locations under circumstances where there is not a vacancy which the Employer is able to fill and the reassignment is not governed by a specific procedure in the collectives bargaining Agreement, the Employer shall use the procedure described in Subsections A through C below.
Where the reassignment is governed by a specific procedure described in the collective bargaining Agreement, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 3 Transfer; Article 14, Section 4 Filling Vacancies; Article 14, Section 6 Exchange Reassignment and Article 14, Section 7 Detailing.
When the Employer intends to utilize the procedures in Subsections A through C below, the Employer shall give the Union reasonable prior notice before the Employer’s final determination of sending work locations is made and shall meet with the Union to discuss the details of such action, including the data upon which the Employer bases the designation of sending work locations. Such data will take into consideration the cyclical nature of the work and may include the work load, scheduling systems, the types of positions affected by reassignment, and current staffing data.
A.	The Employer shall first reassign to one or more work locations (the receiving work locations) designated by the Employer those employees in the appropriate class/level in work locations designated by the Employer as sending work locations, as outlined above, whose names are on the transfer lists provided in Article 14, Section 3 for the receiving work locations. If the number of transfer names exceeds the number needed, employees shall be selected from the three most senior for each transfer needed.
B.	If an insufficient number of employees is available on transfer lists under Subsection A above, the Employer shall seek volunteers by class/level at the sending work location(s) as outlined above. If the number of volunteers exceeds the number needed, volunteers shall be selected from the three most senior for each volunteer needed.
C.	If an insufficient number of employees is available under Subsections A and B above, the Employer shall reassign employees from the sending work locations as outlined above to the receiving work location(s) by class/level in inverse seniority order.
(1)	Employees who are involuntarily reassigned pursuant to this Subsection shall receive at least fourteen (14) calendar days’ written notice. The Union shall be notified concurrently.
(2)	The Employer shall not involuntarily reassign any employee who has been involuntarily reassigned within the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period.
(3)	The Employer may only involuntarily reassign employees to a work location within a reasonable commuting distance.
(4)	Probationary employees may not be included in the reassignment if the Employer determines they are not q jalified to perform the work, but such employees shall be included in any reassignment for such class/level upon completion of their probationary period.
(5)	Exceptions to reassignment by least seniority shall be made where such reassignment would cause a clearly identifiable hardship to the employee. For purposes of this Subsection, hardship means a documented health condition of an employee or an employee’s immediate family (defined as spouse, children, parents, or spouse’s parents) requiring the employee’s presence or availability in the current location for an extended period of time.
(6)	Employees who are involuntarily reassigned shall have the option of declining the reassignment within seven (7) calendar days of receiving the fourteen (14) calendar cay notice of reassignment Employees who exercise this option will then receive a seven (7) calendar day written notice of layoff, shall be laid off, and shall have no bumping rights. These laid off employees shall have the right to have their names placed on work location and statewide recall lists pursuant to Article 13, Section 11.
SECTION 6.	REASSIGNMENT IN THE ESA.
This provision applies only in the ESA. Reassignment is the permanent assignment of employees to another work location. Whenever the Employer determines that, in order to accomplish its mission, it is necessary to reassign employees from one work location to another to correct a staffing imbalance between work locations under circumstances where there is not a vacancy which
i
the Employer is able to fill and the reassignment is not governed by a specific procedure in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Employer shall use the following procedure.
Before making an involuntary reassignment between work locations, the Employer shall seek volunteers in the class/level at Ihe work location from which the reassignment is to be made, and shall select from the three most senior qualified volunteers. If there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer will reassign the least senior qualified employee who has not been reassigned between work locations within the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period. The Employer may only involuntarily reassign employees to a work location within a reasonable commuting distance.
Probationary employees may not be included in the reassignment if the Employer determines they are not qualified to perform the work, but such employees shall be included in any reassignment for such class/level upon completion of their probationary period.
Employees who are involuntarily reassigned shall receive at least fourteen (14) calendar days written notice. The Union shall be notified concurrently. Upon request by the Union, the Employer will meet :o discuss the reassignment. Exceptions to reassignment by least seniority snail be made where such reassignment would cause a clearly identifiable hardship to the employee. For purposes of this Subsection, hardship means a documented health condition of an employee or an employee’s immediate family (defined as spouse, children, parents, or spouse’s parents) requiring the employee’s presence or availability in the current location for an extended period of time.
Employees who are involuntarily reassigned shall have the option of declining the reassignment within seven (7) calendar days of receiving the fourteen (14) calendar day notice of reassignment. Employees who exercise this option will then receive a seven (7) calendar day wr tten notice of layoff, shall be laid off, and shall have no bumping rights. These laid off employees shall have the right to have their names placed on the work location and statewide recall lists.
SECTION 7.	EXCHANGE REASSIGNMENT.
Nothing in this Article shall preclude the Employer from having the right to reassign an employee within his/her classification to another work location and to make in conjunction therewith a direct exchange reassignment in the following situations:
A.	Where an employee has been disciplined and the circumstances of the disciplinary action indicate that the employee should be reassigned,
i
consideration shall be given to moving the employee to a vacancy if one exists.
B.	When an employee requests a transfer and the Employer agrees that transfer would be in the mutual interest of both parties.
Whenever the Employer makes a direct exchange reassignment pursuant to Subsections A and B above, the Employer will first seek a volunteer for the direct exchange from the assignment location to which the direct exchange reassignment is to be made. If there is no qualified volunteer at the assignment location to which the employee is to be reassigned, the least senior employee in the particular class at such assignment location shall be selected for the direct exchange reassignment. At the option of the Employer, a probationary employee may be utilized for direct exchange reassignment ancl consideration for such use, while not mandatory, is encouraged.
Employees who are at the same class/level shall be allowed to exchange positions between work locations when the Appointing Authority finds that such exchange can be accommodated. If a proposed exchange is not approved, the Appointing Authority shall advise the affected employees of the reasons for nonapproval and afford the Union an opportunity for discussion.
SECTION 8.	DETAILING.
Detailing is the temporary short-term assignment of employees to another work location. When the Appointing Authority decides that it is necessary to detail employees for longer than three (3) consecutive work days in order to accomplish the mission of the agency, the Appointing Authority shall first ask for volunteers at the work location from which such detailing is to take place. In evaluating employees who are to be selected for detailing, the Appointing Authority shall take into account the needs of both the sending and the receiving office, and the class(es)/level(s) of the employees needed for detailing. The Appointing Authority shall then detail from among the three most senior qualified volunteers in seniority order. In the event that there is an insufficient number of volunteers, the Appointing Authority shall assign employees by class/level to be detailed in inverse seniority order. Seniority will not be considered for detailing assignments of three (3) consecutive workdays or less. For purposes of detailing in inverse seniority order, the Union President, Officers, Chief Stewards, and Stewards shall be considered most senior. Among such Union officials, the Steward shall be most senior, followed by the Chief Steward, Union Officer, and Union President.
For purposes of this Section, preauthorized classes and levels shall not be combined when the Appointing Authority determines the mix of those class(es)/level(s) which are to be detailed.
Probationary employees may not be included in the detailing if the Employer determines they are not qualified to perform the work, but such employees shall be included in any detailing for such class/level upon completion of their probationary period.
In the UIA and ESA, exceptions to detailing by least seniority where such detailing would cause a valid hardship to the employee shall be subject to review on a case-by-case basis in accordance with current practice. In other Departments, until guidelines for such exceptions are established and agreed upon through secondary negotiations, current practice in regard to exceptions to detailing shall continue.
SECTION 9.	OUTSTATION.
The assignment of staff to a workstation which is located at a facility other than the work location (i.e., an outstation) shall oe in accordance with the provisions for detailing as stated above, except that in the event there is an insufficient number of volunteers, the Appointing Authority shall assign qualified employees by class/level in least seniority order. Exceptions to such assignment because of a clearly identifiable hardship shall be made in accordance with Section 5.C (5) of this Article.	!

It is understood that each exclusively recognized employee organization will be entitled to designate one (1) representative to participate in the Labor-Management Health Care Committee.
The Plan consists of the following principal components: precertification of all hospital inpatient admissions; second surgical opinion; home health care; and alternative delivery systems.
(1)	Pre-certification of Hospital Admission ana Length of Stay. The precertification for admission and length of stay component of the plan requires that the attending physician submit to the Third Party Administrator (TPA) the diagnosis, plan of treatment and expected duration of admission. If the admission is not an emergency, the submission must be made by the attending physician and the review and approval granted by the TPA prior to admitting the covered individual into the acute care facility. If the admission occurs as an emergency, the attending physician is required to notify the TPA by telephone with the same information on the next regular working day after the admission occurs. If the admission is for a maternity delivery, advance approval for admission will not be required; however, the admitting physician must notify the TPA before the expected admission date to obtain the length-of-stay approval. There will be no limitation on benefits caused by the attending physician’s failure to obtain pre-admission certification.
(2)	Second Surgical Opinion. Effective January 1, 2003, an individual covered under the State Health Plan will be entitled to a second surgical opinion. If that opinion conflicts with the first opinion, the individual will be entitled to a voluntary third surgical opinion.

(3)	Home Health Care. A program of Home Health Care and Home Care Services to reduce the length of hospital stay and admissions shall also be available at the employee's option. This component requires that the attending physician contact the Third Party Administrator to authorize home health care service in lieu of a hospital admission or a continuation of a hospital confinement.
The attending physician must certify that the proper treatment of the disease or injury would require continued confinement as a resident inpatient in a hospital in the absence of the services and supplies provided as a part of the Home Health Care Plan. If appropriate, certification will be granted for an estimated number of visits within a specified period of time. The details of the types of services and charges that shall be covered under this component include part-time or intermittent nursing care by a registered nurse (R.N.) or licensed practical nurse if an R.N. was not available; parttime or intermittent home health aid services; physical, occupational and speech therapy; medical supplies, drugs and medicines prescribed by a physician, and laboratory services provided by or on behalf of a hospital, but only to the extent that they would have been covered if the individual had remained or been confined in the hospital. Home Health Care services under the SHPA will be continued. Details of the covered services will be provided in the SHP benefit booklet. Home Health Care shall be available at the patient’s option in lieu of hospital confinement. To receive home health care services, a patient shall not be required to be homebound. Home infusion therapy shall be covered as part of the Home Health Care benefit or covered by its separate components (e.g., durable medical equipment and prescription drugs).

LETTER OF UNDERSTAND NG
Article IV, Section I
UNION SECURITY, AGENCY SHOP
During negotiations in 1988, the parties discussed problems related to deduction of union dues and service fees for employees recalled from layoff or returning
from a leave of absence of less than one year. There may also be problems
related to such deductions for employees scheduled from furlough to permanent-
intermittent positions.
The Employer agrees to investigate and correct such problems, wherever possible. To the extent that such problems cannot be corrected through changes
in the automatic processing of dues/service fee deductions, the Employer will
revise manual processing of Employer documents related to entry on duty in an effort to make the processing of such deductions as reliable as possible.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Article 4 - UNION SECURI1Y

The instruct ons shall direct that signed cards returned to the designated representative be forwarded to the Union, as currently required by Article 4, Section 1.F.
The instructions shall also inform the designated representatives that until the Office of the State Employer notifies the Appointing Authority that the Union has implemented an approved agency fee objection procedure, no employee is required to file a membership cr service fee representation card.
The State Employer shall obtain and provide to the Appointing Authority a transaction coding list to assist in ensuring that dues and representation service fees are properly continued in the PPFUSM system.
3.	SEIU Local 31-M shall provide to employing departments adequate supplies of both membership cards and representation service fee cards on an ongoing basis.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING Human Services Support Agreement Article XIII, Layoff and Recall Section 11 - Recall from Layoff
During the course of the 1984 negotiations the issue of the expiration of recall rights for laid off Human Services Support Bargaining Unit employees was discussed. In recognition of the fact that as of Augus: 1,1984, a large number of laid off Human Services Support Bargaining Unit employees’ recall rights expired
prior to the new Agreement being reached to extend recall rights from three years to six years, the parties have agreed to bridge the recall rights for all employees of the Human Services Support Bargaining Unit whose recall rights would otherwise have expired as of August 1, 1984, that the period of time between and thereafter until August 1, 1984 and the date upon which the new
Agreement has been approved by the Civil Service Commission. Employees affected by the provisions of this Letter of Understanding shall continue to have
recall rights for an additional three years.
In order to facilitate the reinstatement of employees on applicable recall lists/
cards, the parties agree that the Departments/Agency shall have sixty (60) calendar days from the date all signatures are obtained to review the recall
documents and make any necessary changes. In he event there is a dispute over an employee’s recall rights that may be attributed to the provisions of this Letter of Understanding, the parties agree to meet and attempt to resolve the dispute. It is not intended that an error in the administration of these terms result in the displacement of employees who have been previously recalled, but result in the employee whose recall rights have been abridged being placed in seniority order on applicable recall lists.

10.	Insurance Continuation. Health Plan benefits will continue in accordance with the Act. Negotiated insurance coverages and benefits will continue as provided in the collective bargaining agreement for employees on contractual leave.
11.	Medical Leave. Up to twelve (12) work weeks of paid or unpaid medical leave during a twelve (12) month period, granted pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, may count towards an eligible employee’s FMLA leave entitlement.
12.	Annual Leave. When an employee requests to use annual or personal leave and it is determined, based on information provided to the Employer in accordance with the Act that the time is for a qualifying purpose under the Act, the Employer may designate the time as FMLA leave and it will be counted against the employee’s twelve (12) work week FMLA leave entitlement if the time is either:
a.	To substitute for an unpaid intermittent or reduced leave schedule; or
b.	When the absence from work is intended to be for five (5) or more consecutive work days.
Only leave that is for a qualifying purpose under the Act will be counted toward the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement. Where an employee has not requested the use of annual or personal leave, the Employer will not require use of such paid leave time to substitute for an unpaid FMLA leave.
13.	Sick Leave. An employee may request to use sick leave to substitute for unpaid leave taken for a qualifying purpose under the Act. Contractual requirements that employees exhaust sick leave before a medical leave commences shall continue. An employee requesting an FMLA family care leave must first exhaust his/her sick leave credits.

Article 22 - ECONOMICS
Payroll Deductions and Remittance for Educational TrustFund
The parties recognize that the State may offer state employees the opportunity for payroll deduction in conjunction with individual employees’ participation in a program similar to the Michigan Educational Trust (M.E.T.) Program. In the event the State initiates a payroll deduction opportunity for trust fund participants, members of the bargaining unit who are trust fund participants will be offered the opportunity to individually initiate enrollment in such payroll deduction program.
It is understood that initiation and continuation of the payroll deduction program is subject to the provisions of applicable statutes and regulations, and will be administered in accordance with such laws and regulations. Should the State determine to alter, amend, or terminate such payroll deduction program, the State will provide the Union advance notice and, upon Union request, meet to review and discuss the reasons for such actions prior to their implementation.
For purposes of administering contractual union security provisions and payroll accounting procedures, it is understood and agreed that such payroll deduction, if and when individually authorized by the employee, will be taken only when the employee has sufficient residual earnings to cover it after deductions for any applicable employee organization membership dues or service fees have been made.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Article 22 - ECONOMICS
In recognition of the fact that the reorganization of the Unemployment Agency will result in the closing of branch offices throughout the State, and in recognition of the fact that layoffs of employees who are unable to relocate to a Remote Initial Claims Center (RICC) are likely to result in the permanent termination of the employment relationship, the paries agree to the establishment of severance pay for such UA employees.
A.	Definitions.
(1)	Layoff - For purposes of this LOU, layoff is defined as the termination of active State employment solely as a direct result of a layoff of an employee who is unable to relocate to a RICC. Other separations from active State employment such as layoffs for reductions in force, leaves of absence, resignation, suspension or dismissal shall not be considered a layoff under the terms of this LOU.
(2)	Week's Pay - Week's Pay is defined as an employee's gross pay for forty (40) hours of work at straight time excluding such things as shift differential and "P" rate at the time of layoff.
(3)	Year of Service - Year of Service is defined as 2088 hours recorded in the State’s payroll system (see Severance Pay Schedule).
B.	Eligibility.
The provisions of this LOU shall apply only to employees with more than one year of service who have been laid off from the Unemployment Agency because they are unable to relocate to a RICC. Further, the following employees shall not be eligible to receive severance pay:
(1)	Employees who are in unsatisfactory employment status.
(2)	Employees with a temporary or limited term appointment having a definite termination date.
C.	Time and Method of Payment.
After an employee has been laid off for six (6) months in accordance with the provisions of this LOU, she/he shall be notified by the Unemployment Agency in writing that she/he has the option of remaining on the recall list(s) or of accepting a lump sum severance payment and thereby

forfeiting all recall rights. The employee must notify the Unemployment Agency in writing of his/her decision either to accept the severance payment or to retain recall rights. An employee who does not notify the Agency in writing of his/her decision shall be deemed to have elected to retain recall rights.
If the employee chooses to remain on recall and rejects the payment, the employee has the option at any time within the next six (6) months of accepting the lump sum severance payment and thereby forfeiting all recall rights. An employee who reaches such decision during the second six (6) month period shall notify the Unemployment Agency in writing of his/her decision.
An employee who has been laid off for twelve (12) months shall be notified by the Unemployment Agency in writing that she/he must choose either to accept the lump sum severance payment or to reject such payment. By rejecting such payment, the employee shall retain recall rights in conformance with the provisions of the Human Services Support Unit Agreement and shall have no further opportunity to receive severance payment. The employee must notify the Unemployment Agency in writing of his/her decision within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the Unemployment Agency's notification. An employee who does not notify the Unemployment Agency in writing of his/her decision to accept the severance payment shall be deemed to have permanently rejected such payment and to have retained recall rights in accordance with Article 13. If an employee elects to accept the lump sum payment, the employee's name shall be removed from all recall lists and such payment shall be made by the Unemployment Agency within sixty (60) calendar days of receipt of the employee's decision.
D.	Disqualification.
An employee laid off as defined in this LOU who has not elected in writing to accept severance payment shall be disqualified from receiving such payment under the following conditions:
(1)	If the employee is deceased.
(2)	If the employee is hired for any position oy an Employer.
a.	If such employment requires a probationary period, upon successful completion of such period.
b.	If no probationary period is required, upon date of hire.
c.	If a probationary period is required and the employee does not successfully complete such required probationary period and is

F.	Effect of Hiring.
If an employee has accepted severance payment and is hired in the State Classified Service within two (2) years of acceptance of severance payment, such employee shall repay to the State the full net (gross less employee's FICA and income taxes) amount of the severance payment received. Such repayment shall not be required until after the employee has successfully completed a required probationary period. Once such employee has successfully completed the required probationary period, that employee shall have a one (1) year period to make the repayment to the Unemployment Agency. The details of the method and time schedule for such repayment shall be discussed between the employee and the Unemployment Agency and reduced to writing and signed by the employee and the Appointing Authority or designee. In cases of unusual hardship and by mutual consent the one (1) year period may be extended.
G.	Payment.
An employee who elects in writing to receive severance pay shall receive an explanation of the terms of such severance pay. The employee and Appointing Authority or designee shall utilize a form which explains to such employee all the conditions attendant to acceptance of severance pay.
The employee and Appointing Authority or designee shall sign this form and the signatures shall be witnessed No employee is entitled to receive severance pay until and unless she/he has signed the above mentioned form. The employee shall receive a copy of the signed form.

regulation for payment of taxes to any federaI, state, county or municipal government. Eligible employees as indicated in Sections A-F above shall receive severance payment according to the following schedule:
(1)	Employees who have from one (1) throu gh five (5) years of service:
One week's pay for every full completed year of service, years 1-5;
(2)	Employees who have more than six (6} full years of service: Two week’s pay for every full completed year of service, years 6-10;

Section 2, J - Civil Service Health Risk Appra sal Program
This confirms the Parties' agreement to accept the Department of Civil Service-administered Health Risk Appraisal Program (hereinafter CS-HRA) as satisfying the “Riskmaster” requirements of Item II.H.1. of the 1988-89 Economic Agreement between the parties. While neither part/ herein asserts a right or obligation to bargain over the identity of a fringe benefit provider, carrier or administrator, this Agreement is based upon the fbl'owing considerations, and assurances from the Department of Civil Service (as reflected in Mr. William Blackburn’s 8/8/88 memo to the Parties):
1.	It was and is the intent of the Parties that the “Healthy Together Program" would be applicable to all unit members (not just those already enrolled in the State Health Plan administered for the state by BCBSM). The best judgement of the Department of Civil Service is that such universal application would cause unacceptable delays in implementation due to state bidding and purchasing statutes and regulations.
2.	This agreement does not alter the obligation to furnish Healthy Life and Health Action as referenced in contractual provisions. Such services are being secured through the Department of Civil Service and provided by the Appointing Authorities.
3.	The CS-HRA can and will provide services superior to those available through “Riskmaster”. Specifically, current clinical measures of height/weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels will be collected and recorded for each unit member who elects to participate, either through the services of the Health Screening Unit staff or HMOs, and the database created under the CS-HRA will be designed to provide more flexible and informative profiles (including time series) on health status of groups without jeopardizing participant confidentiality assurances.
4.	The CS-HRA program will provide participant:! with confidentiality. Health Screening Unit staff will furnish participants who desire it a list of qualified providers of health risk reduction programs and services.

6.	The CS-HRA will be piloted exclusively in the units which are currently contractually entitled to an HRA program, and only after the CS-HRA has been offered to all members of both units, and the experience gained from this pilot has been evaluated, will the results be utilized to implement the CS-HRA program throughout the state service^
The Parties have not waived their right to require that the state revise or replace the CS-HRA program in the event it is determined, by the Parties’ agreement or through the decision of a contractual grievance arbitrator, that the services provided to unit members through the CS-HRA, in their totality, are so deficient as to deny unit members those benefits they could reasonably have expected if ‘‘Riskmaster” had been implemented.

In addition, the parties agree to set up a joint committee for the purpose of creating any additional guidelines and reviewing implementation. The committee will also: be charged with identifying situations in which access to non-participating providers may be necessary and developing procedures to avoid balance billing in these situations.
The parties have also discussed the fact that there are some State employees who do not live in Michigan. The following are procedures in place for persons living or traveling outside Michigan:
Members who need medical care when away from Michigan can take advantage of the third party administrator’s national PPO program. There is a toll-free number for members to call in order to be directed to the nearest PPO provider. The member is not required to pay the physician or hospital at the time of service if he/she presents the PPO identification card to the network provider.
If a member is traveling he/she must seek services from a PPO provider. Failure to seek such services from a PPO provider will result in a member being treated as out-of-network unless the member was seeking services as the result of an emergency.
If a member resides out of state and seeks non-emergency services from a non-PPO provider, he/she will be treated as out-of-network. If there is not adequate access to a PPO provider, exceptions will be handled on a per case basis.

• If the non-network provider is not a Blues' participating provider, the provider does not accept Blues' payment as payment in full. The member is responsible for the out-of-network deductible and Co-payment. The member may also be balance billed by the provider for all amounts in excess of the Blues’ approved payment amount.
When a member has access to the network and chooses to use an out-ofnetwork provider, amounts paid toward the out-of-network deductible, copayment or out-of-pocket maximum cannot be used to satisfy the in-network deductible, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximum.

4.	If a member does not have access to the network but then additional providers join the network so that the member would now be considered innetwork, the member will be notified and given a reasonable amount of time in which to seek care from an in-network provider. Care received from a non-network provider after that grace period will be considered out-ofnetwork and the out-of-network deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums will apply. If a member is undergoihg a course of treatment at the time he becomes in-network, the in-network rules will continue for that course of treatment only pursuant to the PRO Standard Transition Policy.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
IN SUPPORT OF NATIONAL HEALTH CARE REFORM
September 1991
The Union and the Employer recognize that our nation’s health care system has reached a state of crisis. Skyrocketing health care costs threaten the living standards of workers and the financial stability of slate and local governments. Spending for publicly provided health care insurance, both for civil servants and the poor who rely on government for health care coverage, is the fastest growing component of state and local government budgets. The cost of providing health care insurance is rising as rapidly for the public sector as it is in the private sector.
In the past, the Union and the Employer have agreed to mutual efforts to control health care costs through various cost-containment initiatives. While the parties are committed to continuing these efforts, they now recognize that the problem cannot be solved through collective bargaining alone. Health care costs cannot be adequately controlled on a plan-by-plan, employer-by-employer, or even totally on a state-by-state basis. Rather, a new national framework for the health care system that works in true partnership with the states is required to solve the three related problems of cost, quality and access.
The parties agree to work jointly to achieve a national consensus for health care reform. National health care reforms should recognize the best of state initiatives, including statewide health care reforms that improve access, maximize delivery of cost-effective preventive care and that establish medical care payment programs designed to reduce overall medical costs. The parties recognize that cooperation between labor and management will increase their effectiveness in achieving changes in state and federal policy that both support.
At the national level, the parties agree to meet with Congress to begin work on approaches to achieve national health care reform that recognize the partnership role of states.
At the state level, the parties agree to the formation of a Joint Committee on Health Care Reform whose efforts will be guided by the following principles:
1.	The interconnected problems of cost, quality, and access require comprehensive solutions involving states, the federal government and the private sector.	'
2.	Immediate action to achieve a national consensus on comprehensive solutions is required, even though it may entail both short and long-term initiatives.

3.	Assuring all citizens access to affordable health care must have the highest priority. The financing of care should be shared fairly among all participants in the health care system. Health care financing must have a positive impact on international competition, preclude cost shifting among payers and assure basic care to individuals who do not have the ability to pay.
4.	A comprehensive solution will require leadership from all levels of government and the private sector to establish a national framework for health care reform which will contain costs, assure quality, and extend access to affordable care for all citizens. The practice of shifting financial responsibility for health care costs from the federal government to states and localities must end, and a stable financing base must be assured.
5.	Cost containment strategies at the state level must work together with national reforms. State level cost containment strategies may include allpayer reimbursement systems, global budgeting of capital, an expanded role for community-based care that emphasizes preventive health care, electronic billing systems, purchasing consortia for small businesses to reduce administrative costs and tort liability reform, including national practice standards and protocols.
6.	The federal government must recognize the critical role of states and localities as administrators and innovators. The federal government can assist states in their efforts to test various reform alternatives and the parties agree to study such alternatives including reducing paperwork burdens, simplifying waiver procedures for Medicaid, utilizing all-payer reimbursement systems and the utilization of cost-effective managed care.
7.	Reform should build upon the strengths of the American economic system including plurality (e.g., the choice of competing delivery systems), competition, technical innovations, and a federal/state partnership.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
SEIU COALITION
IMPLEMENTATION OF PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES
The parties have previously entered into collective bargaining agreements which provide that, working through subcommittees, the parties will explore managed care, preferred provider systems, structural changes in group insurance plans and related matters as mutually agreed by the parties, for the purpose of implementing cost containment measures in the State Health Plan and other group insurance plans on a timetable to be determined by the parties. These Agreements were approved by the Civil Service Commission on January 26, 1993.
The parties have now met in subcommittees on numerous occasions, at which they were assisted by the staff of the Department of Civil Service Employee Benefits Division. Pursuant to those subcommittee discussions, the parties now agree that, effective with the first full pay period in July 1993 (or as soon thereafter as administratively feasible), covered benefits in the area of mental health/substance abuse services will be “carved out” of the State Health Plan and provided to bargaining unit employees through a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO). The parties expect that the state would realize substantial and significant cost savings in the area of mental health/substance abuse services while increasing the accessibility and quality of such benefits by providing services not currently available under the State Health Plan. Among the additional services are:
•	A 24-hour/day, 7-day/week “800” toll-free telephone staffed by mental health care professionals to provide immediate referral and assistance to enrolled employees and their dependents;
•	A “managed care” plan providing ongoing evaluation and management of cases by professionals familiar with the most appropriate treatment settings;
•	Monitoring of provider effectiveness in the various treatment plans;
•	Direct interface with the Department of Civil Service Employee Services Program to provide for a coordinated continuum of care; and
•	Elimination of the $50/$100 annual deductible for outpatient services provided within the network.
The parties acknowledge that one of the principal underlying concepts of a PPO managed health care system is that enrolled employees and their covered dependents are expected to use a network of providers who have agreements

with the PPO administrator (“the Administrator") and, if services are obtained from non-network providers, financial sanctions will be imposed. While the final authority over such issues as scope of coverage, benefit design, and the relative responsibilities of the PPO and the patient for payment of charges is contained in the Request for Proposal and selected Vendor’s Response to Proposal, in general:
•	Covered inpatient services provided by a network provider will be paid directly to the provider at 100% of approved charges; there will be no annual deductible.
•	Covered outpatient services provided by a network provider will be paid directly to the provider at 90% of approved charges, with a 10% co-payment of the approved charge on the part of the patient; there will be no annual deductible.
•	Except during the transition period (including any extension period) described below, covered inpatient and outpatient services provided by a non-network provider will be paid by the patient who, after meeting an annual deductible of $50/person and $100/family, will be reimbursed by the Administrator for the lesser of 50% of the billed charges, or 50% of the allowable charges authorized by the PPO Administrator.
•	The annual $3500 maximum benefit for outpatient services is maintained.
Participating providers of covered mental health/substance abuse services will be selected, maintained and removed by the Administrator in accordance with standards of professional qualifications and practice established by the Administrator. Employees will be encouraged to provide the Administrator with the name and business address of any provider(s) from whom the employee or a covered dependent has received covered services so that the Administrator may contact him/her and, if s/he meets the Administrator’s standards of professional qualification and practice and agrees to accept the PPO Administrator’s treatment protocols, solicit his/her participation as an in-network provider.
1.	Transition Period. Employees/covered dependents who are receiving inpatient mental health/substance abuse services at the time the PPO is implemented will not become covered by the PPO program (but will remain in their current State Health Plan coverage) until being discharged from the inpatient facility. Employees/covered dependents who are receiving mental health/ substance abuse outpatient services from a non-network provider at the time the PPO is implemented will be afforded a 90-day transition period during which they may continue and complete the treatment plan with the non-network provider. Billed charges for covered services received from the non-network provider during this transition period will be paid in accordance with reimbursement procedures of the State Health Plan in effect prior to the implementation of the PPO, unless the provider becomes a participating provider under the network. If, at the end of the 90-day transition period, the patient has not been

authorized an “extension period” by the Administrator (as described below), and the patient continues or renews receiving services from a non-network provider, the non-network provider’s charges for covered services will be reimbursed by the Administrator at the rate of 50% of the billed charges, but not to exceed an amount equal to 50% of the allowable charges authorized by the PPO Administrator.
2.	Extension Period. The parties acknowledge that in some cases, due to the nature of the patient’s condition and/or treatment plan, a 90-day period for patients to make a transition from a non-network provider to a network provider may not be sufficient to permit the quality of services to be maintained. The Administrator will maintain and communicate to enrolled employees a procedure by which a patient may request a professional opinion from a network provider designated by the PPO Administrator on the question of whether (from a clinical standpoint) authorized treatment with the current non-network provider should be extended beyond the initial transition period. If the Administrator grants an extension period, the patient may continue receiving covered services for a period of time until the need for treatment, based on the second opinion, ends or 90 days following the expiration of the transition period, whichever comes first. During this extension period the non-network provider’s charges for covered services will be paid in accordance with the procedures of the State Health Plan in effect prior to the implementation of the PPO.
3.	Geographic Accessibility. The parties recognize that there may be areas within the state where the closest network provider is not located within a reasonable distance from the patient’s residence, and there is no expectation that one will be locating within a closer distance within the period during which covered services are authorized. If there is no network provider within a reasonable distance (as determined by the Director of the Department of Civil Service Employee Benefits Division) from the patient’s home address, the Administrator will authorize payment for covered services which are provided by a non-network provider as currently provided under the State Health Plan in effect prior to the implementation of the PPO.
4.	Conflicts of Interest. There may be circumstances in which a network provider is also a state employee, or is providing contractual services to a state agency, at a worksite where bargaining unit employees are employed. The parties recognize that employees expect and require as much privacy as possible in their relationship with their treatment provider; requiring an employee to choose between using the services of a network provider with whom the employee works, versus assuming responsibility fori a larger share of the billed charges because a non-network provider has been selected for covered services, could cause this privacy interest to be comprorjnised. The parties therefore agree that the Administrator will maintain a system of alternative provider referrals and equivalent covered expense reimbursement which assures that, at the patient's option, network providers for state employees and their dependents are neither state employees, nor providing contractual services to a state agency, at a worksite where the state employee is employed.

5,	Selection of Administrator. The parties recognize that the public policy of the State of Michigan is to obtain services paid for out of public funds through an open competitive process, and that the selection of a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services PPO Administrator is subject to this policy. The parties also recognize that their success in implementing a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services PPO can be influenced to a considerable extent by the acceptability of the PPO Administrator to the enrolled employees and their bargaining representatives. The parties therefore agree that the SEIU Coalition will be afforded the opportunity to designate one official representative of the Coalition and up to two additional observers to the Joint Evaluation Committee that is appointed by the Department of Management & Budget Purchasing Division to review bid specifications, evaluate qualified bids, and select one or more Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services PPO Administrators for FY93-94, and a single PPO administrator during FY94-95. The parties understand that it is the intent to select not more than three Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services PPO Administrators to implement such plans during FY93-94, and that the process of assigning a particular Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services PPO Administrator to the respective bargaining units will be consultative to the maximum extent feasible. The parties also understand that the JEC will evaluate the relative performance of all the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services PPO Administrators that are initially selected to provide services to groups of state classified employees during FY93-94, and that the JEC will be used to select a single vendor of such mental health/substance abuse PPO services for all applicable groups of classified employees during the first quarter of FY94-95. In the event that the vendor providing services to the SEIU Coalition is not the one selected to be the state's single vendor, the provisions of Section 1, Transition Period, and Section 2, Extension Period, above shall apply.
1. Termination of Participation, The parties understand that the agreement with the vendor(s) will contain a thirty-day cancellation clause under which the Department of Civil Service may terminate the agreement for cause. The parties recognize that the SEIU Coalition (and/or the Employer) may not be completely satisfied with the experience under the mental health/substance abuse PPO. The parties therefore agree that they will meet on a regular quarterly basis throughout FY93-94 and FY94-95, and during the month of March 1995 to review any substantive problems encountered by unit members and/or the state under the PPO; determine whether such problems can be corrected during the balance of FY93-94, FY94-95 and FY95-96; and, if so, determine what course of action will beat achieve these corrections without changes in the agreed-upon benefit design and coverages. The views of the Department of Civil Service Employee Benefits Division on these issues will be solicited and given maximum consideration by all of the parties, but will not be controlling upon any of the parties; If, as a result of this review and the parties’ good faith attempts to resolve tlfie problems identified, either of the parties wishes to propose that participatiori in the PPO be terminated at the end of FY94-95, such proposal shall be made to the other party not later

If the proposal to terminate participation in the PPO at the end of FY94-95 is supported by the Civil Service Commission, the benefits and coverages in effect during FY95-96 shall be as provided by the Civil Service Commission.

Section 11 - Confidentiality of Medical Records
During Bargaining in 1991, the parties discussed the confidentiality of medical information. In response to concerns expressed by the Union, the Employer recognizes that the “Employee Time and Attendance Report" - DMB Form A-424, asks that the employee specify only the "reason” for the employee's sick leave usage. The parties agree that detailed information pertaining to the reason for sick leave usage is subject to Article 11, Section 11 and need not be specified on DMB Form A-424. For example, it is sufficient to record “illness" but not the specific nature of the illness, or to record “attending a funeral" but not the name of the deceased, when completing the DMB Form A-424. However, the Employer has the right to require additional evidence to verify the reason indicated for the use of sick leave in accordance with Article 16, Section 3.
In the MESC, completion of sick leave affidavits is not currently required.

Section 4.	D - Types of Leaves of Absence
Subsection (2) - Medical
During bargaining in 1995, the parties discussed the concerns expressed by the Union regarding the need for appropriate review in evaluating employee requests for medical leaves of absence and the extension of medical leaves. The Employer agrees that in considering requests for medical leaves of absence, or extensions, outside of the contractual guarantee, management will exercise discretion based on the individual circumstances related to the leave request on a case by case basis. In considering these requests, the Employer acknowledges its contractual obligation in considering its operational needs, the employee’s work record, and verifiable medical information that the employee can return at the end of the extension period with the ability to perform his/her job duties.

Article 22 - ECONOMICS
Section 8. Continuation of Group Insurances.
During Bargaining in 1991, the parties discussed the issue of continuation of group insurances (“direct pay” option) for permanent-intermittent employees.
The parties recognize that a permanent-intermittent employee, upon furlough, will be offered the opportunity to continue group insurances according to Article 22, Section 8.A(3), and will have the appropriate “direct pay” forms mailed in a timely manner by the departmental Employer if the Employer does not anticipate that the employee will be returning to work within one or two pay periods.
However, if the Employer believes that the permanent-intermittent employee will be returning to work within one or two pay periods, the enrollment will be reported to the appropriate insurance plan administrator or HMO for up to two pay periods as a “premium not taken,” according to current practice of the Department of Civil Service, and a premium will be deducted from the employee’s first pay upon return to work. If the permanent-intermittent employee does not return to wort within two pay periods, the employee will then be offered the opportunity to continue group insurances according to Article 22, Section 8.A(3), and will have the appropriate "direct pay” forms mailed in a timely manner by the departmental Employer.
