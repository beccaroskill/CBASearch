It is further recognized that a competitive and viable manufacturing environment provides the only meaningful guarantee for stable and improved employment levels for present and future employees.
For this reason, the Company continues to endorse the practice that the Union will be notified of technological, work practice, or process changes that will result in the displacement of employees, in order to enable such employees to make arrangements to bid on, or move to, other jobs that may be available.
To further minimize the impact on employees that may be displaced, the Company agrees to provide special hiring consideration at other Armstrong facilities, provided recall rights are waived by any displaced employee securing employment at another Company facility,
B*22. The Lancaster Plant recognizes that employment security is essential to an employee's well being and acknowledges that it has a responsibility, with the cooperation of the Union, to provide stable employment to its workers. The parties also recognize that a healthy viable business is an essential ingredient to employment security and that employees’ efforts toward continuous improvement are essential to achieving business viability. Each FBU and the Lancaster site have specific cost, quality, and delivery measures to achieve business improvements to assure the business will first achieve and then maintain best cost supplier status. The Company will consult with the Union over the definition of these measures and the goals established for each year.
Hence, the Lancaster Plant agrees that as long as the Lancaster Plant is achieving or exceeding its business improvement objectives (as measured by appropriate FBU/site cost, quality and delivery measures), it will not indefinitely lay off employees unless compelled to do so by business conditions associated with any F8U or the entire site. Employees not fully utilized in one FBU will be assigned to work in any FBU on the site. The terms of this Employment Security and Business Improvement agreement will be in effect for the length of the current contract.
58
There are many situations that can impact a business which are not associated with employee improvement. These situations include, but are not limited to, the following:
*	significant capital improvements;
*	changes to technology impacting either product or process;
*	changes in market conditions.
Layoffs that result from these or similar circumstances will not be covered ■ by the provisions of this agreement.
H The parties agree that a continuing objective is stable employment. In an effort to reduce or remove the adverse impact of a layoff that may result, m the Company, with support from the Union, commits its best efforts to “ provide additional employment at the site to displaced employees.
An about to be laid off employee, with more than two years of company service at the Lancaster Plant and who has not had a time-off disciplinary infraction within the prior two years from the date of layoff, will be given the opportunity to apply to up to three parent company manufacturing plants for potential employment. The company agrees to provide special hiring first consideration at other Armstrong facilities in descending order of Lancaster Plant continuous service among such applicants. An interest form will be completed by the employee that along with a copy of the employee's employment record and resume will be forwarded by the company to the Shared Services Center for forwarding to the plant(s) selected, at the time they are hiring. The employee’s request must be renewed annually while on layoff and will expire upon recall or expiration of recall rights. Any employment decision rests solely with the gaining plant.
When a laid off employee secures employment at another company plant he/she will waive any recall rights to the Lancaster Plant upon completion of the probationary requirements at the new plant.
M In the event of a shut-down of an FBU, the Company will meet with Union officials to conduct effects bargaining to reduce the negative impact cn the
■| employees affected. Options such as enhancements to retirement benefits, severance pay, outplacement services and the like, will be explored by the parties. The parties commit to give their best efforts to this task. The parties ®	recognize that ERO’s require the approval of others above the Plant level.
M	B'23. Broaden management’s ability to video surveillance.
Management shall have the discretion to use video surveillance In the
( plant Ibr the purpose of protecting company property. The company
59
must notify the Union President or designate In regard to the areas of surveillance and die intended duration. This notification will be by written notice as well as telephone notification prior to activating any video surveillance.
B-24. Skilled Trades: The Company and the Union agreed during the 2002 negotiations that prior to the printing of the Agreement that the Skilled Trades Division Chairperson, and/or a designate determined by the Union President of Local 285, will meet with a Company representative to arrange Skilled Trades contractual language in one area of the Contract where it is practical to do so without duplication.
B-25. Grievance Settlement: The Company and Union agree to settle all outstanding arbitration backlog of grievances within 90 days of the contract being ratified. These settlements will not constitute or bind the parties in any past, present and future language disputes.
These settlements will conform with the rulings and decisions of the Bankruptcy Court concerning pre-petition claims.
B-26. CDL/Certification Payment: Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) for all active DOT drivers, who are drivers on file, and/or certification costs related to the job for Skilled Trades employees will be paid in the future by the Company. The licensed employees will be reimbursed after presenting a copy of their new license to management.

LANCASTER PLANT ATTENDANCE PROGRAM for LOCAL NO. 285
United Steelworkers, AFL-CLC
Revisions effective July 1,2006
PREFACE
Absence from work is a disruptive and costly problem for both the employee and the Company. The employee suffers loss of earnings that can never be recovered. For the Company, it disrupts work schedules, creates inefficiencies, affects product quality, and often adds to payroll costs.
A significant majority of employees at the Lancaster Plant are conscientious about attending work. While the Company has a right and need to expect regular attendance, there sometimes are valid reasons why a person must be absent. Employees with reasonable amounts of absences will not be affected by this program. Therefore, this attendance program takes into account the needs of both the Company and the employee.
Another major objective of the Lancaster Plant’s Attendance Program is to ensure fair and consistent treatment of all employees. This program should provide the means to achieve uniformity.
Regular, conscientious attendance on everyone's part will enable our Plant to increase both efficiency and its productivity and will certainly have a positive effect on everyone.
Site Manager
PURPOSE
The Lancaster Plant Attendance Program is designed to:
1.	Encourage employees to attend work regularly and on time.
2.	Encourage employees to inform their Supervisors ahead of time when they are unable to attend.
3.	Inform and warn an employee when an improvement in attendance is necessary and offer help when requested to solve any problems causing poor attendance.
4.	Remove from the work force an employee who, after a reasonable opportunity to do so, does not meet attendance standards.
5.	Recognize employees who display exemplary attendance through the Attendance Incentive Program (Page 6).
Points will be charged and accumulated for any combination of different types of absences which occur in a consecutive twelve-month period.
Upon return to work from an absence of 28 days or longer the employee’s consecutive 12 month period will be adjusted by the length of the absence.

SUPPLEMENT “B” LETTERS OF UNDERSTANDING
April 16, 1999
Mr. Jerry P. Eshleman
President, Local 285, USWA
202 West Liberty Street, Lancaster, PA 17603 ,
Dear Mr. Eshleman:
B-L This letter will confirm the understanding reached in our 1999 contract negotiations.
All Letters of Understanding B-2 through B-22, agreed to during the 1999 Negotiations will be in force for the term of the Agreement, unless the parties mutually agree to changes.
B-2. Effective April 1,1996, the Company will continue to make Workers’ Compensation payments in accordance with its established procedure except that payment will also be made voluntarily for temporary-total disabilities of less than seven (7) days’ duration that are accepted by the Company as being work related. Such benefits will be paid on the basis of the number of days during which the employee was totally disabled starting with the employee’s first scheduled work-day following the date of injury.
B-3. Safety Shoes: The Company will credit each employee up to one hundred ($100.00) dollars towards the purchase of safety shoes each year. The credit limit does not apply to situations where shoes are already replaced by the Company due to damage sustained in the production process.
B-4. During a period of unusually bad winter weather, when the Company declares a “snow emergency” and announces the same on local radio stations for the purpose of communicating to employees whetherwork is available, employees who find it too difficult to report for work may elect to have any such day which has been scheduled but not worked paid as a day of vacation. The employee who so elects to have the day count as vacation shall be paid one fifth (1/5) of a normal week’s vacation pay, or one third (1/3) for an employee scheduled for three 12-hour shifts, for each such week-day’s absence providing the employee notifies his or her supervisor of the employee’s desire to be so paid on the first day of the employee’s return to work.
B-5. The Company will make available a means by which employees may elect to have their regular weekly paychecks and bonus checks

1.	The credit from that deposit will not be available to the employee until the first bank working day (excluding Saturdays) following the date of the check. The Company’s responsibility shall be limited to transmitting funds in a timely fashion. Since the Company cannot control when an employee cashes a check or when a bank credits an account, differences which arise as a result of those conditions shall be matters to be handled solely between those parties.
2.	When a paid holiday occurs, the deposit will move by one day for each holiday in the week. For example, if the deposit is normally Friday, and Thanksgiving week the plant celebrates the holiday on Thursday and Friday, the deposit would shift for all employees from Friday to Tuesday of the following week. This would allow for sufficient time to deposit the money into the employees’ account.
3.	The Company may add or eliminate banks, and may terminate the program if it determines just cause exists.
4.	Any employee who withdraws the deposit authorization will be ineligible to submit another deposit authorization before one year from the date of withdrawal.

* changes in market conditions.
Layoffs that .result from jhese or similar circumstances will not be covered by the provisions of this agreement.

An about to be laid off employee, with more than two years of company service at the Lancaster Plant and who has not had a time-off disciplinary infraction within the prior two years from the date of layoff, will be given the opportunity to apply to up to three parent company manufacturing plants for potential employment.

The employee’s request must be renewed annually while on layoff and will expire upon recall or expiration of recall rights. Any employment decision rests solely with the gaining plant.
When a laid off employee secures employment at another company plant he/she will waive any recall rights to the Lancaster Plant upon completion of the probationary requirements at the new plant.

LANCASTER PLANT ATTENDANCE PROGRAM
Revisions effective July 1,1999 through the term of two(2) contract agreements
PREFACE
Absence from work is a disruptive and costly problem for both the employee and the Company. The employee suffers loss of earnings that can never be recovered. For the Company, it disrupts work schedules, creates inefficiencies, affects 'product quality, and often adds to payroll costs.
A significant majority of employees at the Lancaster Plant are conscientious about attending work. While the Company has a right and need to expect regular attendance, there sometimes are valid reasons why a person must be absent. Employees with reasonable amounts of absences will not be affected by this program. Therefore, this attendance program takes into account the needs of both the Company and the employee.
Another major objective of the Lancaster Plant’s-Attendance Program is to ensure fair and consistent treatment of all employees. This program should provide the means to achieve . uniformity.
Regular, conscientious attendance on everyone’s part will enable our Plant to increase both efficiency and its productivity and will certainly have a positive effect.on everyone. .	.
