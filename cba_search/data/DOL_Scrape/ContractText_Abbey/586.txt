In addition, the Union may request, with advance written notice to review the results with the employer. The Employer will provide the Union the Historical selling cost percentage and the percentage goal quarterly.
New hires will be eligible to receive commission upon completion of their first three (3) months of employment. They are eligible for the commission enhancement at the end of the first full fiscal quarter following their first three (3) months of employment.

APPENDIX C
ATTENDANCE POLICY
I.	GENERAL ABSENTEEISM POLICY
Macy's California believes it is the obligation of every employee to report to work on time as scheduled each day and to work their entire schedule.
II.	STANDARD
A.	Punctuality in reporting to the job is expected from every employee and is essential to the smooth operation of the business.
B.	1. An absence occurs any time an employee is scheduled to work, but does not report. This does NOT include approved time off for vacation, holidays, bereavement leave, jury duty, approved leave of absence including pre-approved sick leave, or for any other written approved reason. All employees who are unable to report to work must inform the personnel office prior to their scheduled starting time and inform them of the reason for their pending absence, and how long they will be out An employee out of work due to illness for five (5) or more working days must provide Human Resources, for purposes of SDI, current medical certification of ability to work, or inability to work. In cases of Worker's Compensation, this certification must still be provided on the first day.
2.	The Employer shall consider all circumstances presented by an employee (or union representative on his behalf) before classifying an attendance incident as an “occurrence” or “irregularity”.
C.	Absences shall be recorded into three (3) categories:
1.	Reported absences: Those in which the employee is not reporting to work but has contacted Human Resources in accordance with the above procedures. If an employee reports an anticipated return date, they do not have to call in each day, unless the return date goes beyond original anticipated return date.
2.	Job Abandonment: Failure to report to work within two (2) days of notification, or failure to report for two consecutive days.
3.	Failure to Report Off: Unless serious illness or injury precludes an employee from reporting off work,
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 71 of 94
A FINAL WARNING SHOULD BE GIVEN THE FIRST DAY OF NO REPORT. TERMINATION THE SECOND TIME AN EMPLOYEE FAILS TO REPORT.
III.	DISCIPLINE
A.	Excessive absenteeism and/or tardiness will result in a CAUTIONARY WARNING, WRITTEN WARNING. Continued poor attendance will result in a FINAL WARNING and thereafter, possible discharge.
B.	1. An employee has a combination of attendance and/or punctuality problems which exceed six (6) points in any rolling 3-month period or ten (10) points in a rolling 12-month period. Each absence will count as one (1) point. Each long lunch shall count as a !6 point or 1 full point. Each tardy and employee-initiated home-early over 15 minutes will count as a full point. Tardiest under 15 minutes but greater than five (5) will be recorded as 1/2 point.
C.	An employee who shows a clearly identifiable pattern in his/her absences and/or punctuality (e.g. Fridays, excessive short-term tardiest or Saturdays, long lunches, day off after vacation, etc.) shall receive counseling.
D.	Counseling Guidelines:
1.	An employee will be subject to disciplinary action where their attendance exceeds the deviation points below or their absences follow a pattern.
2.	Ten (10) points in a rolling 12-month period or six (6) points in a rolling quarter = Written Warning.
3.	Twelve (12) points in a rolling 12-month period or the second time in a rolling 12-month period of six (6) points in a rolling 3-month period = Final Warning.
4.	Fourteen (14) points in a rolling 12-month period = Termination.
C. 1. Except as noted in Subsection C(2) incidents will be null and void after the 12-month rolling period.
2. An employee who demonstrates a pattern of attendance problems even after the 12-month rolling period will be reinstated at the 12 point level of this Divisional Attendance Policy, for a period of four (4) months.
IV. PROCEDURES
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 72 of 94
A.	Employee's attendance records will be monitored every month. When a review indicates a failure to meet standards, the employee should be disciplined. When an employee's attendance is reviewed, and possible discipline may occur, ALL employees in the department should be reviewed. If another employee has a similar record, they too should be addressed.
B.	If upon examination, the employee's attendance continues to fall below the above standards, or the employee exhibits a clearly identifiable pattern, or exhibits a lack of commitment to improve his or her attendance record further disciplinary action may be taken.
C.	All employees must contact Human Resources for reporting absences of any kind, including going home early. All calls must be logged in and kept on file for at least one (1) year. The log sheets should also include a column for anticipated return date. Attendance tracking should be off the call-in sheets and attendance cards.
D.	Attendance cards must be kept on all employees. Attendance cards should show any attendance irregularities (i.e. home early, late arrival, absence for any reason), in addition to days worked, noting indicators listed on the bottom of the card. Attendance cards must be posted weekly.
E.	The Department and Group Managers are responsible for keeping track of daily attendance with the Human Resource Manager in tracking attendance.
F.	Department managers and Group managers should review attendance no less than monthly.
G.	When disciplinary warnings are given under this policy the Employer shall simultaneously furnish written notice to the Union.
V. COUNSELING GUIDELINES
1.	Again, consistency is a key factor in a successful attendance program.
2.	Relevant factors to consider in all cases are:
a.	Frequency-How often is the employee out?
b.	Cause-Does the employee usually have an acceptable record and is experiencing a long term illness in a given year, or is attendance sporadic?
c.	Patterns of Absences-ls the employee always absent on a Saturday, or Mondays and Fridays, or day prior to or after vacation?
http://macys.locall 01 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 73 of 94
d.	Compliance with call-in policy.
3.	Begin by being supportive. Tell the employee you want to help, don't lecture or become angry. If the employee expresses that they are having a personal crisis contributing to their attendance problem, suggest the EAP (Macy's Employee Assistance Program) to them if appropriate.
4.	Use the documentation to show evidence. Don't rely on memory-have it in front of you. Ask if they have any comments.
VI. DEFINITIONS
1.	ABSENCE-Failure of an employee to report to work when scheduled, or unscheduled time off the job (unless time off approved by executive or is a certified workers compensation illness/injury), consecutive absences for the same reason shall be deemed one incident.
2.	TARDY-Failure of an employee to report to their work station within five (5) minutes of their schedule, or punch in within five (5) minutes of their scheduled time.
5-14 minutes = 1/z point
15 or more minutes = 1 point
3.	HOME EARLY-Failure of the employee to work their full scheduled shift if initiated by the employee and not approved by the manager.
4.	LONG LUNCH-Failure of the employee to return from meals or breaks in their allotted or agreed upon time.
5-29 minutes tardy = 1/2 point
30 or more minutes tardy = 1 point
5.	JOB ABANDONMENT-Failure to report to work within two (2) days of notification, or failure to report for two (2) consecutive days. 6
6. ATTENDANCE IRREGULARITY/INCI DENT-Any time an employee arrives late, leaves early, or is not at work (other than approved times specified).
VIL GRIEVANCE RIGHTS AND SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm	1 /31/2005
Contract
Page 74 of 94
A. Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to waive any of the Union's rights or obligations to grieve the . application of this policy to an individual employee who has completed the probationary period. The parties agree the Divisional Attendance Policy applies to all non-probationary bargaining unit employees.
Any employee who currently has nine (9) or less points under the Divisional Attendance guidelines shall be deemed to have zero points under this policy effective on date of approval by the parties.
An employee having either 10 or 11 points under the guidelines will be deemed to have nine (9) points under the policy, deletion to be the oldest incidents.
VIII. ATTENDANCE CREDITS
Grace Period
Each associate has 7 1 2 3/z "grace points" in a rolling twelve (12) months period or 5 1/2 "grace points" in a rolling three (3) month period under the current attendance policy before any disciplinary counseling is begun.
Credit Points
Associates shall earn 1/2 credit that will be applied to these "grace points" under the following parameters:
1. Volunteering to change any scheduled day off, to accommodate business needs after a final schedule has been posted or changing an approved scheduled personal/floating holiday or vacation to accommodate business needs.
2. A maximum of eight (8) credits may be earned in a rolling twelve (12) month period.
3. The Employer shall apply the credit points to the employee’s attendance record.
Rewards
At the end of each calendar year each associates who has zero (0) attendance points will earn a day off with pay that may be taken in the following calendar year under the same guidelines that apply to vacation days. If an associate has zero (0) points for two (2) consecutive years thereafter they earn one (1) day per year up to a maximum of five (5) days.
We further agreed any dispute with the terms of the agreement will be placed before the mediator for

resolution.
APPENDIX D
LEAVE^ILABSENCEANDTIMEjOFF
At some point in your career, you may need to request a leave of absence/time off.
Your eligibility and whether the leave is paid are determined by several factors. These include the reason for the leave, your length of service, and your hours worked. Different kinds of leaves of absence may run concurrent with each other and/or with paid time off.
To request a leave, contact your Human Resources representative and your manager. A Human Resources representative will provide the necessary forms, information, explain the procedure, and advise you what kinds of leave may be available, whether or not you qualify, and whether the leave will be paid or unpaid. Most leave time is unpaid. If you have used up all the time available on one kind of leave and request additional time off, the Company will explore whether another type of leave might be available to you. Leave eligibility often depends on the information you provide us, so be sure to respond promptly and fully to any requests for information, doctor’s certifications, etc.
The following types of leave and/or time off are available subject to eligibility requirements. Eligibility, amount of leave time available, and other specifics and limitations vary depending on the state you work in and the type of leave. Additional information on each of these leaves is available from your Human Resources representative.
•	Personal - Time off for personal reasons not covered by other specific types of leave. Employees must take any unused vacation concurrent with a personal leave.
o Military - To attend scheduled drills, training, or active duty.
•	Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation - For employee to voluntarily enter a drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, provided the leave does not pose any undue hardship on the Company.
•	Domestic Violence/Sexual Assault Leave - Time off for victims of domestic violence or sexual assault to obtain help from a court, seek medical attention, obtain psychological counseling, or participate in safety planning, such as permanent or temporary relocation.
•	Volunteer Firefighters - Leave of up to 14 days per calendar year for firefighter training.
http://macys.locall 01 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 76 of 94
•	Bereavement - Up to 3 working days off in the event of a death in the immediate family (spouse, child, grandchild, mother, father, sister, brother, mother-in-law, father-in-law, stepparent, grandparent, domestic partner or roommate ).
•	Jury/Witness Duty - Time off to fulfill jury or witness obligations.
•	Time Off to Vote - Up to two hours unpaid time off if necessary to vote.
•	Time Off for School Children - Up to eight hours a month or 40 hours in a calendar year to participate in a child’s school activities, including meetings about discipline or suspension.
•	Pregnancy Disability - For employees who are disabled because of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, as certified by a health care provider.
California’s employees must review the appendix to this handbook regarding pregnancy disability leaves as provided under California state law.
•	Disability - For regular employees in the event of their own illness or injury which makes them unable to work a full work week or more, as certified by a health care provider.
•	Family Care and Medical Leave - Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”), employees with at least 12 months of service and who have worked at least 1250 hours in the 12 month period prior to the beginning of the leave, may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for:
•	Care of the employee’s newly born, newly adopted or new foster child.
•	Care of a child with a serious health condition.
•	Care of a spouse or parent who has a serious health condition.
•	The employee’s own serious health condition.
Other leaves may also be available for childbirth and for the care of a newborn, foster child or adopted child. Please contact your Human Resource Manager for more information on regarding leaves for these purposes. The following notice reviews in detail family care and medical leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”). The FMLA benefits described below are available to eligible employees throughout the United States and Guam. For California employees, review the appendix to this handbook for the policy that applies to you under the California Family Rights Act and California Pregnancy Disability Law.
FMLA LEAVE POLICY
Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, you are eligible to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid
http://macys.locall01.com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract	Page 77 of 94
Family and Medical Leave within any 12-month period and be restored to the same or a comparable position upon your return from leave provided: (1) you have worked for the Company for at least 12 months, and for at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months; and (2) are employed at a worksite that has 50 or more employees within a 75 mile radius. The 12-month period in which you may take 12 weeks of leave will be measured as a “rolling” 12-month period dating back from the time you request leave to begin.
1.	ReasonJocLeaye
You may take Family and Medical Leave for any of these reasons: (1) the birth of a child and to care for such child; (2) the placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly-placed child; (3) to care for a spouse, child, or parent (“family member”) with a serious health condition; or (4) because of your own serious health condition which renders you unable to perform an essential function of your position. Leave because of reasons “1” or “2” must be completed within the 12-month period beginning on the date of birth, adoption, or placement. In addition, where both spouses are employed by the Company and they request leave because of reasons “1” or “2”, they may only take a combined total of 12 weeks leave for such purposes during any 12-month period.
2.	Notice^tLeave
If your need for Family and Medical Leave is foreseeable, you must give the Company at least 30 days prior notice of the need for leave, preferably written. If this is not possible, you must at least give notice as soon as practicable (generally within one to two business days of learning of your need for leave). Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delay of leave. Additionally, if you are planning a medical treatment, you must consult with the Company first regarding the dates of such treatment. Where the need for leave is not foreseeable, you should notify the Company as soon as possible and practical.
3.	MedicaLCertification
If you are requesting leave because of your own or a covered family member’s serious health condition, you must provide appropriate medical certification from the relevant health care provider within 15 calendar days after you request leave, if practicable. You may obtain Health Care Provider Certification Forms from your Human Resource Manager or an Employee Service Area. If your leave is foreseeable, you must provide the medical certification before leave begins. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may be grounds for delay of leave.
The Company, at its expense, may require an examination by a second health care provider designated by the Company, if it reasonably doubts the medical certification you initially provide for your own
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 78 of 94
serious health condition. The Company, at its expense, may require an examination by a second health . care provider designated by the Company, if it reasonably doubts the medical certification you initially provide for your own serious health condition.
If the second opinion conflicts with the original medical certification, the Company, at its expense, may retain a third, mutually agreeable, health care provider to conduct an examination and provide a final and binding opinion.
The Company may require subsequent medical re-certification at the expiration of your previous certification. Failure to provide requested re-certification within 15 days, if such is practicable may result in delay of further leave until such certification is provided.
4.	RepQrting_While_on_Leaye
If you take leave because of your own serious health condition or to care for a family member, we may require you to contact us every 30 days regarding the status of the condition and your intention to return to work. In addition, you must give notice as soon as practicable (within two business days if feasible) if the dates of leave change or are extended or initially were unknown.
5.	Leave_is_Partiany_Paid
You may be eligible to receive under the Paid Family Care Leave Act, up to 6 weeks partially paid leave under Family Temporary Disability Insurance, and you may also be eligible for short or long-term disability payments and/or workers’ compensation benefits. Those plans are described in the benefit information brochure, “Macy’s More You”. If you request leave because of a birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, your unused vacation accrual and any paid time off will first be substituted for unpaid Family and Medical Leave. If you request leave for a pregnancy-related disability, or any disability for your own serious health condition, you may use your unused vacation accrual if you desire. However, if you request leave because of your own serious health condition, your Family and Medical Leave will run concurrently with other Company provided leave, except where prohibited by law. The substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time does not extend the 12-week leave period. Further, in no case may the substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time result in you receiving more than 100% of your salary.
6.	Me4icaLand_Qther_Benefits
For the first 12 weeks of an approved Family and Medical Leave, the Company will maintain your health benefits as if you continued to be actively employed. If you take a leave for disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition and follow that leave with a leave to care for your
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm	1/31 /2005
Contract
Page 79 of 94
newborn child, your leave may exceed 12 weeks, but we will only pay the company contribution for medical benefits for the first 12 weeks you are on leave. If paid leave is substituted for unpaid Family and Medical Leave, the Company will deduct your portion of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If your leave is unpaid, you must pay your portion of the premium through direct payment to Federated Finance. (The address is available from your Human Resources representative). Your health care coverage may end if your premium payment is more than 30 days late. If your payment is more than 30 days late, we will send you a letter to this effect. If we do not receive your co-payment within 15 days of that letter, your coverage will end. If you elect not to return to work for at least 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period, you will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the health benefit premiums paid by the Company for maintaining coverage during your unpaid leave, unless you cannot return to work because of a serious health condition of you or a family member or other circumstances beyond your control.
7.	Exemption for Highly Compensated Employees
Highly-compensated employees (i.e., the highest paid 10% of salaried employees within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite) may not be returned to their former or equivalent position following a leave if restoration of employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the Company. The Company on a case-by-case basis will make this fact-specific determination. The Company will notify you if you qualify as a “highly compensated” employee, if the Company intends to deny reinstatement, and of your rights in such instances.
8.	Jntenniltent_anjLRe4u^
Leave because of a serious health condition, including pregnancy-related disabilities, may be taken intermittently (in separate blocks of time due to a single health condition) or on a reduced-leave schedule (reducing the usual number of hours you work per workweek or workday) if medically necessary. Employees also may be eligible for intermittent leave for bonding purposes following the birth or placement of a child in increments of two weeks, except for two occasions where the amount of time can be less. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your salary based on the amount of time actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position that better accommodates your recurring leave and has equivalent pay and benefits.
9.	Returning from Leave
If you take leave because of your own serious health condition, (except if you are taking intermittent leave) you will be required to provide medical certification that you are fit to resume work. Employees failing to provide a required Return to Work Medical Certification will not be permitted to resume work

Contract
Page 80 of 94
until it is provided. Under most circumstances, an employee who returns from Family and Medical Leave will be reinstated to his or her original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. However, an employee has no greater right to reinstatement than if she or he had been continuously employed rather than on leave. In addition, employees who do not return to work are not entitled to an accrual of seniority or employment benefits that may have occurred during a leave period.
10.	Extended-LeaveJpr_S.erious_Health_CQndition
Leave taken because of your own serious health condition may be extended where it appears an extension will allow you to return to work in the readily and foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Such extended leave is based on: (1) written request to the Company; (2) medical certification that the serious health condition has continued and an extension of leave will allow you to return to work in the readily foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) approval by the Company. If you do not return to work on the originally scheduled date or if you do not request in advance an extension of the agreed-upon leave, providing appropriate documentation, you will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned your job. If you request an extension of your leave beyond the initial 12-week period, submit the request and supporting documents before your original leave expires. In addition, you must provide an updated medical certification each month that the leave is extended. Reinstatement is not guaranteed on an extended leave and depends on Company needs.
11.	No_Work_While_onXeaYe
Working a non-Company job inconsistent with the restrictions provided by your health care provider while on Family and Medical Leave or any other authorized leave of absence is considered a voluntary resignation. Unless on intermittent leave, you may not perform any work for the Company during the time period your health care provider certifies you are disabled from work.
CALIFORNIA PREGNANCY DISABILITY LEAVE
If you are disabled by pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, you are eligible to take a pregnancy disability leave (“PDL”). If you are affected by pregnancy or a related medical condition, you are also eligible to transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or to less strenuous or hazardous duties, if such a transfer is medically advisable and can be reasonably accommodated. In addition, if it is medically advisable for you to take intermittent leave or work a reduced leave schedule, the Company may require you to transfer temporarily to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave. The PDL is for any period(s) of actual disability caused by your pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition up to four months (or 88 workdays
http://macys.locall01.com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 81 of 94
for a full-time employee) per pregnancy. The PDL does not need to be taken in one continuous period of time, but can be taken on an as-needed basis. Time off needed for prenatal care, severe morning sickness, doctor-ordered bed rest, childbirth, and recovery from childbirth is covered by your PDL. Generally, we treat your pregnancy disability the same as we treat other disabilities of similarly-situated employees.
You are required to obtain a certification from your health care provider of your pregnancy disability or the medical advisability of a transfer. The certification should include: the date on which you became disabled due to pregnancy or the date of the medical advisability of a transfer; the probable duration of the period(s) of disability or the period(s) for the advisability of a transfer; and, a statement that, due to the disability, you are either unable to work at all or to perform any one or more of the essential functions of your position without undue risk to yourself or to other persons; or a statement that, due to your pregnancy, a transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position or duties is medically advisable. As a condition of your return from PDL, or transfer, the Company requires you to obtain a release to return to work from your health care provider stating that you are able to resume your original job duties.
At your option, you can use your unused vacation accrual for the year as part of your PDL before taking the remainder of your leave on an unpaid basis. Macy’s Disability leave runs concurrently with PDL. The substitution of any paid leave will not extend the duration of your PDL. If you do not return to work on the originally scheduled return date or request in advance an extension of the agreed upon leave with an appropriate medical certification, you will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned your employment with the Company. Failure to notify the Company of your ability to return to work when it occurs, or your continued absence from work because your leave must extend beyond the maximum time allowed, may be deemed a voluntary resignation of your employment with the Company, unless you are entitled to Family and Medical Leave. Upon your return from PDL, you will be reinstated to your same position in most instances. Taking a PDL may affect certain of your benefits. If you want more information regarding our eligibility for a leave and the impact of the leave on your benefits, please contact your Human Resource representative. Please refer to the “Family and Medical Leave” policy in this Handbook for additional information. If you remain disabled after you have exhausted PDL benefits, you may be eligible for additional leave under other laws and/or Company policy. See Human Resources.
CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT (“CFRA”)
The following notice reviews in detail the California Family Rights Act:
THE LEAVE POLICY
Under the CFRA, you are eligible to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid Family and Medical
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 82 of 94
Leave within any 12-month period and be restored to the same or a comparable position upon your return from leave provided: (1) you have worked for the Company for at least 12 months, and for at least 1250 hours in the last 12 months; and (2) are employed at a worksite that has 50 or more employees within a 75 mile radius. The 12-month period in which you may take 12 weeks of leave will be measured as a “rolling” 12-month period dating back from the time you request leave to begin.
REASON FOR LEAVE
You may take leave under the CFRA policy for any of the following reasons: (1) the birth of a child and to care for such child; (2) the placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care and to care for such child; (3) to care for a spouse, child, or parent (“family member”) with a serious health condition; or (4) because of your own serious health condition which makes you unable to perform an essential function of your job. Leave for reasons (1) or (2) must be completed within the 12-month period beginning on the child's date of birth, adoption, or placement. If both spouses are employed by the Company and they request leave because of reasons (1) or (2), they may only take a combined total of 12 weeks leave for such purposes during any 12-month period.
NOTICE OF LEAVE
If your need for leave is foreseeable, you must give the Company at least 30 days prior notice of the need for leave, preferably written. If this is not possible, you must at least give notice as soon as practicable (generally within one to two business days of learning of your need for leave). Failure to provide such notice may be grounds for delay of leave. Additionally, if you are planning a medical treatment, you must consult with the Company first regarding the dates of such treatment. Where the need for leave is not foreseeable, you should notify the Company as soon as possible and practical.
MEDICAL CERTIFICATION
If you are requesting leave because of your own or a covered family member’s serious
health condition, you must provide appropriate medical certification from the relevant health care provider within 15 calendar days after you request leave, if practicable. You may obtain Health Care Provider Certification Forms from your Human Resource Manager or an Employee Service Area. If your leave is foreseeable you must provide the medical certification before leave begins. Failure to provide requested medical certification in a timely manner may be grounds for delay of leave.
The Company, at its expense, may require an examination by a second health care provider designated by the Company, if it reasonably doubts the medical certification you initially provide for your own serious health condition.
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 83 of 94
The Company, at its expense, may require an examination by a second health care provider designated by the Company, if it reasonably doubts the medical certification you initially provide for your own serious health condition. If the second health care provider’s opinion conflicts with the original certification, the Company, at its expense, may retain a third, mutually agreeable, health care provider to conduct an examination and provide a final and binding opinion. The Company may require subsequent medical re-certification at the expiration of your previous certification. Failure to provide requested re-certification within 15 days, if such is practicable, may result in delay of further leave until such certification is provided.
REPORTING WHILE ON LEAVE
If you take leave because of your own serious health condition or to care for a covered family member, we may require you to contact the Company every 30 days regarding the status of the condition and your intention to return to work. In addition, you must give notice as soon as practicable (within two business days if feasible) if the dates of leave change or are extended or initially were unknown.
Leave is Partially Paid
You may be eligible to receive under the Paid Family Care Leave Act, up to 6 weeks partially paid leave under Family Temporary Disability Insurance, and you may also be eligible for short or longterm disability payments and/or workers’ compensation benefits. Those plans are described in the benefit information brochure, “Macy’s More You”. If you request leave because of a birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, your unused vacation accrual and any paid time off will first be substituted for unpaid leave. If you request leave for a pregnancy related disability, or any disability for your own serious health condition, you may use your unused vacation accrual if you desire. However, if you request leave because of your own serious health condition, your leave will run concurrently with other Company provided leave, except where leave is provided to California employees for pregnancy disability. The
substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time does not extend the 12-week leave period. In no case may the substitution of paid leave time for unpaid leave time result in you receiving more than 100% of your salary.
MEDICAL AND OTHER BENEFITS
For the first 12 weeks of an approved Family and Medical Leave, the Company will maintain your health benefits as if you continued to be actively employed. If you take a leave for disability caused by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition and follow that leave with a leave to care for your newborn child, your leave may exceed 12 weeks, but the Company will only pay the company
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract
Page 84 of 94
contribution for medical benefits for the first 12 weeks you are on leave. If paid leave is substituted for unpaid leave, the Company will deduct your portion of the health plan premium as a regular payroll deduction. If your leave is unpaid, you must pay your portion of the premium through direct payment to Federated Finance. The address is available from your Human Resources representative, who also will provide you with a schedule of payments. Your health care coverage may end if your premium payment is more than 30 days late. If your payment is more than 30 days late, we will send you a letter to this effect. If we do not receive your co-payment within 15 days of that letter, your coverage will end. If you elect not to return to work for at least 30 calendar days at the end of the leave period, you will be required to reimburse the Company for the cost of the health benefit premiums paid by the Company to maintain coverage during your unpaid leave, unless you cannot return to work because of a serious health condition of you or a family member or other circumstances beyond your control.
EXEMPTION FOR HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES
Highly-compensated employees (i.e., the highest paid 10% of salaried employees within 75 miles of the employee’s worksite) may not be returned to their former or equivalent position following a leave if restoration of employment will cause substantial and grievous economic injury to the Company. The Company on a case-by-case basis will make this fact-specific determination. The Company will notify you if you qualify as a “highly compensated” employee, if the Company intends to deny reinstatement, and of your rights in such instances.
INTERMITTENT AND REDUCED SCHEDULE LEAVE
Leave because of a serious health condition, including pregnancy-related disabilities, may be taken intermittently (in separate blocks of time due to a single health condition) or on a reduced-leave schedule (reducing the usual number of hours you work per workweek or workday) if medically necessary. Employees also may be eligible for intermittent leave for bonding purposes following the birth or placement of a child in increments of two weeks, except for two occasions where the amount of time can be less. If leave is unpaid, the Company will reduce your salary based on the amount of time actually worked. In addition, while you are on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, the Company may temporarily transfer you to an available alternative position that better accommodates your recurring leave and has equivalent pay and benefits.
RETURNING FROM LEAVE
If you take leave because of your own serious health condition, (except if you are taking intermittent leave) you may be required to provide medical certification that you are fit to resume work. Employees failing to provide a required Return to Work Medical Certification will not be permitted to resume work until it is provided.
http://macys.loca! 101 .com/contract.htm
1/31/2005
Contract	Page 85 of 94
Under most circumstances, an employee who returns from CFRA will be reinstated to his or her original job or to an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. However, an employee has no greater right to reinstatement than if she or he had been continuously employed rather than on leave. In addition, employees who do not return to work generally are not entitled to an accrual of seniority or employment benefits that may have occurred during a leave period.
EXTENDED LEAVE FOR SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS
Leave taken because of your own serious health condition may be extended where it
appears an extension will allow you to return to work in the readily and foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. Such extended leave is based on: (1) written request to the Company; (2) medical certification that the serious health condition has continued and an extension of leave will allow you to return to work in the readily foreseeable future and perform your essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) approval by the Company. If you do not return to work on the originally scheduled date or if you do not request in advance an extension of the agreed-upon leave, providing appropriate documentation, you will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned your job. If you request an extension of your leave beyond the initial 12-week period, submit the request and supporting documents before your
original leave expires. In addition, you must provide an updated medical certification each month that the leave is extended. Reinstatement is not guaranteed on an extended leave and depends on Company needs.
