Such notice shall be in writing with a copy to the “Union," as provided herein.
Witnesseth:
WHEREAS, the parties have met and bargained collectively, and in consideration of the mutual promises herein contained,
The Parties Hereby Agree as Follows:
2
ARTICLE I. (Continued)
Article I.
RECOGNITION
(a)	The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agency as to rates of pay, hours of work and conditions of employment for all physical employees of the Company in the departments and classifications listed in the attached appendix. This recognition is based on the Union's certification by the National Labor Relations Board on November 26, 1947, as the representative for collective bargaining purposes for all production and maintenance employees of the Key Span Corporation and its predecessor Companies, the Queens Borough Gas and Electric Company and the Nassau and Suffolk Lighting Company (as more specifically set forth in said certification).
•' The Union is also recognized as bargaining agency for employees in new classifications hereafter established by mutual agreement and covered by this Agreement. New jobs will be established in accordance with Article XXI(c).
(b)	It is agreed that all employees covered by this Agreement, and persons employed for employment (other than part time employment) hereafter for job classifications covered by this Agreement, or transferred to employment in such job classification, as a condition of employment, shall be required to obtain and maintain membership in the Union, but such employees shall have thirty (30) days from the date of employment or transfer to obtain such ■ membership, and the Union agrees that such membership will be available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members.
(c)	If an employee covered by this Agreement, or employed for employment (other than part time employment) hereafter for job classifications covered by this Agreement, or transferred to employment in such job classifications, shall fail to obtain and maintain membership in the Union as provided in Article I (b) above, the Company shall within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from the Union (the employee having been similarly notified) discharge such employee. The Company and the Union agree to cooperate, in the event chat any substantial discharge should be required, so that such discharge shall not unduly interfere with normal operations of the Company,
(d)	The Company agrees to deduct from the pay of those members of the Union covered by this Agreement, the Union
ARTICLE L (Continued)3
membership dues of such members who have signed individual assignments for such deductions. These assignments shall be irrevocable for one (1) year following the date signed, or until the anniversary date of this Agreement, whichever is sooner, but the Company may terminate such deductions in the event the employee's employment is terminated or the employee's position is no longer subject to this agreement. Equal deductions shall be made over a fifty-two (52) week period so that the amounts deducted shall reflect the current month's dues of such employees, and the amount shall be remitted to the Union at its headquarters, 745 Kings Highway, Hauppauge, New York, 11788, not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month following the month in which deductions were made.
(e> The Company agrees that in the event the present practices and policies pertaining to the contracting of work are to be extended or changed, the Union shall be advised in advance and given a reasonable opportunity to meet with me Company and discuss die matter. Other things being equal, preference is to be given to contractors whose employees are affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The Company will make every effort to stabilize employment in the various departments of the Company within the limits announced to the Union, and agrees that contracting of work will not be used as a means of disturbing such stabilization.
(0 The Union recognizes that die supervision and control of all operations, and the direction of working forces, are vested exclusively in the Company, and the Union recognizes the right of the Company to hire, discharge, layoff, suspend, discipline, promote, demote, or transfer any employee or employees of the Company; such right is subject, however, to (he limitations hereinafter imposed by this Agreement,
(g)	The Union agrees that its members, who are employees of the Company, will individually and collectively perform efficient work and service, and that they will avoid and discourage waste of materials, time and manpower, and that they will use their influence and best efforts to protect the property of the Company and its interests and to prevent Loss of tools and materials, and that they will cooperate with die Company in promoting and advancing the welfare of the Company and the service at all times. In advancing these concepts, the Company and the Union agree to form work methods committees. Quality Circles (whose membership will be voluntary), and other forums to develop more efficient and cost effective work practices, methods and procedures. Any revisions to existing agreements will be subject
4
ARTICLE I. (Continued)
to mutual agreement between the Company and the Union in accordance with Article 1 (i) of this Agreement. .	,
(g-1) The Company and die Union, agree that the operation br application of the various provisions of this Agreement shall in no way serve to discriminate against any individuals with respect to their compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or otherwise affect their status as an employee because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, maritai.status, sexual orientation, veteran status, or citizenship status.	.
(h)	The Company shall, upon the certification by the Union, allow any six (6) members of the Union as full-time officers, to represent Local 1049 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on the property of the KeySpan Corporation, and to be on leave of absence, without pay, during their terms of office as such full time officers. The Company hereby agrees that within thirty (30) days of the termination of said employees' services as such Union officers, they may return to positions with the Company at least equivalent to those which they left without interruption in their seniority and at the prevailing rate of pay.- If other employees received a promotion because the Union officials left, it is understood that demotions shall be made on their return to the employ of the Company, if necessary, to make room for their return. Leave of absence for other Union officials may be arranged by mutual agreement.
•	(i) Wherever the words "mutual agreement" appear in this
Agreement, it is understood that the Company and the Union will reach agreement based on “reasonable operating and maintenance requirements”. It is not the intent that the pbrase “mutual agreement,” wherever it appears in this Agreement, shall be utilized as a veto on operations, nor shall it limit the Company in instituting reasonable changes in practices and/or procedures. In the event that a .matter subject to “mutual agreement” is not resolved, die issue may be submitted to .grievance, procedures provided in Article XVIf of this Agreement.	.
(j) The Company and the Union recognize that the introduction of new equipment and procedures and the development of better methods of performing work are essential to the continued well-being of the business. The Company and the Union agree to establish, on a trial basis, "Work Methods Committees” in various Departments presently not having a Work Methods Committee and where it is deemed that such committees would be appropriate. It would .be the function of such
ARTICLE I. (Continued)
5
committees to review, from a standpoint of efficiency and safety, changes in methods or equipment which would materially affect work practices. Any issue concerning the establishment or continuance of a Work Methods Committee will be submitted to the appropriate member of the Company's General Negotiating Committee for resolution. In consideration, therefore, the Company agrees that no regular employee of the Company on completion of five (5) years of active service shall be subject to a lay-off or a reduction in rate solely because of the introduction by the Company of new equipment, procedures and methods' The Company further agrees that no regular employee of the Company upon completion of five (5) years of active service shall be subject to a lay-off during a period that outside contractors are performing work for the Company which is normally performed by the Company forces; provided that the employee has the skills to perform the work being performed by the outside contractors and further that equipment and sufficient manpower is available to complete the project in the time allocated.
0-1) Employees who become excess as a result of the introduction of new equipment, procedures and methods may be assigned to perform work in other areas of the Company's operation for which they are qualified.
0-2) Such excess employees will be offered vacancies occurring in other seniority units and shall receive consideration for such vacancies'on the basis of total service with the Company as compared with the total active service of applicants for such vacancies who are in the seniority unit in which the vacancy exists. Such consideration may not, however, supersede the rights of employees who have completed five (5) years of active service with the Company.
0-3) Employees who receive a pay rate in excess of the pay schedule for the position to which s/he has been assigned under the operation of these provisions shall be subject to “over-the-rate" provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the Union.	1
0-4) An excess employee who refuses to accept another position for which s/he is qualified may be terminated from the Company, and shall be eligible for a separation allowance as provided in Article XVI.
0-5) The Company will discuss with the Union any unusual problems involving the placement of personnel arising under these procedures and attempt to resolve such matters.

New employees shall have a non-compensable one (1) day waiting period in the case of each sickness absence occurring during the first two (2) yean of their employment.
For employees hired on or before February 13 , 2001, in the event an employee had not used the sick leave to which s/he was entitled in the year immediately preceding the current year, s/he may, in the current year (in case of a prolonged illness or if required) use the unused portion of .such prior sick leave, in addition to the sick leave scheduled above for the current year and after the sick leave allowance for the current year has been exhausted. However, this cumulative provision does not apply to employees with less than two (2) years service time. No employee shall receive more than twice the amount shown in the calendar year schedule during any calendar year or for any one (1) illness except that employees who have attained age 45 and fifteen (15) years of service may receive one (1) additional year's basic sick leave allowance at half pay. Employees may requalify for their basic leave allowance for the same illness after a period of three (3) years has expired in which no illness absence has occurred as a result of that illness.
An employee with five (5) years and less than fifteen (15) years service time as of January 1, who has used all allowances of the current year, and who is suffering an illness which evidently will continue at least as many days as the number of full allowance days the employee has carried over from the previous year, may elect to take a lump sum payment consisting of one-half (lA) of the number of full allowance days remaining from his/her previous year.

absent because of a compensable injury is not eligible for sick leave. Sick leave benefits will become effective upon notification to the Company of the employee's inability to work.

Shift employees shall give notice of inability to work at Least four (4) hours before the next reporting time, if possible, and day employees shall give notice at a' reasonable time before the next reporting time. If any employee fails to observe the Company rules pertaining to sick leave or if they present false statements in attempting to collect sick benefits, the Company may, after investigation, refuse to pay such benefits. The Union agrees that it will cooperate to prevent the abuse of this sick leave privilege.

I.	The principles listed below shall serve as guides in cases where a job scheduled for a non-regular workday or off . hours is canceled. When such a cancellation occurs:
(a)	Employees will be sent home or an effort will be made to provide work within reasonable range of their classification and within the limits of their qualifications, in line with the type of work which might reasonably be assigned to them during regular work hours.
(b)	When employees are notified that a job has been canceled and they are not therefore required to report to foe job, other employees scheduled to report for work and cannot be . contacted, and thus do report, will be sent home on reporting. However, if there has only been a partial cancellation of foe job, some of foe employees may be required to repeat, even though others may be sent home or told not to report.
(c)	This does not mean employees may not be kept on the job in anticipation that conditions may change so that a job, temporarily held up due to unavoidable circumstances, may be able to be scheduled at a later time than originally scheduled.
Article HI. (c)
TEMPORARY CHANGE IN SCHEDULE TO FILL A SHIFT VACANCY
1.	An employee who is temporarily assigned to fill a shift vacancy, other than, and in place of, his/her regular shift which has occurred due to absence of foe employee regularly assigned to that shift because of sickness, training, meetings or other reasons beyond foe Company's control, or other emergency reasons, and who receives less than 40 hours notice of such temporary change, shall be paid time and one-half for the first eight (8) hours of work on this temporary shift change.
&
ARTICLE 111. (c) (Continued)
2.	When an employee is assigned to such a temporary shift change, the employee should be informed of the duration, in days of his/her assignment to this temporary shift or that the duration of such assignment shall be for a period measured by the absence of the employee regularly assigned to that shift, whichever applies in the particular case. In the event of such notification at the time of assignment to the temporary shift, this notification shall be construed as notification to the employee to return to his/her regular shift after the termination of die specific number of days or after the return of the employee regularly assigned to that shift and no premium rate shall be paid for the return to the employee's regular shift solely because of the question of sufficient notice.
3.	In all cases, where possible, notification of a temporary shift change should be for a specific number of days.
4.	In the event such notification has been given as provided in Paragraph 2, above, and circumstances change so that the duration of such temporary shift change becomes measured by factors other than contained in the original notification, and the employee is notified to return to his regular shift, with less than 40 hours notice, the employee shall receive time and one-half for the first eight (8) hours of work on returning to his regular shift.
5.	In any case where an employee receives 40 hours notice of such temporary change from his regular shift, and 40 hours notice of reversion to his regular shift, no premium shall be paid solely because of the question of sufficient notice.
6.	In all cases of such assignments, in order to prevent as much inconvenience as possible to both the employee and the Company, the supervisor should keep die employee who is so temporarily assigned, informed of the probable duration of the sickness or absence; and the employee who is absent because of sickness or other emergency absence should keep the Company informed of the probable duration of his/her absence, and should give as much advance notice as possible of the expected time of his/her return to work.
Article III, (c)
FORTY (40) HOURS NOTICE ON CHANGE OF SHIFT
1.	It has been agreed between the Company and the Union that the forty (40) hours notice provision as contained in Article III (c) is not intended to be used as a means of moving employees from one schedule to another without any stability. Employees should have reasonable
ARTICLE III, (c) (Continued)7i stability, and as much advance notice of shift changes as possible, together with some anticipation of the duration of such changes.
Article Iff. (d)
RATE OF PAY FOR EXTENDED WORK PERIODS
1	1. Ou certain emergency occasions, physical employees have
worked extended work periods and it has been impossibleto give them the time off without loss of pay stipulated in the callout. schedule applicable to extended work referred to in Article III (d). On these occasions, the employees shall receive an additional compensation equal to their straight time classified rate of pay for such time worked during this entitled time off without loss of pay period. .
2.	This double time rate should continue for all such time as the employee continues to work, to a maximum of sixteen (16) hours from the regular starting time of that-workday. If the employee continued to work past the sixteen (16) hour period his/her rate should revert to time and one half times his classified rate of pay. ■
3.	Employees will not be paid the above double time rate and also be given added time off without loss of pay.
EXAMPLE: Employee on an 8 A.M. to 4:30 P.M. schedule is called ' out to'work at 12 o'clock midnight, and the next day is a regular workday. According to the callout schedule for extended work, the employee would be entitled to go home at twelve o'clock noon and be paid to 4:30 P.M. for that day. The employee's pay for that entire • ■ period would then be computed at time and one-half , from 12 o'clock midnight until 8:00 A.M., straight time from 8:00 A.M. to 12:00 noon, and straight time until 4:30 P.M. (excluding a one-half hour lunch period). However, if the employee, because of an emergency, was required to work past 12:00 o'clock noon, s/he would receive double time pay for all hours worked starting from 12:00 o'clock noon. This double time pay .	. would continue until 12:00 o'clock midnight [sixteen
.	(16) hours from the start of his/her regular workday]
provided the employee worked until that time. Work after 12:00 o'clock midnight would be at time and one half times his/her regular rate of pay.
8i ARTICLE 111, (d) (Continued)
Article III. (d)
EXTENDED WORK PERIODS
1.	Although the nature of the Company's business is such that at times employees are required to work long continuous periods in order to restore service and relieve hazardous conditions, the Company recognizes that employees should not be requested to work unreasonable long continuous periods unless absolutely necessary. For this reason supervisors are requested to use care and judgement in scheduling relief for employees working long periods of time.	.
2.	In applying this principle, the same consideration should .be given to employees called out for emergency work within three (3) hours after finishing their normal workday, as is given to employees who continue to work on at the end of their normal workday.
3.	When an overtime work period of eight (8) hours or more in duration is scheduled in advance to commence tour (4) or more hours after the completion of an employee's regular workday, the employee should be given sufficient time off from his/her regular work hours to allow him/her eight (8) hours off before the start of the overtime work period.	■
Article III. (d)(f)
DAY WORKERS TEMPORARILY ASSIGNED TO NIGHT WORK
1.	When it is necessary to temporarily assign non-shift employees, ordinarily assigned to day work, to a night schedule on a regular scheduled workday in order to meet system maintenance schedules or to perform any work involving the elimination of an impairment to the operation of a plant or the system, the following procedure shall apply:
(a)	When the schedule change is for one (1) day only, the “callout” schedule and procedure specified in Article III (d) shall apply. '
(b)	When the schedule change is for two (2) days or more, the provision of Article III (f) shall apply for all days involved.
2.	The above provisions are intended to apply only to employees ordinarily assigned to day work who are temporarily assigned to night schedules to perform maintenance work, and is not intended to affect
ARTICLE in. (d) (f) (Continued)
9i
the assignment of day workers temporarily to an operating job on a night shift.
3.	When day workers are temporarily assigned to a night job under the provisions of Article III (f), supervisors are responsible for keeping the employees so assigned advised of the probable duration of such assignment, and the date of the employees’ return to their regular schedule of hours. Nevertheless, the work involved will determine the duration of such assignment and no premium payments will be made to such employees by reason of the amount of notice given to the employees to return to their regular schedule of hours; except, however, if such employees are notified while off duty with less than forty (40) hours notice to return to their regular shift, they shall receive time and one-half pay for the first eight (8) hours of work on their regular shift.
4.	The provisions of Article III (f) regarding day workers assigned to a night schedule do not apply to shift or special scheduled workers except in that instance where a shift or special scheduled worker is called out (while off duty) to report for overtime work prior to and in addition to his/her next regular shift or schedule. Under all other circumstances the change of schedules for shift or special scheduled workers, whether involving one (1) or more days, shall be subject to the notice provision of Article III (c).
Article III. (g)
NIGHT SHUT
1.	For the purpose of night bonus payments, a night shift is defined as a regular scheduled shift wherein four or more of the regular scheduled hours fall in the period from 4:00 p.m. through 8:00 a.m.
Article 111. (h)
NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES SCHEDULED TO WORK ONADAYOFREST
1.	The provisions of Article III (h) provide that employees are to receive thirty:six (36) hours of notice for work scheduled on a day of rest. The purpose of this provision is to afford employees an opportunity to arrange personal affairs so as not to conflict with work requirements.
lot
ARTICLE HI. (h) (Continued)
2.	It is understood that such prior notice can only be provided where knowledge of the work is available at least thirty-six (36) hours prior to the time employees are required to report for work. Under emergency situations or when conditions are such that knowledge of scheduled work on a day of rest is not available thirty-six (36) hours prior to the start of such work, supervisors are requested to afford employees as much notice as is possible under the particular circumstances.
3.	In situations where supervisors have reason to believe that work will be required on a scheduled day of rest, but final determination of this requirement cannot be made until a later time, supervisors should advise employees of the possibility of work on a day of rest with the understanding that final confirmation will be given at a later time.
4.	In cases where thirty-six (36) hours' notice of scheduled work on a day of rest is not provided, employees scheduled to work on the day of rest who are excused from the assignment because of justifiable personal affairs, will not be charged for “refusal of overtime work" in determining equalization of overtime unless otherwise agreed upon by the Company and the Union. '
Article III. fi) *
WORK IN TERRITORY OF ANOTHER UTILITY
1. The Company agrees that when employees are assigned to work in the territory of another utility, they shall receive the same rates of pay as paid for similar work by the host Company provided the rates of pay of the host Company are greater. Such payments shall be in addition to the stand-by provisions of Article 111 (i). All other provisions of this agreement, with the exception of the wage rates as outlined above, will apply to employees while assigned to work in the territory of another utility.
Article III. (j)
OVERTIME LISTS AND RESPONDING TO OVERTIME CALLS
1. The provisions of Article III (j) provide that the Company will attempt to equitably distribute overtime and the Union will make every effort to see that its members respond to such off schedule or overtime calls. The Company has agreed to post periodically overtime notices at each headquarters showing distributive shares of overtime for each
ARTICLE III, (j) (Continued)
Hi
employee at that headquarters. Insofar as responding to overtime calls is concerned, in general, cooperation of employees has been excellent, but there have been certain isolated instances where employees have refused to respond to overtime*calls without a reasonable excuse. All employees will be expected to respond to overtime calls within reason.
■ 2. The Company and Union agree to review periodically departmental practices regarding ■ the distribution of overtime. Consideration will be given to establishing departmental standards so that the distribution of overtime will* reflect all opportunities given to employees for overtime assignments. .	■ -
Article III. (j)
OVERTIME WORK SCHEDULED TO START WITHIN THREE HOURS AFTER AN EMPLOYEE'S REGULAR
QUITTING TIME
1. When overtime is scheduled to start within three (3) hours after an employee's regular quitting time, supervisors should consider the individual involved to determine whether or not s/he would be unreasonably inconvenienced because of the distance, time and conditions involved in going home, and reporting back at’the specified time. When the circumstances are such that an employee would be unreasonably inconvenienced s/he'should be kept at work in the interim period between his/her regular quitting time and the beginning of the scheduled overtime work.

■	t .
1.	As a basic principle, depending upon the particular circumstances involved, an employee qualifies for a* meal or a meal allowance paid for by the Company by working ten (10) hour periods and/or five (5) hour periods. In accordance with this' principle, a meal or meal allowance is furnished by the Company as follows:
- * *
r. ai When a regular workday is involved - or when a non-regular " workday is‘ involved and the employee has received fifteen .	(15)'hours notice of such work - a meal or meal allowance s
furnished’ by the Company ten (10) working hours after the employee starts work, whether s/he starts work before the
12i
ARTICLE IV. (Continued)
normal starting time of the regular day, or continues to work after the close of the normal closing time, or a combination of both; additional meals or meal allowances are provided at five (5) hour intervals after first meal has been furnished. (See attached meal allowances schedules).
b.	On a non-regular workday where substantially the normal work hours are involved and the employee has not had fifteen (15) hours notice of such work, the first or noontime meal or a meal allowance is furnished by the Company, and thereafter the ten (10) hour and five (5) hour measures apply as outlined in paragraph (a) above.
c.	In case of scheduled overtime work not within the provisions of paragraph (b) above, a meal or a meal allowance is furnished after each five (5) hours of such overtime work.
d.	An employee called out to report to work immediately shall be furnished with a meal allowance (but shall not be allowed additional reporting time).
e.	An exception to the ten (10) hour provision above is when work is scheduled for ten (10) hours, three (3) days or more, in which case a meal or meal allowance is furnished only if the employee works more than ten (10) hours.
2.	When the Company furnishes a meal or a meal allowance the time for eating the meal is paid for, unless the work is not to continue after the meal. In accordance therewith, such time is considered work time, and the time for eating the meal is only such minimum time as is reasonably necessary to eat the meal, and is not construed as a format meal period.
3.	Because the basic purpose of the meal allowance is to see that an employee gets sustenance when s/he needs it, whenever reasonably possible foe meal itself should be provided.
4.	An employee who is directed to stand by at his/her work location at the end of his/her regular shift in anticipation of a work assignment will qualify for a meal allowance if directed to secure a meal even though it later develops that s/he is released from work prior to the time when s/he would normally qualify for a meal allowance.

The Company agrees to promote employees to the full limit of their capabilities, provided there are job vacancies and subject to all other applicable terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, In other words, an employee could be promoted to a “B” mechanic's job although it was doubtful that they would ever be able to qualify for an “A" mechanic's job.	.
3.	Testing required for a-promotion should be confined entirely and completely to the requirements of the particular job classification as specified in the job descriptions. ■
4,	Testing and training procedures should be standard within a department, system wide. As a general principle, where training in new methods and equipment is intended to be given to all employees in a job classification, supervisors shall where practicable, train the senior employees first. In those situations where work load requirements, physical location of affected employees, limited, training requirements of employees in a job classification, or other factors which may affect . particular training needs, make it impractical or unreasonable to give training preference to senior employees, the Union should be apprised of such situations and given an opportunity to offer suggestions.

2.	If an employee is promoted out of classification, and it is not intended to refill that position, because circumstances no longer require the position to be tilled, the supervisor at the location should inform the Union Office and local representative of this fact, and the reasons therefore, thereby explaining why a job vacancy has not been posted.
3.	in cases where a vacancy occurs and a notice of vacancy is posted, and no candidate with the necessary qualifications for the job applies within a reasonable time, the Union office and local representative should be informed of this.

Article XI. (a), (a-1)
SICK LEAVE ADMINISTRATION PRACTICES - ADDITIONAL MATTERS
The following material is intended as a guide in the administering of certain phases of sick leave, covering the following items:
38i
ARTICLE XI. (a) (a-1) (Contmued)
1. Notification by an employee of His/Her Inability to Report to work due to illness.	-
.	2. Requirement for a Doctor's Certificate.	.
3.	Presence of a Shop Steward at a Discussion Between a Supervisor and an Employee of the Employee’s Sick Leave Record.
/. Notification by an Employee of His/Her Inability to Report to , Work Due to Illness. .
a.	Time requirements for notification of an illness absence by
; .an employee vary between organizations within the Company based on work procedures within an organization. It is the responsibility of the Company Supervisor to advise employees of this notification requirement.	.
b.	Each employee has the responsibility of notification of his/her absence due to illness. Failure by an employee to give timely notification may be cause for withholding sick leave pay.	(
.. (r -■
c.	A Company supervisor, nevertheless, has the responsibility to investigate an employee's failure of proper notification of a sickness absence before finally determining to withhold sick ' leave pay? ’	'
-	•	*	•	.	I »	'
2,	Requirement for a Doctor's Certificate.
a.	A Company Supervisor may require that an employee who is absent due to illness furnish a doctor's certificate to qualify for payment for sick leave. Such a doctor’s certificate requirement should be based upon reasonable cause.
' b. Normally, an employee placed on a doctor's certificate ■ requirement, based on a review of his/her record, shall be notified that such requirement shall be applicable 'for subsequent sickness absences.
c.	A doctor’s certificate may be required for the instant sickness absence in the following situations:
,	(1) A sickness absence case occurring on a severe storm
, day (see policy on Absences During Severe Storm ‘ Conditions). ’ '
ARTICLE XL (a) (a-1) (Continued)
39i
(2)	An absence case involving questionable circumstances. (NOTE: In these cases, the employee should be advised of the doctor's certificate requirement before his/her return to work.)	■
d.	A requirement for a doctor's certificate based upon absences beyond a specified number of days shall be considered a reasonable requirement.	. _
e.	When an individual is on requirement for a doctor’s . certificate, his/her case should be reviewed periodically by his/her supervisor to determine the advisability of eliminating , such requirement, or of the continuing need therefore.
3.	Presence of a Shop Steward at a Discussion between a Supervisor and the Employee of an Employee Sick Leave 'Record.
a.. Because circumstances in individual employees sick leave records will vary, the presence of a Shop Steward at a discussion with an employee of his/her sick leave record is subject to discretion. Personal problems may be better handled on a confidential basis without a steward's presence;
, other cases affecting the atmosphere surrounding sick leave absences within an organization can often be helped by the . presence of a steward.
As a guide, the following should apply:
' (1) A supervisor should ask an employee whose sick leave record is being discussed with him/her whether s/he desires the presence of a. Shop Steward at such discussion, and make arrangements regarding the Shop Steward’s presence consistent with the employee's expression in the matter. '	. •
(2)	A supervisor will, nevertheless, arrange for a Shop Steward's presence when discussing an employee’s sick ' leave record where the case involves disciplinary action
'	against the employee.
4.	Procedure For Application of Doctors Certificate Requirement.
The following procedure regarding doctor's certificate requirements for employees experiencing five (5) separate illness absences in a continuous twelve (12) month period, or an illness absence of three (3) or more days, shall become effective July 1, 1963.
40i
ARTICLE XL (a) (a-1) (Continued)
1.	In the event the combined sick leave average for clerical and physical employees is less than six (6) days per employee per year for three (3) consecutive months, the application of doctor certificate requirements for illness situations described above shall be suspended until such time as the combined paid sick leave average shall exceed six (6) days per employee per year for three (3) consecutive months.
2,	When the combined sick leave average for clerical and physical employees exceeds six (6) days per employee per year for three (3) * consecutive months, doctor's certificate requirements in the above situations will be re-established and employees shall be notified of the re-establishment of these requirements.
3.	Statistics and records used in establishing sickness absence figures for the purposes of these procedures shall be in accordance with those methods employed by the Company in the period prior to this Agreement.
Article XI. (a), (a-l)
YEAR END SICK LEAVE
1.	An employee who is absent due to illness on his/her last regularly scheduled workday for a calendar year, and who receives sick leave pay for that day under the contract provisions covering sick leave, shall be entitled to a new sick leave allowance as of January 1 following in accordance with the allowance applicable to his/her service time on January 1. Sick leave taken after January 1 is then to be charged against . this new sick leave allowance.
2.	For employees hired before February 14, 2001, the provisions of this paragraph are limited to the extent that an employee may not receive more than twice the amount of a calendar .year's sick leave allowance for any one (1) illness except that employees who have attained age 45 and fifteen (15) years of service may receive one (1) additional year's basic sick leave allowance at half pay.

5.	Whenever an employee is off ill, his/her return to work may be subject to approval by die Company Doctor prior to the employee’s being permitted to return to work. .
Article XI. (a), (a-1), XII. (g)

' ■
c.	A determination by the New York State Workers Compensation Board chat an injury or' disability is a compensation case shall not; for the purposes of this ’ provision, be a conclusive determination that the injury was “incurred in line of duty” and will in no way affect the decision of whether or not the employee involved should receive a differential payment.
d.	The Company will make a differential payment for the period of absence following the injury, provided:
1.	The injury was determined to be a “non-fatal injury incurred in the line of duty” within the original intent of this article.
2.	The accident was not due to misconduct, violation of rules or failure to use proper safety devices on the part of the employee.
3.	The employee reported the injury as promptly as possible under the circumstances.

However, it is the employee's responsibility to apply for existing vacancies for. which they are qualified. Within a reasonable time, if a transfer is not effected, the services of one of the employees will be terminated. Prompt notification to the Employment Division of a forthcoming marriage to which this situation applies will facilitate the possibility of transfer.	-
Article XV.
SICKNESS IN FAMILY
1.	The Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the I.B.E.W. makes no provisions for giving an. employee time off with pay in the event a member of the employee's immediate family is ill and it is necessary for the employee to take time off to give care or perform necessary duties. It has been the practice to deny such requests for time off because of the fact that instances have been found in the past where the privilege was abused.	■
2.	Recently a case arose in which giving the employee such time off appeared to merit serious consideration. It is, therefore, requested that if an employee asks for such time off in. the event of a serious illness in his immediate family and, in the supervisor's opinion, the case ! merits consideration, the employee should be given leave of absence without pay and the case referred to Employee and Labor Relations for ! further consideration.

WORKERS, AFL-CIO
OPINION
At hearings held in Hicksville, New York on June 26, 29 and August 7, 1961. both of die above-named parties were represented. The following question was submitted to a Board of Arbitration consisting of Bernard LaMay, Joseph G. Acker and Thomas A. Knowlton for decision:
"With due regard for safe work practice, may one (1) qualified Lineman/Lmewoman work in the working position on a pole containing multi-phase primary lines to perform certain functions, or are two (2) qualified laneman/Linewoman the minimum number of employees required to work in the working position on a pole containing multiphase primary lines to perform any function?’'
The following opinion is the sole responsibility of foe undersigned, Knowlton.
DISCUSSION
The Employer submitted to foe Board of Arbitration an Exhibit (No. 3) listing the items which it believed can be properly performed on a pole by one (I) qualified Lineman/ Linewoman working by hand on Multi-phase Primary and Series street lighting circuits energized up to 4,IGO volts. There are fourteen (14) such items which are described individually below.
Subsequent to the hearings, foe Employer submitted to foe Board at its request a “Guide to Foremen’' to be used in making work assignments, involving the performance of one (1) or another of the fourteen (14) items in it's Exhibit No. 3.
It is foe Union' s position that in foe performance of work on Multi-phase Primary lines none of foe fourteen (14) items can safely be
62i
performed by one (1) qualified Lineman/ Linewoman in the working position on a pole.
During the past several years, the parties have attempted, on a number of occasions, to resolve this dispute through negotiation, without success. It is not a proper function of the Board to discuss the negotiations or in any way to determine responsibility for their failure.
Primarily, and to establish a frame of reference, certain observations are in order.
First, there is an element of danger in the work of a Lineman/Linewoman. Various risks are an intrinsic part of the job. This Board of Arbitration is called upon to determine, in effect, whether the items in dispute can safely be performed by one (1) employee on the pole or whether the use of one (1) employee creates a risk which is additional to what one might call a normal risk.
Second, this Board must, of necessity, discuss each of the fourteen (14) items separately and render it's decision as to each separate. There is no evidence from which one may conclude that all or none of the functions can properly be performed by one (I) employee.
Third, in any discussion of safety in an electric utility, it is desirable that there be as complete an understanding as possible among both supervisors and employees because in this area, individual differences under many varying circumstances may result in unnecessary and undesirable arguments. It is for this reason that most safety rules are clearly and concisely stated and are as uniform as it is possible to make them.
Safety is obviously a matter of judgement. In this case, it is die judgement of the Board of Arbitration which believes that, to the extent possible, tite requirements should be detailed and uniform even though it is certain that under some circumstances it's conclusions may seem unnecessarily restrictive limitations on the exercise of the managerial function by the immediate supervisor.
To avoid any misunderstanding with respect to the award, it is desirable that some of the terms used in the award be defined. For this reason, the following definitions seem proper:
Primary Tap: A primary tap is any connection to a primary. (This definition differs from that which the Employer believes to be proper. The Employer defines a primary tap as a connection between two (2) energized circuits or between a primary and an energized transformer.
63i
After consideration, the undersigned believes that this definition is not in accord with the parties' agreement which, in Article XXII (b) (5a), mentions the making of “primary taps" and also, in the same sentences, mentions the tapping together of live wires).
Clean Pole: A pole where the working position is unencumbered. [This definition does not meet with the approval of the Union which prefers to regard a clean pole as a pole with “one (1) circuit of three (3) phases with the neutral on the arm or on the secondary position”. Obviously the Union's deflnition would also constitute a .clean pole according to the Company. It does not follow however, that all of the clean poles are of the type specified by the. Union.]
It is the practice of the Company in perfonning any of the work about which this arbitration is concerned to use a job crew which includes at least two (2) qualified Linemen/ Linewomen, one (1) of whom may be a second-class Lineman/Linewoman. This means that on the job, though not necessarily on the pole, there are two (2) qualified Linemen/ Linewomen.	t
In the opinion of a majority of the Board of Arbitration and subject to the qualifications which are stated below in this opinion, the following items of work may properly be performed by one (1) qualified Lineman/Linewoman on a pole, working by hand od multi-phase primary and series street lighting circuits energized up to 4,160 volts.	'
(a)	The application and removal of rubber protective equipment.
(b)	The tying and untying of line conductors.
(c)	The installation and removal of running blocks.
(d)	The installation of a pull rope,
(e)	The replacement of pins and insulators.
(f)	The removal and installation of line and equipment cut-out doors.	,
(g)	The shifting of conductors.
(h)	The cutting and removal of dead primary wires.
(i)	The operating of street light controls.
64i
(j)	The installation and removal of isolating street lighting transformers and the completion of necessary connections, insofar as this work does not require the making of primary taps.
(k)	The installation and removal of street lighting fixtures insofar as this work does not require the making of primary taps.
(1)	The repair of street light fixtures.
■ (m) The replacement of line and equipment cut-outs and the completion of necessary connections, insofar as this work does not require the making of primary taps.
(n) The replacement of lightning arrestors and die completion of necessary connections, insofar as this work does not require the making of a primary tap.
Two (2) qualified Linemen/Linewomen shall be required on the pole in performing any of the above-listed items of work where:
(1)	The working position on the pole is not clearly visible from the ground.	.	.
(2)	The working position on the pole is such that the working position would be above an energized primary conductor or where, if the Lineman/Linewoman fell, s/he would not fall clear of an energized primary conductor.
(3)	The pole is not “clean,” as defined above.
(4)	Work items (b), (e), (g) and (h) shall be performed by two (2) employees on the pole where the attachment of the conductor on adjacent poles is at a lower or substantially higher elevation than the pole being worked, resulting in unusual downward or upward pressure on the insulators.
(5)	Work items (b), (e) and (g) shall be performed by two (2) qualified employees on the pole where the specification of the following table is exceeded:
Span Length
Wire Size (Copper)
100 Ft.
150 Ft.
175 Ft
200 Ft.
4/0
1/0
No. 3
No. 6
65 i
(6)	Work items (b), (?) and (g) shall be performed by two (2) qualified Linemen/Linewomen on the pole where the angle, comer, or tura of die line is such chat the conductor is required to be tied on the side of the insulator.	•	■
(7)	Work items (b), (e), (g) and (h) shall be performed by two (2) qualified Linemen/Linewomen on the pole where wires are excessively slack, necessitating unusual caution in the control of their movement.
