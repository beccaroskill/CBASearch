It is agreed that both the Employer and the Union will encourage and assist in the promotion of this training.
HAZMAT PROJECTS: All toxic/hazardous projects will be subject to any and all safety regulations and insurance provisions that may be required by the appropriate governmental agencies. When dangerous atmospheres are present so that an Operator is required to don a special protective suit and/or a self-contained breathing apparatus at a private, state, federal or other designated toxic/hazardous waste site, the Employer will notify the Union District Office. Reasonable dress-up time and clean-up time will be allowed. The first qualified bargaining unit employee on the job will be designated the steward-safety man, who shall have access to company monitoring records and be kept informed of amounts of contaminants on the job site. A sheltered “safe zone" area shall be provided. There shall be wash-up facilities on all toxic/hazardous waste sites.
On such projects, it is expressly understood that if the employees' immediate health and safety are in danger, the employee may discontinue operations, without penalty, until satisfactory results are obtained, or until such time as a recognized safety agent shall declare the equipment or operation to be safe. All Operating Engineers’ employees shall be advised by the Employer prior to employment as to the nature of the known hazardous waste and possible resultant physical injuries as may be required by applicable law.
18.	DRUG TESTING: The Employer and the Union are committed to a policy that promotes safety in the work place, employee health, and well being. In consideration of this policy, the Union and the Employer agree that any employee found to be under the influence of, in possession of, or engaged in the distribution of drugs or alcohol on the job site shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.
Within two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new
9
operator may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a prescription drug which may impair mental or motor function shall inform their supervisor in writing of such drug use.
Employee involvement with drugs and alcohol can adversely affect job performance and employee morale. In the construction industry the consequences of drug or alcohol use or influence while on the job site can be disastrous. The Employer and Union, therefore, agree to the following policy to insure all employees of a safe and efficient job site free from the effects of drug and alcohol use or influence.
All job sites or work areas are subject to random or massive drug screening. Any employee who is involved in an on-the-job accident resulting in an injury to a person or property, or whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion of probable cause of illegal drug or alcohol use impairment while on the job site, may be required as a condition of continued employment to Submit to a test for alcohol ancl/or illegal drug use which impaired the employee's ability to safely perform his/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a sampling of the employee's blood, urine, or breath. Any employee who is asked to submit to such a test will be required to sign a consent form. If an employee who is asked to submit to a test refuses to do so, or refuses to sign the necessary consent form, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
All testing will be done by a reliable, established laboratory. If this initial test screen result indicates positive findings, further testing of the same sample must be done to confirm the original findings before the laboratory can report a positive finding. The confirmation test will be conducted by an independent accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of American Pathology laboratory and will utilize the more scientific Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry examination (GC/ MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential between the employee, the Employer and the Union. The employee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wages and fringes for the time required for drug testing provided results are negative.
If the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee may be granted a leave of absence for the purposes of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible such rehabilitation programs are covered under the Ohio Operating Engineers Health and Welfare Program providing the employee
10
confines himself/herself to a twenty-four (24) hour licensed rehabilitation medical facility.
Until the employee presents certification of successful completion of the rehabilitation program, he/she shall be removed from the employer's job site; shall be prohibited from registering under Article III of the referral of this contract and shall not be dispatched to work. Upon presentation of certification of the employee’s successful completion of the drug/ alcohol rehabilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her original job with the employer. If the employee is not restored to their original job, the employee will be allowed to register for work in the referral by registering a new work referral card. The employee shall, under either circumstance, for the next succeeding twelve (12) month period, present to the District Representative monthly certification of negative drug/alcohol test results. Failure to do so will result in denying the employee the right to maintain his/her referral card in the register and utilize the referral or if working, to be removed from work.
19.	HARASSMENT POLICY: The parties to this Agreement mutually agree that harassment of any nature is not to be tolerated. Every person working under this Agreement shall immediately notify the Employer when a possibility of a problem happens or exists.
ARTICLE III
REFERRAL SYSTEM
20.	Local 18 and its Branches shall maintain registers of all applicants for referral. Applicants shall not be permitted to be registered in more than one (1) office of the Union at any one time. All applicants will be registered in order of application, provided no person shall be deemed to be an applicant who is otherwise gainfully employed as an Operating Engineer or not immediately available for work. Registrations and reregistrations will be accepted during customary business hours. Applicants shall be classified in priority groups in accordance with the following criteria:
GROUP A: All applicants who have worked as Operating Engineers at least 360 days, 90 days or more per year, during the last four (4) years, and have been employed for at least
11
360 days, 90 days or more per year during the last four (4) years on work as defined in Article I of this Agreement within the geographical jurisdiction of Local 18, and who have lived in the State of Ohio, or in any county contiguous thereto, for at least one (1) year prior to application.
GROUP A PREFERRED: Must have Group A eligibility.
Group A registrants may voluntarily register in the Group A Preferred, however, registrants in the Preferred A status shall have at least fifteen (15) years employment or availability for employment in any one or more of the classifications contained in this Agreement and in the type or kind of craft work covered by this Agreement in the geographic area as defined by this Agreement. Referral in this group is limited to the following described equipment and will be given priority of referral from the Preferred A deck. Preferred A status employees will not be eligible for letter of request by the Employer: Welding Machines, Elevator, Conveyor, Pumps, Compressors, Generators, One Drum Hoist, Mono-Rail Hoist, and Portable Heaters.
(B)	It is further understood and agreed that when the Employer employs Operating Engineers not currently in his/her employ for any machines listed in this section, the Employer shall call the referral office servicing his/her job or project and request that an employee qualifying under the Preferred A status be dispatched to service and operate said machine. Any Operating Engineer currently employed by an Employer can be used to operate any of the above listed machines. Apprentices shall not operate this equipment more than fifteen (15) days.
(C)	Workmen registering in this Preferred A group shall be ineligible to register in any other group and shall not work in any classification other than those specified in this section and only have recall rights for equipment specified in this section.
GROUP A RETIREES: Must have Group A eligibility.
The pension was set up to enhance the lives of retirees in their golden years. Retiring from the trades is by voluntary choice.
A retiree is an equipment operator or mechanic who has applied for and is receiving a pension from any construction industry source.
Upon retirement the retiree can only register in this group. The Group A Retirees will be referred to jobs only after the Group A classification and the Preferred A classification have
12
been exhausted.
The Group A Retiree will not be eligible for letter of request by the Employer.
GROUP B: Same as Group A, except that the employment shall have been at least 270 days, three (3) years of 90 days each. All fourth year Apprentices and Trainees shall be registered in this group.
GROUP C: All applicants who have worked as Operating Engineers at least ninety (90) days per year during each of the last two (2) years, and who have lived in the State of Ohio or any county contiguous thereto for at least one (1) year prior to application. All third year Apprentices and Trainees shall be registered in this group.
GROUP D: All applicants who have worked as Operating Engineers at least ninety (90) days during the twelve (12) months prior to application. All second year Apprentices and Trainees shall be registered in this group.
GROUP E: All other applicants and all first year Apprentices and Trainees shall be registered in this group.
GROUP F: Al) applicants who are “temporary employees."
All applicants who have attained eligibility in any of the foregoing groups shall not lose eligibility as a result of their failure to obtain the required days of employment during the applicable periods of time. All graduating Apprentices shall upon journeymen certification become eligible for Group A. When an applicant fails to register in his/her eligibility group due to reasons other than illness, as hereinafter defined, and does not notify the Union hall the resultant failure to obtain the required days of employment during the applicable periods of time shall cause the applicant to lose eligibility in that group.
Any registrant requesting that their work registration card be placed on hold due to sickness or ill health must present to the Union a doctor’s certificate or statement certifying that the registrant will be under a doctor's care for a minimum of thirty (30) days, and that such illness prevents the registered applicant from working as an Operating Engineer. A work registrant's card will only be placed on hold for a minimum period of thirty (30) days, and a maximum period of one hundred twenty (120) days. No registration cards will be placed in the hold position for illness less than a thirty (30) day duration. Any refusals of
13
dispatches due to illness for a period of less than thirty (30) days shall be counted as a refusal under the terms and conditions of the referral procedure.
21.	In referring applicants, the following procedure shall be followed:
A.	Applicants in Group A shall first be referred, and then Group A Preferred, then Group A Retirees, then applicants in the succeeding groups, in order, through Group E. In each group, the Union shall refer applicants in order of their places on the referral list.
B.	Registered Apprentices or Trainees shall be referred in order of their position on the referral list.
C.	Employers shall have the right to reject any applicant referred for employment and shall immediately notify the Union in writing of such rejection, in the event a registrant is discharged by the employer because of lack of sufficient ability, and he/she does not exercise his/her rights under the referral Board of Review and Arbitration under Paragraph 25, the classification or equipment from which he/she is discharged shall be stricken from his/her referral record and he/she shall not be dispatched to a job in that classification or on that equipment until he/she has:
1.	Taken training at his/her training site and has been certified, or
2.	Has presented to his/her dispatch office a letter from a previous Employer, in signed agreement with Local 18 working within Local 18’s jurisdiction, stating that in the Employer's opinion the discharged registrant has successfully completed a job assignment in that classification or on that piece of equipment in his/her employment.
D.	When an applicant is actually employed, he/she shall notify the Union office at which he/she is registered within twenty-four (24) hours. Failure to do so is an imposition upon those registered and not employed and, therefore, such applicant will be barred from re-registering, unless and until he/she has made application to the Board of Review and Arbitration provided for in Paragraph 25 of this Agreement, and shows good cause for his/her failure to give such notice.
14
E.	When an applicant becomes employed, his/her name shall be removed from the register as soon as he/she shall have worked for a total of thirty-one (31) accumulative working days (one (1) day jobs shall not count). An Operator who relieves another Operator will not be charged for the first fifteen (15) days, (only one (1) fifteen (15) day relief per registration application card). All days after that will be counted toward his/her time.
If an applicant is employed for less than thirty-one (31) accumulative working days, he/she shall be restored to his/her previous position on the register when such employment terminates. Any applicant who quits employment or fails to show up for work assignment at starting time after being dispatched (provided he/she was dispatched the previous day), for whatever reason, except accident verified by police report, shall be placed at the bottom of the applicable registration group regardless of the number of days worked and shall not be eligible for request until he/she puts in a new registration card. When reason for employment termination is questioned, applicant must present a written termination slip evidencing reasons other than a voluntary quit before he/she is restored to his/her previous position on the register.
An applicant for employment may not refuse referral to employment for any reason except that the applicant may inform the District office in writing, before any referral, that he/ she will not accept employment referrals in certain named counties within the District. If an applicant refuses a job referral for the second consecutive time, he/she shall lose his/her position on the register and go to the bottom of the list for his/ her group*. If the dispatcher is unable to contact an applicant, the failure to contact shall not be deemed to be a refusal.
F.	Applicants must notify the Union office in which they are registered by telephone, or letter, or telegram, or in person of their continued availability for employment within thirty (30) days after the date of last registration or re-registration in order to maintain their places on the register.
In order to equally distribute and defray the cost of services rendered by the use of this referral system, all individuals who make use of this referral system shall be required to pay an initial registration fee of $15.75 and another $15.75 for
* Does not apply to the Ohio or Kentucky Residential and Light Commercial Agreements referral.
15
each re-registration thereafter, provided that such fee shall not exceed $15.75 in any consecutive thirty (30) day period, and provided that such fee shall not apply to the following:
1.	Members in good standing of Local 18 and its Branches, International Union of Operating Engineers, whose proportionate share of the cost of this referral system is met by their regular dues; and
2.	Applicants for membership to Local 18 and its Branches, International Union of Operating Engineers, whose proportionate share of the cost of this referral system is met by their fees; and
3.	Members in good standing of the International Union of Operating Engineers who are paying travel dues whose proportionate share of the cost of this referral system is met by the payment of their fees.
G.	The Union shall use its best efforts to notify all registered applicants when work is available for them, but the Union assumes no responsibility or obligation for failure to locate an applicant.
H.	All applicants must submit a written resume of their experience and qualifications at the time of original registrations, and may be tested on the equipment they operate at the nearest available training site prior to being assigned a position on the referral list.
I.	Subject to this referral system employers may hire through this referral policy by name former employees who have resided for at least twenty-four (24) months in the State of Ohio or in any county contiguous thereto, and have been employed by the Employer making the request during the past twenty-four (24) months within the jurisdiction of this Agreement. The Employer must make the request to the appropriate Union District Office and the Employee requested must be registered on the District referral list (Groups A through E).
Employers may hire through this referral policy by name individuals in Group A for a production machine, or for a mechanic, or mechanic/welder, who has been registered on the out-of-work list for at least ten (10) days in the District in which the work is to be performed. Individuals shall have only one (1) request per four (4) month period from the last request.
16
The request by name must be confirmed later in writing, on the letterhead of the Employer and signed by either the Employer or the superintendent of the project.
Nothing in the referral procedure shall interfere with the transfer of an Employer’s employees on his/her payroll from one project to another project within the geographical area covered by Local 18. When transferring employees, the Employer will notify the Union District Office from which the employee is to be transferred.
The Union agrees the transfer will be processed in an expedient manner.
J.	The purpose of the referral system is to provide non-discriminatory employment opportunities. Individuals who register therein deserve a preference over those who do not. Therefore, it is agreed that in the event the referral list is exhausted, and the Union is temporarily unable to furnish qualified applicants within twenty-four (24) hours after receiving the Employer’s request (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excepted), the Employer may temporarily employ others until the Union notifies the Employer that it has qualified registrants available for employment.
Applicants hired by the Employer under this procedure shall be known as Temporary employees", and will be subject to replacements. The Employer will notify the Union District Representatives of the name, union affiliation (if any), date of employment and social security number of such “temporary employee”. The Union will maintain a register of all such “temporary employees", and such register shall be known as the temporary register. Such “temporary employees” may also be referred by the Union (when the referral list is exhausted) from Group F.
Such “temporary employee” shall be subject to replacement by a qualified registered applicant under the procedure listed herein:
1.	The Union shall give a five (5) working day written notice to the Employer with whom the “temporary employee” is working, and such “temporary employee" will thereupon be replaced at the end of the five (5) working day period provided the Union furnishes a qualified registered applicant.
2.	The Union will save the Employer harmless for any
17
liabilities occurring under the application of the provisions of the temporary register.
K. When an Employer states requirements for special skills or abilities in his/her request for employee applicants, the Union shall refer the first applicant on the register possessing such skills, or abilities, regardless of the place or classification of such applicant on the register. If a contractor requests or requires that the Operator be a Certified Operator, verification of the Operator’s certification is the responsibility of the Employer. If the Employer notifies the Union in writing, within 30 days after the employee’s discharge, of an Operator who had been in his/her employment and who had not performed satisfactorily, and the Employer does not wish this Operator to be referred to the Employer for future employment, the Union shall honor this written request.
L Any employee who quits a corib actor without proper notice and is subsequently hired by an Employer with whom Local 18 has a contractual relation without a proper referral by Local 18, shall be discharged by the Employer when it is called to his/her attention.
22.	Employers shall give first opportunity to persons registered ter employment, as provided herein, by calling or notifying the Union at any of its offices in the territory where the work is to be performed.
23.	Registration of applicants and selections of applicants for referral to jobs shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall not be based on, or in any way affected by Union membership, by-laws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspects or obligation of Union membership, policies, or requirements. It is mutually agreed that the Employer and the Union shall abide by all of the laws of the United States, the State of Ohio, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and lawful orders thereof in nondiscrimination and fair employment practices.
The Employer and the Union shall not discriminate against nor limit employment opportunities of any employee, applicant for employment or applicant for Union membership or apprenticeship training because of race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin or ancestry.
The Union agrees to furnish an Employer, at his request,
18
any statement or data required under any regulations referred to herein.
24.	In addition to the above registration groups there shall be established a Short Term Job Group. The sole purpose of this Short Term Job Group is to enable registrants to acquire time to be eligible for unemployment benefits. Registration in this group is limited to applicants eligible for Group A of this referral and all fourth year Apprentices showing proof of need for additional time to qualify for unemployment benefits.
Applicants referral out of this Short Term Job Group will be limited to jobs of two (2) days or less duration in a calendar week or eight (8) days or less duration in a calendar month on equipment listed on their registration cards. Any refusals of jobs will cause the registrant’s card to be removed from the Short Term Job Group deck. Dispatches for short term jobs as defined above will first be made from the Short Term Job Group. If the dispatcher is unable to fill the short term job order from the Short Term Job Group he/she will proceed to fill the order from Groups A through F in accordance with the referral rules. Dispatcher should notify Employers when dispatching from the Short Term Job Group. The Employer reserves the right to request dispatch from Group A.
Since this Short Term Job Group is intended to provide limited employment for those needing credit for unemployment compensation, the Union shall, through its business agents, remove from employment any Operating Engineer who has accumulated more than two (2) days per calendar week or over eight (8) days in a calendar month—as a result of the Short Term Job Referral Group.
Registrants in the Short Term Job Group will not be eligible for any recall or request provisions of the referral as herein described. Employment received as a result of the Short Term Job Group referral will not provide eligibility for employer recall when the registrant is registered in Group A, Preferred A, or Group A Retirees deck. Apprentices or Trainees will not be permitted to register in the Short Term Job Group except as noted above. Registrants may not register in the Short Term Job Group or Group A or Preferred A or Group A Retirees deck at the same time. The Employer shall not be permitted to transfer employees dispatched from the Short Term Job Group from one project to another project.
19
The Union will save the Employer harmless for any liabili-ties occurring under the application of the provisions of the Short Term Job Group.
All the remaining rules with regard to the operation of the referral shall be applicable to the operation of Group A, Preferred A and Group A Retirees except as modified herein.
25.	Any registrant or any Employer who may feel aggrieved by the operation of this referral system shall have the right to and must file his/her grievance, in writing, within ten (10) days after the occurrence of the event concerning which he/she complains with a Board of Review and Arbitration consisting of one (1) representative of the Union, one (1) representative of the Employer, and an impartial third member to be selected by agreement of the Union and the Employer, and the decision of this Board shall be final and binding on all parties.
26.	This statement as to referrals, shall be posted in aii places where notices to Employers and applicants for employment are customarily posted, including all offices of the Union and all offices of the Employer.
27.	An Ohio Contractors Association Labor Relations Division Representative may inspect the referral register at the Union District Office at any time during normal office hours.
28.	All officers and business representatives of the Union who have had previous work experience in any one (1) or more of the job classifications contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to be employed at the trade and it is the intent of this section to provide that upon return to the employment in the trade, they shall do so with the same preference as if they had continually worked at the trade and shall be eligible upon registration for Group A.

31.	The Employer may, at its discretion, designate a person in their employ as a Master Mechanic, and such Master Mechanic shall be answerable to the Employer and paid at the rate established herein. The Master Mechanic so appointed must be a member of Local 18.
32.	On jobs where Maintenance Operators are to be employed, the first two employed shall be Class A; the third one, if required, may be Class B. Any further hire of Maintenance Operators shall be two (2) Class A, then a Class B may be hired. This ratio of two (2) Class A, then a Class B shall be continued in the hire of all Maintenance Operators as required by the project requirements.
33.	No supervisory employee shall perform productive work or operate equipment which would deny an Operating Engineer employment.
