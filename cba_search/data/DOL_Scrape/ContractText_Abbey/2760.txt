PREAMBLE
This AGREEMENT, hereafter referred to as the Agreement, entered into by the STATE OF CALIFORNIA, hereafter referred to as the State or the State employer, pursuant to Sections 19815.5 and 3517 of the Government Code, and the CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION, hereafter referred to as CCPOA, has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious labor relations between the State and CCPOA; establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other terms and conditions of employment.
The term “Agreement” as used herein means the written agreement provided under Section 3517.5 of the Government Code.
ARTICLE I RECOGNITION
1.01 Recognition
A.	Pursuant to the Public Employment Relations Board certification, the State recognizes CCPOA as the exclusive representative for employees in the Corrections Unit 6.
B.	Pursuant to Government Code Sections 19815.5 and 3517, CCPOA recognizes the Director of the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) or his/her designee as the negotiating representative for the State and shall negotiate exclusively with the Director or his/her designee, except as otherwise specifically spelled out in the Agreement.
ARTICLE II
CCPOA REPRESENTATION RIGHTS
2.01 Distribution of Literature
A.	CCPOA representatives requesting access to Bargaining Unit 6 employees and/or designated nonwork locations will check with the appropriate designated management authority to determine availability of space for the distribution of informa
1
tion and/or literature. Access to those locations may be restricted based on space availability and operational necessity. A written list of CCPOA stewards and staff shall be furnished to the State, and CCPOA shall notify the State promptly of any change.
B.	CCPOA may use existing employee mailboxes for distribution of information and/or literature. CCPOA assumes responsibility for the distribution of its own literature, unless mailed through the U.S. Postal System addressed to individual employee(s).
2.02 Access to Employees
A.	CCPOA stewards or representatives seeking access to the employees in a work or secure area, or to review documents, shall provide the department head or designee with reasonable advance notice of the visit. Access may be denied or delayed or limited for reasons of safety, security, public order, or other business-related reasons. Access to employees shall not be unreasonably withheld.
B.	Access to work locations solely for the purpose of observation of the worksite, not involving discussion with employees, may be granted with reasonable advance notice with an appropriate escort. On occasion the representative may need to talk confidentially with the employee or take confidential notes. Under these circumstances, management agrees, if requested by the representative, to ensure reasonable physical separation between the escort, the representative and the employee. However, for legitimate business-related reasons, the representative may be required to take notes or communicate with the employee at an alternate location.
2.03 Access to New Employees
A. CCPOA representatives shall be allowed access to Unit 6 employees (employees) while they attend their respective Academies for two (2) hours during the first week of each Academy cycle. CCPOA will provide the State the names of representatives who will be meeting with the new employees one (1) week in advance of the meeting. The time of
2
this access shall be mutually agreed to between CCPOA representatives and the Director of the Academy.
B.	CCPOA representatives shall be allowed access to off-duty employees while at the Academy during the second week of the Academy cycle, or, on other weeks, at a time mutually agreed upon by CCPOA and the Director of the Academy. CCPOA representatives shall be allowed access to off-duty employees at the Academy for an additional four (4) hour period during the midpoint of the Academy cycle provided the cycle is 10 weeks or longer, at a time mutually agreed upon by CCPOA and the Director of the Academy. CCPOA will provide the State with the names of representatives who will be meeting with the new employees one (1) week in advance of the meeting.
C.	The State shall provide CCPOA a schedule of when each new Academy cycle begins at least one (1) month prior to the beginning of each cycle.
D.	At the beginning of each new Academy cycle, the State shall provide CCPOA with a complete roster of the names and work locations of each new employee entering Bargaining Unit 6.
E.	Each CCPOA local Chief Job Steward and designee will have two (2) hours of access to new employees during the employee’s orientation at each facility, office, camp, or other places of employment. The local management and CCPOA will meet to pick a specific designated time during this orientation for the CCPOA presentation. The local CCPOA presenter shall provide the local administration with a pre-planned agenda prior to the orientation. The local administration shall be notified of any changes in that agenda prior to those changes taking place.
F.	Membership Packets and MOU: During both the Academy presentation and the orientation mentioned in paragraph E. above, CCPOA may provide each new employee with a DPA-approved packet of CCPOA information and a copy of the Unit 6 MOU. DPA approval of said packet of infor
3
mation shall not be arbitrarily or capriciously withheld.
G.	The State shall provide CCPOA adequate meeting space and access to audio/video equipment where available at the place the new employees are assembled for orientation.
2.04 Use of State Facilities
The State will permit use of certain State facilities for CCPOA meetings, subject to the operating needs of the State and the availability of appropriate space. Requests for use of such State facilities shall be made in advance to the Warden/Superintendent /Regional Administrator or designee. When required in advance, CCPOA shall reimburse the State for additional expenses such as security, maintenance and facility management costs, or utilities, incurred as a result of CCPOA’s use of such state facilities. Such costs shall not exceed those uniformly applied to other users.
2.05 Bulletin Boards
A.	CCPOA shall have access to employee organization bulletin boards at all work facilities to post materials related to CCPOA activities. Any materials posted must be dated and initialed by the CCPOA representative(s) responsible for the posting, and a copy of all materials posted must be distributed to the Appointing Authority, camp commander, facility head, or unit supervisor at the time of posting.
B.	Where state-owned employee organization bulletin boards exist, the Department shall provide reasonable bulletin board space for the exclusive use of CCPOA; or as an alternative, at its expense, CCPOA may provide at each camp or facility one or more (as described and limited in paragraph J.), with optional cover and lock, not to exceed 36" x 48" in size, and to be placed as described in paragraphs K. and L. Installation will be by the Department. In those cases where the bulletin board is provided with a lock, the Appointing Authority, camp commander, facility head, or unit supervisor shall be provided, at CCPOA’s expense, two (2) keys to the lock. Such keys will not be used ex
4
cept in case of a safety hazard, or in violation of a no-strike provision or as such in paragraph E. herein; even in such instances the key shall not be used without a reasonable effort to have a CCPOA representative present. Any CCPOA bulletin board shall be installed in a location consistent with institutional safety, security and operational needs.
C.	If bulletin boards in a snack bar exist at facilities beyond those described below, CCPOA shall only be entitled to share such boards and have reasonable space on such boards.
D.	Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require the State to move or remove existing employee or management bulletin boards from their present locations.
E.	CCPOA agrees that nothing illegal or which threatens the safety or security of the facility, or which is of racist, sexist, obscene, defamatory (material which not only impugns the character or reputation of the subject, but is also false) or of a parti-san/political nature shall be posted.
F.	Materials posted by an employee of the State shall be posted on the employee’s own time.
G.	Should CCPOA decide to place an exclusive bulletin board in a parole facility, size and location shall be reasonably determined by local administration and board size shall be no more than 2 feet by 3 feet.
H.	Size and location of exclusive boards in new facilities shall reasonably be determined by local administration after consultation with CCPOA and the board size shall be no more than 3 feet by 4 feet.
I.	When CCPOA has a local concern over the number of bulletin boards, the Appointing Authority, camp commander, facility head, or unit supervisor and the CCPOA Chapter Chief Job Steward shall meet to determine locations of the bulletin boards.
J.	The number of bulletin boards and locations at each
institution will remain the same. Any alterations of existing practices must be locally negotiated and agreed upon by both sides.
5
K.	CCPOA is allowed one (1) bulletin board in each Unit 6 parole office, facility, and camp.
L.	As new institutions, facilities, camps or offices are opened, the Appointing Authority, camp commander, facility head, or unit supervisor, and the CCPOA Chapter Chief Job Steward shall meet to determine the locations of the bulletin boards at that institution, facility, camp or office.
M.	CCPOA may add a literature distribution box and/ or mail box under each of the CCPOA bulletin boards, if it so chooses.
N.	This section shall be administered in accordance with Arbitrator Bonnie Bogue’s decision on Case No. 39596-63a dated December 5, 1996.
2.06 Chief Job Steward Assignment
A.	Chief Job Stewards shall be given an assignment in accordance with CDC/CYA post and bid/post assignment by seniority sections of this MOU. This shall exclude Chief Job Stewards’ positions at camps.
B.	In CYA institutions and/or facilities having more than six (6), and CDC institutions having more than nine (9) authorized MTA positions, plus the Youth Training Center and Northern California Youth Correctional Center, CCPOA shall be able to designate one (1) Chief Job Steward from an MTA classification who shall be placed in a second watch position, with Saturdays and Sundays off where possible, if the steward so requests.
CCPOA shall be able to designate one (1) additional Chief Job Steward at CIM, CMC and CMF as well as any CDC institution where the authorized number of MTA positions is forty (40) or more.
C.	There shall be no more than two (2) Chief Job Stewards for the MTAs employed within DMH Mental Health Unit. The Chief Job Steward(s) shall be placed in a second watch position with Saturdays and Sundays off, where possible, if the steward so requests.
6
D.	In the CDC and CYA camps, CCPOA shall designate one (1) Chief Job Steward of CDC Camps (North), one (1) of CDC Camps (Central), one (1) of CDC Camps (South) and one (1) CYA Camps (statewide).
2.07 Stewards’ Rights
A.	The State recognizes and agrees to deal with designated stewards or staff of CCPOA on all matters relating to the administration of this MOU.
A written list of CCPOA stewards, broken down by department and designated area of primary responsibility, shall be furnished to the State immediately after their designation and CCPOA shall notify the State promptly of any changes of such stewards. CCPOA stewards shall not be recognized by the State until such lists or changes thereto are received. A CCPOA steward’s “area of responsibility” means institution, office or building. However, the parties recognize that it may be necessary for CCPOA to assign a steward responsibility for several small offices or buildings within a close proximity.
B.	Upon request of an employee, or on behalf of a CCPOA-filed grievance, a CCPOA steward may:
1.	Investigate an employee grievance, including health and safety grievances, and assist in its presentation, provided it is in the steward’s department and designated area of primary responsibility;
2.	Provide representation of an employee at an interrogation, fact-finding, investigatory interview, or similarly-purposed discussion which has as its purpose the gathering of facts to support adverse actions;
3.	Provide representation on E.E.O. complaints, disputes over modified duties/reasonable accommodation, and “return-to-work” hearings;
4.	Provide representation at shooting review boards or as allowed by the Peace Officers’ Bill of Rights;
7
5.	Participate in meetings with local management including local Meet and Confer sessions as may be delegated and required by this MOU.
C. The steward shall be allowed reasonable time for the purpose of representing employees during working hours without loss of compensation, subject to prior notification and approval by the steward’s immediate supervisor. The grievant’s immediate supervisor may temporarily deny access to any CCPOA steward for operational necessity. Supervisors shall not unreasonably withhold time off or deny access for purposes of grievance preparation. Investigation of a grievance or adverse action shall not interfere with the work of other employees.
D.	Employees shall be entitled to reasonable time off without loss of compensation to confer with a CCPOA representative on representational matters at the work location in accordance with subsection B. above during work hours, subject to approval of the employee’s supervisor.
E.	Pursuant to Government Code 3303(h), the representative shall not be required to disclose, nor be subject to any punitive action for refusing to disclose, any information received from the Peace Officer under investigation for non-criminal matters.
2.08 Use of State Telephones
A.	CCPOA representatives and job stewards shall be permitted reasonable access to State telephones to make calls for CCPOA representation purposes; provided, however, that such access to State telephones shall not result in any additional costs to the State, nor shall it interfere with the conduct of State business.
B.	Personally owned cellular telephones and paging devices will only be allowed within the security areas of institutions/facilities upon Appointing Authority approval.
8
2.09 Questionnaires
It is the intent of the State employer that all management questionnaires originated by the Department of Corrections (CDC) and/or Youth Authority (CYA) not infringe upon the rights afforded to CCPOA under the Ralph C. Dills Act. Copies of all management questionnaires directed toward employees and originated by the departments shall be furnished to CCPOA one (1) week prior to questionnaires being distributed to employees. The State shall also furnish CCPOA, within a reasonable time frame, a copy of all published findings from said study.
2.10	Representation on Committees
A.	If a management-initiated committee has Unit 6 employees participating on said committees or in its meetings, and/or the committee is developing a plan or policy on issues within the scope of representation, CCPOA shall be provided a seat on the committee.

A copy of official minutes, when taken, of said committee meetings shall be provided to the CCPOA representative on the committee.
B.	Only CCPOA’s headquarters may negotiate or designate someone to negotiate any issue, whether statewide or local, under the Meet and Confer sections of the Ralph C. Dills Act or this Agreement.

ARTICLE III ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY
3.01 Dues Deduction
A.	It is the intent of this section to provide for payroll deductions of CCPOA members in Unit 6, relative to dues and insurance programs. CCPOA dues, regular and general assessments, and other membership benefit deductions properly and lawfully authorized will be deducted by the State from the salary of each employee in an amount specified by CCPOA and in accordance with State Controller’s Office administrative policies and procedures and transmitted to CCPOA. Amounts deducted shall be set by CCPOA and changed by the State upon written request of CCPOA. CCPOA agrees to pay charges for service in accordance with State Controller’s Office administrative procedures. The State agrees to provide prior notification of State Controller’s Office service rate changes to the CCPOA.
B.	The written authorization for CCPOA dues deductions shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this MOU.
C.	CCPOA hereby agrees in consideration of forbearance by the State Controller, at the request of CCPOA of the Controller’s right to require a waiver from State employees of any liability for inadvertence or error, as a condition of making payroll deductions for payment to CCPOA pursuant to the Government Code Sections 1151 and 1152, and of benefits accruing to CCPOA, as a result of such forbearance. CCPOA hereby agrees to hold the State of California, the State Controller and his/ her employees harmless from liability for any errors in withholding or transmitting payroll deduction monies for CCPOA except for liability to CCPOA for monies actually withheld, but not transmitted.
3.02 Agency Shop
Since CCPOA has certified that it has a CCPOA membership of at least fifty percent (50%) of the total
11
number of full-time employees in Unit 6, CCPOA is allowed to collect a “fair share” fee from non-CCPOA members who are employees in Bargaining Unit 6.
The fair share shall operate in accordance with the following:
A. The State employer agrees to deduct and transmit to CCPOA all deductions authorized on a form provided by CCPOA, and pursuant to Government Code Section 3515.7, to deduct and transmit to CCPOA all fair share fees from State employees in Unit 6 who do not elect to become members of CCPOA. The State employer agrees to deduct and transmit all deductions and fair share fees during the life of this MOU and after the expiration of this MOU until: (1) a successor agreement is reached, or (2) implementation of the State’s last, best and final offer after negotiations, whichever comes first. The State shall deduct and transmit fair share fees effective with the first pay period following ratification of this MOU. Such authorized dues deductions and fair share fees shall be remitted monthly to CCPOA along with an adequate itemized record of deductions. CCPOA shall pay any reasonable costs incurred by the State Controller. The State employer shall not be liable in any action brought by a State employee seeking recovery of, or damages for, improper use or calculation of fair share fees and CCPOA agrees to hold the state employer harmless for any such action.
B.	Any employee may withdraw from CCPOA by sending a signed withdrawal letter to CCPOA with a copy to the State Controller. Employees who withdraw from CCPOA shall be subject to paying a CCPOA fair share fee as provided above.
C.	The amount of membership dues and fair share fees shall be set by CCPOA and changed by the State upon written notice from CCPOA. CCPOA agrees to notice all affected employees any time there is a change in membership dues or fair share fees.
D.	CCPOA agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the State harmless against any claims made of any na
12
ture and against any suit instituted against the State arising from its checkoff for CCPOA deductions.
E.	Pursuant to Government Code Section 3515.7(c), any employee who is a member of a religious body whose traditional tenet or teachings include objections to joining or financially supporting employee organizations shall not be required to financially support CCPOA. That employee, in lieu of a membership fee or fair share fee deduction, shall instruct the State employer, via a means prescribed by the State Controller, to deduct and pay sums equal to the fair share fee to a non-religious, non-labor organization, charitable fund approved by the State Board of Control for receipt of charitable contributions by payroll deductions.
F.	If an employee who holds conscientious objections pursuant to this item requests individual representation in a grievance, arbitration, or administrative hearing from CCPOA, CCPOA may charge the employee for the reasonable costs of such representation.
G.	An employee who pays a fair share fee shall be entitled to fair and impartial representation by CCPOA. A breach of this duty shall be deemed to have occurred if CCPOA’s conduct in representation is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith.
H.	CCPOA agrees to keep an adequate record of its financial transactions and shall make available annually, to the Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) and to employees in Unit 6 within ninety (90) days after the end of its fiscal year, a detailed written financial report in the form of a balance sheet and an operating statement, certified as to accuracy by the president and treasurer or comparable officers of CCPOA. In the event of failure to comply with this section, the State employer or any employee in Unit 6 may petition the PERB for an order compelling compliance.
I.	CCPOA agrees to annually notify any state employee who pays a fair share fee of his or her right to demand and receive from CCPOA a return of any part of that fee paid by him or her which repre
13
sents the employee’s traditional pro rata share of expenditures by CCPOA that is either in aid of activities or causes of a partisan, political, or ideological nature only incidentally related to the employee’s terms and conditions of employment, or applied toward the cost of any other benefits available only to members of CCPOA.
J.	A fair share form of organizational security enacted pursuant to this article may be rescinded by a majority of those votes cast, rather than a majority of members of the unit, provided that: (a) a request for such a vote is supported by a petition containing the signatures of at least thirty percent (30%) of the permanent full-time employees in the unit; (b) the vote is by secret ballot; and, (c) the vote may be taken at any time during the term of this MOU. If the PERB determines that the appropriate number of signatures has been collected, it shall conduct the vote in a manner which it shall prescribe.
K.	No provision of this article shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this MOU.
L.	Should a majority of employees in Unit 6 rescind the fair share form of organizational security of this MOU, all employees who are, or voluntarily become, members of CCPOA shall remain members of CCPOA, except that a maintenance of membership provision shall not apply to any employee who within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the MOU withdraws from CCPOA by sending a signed withdrawal letter to CCPOA with a copy to the State Controller.

ARTICLE VI
GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
6.01 Purpose
A.	This grievance procedure shall be used to process and resolve formal written grievances arising under this MOU and other employment-related formal written grievances.
B.	The purposes of this procedure are:
1.	To resolve formal written grievances informally at the lowest possible level.
2.	To provide an orderly procedure for reviewing and resolving formal written grievances promptly.
18
6.02 Definitions
A. A “contract grievance” is a dispute between CCPOA and the State, or a dispute of one (1) or more employees against the State, involving the interpretation, application or enforcement of the provisions of this MOU.
B. A “policy grievance” (a non-arbitrable grievance) is a dispute between one (1) or more employees against the State, or a dispute between CCPOA and the State involving subjects not covered by this agreement and not under the jurisdiction of the State Personnel Board. A policy grievance may be processed only to the Director’s level of this grievance procedure unless otherwise capped at a lower level in this agreement (e.g., LOIs/WIDs), and is not arbitrable.
C.	A “health and safety” grievance will include, but not be limited to, such matters as:
1.	Unsafe structural conditions;
2.	Defective or unsafe mechanical equipment;
3.	Defective or unsafe electrical;
4.	Health and environmental hazards including, but not limited to, contained bio-hazard fluids;
5.	Vector Control; and
6.	Violation of acknowledged custodial rules or procedures which would constitute a danger of safety to the employee, worksite or the public.
Health and safety grievances shall be filed directly at Step 2, the Appointing Authority’s level.
D.	The following are merit system appeals under the jurisdiction of SPB, and are not grievable or arbitrable under this MOU. Complainants or appellants are placed on notice that these following items should be appealed directly to SPB unless an initial departmental appeals process has been spelled out in the Youth Authority Administrative Manual (YAM) or the CDC Departmental Operations Manual (DOM):
19
1.	Exam appeals;
2.	Adverse Action appeals (Government Code Section 19570, et seq.);
3.	Merit complaints;
4.	Whistle-blower complaints;
5.	Equal Employment Opportunity complaints (see the YAM or DOM);
6.	Appointment appeals;
7.	Withholds from certification (background investigations).
E.	As used in this procedure, the term “immediate supervisor” means the individual, identified by the Appointing Authority, who assigns, reviews and directs the work of an employee.
F.	As used in this procedure, the term “party” means CCPOA, an employee or the State.
G.	A “CCPOA representative” refers to an employee designated as a CCPOA steward or a paid staff representative.
H.	Grievances shall be filed on a mutually negotiated grievance form provided by the State, and made readily accessible at each and every institution, facility, camp and parole office.
6.03 Time Limits
A.	Each party involved in a formal written grievance shall act quickly so that the grievance may be resolved promptly. Every effort should be made to complete action within the time limits contained in the grievance procedure. However, with the mutual consent of the parties, the time limitation for any step may be extended.
B.	If there has been no mutually agreed-upon time extension, failure to respond to the grievance within the specified time frames shall allow the grievant to file a grievance at the next level. If this occurs, the higher level must respond to the grievance and may not return it to a lower level.
C.	Where mass grievances are filed or arguably frivo-lous/redundant grievance activity is occurring, the State or CCPOA may temporarily freeze all grievance time frames and processing for those griev
20
ances alleged to be in this category. If the State is to invoke this section, the State shall contact CCPOA headquarters, prior to the freezing of the grievances, to arrange a meeting between the local CCPOA Chapter, CCPOA headquarters staff, institutional management staff, and departmental Labor Relations staff, to meet locally on these issues and/or problems associated with the frozen grievances. This shall occur prior to the grievances being unfrozen and the time frames reinstituted. Once this meeting has occurred, the State has fourteen (14) calendar days to respond to the grievances. This also applies to the mini-arb.
6.04 Waiver of Steps
A.	The parties may mutually agree to waive the grievance procedure to the appropriate step for resolution.
B.	Where the lower level is able to resolve the issue or issues grieved, the grievance can be redirected from the higher level to the lower level without the higher level answering the merits of the grievance, but the lower level shall answer within the time frames allowed for the higher level, upon receipt of an expedited transmittal. If the grievant is dissatisfied with the lower level response, the grievance can then be advanced to the next level above the higher level which should have responded to the grievance, with a copy to the initial higher level.
6.05 Presentation
At any step of the grievance procedure, CCPOA may request that the State representative hold a grievance conference. If the State representative agrees to hold a grievance conference and a grievance conference is scheduled, the grievant and the CCPOA representative may attend without loss of compensation.
6.06 Employee Rights
Each employee retains all rights conferred by Section 3512, et seq., of the Ralph C. Dills Act.
6.07 Informal Discussion — Step 1
A.	An employee grievance initially shall be discussed with the employee’s involved supervisor within
21
twenty-one (21) calendar days of the alleged violation or after knowledge of same reasonably should have been acquired. The involved supervisor shall render an immediate response, if possible, or within seven (7) calendar days if he/she requires further research.
B.	If it is clear that the supervisor does not have the authority to grant the grievance, he/she must so state this fact to the grievant immediately on the appropriate worksheet. (See Appendix Item #1)
C.	The involved supervisor’s resolution of the grievance at Step 1 shall be non-precedential.
6.08 Formal Appeal — Step 2
A.	If a grievance is not resolved at Step 1 to the satisfaction of the grievant, a formal grievance may be filed no later than within seven (7) calendar days of the decision at Step 1.
B.	However, if a CCPOA grievance is not initiated at Step 1, the grievance must be filed within twenty-one (21) calendar days after the event or circumstances occasioning the grievance, or within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the alleged violation or after knowledge of same reasonably should have been acquired.
C.	A formal grievance shall be initiated in writing on the mutually negotiated grievance form provided by the State, and shall be filed with the Appointing Authority or designee. Upon filing of the written grievance, the institution or parole region shall assign the grievance a number in accordance with Appendix Item #2.
D.	If the grievance is not in the scope of authority of the Appointing Authority or designee to grant, the grievant’s CCPOA Job Steward may file the grievance directly at Step 3 of the grievance process, unless the grievance alleges a violation of an MOU section which may be appealed to mini-arb pursuant to Section 6.13. These grievances may not be filed directly at the third level under any circumstances.
22
E.	Prior to formally responding to the grievance, there shall be a grievance conference between the griev-ant (if not CCPOA), CCPOA and the Appointing Authority or designee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.03 and 6.04.
F.	Within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt of the formal written grievance, the Appointing Authority or designee shall respond in writing to the grievance as the first level of response. Decisions at this level are considered nonprecedential.
G.	Regardless of who files the grievance, a copy of the grievance and the response shall be mailed by the Appointing Authority or designee to the appropriate office of CCPOA and a copy hand delivered or mailed to the work address of the local CCPOA representative. The postmark date shall determine the date of the response.
H.	This shall be the final level of review for any grievance involving the contents of a LOI or WID, the contents of a performance appraisal, an alleged POBR violation, and all Health and Safety grievances.
6.09 Formal Appeal — Step 3
A. If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision rendered pursuant to Step 2, the decision may be further appealed as follows:
1.	If the grievance alleges a violation of a section of the MOU listed under Section 6.13, the grievance may be appealed to mini-arb under the rules and procedures specified in Section 6.13. This mini-arb shall be the only and final level of review for all such grievances.
2.	If the grievance alleges a violation of any other section of the MOU which may be appealed beyond the second level, the grievance may be appealed to CDC/CYA/DMH Department Director or Designee as follows:
a.	Within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the receipt of the second level response, the grievant or CCPOA may appeal the
23
decision to the Director of the Department or designee.
b.	Within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt of the appealed grievance, the person designated as third level of appeal shall respond in writing to the grievance, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.03 and 6.04.
c.	This shall be the final level of review for all “policy” grievances in that they do not involve the interpretation, application or enforcement of the provisions of this MOU.
d.	Regardless of who files the grievance, a copy of the grievance and said response shall be mailed by the Appointing Authority or designee to the appropriate office of CCPOA.
e.	If the grievance alleges a violation of the following MOU Sections: 2.03, 2.04, 2.08, 2.09, 5.03, 7.04, 7.05, 7.06, 7.07, 9.03, 9.06, 9.09, 10.02 (except D.), 10.08, 10.09, 10.18, 11.02, 11.03, 11.06, 12.04 (except G.), 12.06, 14.05, 16.02, 16.04, 16.07, 17.03, 17.06, 17.09, 17.10, 17.11 (except F.), 17.13, 17.14, 18.01, 18.02, 18.03, 19.01, 19.02, 19.03, 19.07, 20.01, 20.02, 21.01, 21.02, 21.03, 21.04, 21.05, 22.01, 22.02, 22.03, 23.02, 24.01, 24.03, 24.04 (except C), 24.05, 24.08, 24.09, 24.10, 25.01, 25.02, the grievance may be appealed directly to arbitration after the third level response. The appeal to arbitration shall be made by sending a request for arbitration to the Director of the DPA, or designee, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the third level response. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with Section 6.11 of this article.
24
6.10	Formal Appeal — Step 4
A.	If the grievant is not satisfied with the decision rendered at Step 3, the grievant may appeal the decision within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt of the decision as follows:
1.	If the grievance alleges a violation of any the following sections of the MOU: 1.01, 2.01, 2.02, 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 3.01, 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 5.01, 5.02, 5.05, all sections in Article VI, 7.02, 8.01, 8.02, 8.05, 8.06, 9.04, 9.08, 9.10, 9.12, 9.14, 9.15, 9.16, 10.06, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14, 10.17, 11.08, 11.11, 11.12, 12.01, 12.02, 12.03, 13.01, 13.02, 13.03, 13.11, 14.01, 14.03, 14.04, all sections in Article XV (except 15.01 [2nd paragraph], 15.03,15.04 and 15.12(I)), 16.03, 17.02, 17.12, (18.04 See Appendix #15), 21.06, 26.01 (except K.), 27.01, 27.02, 27.03, the grievance must be appealed to the Director of the DPA, or designee within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt of the decision at the third level. Within twenty-one (21) calendar days after receipt of the appealed grievance, the Director of DPA or designee shall respond in writing to the grievance, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.03 and 6.04.
B.	DPA and CCPOA representatives agree to hold quarterly grievance settlement meetings to facilitate the resolution of specific grievances received at the fourth level.
C.	In the event the Department of Personnel Administration renders a grievance response at the fourth level that provides in whole, or in part, a remedy for the contract violation alleged in the grievance, and that remedy is not enforced or implemented in accordance with instructions or directives set forth in the grievance response, the union may compel the enforcement or implementation of the remedy by filing a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 in a court of competent jurisdiction. The union will be deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies nec
25
essary to the pursuit of a writ of mandate upon providing notice to the Department of Personnel Administration of specific nature of the unenforced or unimplemented fourth level grievance remedy, and upon a showing that the remedy remains unenforced or unimplemented for a period of fifteen (15) days following the date of such notice. A court of competent jurisdiction may issue a writ or order compelling the enforcement or implementation of the remedy prescribed in the fourth level grievance response, and may also award costs and attorneys fees upon a showing that there was no reasonable business justification for the delay or failure to implement or enforce the grievance remedy.
6.11	Arbitration
A.	Only grievances which involve the interpretation, application or enforcement of the provisions of this MOU may be appealed to binding arbitration.
B.	Pursuant to subparagraph A. above, if CCPOA is not satisfied with the decision rendered in Step 3 or in Step 4, only CCPOA may appeal the decision to binding arbitration. Such appeal shall be made by written demand within twenty-one (21) days to the Director of DPA or designee. Only grievances which exclusively allege violations of those MOU sections listed in subsection 6.10 A.1. can be appealed to arbitration directly after the third level of response.
CCPOA shall have one hundred eighty (180) calendar days after appealing the grievance to request in writing DPA to strike for arbitrators. If the request to strike arbitrators is not made within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, the grievance shall be considered withdrawn and CCPOA may not proceed to arbitration.
C.	Either party (the State employer or CCPOA) may waive the time limits specified herein and proceed to Step 4 in any case where either party alleges the other is proposing to take an action in violation of the provisions of this MOU, which would result in irreparable injury, in so short a period of time as to disallow the other party from proceeding within
26
the time limits. Within seven (7) calendar days, the Director of DPA or designee shall respond. If there is no satisfactory resolution at Step 3 or 4, either party may appeal the grievance to arbitration by making written demand within fourteen (14) calendar days to the Director of DPA or designee. Only grievances pursuant to subparagraph A., above may be so appealed. The arbitrator shall have the power to: (1) order the party initiating the grievance to abide by the time limits provided in this article; or, (2) issue an order to the party proposing the action to temporarily defer the action. In the latter case, the arbitrator shall have the power to frame a decision provided it does not add to, delete, or alter any provisions of this MOU, or any agreements supplementary thereto, but shall limit the decision to the application and interpretation of its provisions.
D.	The parties agree that they intend this arbitration clause to extend beyond the expiration of the MOU and continue until the implementation of a successor MOU or the implementation of the State’s last, best and final offer after impasse. The State recognizes its obligation to maintain the terms of this MOU after expiration and before agreement on a new MOU or implementation of the State’s last, best and final offer after impasse. Grievances filed during this period will retain the same level of arbitrability as during the life of this MOU.
6.12	Selection and Authority of Arbitrator
A.	An impartial arbitrator shall be selected from a mutually agreed-upon standing panel of no less than twenty (20) arbitrators pre-selected by DPA and CCPOA.

28
1.	The mini-arb shall be held at the local worksite or other mutually agreed upon location.
2.	The arbitrator shall be selected from the list of arbitrators agreed upon by the parties.
3.	The arbitrator shall review and decide multiple grievances at a time. The mini-arbs will be held at least quarterly, as necessary, or when no less than eight (8) grievances under this section are pending review.
4.	Only the grievant, and his/her local CCPOA Job Steward and no more than two (2) local management representatives may appear before the arbitrator to make an oral presentation. The arbitrator shall make his or her decision solely on the written record in the grievance, the grievance response(s), and any oral presentation made at the arbitration proceeding. The presentations shall be time-limited, consistent with the intent of this provision to hold multiple grievance reviews in a single day. Only the arbitrator may ask the other side questions. Labor Relations Representatives may represent the State on one (1) grievance in a twelve (12) month period. CCPOA Field Representatives may represent one (1) grievance in a twelve (12) month period. CCPOA Rank and File Vice-Presidents and the CCPOA Executive Vice-President may represent the grievant on an occasional basis related to specific need. If the use of CCPOA Rank and File Vice-Presidents or the CCPOA Executive Vice-President becomes excessive, this issue will be addressed by the Mini-Arbitration Committee.
5.	The CCPOA Job Steward and the grievant(s) will attend the arbitration proceeding without loss of compensation.

9.	The State and CCPOA agree that no attorneys shall be used in this mini-arb process. This includes anyone who has graduated from law school, except the grievant.
10.	The parties are limited at the mini-arb to presenting only the facts, documents, and arguments presented during the lower levels of the grievance process. Supporting documents may be added after the second level response if said documents are obtained as a result of a written information request submitted prior to the second level response. At the conclusion of the second level grievance conference, for any grievance which has the potential of going to min-arb, the grievance package, including any supporting documentation, will be lettered, i.e., the first page is lettered “A”, the second “B”, etc. The parties will initial the last page.
11.	If during the second level grievance conference either party requests an extension of the second level response time limits to investigate the grievance, the parties will recess the grievance conference. If the grievance conference is recessed, the parties will sign a written waiver form recessing the grievance conference and establishing a date to continue the grievance conference. Time exten
30
sions are limited to one (1) and may not exceed fourteen (14) calendar days.
If the State refuses to recess the grievance conference, then CCPOA shall have fourteen (14) calendar days to issue a rebuttal to the second level grievance response. This rebuttal shall become part of the grievance package forwarded to the mini-arb. If CCPOA refuses to recess the grievance conference, then CCPOA shall not be allowed to rebut the second level grievance response.
12.	If the grievance alleges violations of contract sections that are subject to the mini-arb process and contract sections that are not subject to the mini-arb process, the grievant must choose between either: (1) dropping all of the contract sections subject to the mini-arb process and pursuing through the normal grievance process the contract sections not subject to the mini-arb process, or (2) dropping all of the contract sections not subject to the mini-arb process and pursuing the grievance through the mini-arb process. The grievant must make this choice after the second level response.
13.	When the decision is made by CCPOA to take the grievance to mini-arb, the parties at the local level will meet and number the pages of the grievance package, 1 of however many pages, 2 of however many pages, etc. The parties will initial the last page.
14.	If the second level grievance response contains or relies in part on information that was never discussed or raised in the second level grievance conference, CCPOA shall have fourteen (14) calendar days in which to add a rebuttal to the grievance package.
B.	By mutual agreement between DPA and CCPOA, grievances involving interpretations of other sections of the MOU not listed above may be referred to this process.
31
C.	The Mini-Arbitration Committee established January 2, 1998, will continue to meet on an as-needed basis.
D.	The mini-arb shall be requested by CCPOA sending a letter and the grievance package to the CDC, Labor Relations Office within sixty (60) calendar days of the second level response. The Mini-Arbitration Committee may change the language of this paragraph D., if necessary.
6.14	Arbitration Costs (Except Mini-Arb)
The cost of regular arbitration shall be shared equally between the parties.
6.15	CDC Decision/Settlement
Implementation
A. Whenever DPA receives an arbitration decision, or issues a decision or enters into a settlement agreement of a 4th level grievance which provides a remedy in part or whole, and will require an action(s) by CDC, DPA shall provide CDC with the decision. This decision will include a summary that clearly articulates the necessary remedies to be implemented by CDC for full compliance with the decision.
B.	This summary will include whether the decision/ settlement represents a department wide remedy, or a local issue remedy only. The information will be provided directly to the CDC Chief, Labor Relations Branch (LRB), who will be responsible to notify the respective Chief Deputy Director(s), the Director, and all affected parties to the decision rendered. DPA decisions relevant to remedy of a 4th Level grievance shall carry the full force and weight of Binding Arbitration. CCPOA, at their discretion, may present such decision/settlement to a competent court of law for confirmation.
C.	Upon receipt of an arbitration or 4th Level grievance decision/settlement which provides a remedy in part or whole, the LRB Chief or designee, acting for the Director, will be responsible to prepare a notification of action necessary to implement the arbitration or grievance remedy. This
32
notice will be recorded at the LRB and sent to the appointing authority of the area(s) affected by the decision. The appointing authority(s) will be required to provide the LRB with confirmation of receipt of the notice. Confirmation shall be sent within two (2) working days of receipt of notice.
D.	The affected appointing authority shall be responsible to implement the necessary actions as detailed by the LRB on behalf of the Director. The appointing authority shall be responsible to provide the Director, via the LRB, confirmation that all required actions have been implemented to satisfy the arbitration or decision/settlement. This notification shall be transmitted to the LRB no later than ten (10) working days from receipt of the initial notification.

A.	Purpose and Policy
The parties hereto declare their joint purpose and policy to continue an organized, planned system of apprenticeship, conducted as a joint labor and management departmental undertaking. These
43
standards have, therefore, been adopted and agreed upon under the Shelley-Maloney Apprenticeship Labor Standards Act of 1939, as amended, to govern the employment and training of apprentices in the trade defined herein.
Effective January 1, 1995, the Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, Senate Bill No. 1902, to establish the Commission on Correctional Peace Officers’ Standards and Training (hereafter referred to as “CPOST”). This Act amended Penal Code Sections 13600 and 13601, in order to consolidate the researching, establishment and monitoring of standards for the selection and training of COs, both apprentices and journeypersons. The parties recognize that these legislative amendments effectively renamed the CDC — Department of the Youth Authority Joint Apprenticeship Committee as the CPOST; and gave CPOST the authority to create its own operating rules and regulations.

ARTICLE IX
GENERAL PERSONNEL
9.01 Probation and Annual Performance
Reports
A.	All performance reports shall be in writing and state whether or not the employee has been performing his/her duties successfully. An overall rating of satisfactory or higher shall be considered an indication of successful job performance. For reports utilizing numerical points, an overall average of two (2.0) or above shall be considered as successful job performance. There is to be no rounding.
1.	Probationary performance reports shall be completed at sufficiently frequent intervals to keep the employee adequately informed of progress on the job and shall only cover the time since the previous report. The final probationary performance report may summarize the previously issued probationary performance reports.
2.	In CDC, annual performance reports shall be due on the employee’s birth date, and only cover up to the immediate twelve (12) months prior to the due date of the report. If the employee’s first annual performance report is due less than three (3) months from completion of probation, the annual performance report will not need to be completed until the
54
following calendar year, but will cover the entire period from the final probationary performance report.
3.	In CYA, the existing practice of Annual Performance Reports being due in the same month for all BU6 employees at each facility will continue.
B.	While in the process of completing the annual performance report or a probationary report, the employee’s supervisor shall personally meet with the employee to review the report, any notes, documents, or audits utilized in preparing the report. Nothing of a negative nature shall be mentioned in a performance report if the performance was not previously documented and discussed with the employee during the rating period. Unless an employee’s performance was of a continuing nature or the instance was particularly egregious, a singular event shall not be the basis for a substandard rating. Generally, employees who correct their performance to satisfactory during the rating period should receive a standard or better rating.
C.	Performance reports shall, as a general rule, be completed and issued to the employee no later than thirty (30) days after the due date of the report. At the time an employee signs his/her probationary or annual performance report, a copy will be provided to the employee.
D.	The probationary period for all employees shall be one (1) year. PIEs must work twelve (12) calendar months and physically work a minimum of 1,680 hours in order to complete their probationary period.
E.	Performance reports shall be maintained in an employee’s official personnel file in accordance with each Department’s retention schedule, at which time it shall be removed and given to the employee unless he/she requests that it be destroyed.
9.02 Supervisory File
Except when a rejection on probation or an adverse action is being prepared, the notes and documents which were used in preparing the report, or which have
55
time limitations which have lapsed, shall be removed from supervisory files upon expiration of the grievance time frame and given to the employee unless he/she requests that it be destroyed, this shall include any documents which are maintained electronically. Any reference to adverse actions should not be maintained in the supervisory file other than any reference to such in the most current performance report.
9.03 Location of, and Employee Access to, Files
A.	There shall be only one (1) official personnel file and one (1) supervisory work file regarding each employee. An employee will have access to his/ her personnel file, supervisory file, medical file, and training or IST file. Access to investigative files shall be pursuant to the Bodiford decision.
B.	An employee may request an inspection of his/her official personnel file, by the employee or the employee’s representative, at the employee’s work location. The departments will endeavor to schedule such file reviews in conjunction with other business travel proximal to the employee’s work location. For those personnel files maintained at a central location not in close proximity to the employee’s worksite, the employee shall be provided a copy of the information contained in his/ her file upon request. CCPOA may, upon request of the employee, send a representative to monitor the reproduction of the material.
C.	Upon request, each employee shall be informed of the existence and location of any and all files, including electronic files pertaining to files in Section A. above, regarding said employee, and the employee or his/her representative shall have a right to inspect these files during regular office hours, unless deemed confidential.
D.	The Department shall follow the guidelines established by the Public Information Act and Information Practices Act to insure the privacy of the employee is not violated.
E.	Each employee’s personnel file, supervisory file, and medical file, shall contain an inspection log.
56
Any person reviewing the file shall sign and date the log, unless excluded by law.
F.	The departments shall make best efforts to identify all existing employee files and to notice CCPOA of what files exist and where.
G.	Within 90 days of ratification by both parties, each appointing authority shall establish a joint labor/ management committee to advise the appointing authority regarding measures to aid in ensuring there is no knowing removal of personal information regarding Unit 6 employees from State prisons or CYA institutions without proper authorization, and that notice is given to the employee if his/her personal information is lost, stolen or can no longer be accounted for. The establishment of this committee shall not preclude CCPOA or its members from seeking remedies outside the grievance process.
9.04 Access and/or Release of Employee Files to Nondepartmental Persons
Unless released pursuant to court order or subpoena, information in the employee’s official personnel, train-ing/IST, medical, citizens complaint and/or supervisory files is confidential, and will be available for inspection only to the employee, his designee, the department head, or his/her designee in connection with the proper administration of the department’s affairs and/or supervision of the employee, and the employee shall be immediately informed of the service of a subpoena requesting release of information from his/her file, or of a court order effecting the same.
9.05 Letters of Instruction/Work Improvement Discussions
A.	LOIs/WIDs shall contain a specified expiration date, not to exceed one (1) year from the date that management should have reasonably known of the incident resulting in the LOI/WID. A LOI/WID should be removed from all of the employee’s files prior to its expiration date, provided that all requirements contained in the LOI/WID have been met. Upon the employee’s request to the Appointing Authority or his/her designee, the LOI/WID shall be re
57
moved and given to the employee unless he/she requests that it be destroyed.
B.	LOIs/WIDs shall be issued in a timely fashion, generally within thirty (30) days from when the incident occurred or from date of discovery of the incident that forms the basis for the LOI/WID. Unless special circumstances exist, LOIs/WIDs should not be written if the knowledge of the incident is more than thirty (30) days old.
C.	In cases where departmental staff are investigating an employee in a situation in which adverse action potentially may follow, and the decision is made to give the employee an LOI/WID, the LOI/ WID shall be issued in a timely fashion, generally within thirty (30) days from the decision to give the employee an LOI. This will not prevent the parties from negotiating a formal adverse action down to an LOI/WID.
D.	The parties agree that LOIs/WIDs (or similar documents regardless of title as discussed in subsection E below) are instructional and intended to improve job performance. Accordingly, LOIs/WIDs shall not be cited as charges in any adverse action. They may be used as supporting evidence by the State in a later disciplinary case, if the expiration date has not yet occurred, in order to show that the State has put the employee on notice about what is expected in the future.
The LOI/WID (or similar document) may only be cited in or submitted as support for a subsequent adverse action to prove the employee knew about a law, rule, policy or employer expectation. The document shall not be cited in a subsequent Notice of Adverse Action or admitted into evidence to prove prior misconduct (or a pattern of misconduct) leading to the adverse action.
E.	This provision shall not be circumvented by calling the document by another title such as: Letter of Informal Discussion, Report of Counseling, Letters of Contact, or Expectations of Work Performance memos. Such “minor” corrective memos are to be placed in the employee’s supervisory file, but not in the employee’s personnel file.
58
F.	The employee shall have the right to submit a rebuttal to any LOI/WID, or any such comment referred to in subsection E. above. This rebuttal shall be attached to and shall accompany the LOI/WID.
G.	Disputes concerning this section are adjudicated under the mini-arb section. However, a violation of section D above is arbitrable under sections 6.11 and 6.12 and 6.11 C in particular. The Arbitrator cannot in making his/her decision evaluate, review, or in any other manner involve the contents of the disputed document.
9.06 Adverse Action and Citizen Complaint Documents
A.	Upon the employee’s written request, all official Notices of Adverse Action, all documentation leading to or supporting or proposing such action, and all SPB decisions rendered in such cases will be purged from the employee’s official personnel file(s) after three (3) years.
B.	Upon the employee’s written request, all citizens’ complaints, reports and findings related to Penal Code Section 832.5 shall be purged from the Department’s files after a period of five (5) years.
9.	07 Out-of-Classification Assignments
A.	Notwithstanding Government Code Sections 905.2, 19818.8, an employee may be required to perform work other than that described in the specification for his/her classification for up to one hundred twenty (120) consecutive calendar days during a fiscal year.
B.	Out-of-Class When Required
If a department head or designee requires an employee, in writing, to work in a higher classification for more than fifteen (15) calendar days, the employee shall receive a pay differential of five percent (5%) over his/her normal daily rate of the class to which he/she is appointed for that period in excess of fifteen (15) calendar days. If a department head or designee requires, in writing, an employee to work in a higher classification for thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or more, the employee shall
59
receive a pay differential of five percent (5%) over his/her normal daily rate of the class to which he/ she is appointed from the first day of the assignment. If the assignment to a higher classification is not terminated before it exceeds one hundred twenty (120) consecutive calendar days, the employee shall be entitled to receive the difference between his/her salary and the salary of the higher class at the same step the employee would receive if the employee were to be promoted to that class, for that period in excess of one hundred twenty (120) consecutive calendar days. The five percent (5%) differential shall not be considered as part of the base pay in computing the promotional step in the higher class.
C.	Should any employee file suit against CCPOA seeking to declare this provision illegal, the State shall indemnify for any costs incurred in defending itself.
D.	The State shall not rotate employees in and out of out-of-class assignments for the purpose of avoiding payment of an out-of-class differential.
E.	It is not the State’s intent to select employees for out-of-class assignments based on favoritism.
F.	If any dispute arises about this out-of-class section (subsections A. through G.) an employee may file a grievance and arbitrate the grievance utilizing the mini-arb process described in Article VI.
G.	It is not the intent of either party to circumvent any certified hiring or promotional list, or the Merit System in general. Furthermore, whenever possible, the Appointing Authority shall choose employees for out-of-class appointments from the current hiring list for the particular job classification for which the employee is to be hired on an acting basis. If there is no appropriate current hiring list at the local facility or office complex, the State shall assign the out-of-class duty only to those employees who are qualified to take the examination for entry into that classification. Permanent employees who vacate positions to accept out-of-class assignments shall have a mandatory right of return to their former
60
position and assignment, when possible, upon the conclusion of the out-of-class work.
9.08 Classification Proposals
The State agrees to notify CCPOA thirty (30) days in advance of classification proposals the State presents to SPB that impact employees in Unit 6. CCPOA agrees to notify the relevant department thirty (30) days in advance of classification proposals that CCPOA presents to SPB.
9.09 Personnel Investigations
A.	An employee who is under investigation for an action or incident which is likely to result in formal adverse action shall be normally notified, at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the investigative interview, simultaneously, in writing, of both the subject matter and his/her right to representation prior to any interrogation, fact-finding, investigatory interview, or shooting review board, or similarly-purposed discussion which has the potential of obtaining information which, if found to be true, could or is likely to result in formal adverse action. The employee will be given a reasonable opportunity to secure the representative of his/her choice.
B.	If an employee is called to an investigatory interview and the employee reasonably believes the subject matter of the investigation is such that the employee could possibly receive discipline, the employee, at his or her request, shall be given a reasonable opportunity to secure a representative of his/her choice.
C.	The employee will be provided with a copy of all documents and/or other investigatory material in accordance with the Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights (POBR) and any current or subsequent court decisions which impact or alter Government Code Section 3300, et seq.
D.	Whenever a ward/inmate/parolee/patient files or submits a grievance, a 602 (“Inmate Appeal”), any written complaint, or verbal complaint which is later reduced to writing by either the inmate or the State, which, if found true, could result in adverse action
61
against the employee or contain a threat against the employee, the Department agrees to immediately notice the employee of said filing. The State agrees to provide the affected employee a copy of said document if the employee so requests. This is not intended to preclude the informal level response procedure in the current CDC Operations Manual. Upon the employee’s request, a copy of the outcome of the ward/inmate/parolee/patient’s complaint shall be provided, if the complaint has progressed beyond the informal stage. The Employer and CCPOA agree that all video tapes, audio tapes or any other kind of memorialization of an inmate/ward/parolee/patient statement or complaint shall be treated as a writing within the meaning of this subsection. The tapes or “writings” shall be turned over, regardless of whether the com-plaint/statement is deemed “inmate/ward/parolee/ patient initiated” or not.
E.	However, whenever the Department is conducting an investigation which necessitates surveillance, obtaining a search warrant, undercover operations, or a “sting,” the employer need not inform the employee of the written complaint until the investigation is completed.
F.	The State agrees that any Unit 6 member under investigation shall be granted an opportunity to view the cell extraction videotape with his/her representative prior to the related investigatory interview. Management can have a representative present at the viewing to ensure the integrity of the tape, but the management’s representative shall not be so close as to intrude in a private communication.
G.	The Departments acknowledge their obligation to complete all Unit 6 personnel investigations within twelve (12) months under the terms and exceptions of Government Code Sections 3304 and 3309.5 inclusive. This subsection 9.09 F. is not arbitrable. The employee may, however, at any time utilize whatever remedies may be available under POBR.
62
9.10 Requests for Reinstatement After AWOL Separation
A. An employee separated, pursuant to California Government Code Section 19996.2 (the AWOL statute), shall be afforded a Coleman hearing by his/her Appointing Authority within ten (10) work days after service of the notice of separation. The date of service is either the date of personal service or the date of the mailing of the notice. Neither a failure to afford a Coleman hearing nor the decision of the Coleman officer shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement.
B.	Requests for reinstatement after AWOL separation shall be handled solely through the grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement, beginning at the third step.
If a request for reinstatement goes to arbitration, the arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to deciding the following: (1) whether the employee has a satisfactory explanation for his/her absence; (2) whether the employee has a satisfactory explanation for failing to obtain leave; and (3) whether the employee is ready, willing, and able to return to work, and/or, if not, whether the employee has leave from his/her Appointing Authority to be absent.
The arbitrator may order reinstatement only if the employee establishes satisfactory reasons for the absence and the failure to obtain leave and if he/ she is ready, willing, and able to return to work or has leave to be absent. If the employee is reinstated, back pay may be awarded.
9.11	Peace Officer Bill of Rights
The Peace Officer Bill of Rights, hereafter referred to as POBR, applies to all Peace Officers in Bargaining Unit 6. Alleged POBR violations may be grieved up to the Appointing Authority’s level, but shall not be grievable nor arbitrable beyond this level. This section shall not constitute a waiver of any of the appeal rights granted a Peace Officer under POBR.
63
9.12	CDC/CYA DOT Drug Testing
The parties agree that the CDC and CYA DOT Drug Testing Agreement shall be an addendum to this agreement.
9.13	Substance Abuse — Reasonable Suspicion Testing
The parties have met and conferred over the State’s substance abuse policy set forth in DPA Rules 599.960 through 599.966 and hereby agree to the following:
A.	General Policy. (Ref. DPA Rule 599.960)
The State and CCPOA agree that it is the purpose of its policy on substance abuse testing to help ensure that the State work place is free from the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, and to do so in a way that protects constitutional and statutory rights of employees. The provisions on substance abuse testing are not meant to be a limitation upon the use, nor replace, the State’s Employee Assistance Program; nor are the provisions meant to be a limitation upon the State’s ability to order a medical examination or take adverse action.
B.	Reasonable Suspicion. (Ref. DPA Rule 599.962)
1.	Information from an anonymous source or from an inmate/ward/parolee/patient source shall not be the sole criterion for determining reasonable suspicion. Anonymous information or inmate/ward/parolee/patient-origi-nated information must be supported or corroborated by the Appointing Authority and his or her designee in order to order reasonable suspicion testing.
2.	For purposes of determining reasonable suspicion, the Department of Corrections, Youth Authority, and Mental Health will make every effort to consult with an on-duty medical staff person authorized by the Department, when available on duty at the worksite. However, the decision to order a substance abuse test shall remain with the Appointing Authority or designee.
64
3.	The State agrees to develop a training program for its supervisors and designees in the administration of its substance abuse policy. This training shall include a section on recognizing symptoms of substance abuse, and other factors which may constitute reasonable suspicion.
4.	The facts and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion is based, shall be given to the employee at least orally at the time the employee is directed to submit to a substance abuse test, and shall be made available in writing within twenty-four (24) hours. These facts and circumstances shall be documented on a form to be developed by the State. Such documentation shall include observations of the relevant on-duty medical person specified in B.2. above. The oral conversation may be taped by either the State or the employee.
C.	Testing Procedures and Standards. (Ref. DPA Rule 599.963)
1.	If the Appointing Authority receives DPA approval to test for the improper use of a substance not listed in the statewide policy, it will inform the employee of its intent to test for that substance prior to the actual sample analysis.
2.	The sample collected under a substance abuse test will not be used to test for any other medical condition such as pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, or other diseases such as diabetes. However, the sample could be used to match such sample with subject.
3.	Substances to be tested for shall include the following, using established procedures specified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA): (Levels in effect July 1, 1999.)
65
Substance	Screening Test Concentration Level	Confirmatory Test Concentration Level
Amphetamines	1000 nanograms per milliliter	500 nanograms per milliliter
Methamphetamines	1000 nanograms per milliliter	500 nanograms per milliliter
Cannabinoids	50 nanograms per milliliter	15 nanograms per milliliter
Cocaine (Benzoylecgonine)	300 nanograms per milliliter	150 nanograms per milliliter
Opiates	2000 nanograms per milliliter	300 nanograms per milliliter
Phencyclidine (PCP)	25 nanograms per milliliter	25 nanograms per milliliter
Benzodiazepines	300 nanograms per milliliter	300 nanograms per milliliter
Methaqualone	300 nanograms per milliliter	750 nanograms per milliliter
Barbiturates	300 nanograms per milliliter as secobarbital	200 nanograms per milliliter
Alcohol	.04% weight/ volume	.04% weight/ volume
The present cut-offs shown for the first six (6) substances are those established by the SAMHSA. There are no SAMHSA cut-offs for the remaining substances. The State will use the test cut-off levels established by SAMHSA for identifying positive test samples. Where SAMHSA does not establish cut-off levels for a substance, the State will notice CCPOA of the cut-off level to be used. Should the State desire to change the cut-off lev
66
els based on changes to SAMHSA or other standards, the State will notice CCPOA and meet to discuss the changes.
4.	The State agrees that the procedures for collecting the sample should be done in a professional manner with due regard to the employee’s privacy and confidentiality, consistent with the State’s need to ensure a true sample is taken. The State will follow SAMHSA guidelines in establishing these procedures. (See Appendix Item #3 for a list of SAMHSA Privacy Procedures for collecting urine specimens.)
5.	The State shall maintain and follow a secure chain of custody to ensure true samples are taken. In establishing this chain of custody, the State will take the SAMHSA guidelines into consideration as well as recommendations of the laboratories selected to do the testing. The State agrees to meet with CCPOA to review the chain of custody procedures, and consider CCPOA recommendations once the laboratories have been selected. Once the chain of custody procedures have been finalized, they shall be provided to CCPOA in writing.
6.	Consistent with Section 599.964(d), the testing laboratory will be informed of its obligation to preserve a sufficient portion of the sample to be independently tested by the employee.
7.	If the State intends to rely on a positive test result to initiate adverse action, it shall notify the laboratory that all portions of the sample, including any portion reserved for the employee, should be retained pending completion of any appeal procedures.
8.	Copies of the test results and chain-of-cus-tody documents shall be provided within three (3) work days of receipt of the documented results by management.
67
9.	CCPOA may submit a list of commercial laboratories for the State to consider in developing its “bid package” for testing services. Such submissions must meet standards used by SAMHSA, the College of American Pathologists, or other comparable standards to accredit laboratories for forensic urine testing. Such submissions shall in no way obligate the State to select such laboratories to perform testing services.
10.	The State shall use the commercial laboratories selected or otherwise approved by DPA. CCPOA shall be notified of the laboratory selected to perform the testing changes.
D.	Employee Rights. (Ref. DPA Rule 599.964)
1.	In addition to the rights specified in DPA Rule 599.964, employees shall be entitled to representation during the sample collection process. A representative shall in no way interfere with the sample collection process. CCPOA will provide timely representation upon request.
2.	DPA Rules 599.960 through 599.966 and this supplement shall be mailed to current employees at the time of final implementation. These rules shall also be made available upon request, but such request shall not be deemed to require a delay in the testing process. They will be provided to new hires within the first three (3) weeks at the Academy or the first week of employment at the work location, whichever is first.
3.	For purposes of requiring an employee to submit to periodic testing as a condition of remaining or returning to State employment (refer to paragraph c. of State’s proposed 599.960), the State agrees to develop guidelines for “return to work agreements” which specify the conditions under which an employee may remain in his or her employment. Conditions appropriate for these return to work guidelines include but are not limited to
68
a.	Periodic testing for substance abuse during the period of the return to work agreement, during which the employee must test negative at all times;
b.	Reasonable suspicion testing for substance abuse during the return to work agreement under the terms of the general policy;
c.	Requirement that the employee participate in a substance abuse rehabilitation program at the employee’s expense;
d.	Termination of the employee if its conditions are violated.
Placing an employee on such “Return to Work Agreement” shall not preclude adverse action short of termination. (See Appendix Item #6 and Sideletter #3)
4.	Should an employee be found to have tested positive for a substance, and adverse action is taken against said employee, his/her appeal and remedies should be through the SPB appeal process and not through the grievance arbitration sections of the MOU.
5.	Persons who do not test positive shall not have any record of the test placed in his/her official personnel file, unless the employee so requests, and may file a complaint over the administration of the test.
E.	Expedited Grievance Process for Addressing Issues Related to Section 9.13.
1.	An aggrieved employee or the Union has ten (10) work days from the date of the administration of a drug test on an employee, or ten (10) days from the date of discovery of an alleged procedural non-conformance, to file an expedited grievance alleging procedural nonconformance.
2.	The expedited grievance shall be filed at the departmental level. The State shall have ten (10) work days to respond.
69
Prior to responding, and within the ten (10) work days, a grievance conference shall be held if requested by the State or CCPOA.
3.	If the grievant is not satisfied with the departmental decision, the grievant may appeal the decision within five (5) work days after receipt of the decision, to DPA. This level shall be considered the final step in this expedited grievance process, and constitutes an exhaustion of the administrative remedies available to Bargaining Unit 6 employees and CCPOA pertaining to Section 9.13. This shall not preclude an appellant who is subsequently subject to adverse action because of violation of DPA Rules 599.960 to 599.966 to raise any issues regarding procedural non-compliance with Section 9.13 or DPA Rules 599.960 to 599.966 before the SPB. It is clearly understood that Section 9.13 and DPA Rules 599.960 to 599.966 are not arbitrable, and constitutes an exhaustion of administrative remedies unless the issue is raised before the SPB in an adverse action appeal.
9.14	Random Substance Testing Program
A.	Authority and Purpose
1.	It is the intent of the State and the Union to maintain a drug and alcohol free workplace. This objective is accomplished through education, employee assistance, reasonable suspicion and random drug and alcohol testing, and discipline. Consistent with a Peace Officer’s sworn oath to uphold the laws of the State of California, each Bargaining Unit 6 Peace Officer employee shall not illegally use or be impaired from the use of a drug designated in subsection B.1.a.(1) through (8), or be impaired by use of alcohol while on the job.
2.	To maintain a workplace free from the negative effects of drug and alcohol use, the parties agree that, effective April 15, 1998, all newly hired Bargaining Unit 6 employees and newly reinstated employees with a break in
70
service of more than twelve (12) months, as defined in Section 12.01, will be subject to unannounced random drug and alcohol testing. Newly hired means when an employee is first appointed into a Bargaining Unit 6 classification.
3.	It is expected that CDC and CYA (the Departments) will begin testing managers and supervisors in calendar year 2000. Testing of rank and file will not be expanded until testing of managers and supervisors has been implemented.
4.	Testing of additional rank and file employees will only begin after reaching agreement with the Union on a procedure to test these rank and file employees. Negotiations on procedures to test these rank and file employees will commence six (6) months following testing of twenty percent (20%) of the managers and supervisors.
5.	It is the expectation of the parties that the expansion of drug testing of the additional rank and file will begin during the second year of the contract.
B.	Random Testing Process and Standards
1.	The drug and alcohol testing process shall be one that is scientifically proven to be at least as accurate and valid as urinalysis using an immunoassay screening test, with all positive screening results being confirmed, utilizing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry before a sample is considered positive. The alcohol testing process shall be one that is scientifically proven to be at least as accurate and valid as (1) urinalysis using an enzymatic assay screening test, with all positive screening results being confirmed using gas chromatography before a sample is considered positive or (2) breath sample testing using an evidential breath testing device which meets the standards specified in the federal regulation 49 CFR Part 40 and is an approved device on the federal conforming products list.
71
a.	Substances to be tested for shall include the following, using established procedures specified by SAMHSA:
(1)	Amphetamines and Methamphetamines
(2)	Cocaine
(3)	Marijuana/Cannabinoids (THC)
(4)	Opiates (narcotics)
(5)	Phencyclidine (PCP)
(6)	Barbiturates
(7)	Benzodiazepines
(8)	Methaqualone
(9)	Alcohol
b.	The State will use the test cut-off levels established by SAMHSA for identifying positive test samples.
2.	Test samples will be collected in a clinical setting, such as a laboratory collection station, doctor’s office, hospital or clinic, or in another setting approved by the State on the basis that it provides for at least an equally secure and professional collection process, with due regard for the employee’s privacy and confidentiality. The State shall use SAMHSA chain of custody procedures to ensure that true samples are obtained.
3.	The State shall use SAMHSA chain of custody procedures to ensure that a sample is maintained from the time it is taken, through the testing process, to its final disposition.
4.	Substance tests shall be performed by a SAMHSA approved laboratory.
5.	The State will use the Health Evaluation and Information system for Drug abuse in Industry (HEIDI) computer software to randomly select employees for testing. Approximately thirty-five percent (35%) of the Bargaining Unit 6 employees will be selected for drug and alcohol testing annually.
72
C.	Employee Rights
1.	Each employee subject to random testing shall be given a copy of an information packet explaining the employee’s rights and the substance abuse procedures to be followed.
2.	An employee suspected of violating this Article shall be entitled to representation during any interrogative interviews with the affected employee that could lead to a decision by the Appointing Authority to take adverse action against the employee. The employee shall also be entitled to representation in any discussions with the Medical Review Officer that occur under subsection D.
3.	The sample collection process shall include the opportunity for the employee to provide information about factors other than illegal drug use, such as taking legally prescribed medication, that could cause a positive test result. At the employee’s option, this information may be submitted in a sealed envelope to be opened only by the Medical Review Officer if the test result is positive.
4.	The employee shall receive a full copy of any test results and related documentation of the testing process.
5.	All confirmed positive samples shall be retained by the testing laboratory in secure frozen storage for one (1) year following the test or until the sample is no longer needed for appeal proceedings or litigation, whichever is longer. At the employee’s request and expense, the sample may be retested by that laboratory or another laboratory of the employee’s choice.
D.	Medical Review Officer
1.	The State shall designate one (1) or more Medical Review Officers, who shall be licensed physicians, to receive test results from the laboratory. Upon receiving results, the Medical Review Officer shall:
73
a.	Review the results and determine if the standards and procedures required by this Article have been followed.
b.	For positive results, interview the affected employee to determine if factors other than illegal drug use may have caused the result.
c.	Consider any assertions by the affected employee of irregularities in the sample collection and testing process.
d.	Based on the above, provide a written explanation of the test results to the Appointing Authority or his/her designee. The employee shall also receive a copy of this explanation.
E.	Records, Confidentiality
1.	The State shall maintain records of the results of any employee testing under this Article. These records, and any other information pertaining to an employee’s drug or alcohol test, shall be considered confidential and shall be released only to:
a.	The employee who was tested or other individuals designated in writing by that employee.
b.	The Medical Review Officer.
c.	DPA, as needed, for the effective administration of the Article.
d.	Individuals who need the records or information to:
(1)	Determine, or assist in determining, what action the Appointing Authority should take in response to the test results.
(2)	Respond to appeals or litigation arising from the drug test or related actions.
F.	If Section 5.02 applies to this section, then the provisions of Section 5.02 shall apply or the parties may renegotiate minor discipline.
74
9.15	Disciplinary Process
A.	No State official or employee shall impose or threaten to impose reprisals on employees, discriminate or threaten to discriminate against employees, or otherwise interfere or threaten to interfere with employees, restrain or threaten to restrain employees, or coerce or threaten to coerce employees because of their exercise of their appeal rights to the SPB or its authorized representative or for appearing as a witness before the SPB or its authorized representative.
B.	Upon request from CCPOA legal staff, the State will allow the CCPOA Chapter President or Job Steward a reasonable amount of State time to be released from his/her assignment to attend an SPB hearing to assist CCPOA legal staff on technical issues when the hearing is held at the institution.
9.16	Course and Scope Protection - Defense in Civil and Criminal Actions
A. Civil Actions
1.	This section is not designed to change the substantive rights and responsibilities of either the State employer or an affected correctional employee. Rather, it is to provide an alternative quick and less expensive (as compared to going to court) process by which such rights and responsibilities are to be determined.
2.	In any case where a bargaining unit member is sued civilly s/he may tender a defense of the action to the State employer, using procedures agreed upon by CCPOA and DPA applicable to all departmental employees within ninety (90) days of ratification.
3.	This section will apply to all civil actions filed against Bargaining Unit 6 employees on or after the effective date of this MOU even if the events alleged occurred prior to this MOU section becoming effective. If the State employer refuses the tender of defense, then:
a.	The State employer shall give to the employee a written, detailed statement ex
75
plaining the reasons for the decline of the tender;
b.	Said reasons shall comply with Government Code section 995 et seq with regard to the rights and responsibilities of both the State employer and the correctional employee (bargaining unit member);
c.	If CCPOA believes that the tender of defense violates the rights of the employee under Government Code section 995 et seq. (and section 995.2 in particular), then CCPOA and CCPOA alone shall have the right to grieve the propriety of the refusal of the tender of defense. Moreover, because time is of the essence, the parties agree that any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this section shall be resolved through Section 6.11 and Section 6.12 (e.g., 6.12 (c)) provided the employee first executes a waiver of any and all rights to challenge the denial of representation in some other forum, including a court of competent jurisdiction. The grievant (CCPOA) and employer will have the right to present testimony, statements and documents in support of their respective positions in accordance with the following:
(1)	All parties shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and documents, and may assert any and all privileges. Additionally, the adjudicator shall refuse to issue or quash any subpoena upon a demonstration that the production of the witness or document creates an undue burden or significantly interferes with the ability to prepare for or defend against an underlying civil action.
76
(2)	If the adjudicator refuses to issue or quashes a subpoena based on a demonstration as discussed in subparagraph a above, the employee shall be permitted to either proceed pursuant to Section 6.11 and 6.12 notwithstanding the adjudicator’s ruling, or elect to challenge the denial of representation by proceeding directly to court under Government Code section 996 et seq. If the employee proceeds pursuant to Sections 6.11 and 6.12 despite the adjudicator’s ruling, the employee does not prevail, then nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the employee from challenging the denial of representation just as if Sections 6.11 and 6.12 were never invoked.
(3)	Where the events leading to the denial of representation give rise to both criminal and civil liability, and a prosecuting agency makes a written request to the State, the following shall occur:
(a)	The Section 6.11 and 6.12 provisions of this section shall be stayed; and, the employee and State shall jointly move the court in which the civil action is venued to stay its proceedings until the criminal matter is concluded.
(b)	In the unlikely event that the civil court does not stay proceedings pending completion of the criminal matter, then CCPOA shall have the option of proceeding pursuant to Section 6.11 and 6.12. CCPOA shall provide the State with a list of witnesses and
77
documents requiring a subpoena because they are not available voluntarily or through some other means of discovery. The adjudicator may issue a subpoena for said witnesses and documents unless a written objection is presented by a prosecuting authority in which case the subpoena shall not issue. CCPOA may then elect to proceed pursuant to Section 6.11 and 6.12 or proceed with other remedies.
(4)	Any decision rendered pursuant to this section shall be in accordance with substantive law on the subject of the tender of defense by State employees, including but not limited to Government Code section 995 et seq. and cases interpreting same.
B.	Criminal Actions
1.	By written request to the Director, an employee may request legal representation from the Department in a criminal matter brought against the employee, as a result of an alleged act or omission arising out of the employees employment. This section covers all criminal charges filed against Unit 6 employees, on or after October 1, 2001, even if the events underlying the charges occurred prior to the ratification of the MOU.
2.	If an employee requesting legal representation in a criminal matter brought on account of an alleged act or omission arising out of the employee’s employment for which the employee has been cleared by any departmental investigation or review, the Department will provide the employee with legal representation in the criminal action unless and until the Department obtains information which it contends supports one of the conditions of
78
withdrawal of defense under Government Code section 995.2.
3.	The employee and his attorney will be provided with the detailed reasons for the Department’s denial or withdrawal of the request for representation. Neither the denial nor the withdrawal shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure. However, in the event that the Department denies the employee representation in a criminal matter (whether the Department has cleared the employee or not) arising out of the course and scope of employment, and the employee is subsequently acquitted of all charges, or the charges are dropped or dismissed by a Court in their entirety without the employee suffering any sentence, penalty, fine, service or diversion, the Department shall reimburse the employee for all reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in defense of the criminal matter.
ARTICLE X
LEAVES
10.01 Vacation Leave
A. Employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave credit for the first six (6) months of service. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying months, employees covered by this section shall receive a onetime vacation credit of forty-eight (48) hours. Thereafter, for each additional qualifying monthly pay period, the employee shall be allowed credit for vacation with pay on the first day of the following monthly pay period as follows:
7 months to 3 years .
37 months to 10 years .. 121 months to 15 years 181 months to 20 years 241 months and over ...
. 8 hours per month 11 hours per month 13 hours per month 14 hours per month 15 hours per month
79
B.	Breaks in employment of eleven (11) work days or more, including unpaid leaves of absence, shall not be counted towards vacation leave accrual purposes set forth under paragraph A. above.
C.	Employees who work less than full-time shall receive vacation leave credit in accordance with the vacation leave accrual schedule in paragraph A. above, when total accumulated employment equals one (1) month of full-time employment.
D.	Employees who work on an intermittent basis shall receive vacation leave credits in accordance with the vacation leave accrual schedule in paragraph A. above, on the basis of one hundred sixty (160) hours of paid employment equals one (1) month of full-time employment. Any hours worked over one hundred sixty (160) hours in a monthly pay period shall not be counted toward vacation leave accrual. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of the initial six (6) qualifying pay periods, an intermittent employee shall receive a one-time vacation credit of forty-eight (48) hours. Thereafter, intermittent employees shall receive vacation credit in accordance with the schedule in paragraph A. above on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period. The hours of paid employment in excess of one hundred sixty (160) hours in a monthly pay period shall not be counted or accumulated.
1.	In CDC and CYA, a PIE shall be allowed to utilize up to two (2) 40-hour weeks of paid vacation each year and may be permitted by an appointing authority to use more. Alternatively, PIEs may request up to two (2) 40- hour weeks of unpaid time off. Once a vacation period or unpaid time off has been granted, it shall not be canceled by management, except in emergencies.
2.	Vacation/unpaid time off requests will be submitted to the Personnel Assignment Lieutenant (and administered) using the PIE’s Academy hire date until the implementation
80
of the seniority calculations under Section 12.01. At that time, vacation/unpaid time off requests will be made in the same manner as requests made by permanent full-time staff. Although PIEs will not use the authorized positions in the vacation relief pool, the institution will establish a vacation schedule that will allow up to 1/26 of the total number of PIEs at the institution to be on vacation or unpaid time off in any given two-week vacation period.
a. When it is determined that there is a lack of work, a department head or designee may:
(1)	Schedule the intermittent employee for vacation leave; or
(2)	Allow the intermittent employee to retain his/her vacation credits; or
(3)	Effect a combination of (1), or (2) above.
E.	If an employee does not use all of the vacation leave credit that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued vacation leave hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee:
1.	Was required to work as a result of fire, flood or other extensive emergency;
2.	Was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time;
3.	Was absent on full salary for compensable injury; or,
4.	Was prevented by Department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave.
81
F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
G.	The time when vacation is to be taken shall be determined by the department head or designee. When two (2) or more employees request the same vacation time and the department head or designee cannot grant the request to all employees requesting it, approval shall be granted in order of seniority.
H.	If an employee desires to cancel a pre-scheduled vacation time, the employee:
1.	Shall notify the supervisor, in writing, no less than thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the scheduled vacation time;
2.	May not carry over excess vacation time which may accrue as a result of the cancellation; and,
3.	If assigned to a community-based facility, institution or camp, may not cancel the scheduled vacation time if more than one-quarter ( ) of those scheduled for a vacation during the same pay period have been approved for cancellations, unless specifically approved by facility/institution management. Failure to notify the supervisor in writing in 1. above shall result in the employee being forced to use the scheduled vacation time, and the loss of any rights to request and be scheduled for subsequent vacation time during the calendar year based on seniority.
4.	Vacation/Work Week:
For purposes of vacation scheduling, the work week shall start with first watch/graveyard shift on Monday and end at third watch/swing shift on Sunday.
I.	If the State cancels a scheduled vacation or CTO leave and the employee suffers an economic loss as a result of the State’s cancellation of that leave, the State shall reimburse the employee for all rea
82
sonable and documented economic loss of the employee provided the employee:
1.	Notifies the employer at the time he/she is told of the vacation/CTO leave cancellation that economic loss will result;
2.	Makes all reasonable attempts to recover his/ her expenses; and,
3.	Provides the employer documentation of the economic loss.
10.02 Sick Leave
A.	Sick Leave Accrual
1.	Full-Time Employees: Employees shall receive eight (8) hours of sick leave credit on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of a qualifying pay period (eleven [11] or more work days of service in a monthly pay period). The provisions of this paragraph (10.02 A.1.) do not apply to fulltime 7k exempt Firefighters identified in Section 17.02.
2.	Part-Time Employees: Part-time employee(s) shall earn, on a pro rata basis, the fractional part of eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period (eleven [11] or more work days of service at their time base).
3.	PIEs: Employees shall receive eight (8) hours of sick leave credit on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period. The hours of paid employment in excess of one hundred sixty (160) hours in a monthly pay period shall not be counted or accumulated.
Notwithstanding any other section of this MOU, an Intermittent Employee shall only be permitted to use sick leave credits for approved sick leave which (a) occurs during periods when they are pre-scheduled to work; or (b) coincides with a day that an employee on a rotational list is contacted to work. “Con
83
tacts” for work require that the employer initiate the exchange, and the exchange was “human-to-human” between a supervisor and the employee.
4.	Multiple Positions (Under This Rule):
a.	An employee holding a position in addition to other full-time employment with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position.
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more less than full-time positions, the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed full-time employment credit.
B.	Sick Leave Use
1.	Approved sick leave means the necessary absence from duty of an employee because of:
a.	Illness or injury.
b.	Illness or complications due to a pregnancy which prevent an employee from working.
c.	Exposure to a contagious disease which is determined by a physician to require absence from work.
d.	Dental, eye, and other physical or medical examination or treatment by a licensed practitioner.
e.	Required attendance upon the employee’s ill or injured mother, motherin-law, father, father-in-law, wife, husband, daughter, son, sister, brother, or any person residing in the immediate household. Such absence shall be limited by the department head or desig
84
nee to the time reasonably required for such care.
2.	The employee is responsible to give the Department reasonable advance notice for the reasons cited in B.1. Employees are strongly urged to give at least two (2) hours advance notice prior to the start of the employee’s duty shift, but under normal circumstances, reasonable advance notice will be considered one (1) hour. Should the employee be sick the night before his/her shift, and is reasonably certain he/she will not be able to go to work the following day, said employee must call in sick at the earliest possible time. The employee will personally contact the designated supervisor at the institution, camp, facility, or parole region to request sick leave usage.
3.	The department head or designee shall approve use of sick leave credits only after having ascertained that the absence was for an authorized reason. If disapproved, the department head or designee must specifically state in writing the reason(s) for the disapproval.
a.	CDC: The employee is responsible for submitting an accurate CDC 998A form to the designated supervisor on or before the third working day of the pay period following the pay period in which the sick leave was taken. An employee who fails to submit a CDC 998A by the third (3rd) working day will be notified in writing, advising the employee that he/she has fifteen (15) calendar days to submit the approved/disapproved CDC 998A to the Personnel Office. Employees who fail to submit the CDC 998A form within the fifteen (15) days shall be docked for their absence(s) and an accounts receivable date will be established. In the case of long-term sick leave absence, the employee is responsible for submitting the CDC 998A form to the designated supervisor pursuant to the 998A Agreement
85
(see Sideletter #4). The designated supervisor will provide the employee with a copy of the approved/disapproved CDC 998A form at the time of submission.
b.	CYA: The employee is responsible for submitting an STD 634 form to the designated supervisor on the day of return to work or as soon as possible after return to work. In case of long-term sick leave absence, the employee is responsible for submitting the STD 634 form to the designated supervisor no later than the end of the pay period or as soon as possible after return to work. The designated supervisor will provide the employee with a copy of the approved/ disapproved STD 634 form at the time of submission.
4.	An employee will receive a pay dock for approved sick leave time if the employee had no sick leave or other credits. If the employee has insufficient accrued sick leave credits, but has other leave credits, the employee shall be allowed to use those credits to cover the approved sick leave time.
5.	Sick leave may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
C.	Sick Leave Verification
1.	An acceptable “medical verification” for sick leave use is a document signed by a United States Licensed Physician, nurse practitioner, or other health care specialist/professional, competent within their scope of practice to make a medical evaluation on the employee’s alleged/stated illness, injury or medical incapacity, and such person is making the evaluation while on duty in his/her respective employment relationship within a health care facility or medical practice.
Unless requested at the time of approval, prescheduled and approved medical/dental ap
86
pointments/treatments do not require medical verification.
2.	Medical verification may also be required but only if required in advance, in the following kinds of circumstances:
a.	An employee is unable to personally make the sick leave request to the designated supervisor.
b.	The sick leave requested falls on a date which the employee previously requested a form of leave covered by this MOU but was denied.
c.	An employee is sick for three (3) or more consecutive days.
d.	Medical verification is always required if an employee calls in sick on Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, or New Years Eve.
3.	When a medical verification is required, the medical verification must provide the following information:
a.	The date the employee or the employee’s family member is examined by a licensed physician or other health care special-ist/professional;
b.	The expected length of the employee’s absence and his/her expected return to duty;
c.	The employee is medically able to return to work; and
d.	The list of restrictions (if any) including, if applicable, any impairment to the employee’s ability to perform the duties of his or her classification due to medication or treatment.
4.	The Appointing Authority designee will ensure the medical clearance verification is consistent with the employee’s responsibility to perform all duties of his/her class. If the medical
87
clearance verification is not consistent with the employee’s responsibility to perform all duties of his/her class, the Appointing Authority designee shall inform management of the employee’s condition and duty limitations.
5.	An employee shall not be requested to provide a medical verification after the fact. For example, if an employee calls in sick on the fifteenth (15th) of the month and a medical verification is not requested and then calls in sick on the sixteenth (16th) of the month and a medical verification is requested, the medical verification would be for the sixteenth (16th) only. This does not prohibit the Department from pursuing other administrative review or remedies if abuse is suspected.
6.	If a returning employee is required to present medical clearance verification to the Appointing Authority designee, and the returning employee has a valid medical clearance verification from his/her physician allowing said employee to return to work and, with reasonable notice by the employee or upon institution order, the employee presents him/herself for medical clearance during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, the employee shall be allowed to return to paid status, but not use leave credits. If the employee does not have valid medical clearance verification from his/her physician allowing said employee to return to work and present him/herself for medical clearance by the Appointing Authority designee during normal business hours, Monday through Friday, the employee shall either continue on sick leave status or management approved leave credits until such time as clarifying medical documentation is obtained from the physician releasing the employee to work.
7.	All medical information provided to the State shall be considered confidential. Under no circumstances will an employee be required to disclose the medical cause or nature of his or
88
her, or his or her family member’s, illness or injury to the State for sick leave approval.
D.	Employees shall not be denied the right to use sick leave or be subject to any type of corrective or disciplinary action, or in any manner discriminated against for using or attempting to exercise their right to use sick leave based solely on the amount or frequency of use.
E.	All other State laws, rules and departmental policies regarding sick leave shall remain in effect.
F.	Denial of sick leave shall not be appealed beyond Step 4 of the grievance procedure. The arbitrator may not rule on the adequacy or inadequacy of the medical verification provided.
G.	All provisions of this section shall apply unless they are in conflict with FMLA, CFRA, EIDL, IDL, ADA or catastrophic illness/injury.
10.03 Enhanced Industrial Disability Leave (EIDL)
A. An employee who loses the ability to work for more than twenty-two (22) work days as the result of an injury incurred in the official performance of his/ her duties may be eligible for a financial augmentation to the existing industrial disability leave benefits. Such injury must have been: (1) directly and specifically caused by an assault by an inmate, patient, ward, or parolee, (2) by a domestic animal while the employee is performing in the line of duty, (3) a “criminal act of violence” against a peace officer who was performing in the line of duty. For purposes of this Article, “criminal act of violence” means an act which would constitute a misdemeanor or felony if pursued to conviction; (4) must have been directly and specifically caused in the course of responding to, returning from or fighting an active fire as defined in PRC 4103, 4104, 4170, and 4170.5. EIDL granted under this section must meet the criteria of direct or indirect physical contact with a combative or resistive inmate, patient, ward or parolee. The director of a department may make a determination in special circumstances
89
related to extraordinary hazardous duty. Upon the request of an employee and/ or the Union, the Department Director shall review any incident where an employee suffers an injury and will make a determination regarding the application of this section.
B.	The EIDL benefit will be equivalent to the injured employee’s net take home salary on the date of occurrence of the injury or the date that the employee is placed on EIDL, whichever is later. EIDL eligibility and benefits may continue for no longer than one (1) year. For the purposes of this section, “net salary” is defined as the amount of salary received after federal income tax, State income tax and the employee’s retirement contribution has been deducted from the employee’s gross salary.
C.	EIDL will apply only to serious physical injuries and any complications directly related medically and attributable to the assault or fire, as determined by the Department Director or designee. his benefit shall not be applied to either presumptive, stress-related disabilities, or physical disability having mental origin.
D.	The final decision as to whether an employee is eligible for, or continues to be eligible for, EIDL shall rest with the Department Director or designee. The Department may periodically review the employee’s condition by any means necessary to determine an employee’s continued eligibility for EIDL.
E.	Other existing rules regarding the administration of IDL will be followed in the administration of EIDL.
F.	This section relating to EIDL will not be subject to the arbitration procedure of this MOU.
G.	In circumstances that deviate from paragraph A. and C., the Director may consider and grant EIDL on a case-by-case basis when he/she determines the injury was in fact job-related.
H.	A PIE who otherwise meets the EIDL criteria contained in this section of the MOU, but who has less than one thousand (1,000) hours of State service credit toward retirement will be eligible for a monthly EIDL benefit either:
90
1.	Equivalent to the average number of monthly hours worked in the previous twelve (12) months preceding the qualifying injury, or
2.	If the employee has not worked twelve (12) months, the equivalent to the average monthly number of hours worked in the months preceding the injury.
In no case shall the benefit be less than eighty-four (84) hours.
In no case shall the benefit exceed one thousand five hundred (1,500) hours in a twelve (12) month period in combination with hours worked and the EIDL benefits paid.
This paragraph only applies to injuries that qualify for EIDL and not IDL. IDL or EIDL benefits currently available to PIEs with one thousand (1,000) hours of State service credit are not intended to be affected by this paragraph.
I. EIDL benefits may be extended beyond the one (1) year cap, at the Director’s discretion, in those instances where the injuries are the result of being burned, shot, stabbed or hit with a deadly weapon, and where the Director finds that rehabilitation back to the job is possible if the EIDL is extended. In no event can the EIDL benefit be extended beyond three (3) years.

96
fee(s) received. An intermittent employee shall not be removed from pre-scheduled work hours because he/she is on jury duty.

Interviews of subpoenaed witnesses shall be at times and places reasonable for the witness and for the Appointing Authority.
C.	If the subpoenaed employee is scheduled to work at the same time that the hearing is scheduled, and the subpoenaed employee is not likely to be immediately called to the witness stand, the State may, with the concurrence of the Appellant’s attorney, return the subpoenaed officer to his/her duty post subject to recall upon notice by either the Appellant’s representative or the Department’s representative.
D.	Whenever an employee is served with a subpoena which compels his/her presence as a witness, unless he/she is a party or expert witness, such employee shall be granted a leave of absence with pay in the amount of the difference between the employee’s regular earnings and any amount he/ she receives for such appearances. This section shall not be applicable to appearances for which the employee receives compensation in excess of his/her regular earnings.
10.13	Release Time Bank
A.	A CCPOA release time bank shall be established to which employees may contribute any earned, leave credits, with the exception of sick leave. The contributions shall be in two (2) or more hour increments. Contributions in fractions of hours will not be allowed. Credit may not be transferred be
100
tween departments. Contributions to the release time bank shall be computed once a month, provided they are received by the second Friday of that month.
B.	Establishing the Bank
CCPOA shall make available to Bargaining Unit 6 employees an information sheet explaining the means by which an employee may contribute time into the release time bank. CCPOA shall make forms (with built-in carbon copies) available for that purpose. When an employee desires to make a contribution to the release time bank, the employee will complete the three-part form provided by CCPOA and give this form to a Unit 6 steward. The Unit 6 steward will deliver the form to the institution, facility, camp, or parole personnel office with a CCPOA addressed, CCPOA postage-paid envelope at the time the steward delivers the form. The personnel office will determine that the employee authorizing the release time bank contribution has the earned CTO and/or vacation time (depending upon the number of hours desired to be contributed by the employee), prior to posting the contributed time to the release time bank. The personnel office will forward the first copy of the form to CCPOA headquarters in Sacramento in the envelope provided by the steward on a regular monthly basis. Employees may voluntarily execute such forms to authorize transfer of existing CTO hours and/or vacation credits. The form shall provide a space to indicate the amount and type (CTO and/or vacation) of time contributed. Each party to this MOU shall be responsible for, and keep, its own set of records. Records shall be compared, verified, and adjusted/corrected as the parties agree is necessary, but no more often than once quarterly. In no case shall CCPOA accumulate or use more than ten thousand (10,000) CTO and/or vacation hours from the bank during the term of this MOU.
C.	Withdrawal From the Bank
Any of five (5) designated CCPOA paid representatives or Bargaining Unit 6 representatives may
101
authorize time withdrawal from the release time bank for use of a Unit 6 employee to conduct bona fide Association business. CCPOA shall notify the departments’ labor relations office of the identity of the five (5) representatives by August 1, of each year. Employees authorized may be released with forty-five (45) days’ advance notice (as a guideline) for regular, ongoing time off, or forty-eight (48) hours (as a guideline) on an ad hoc basis. In all cases, the granting of time off shall be subject to the approval of the employee’s supervisor, operational needs, emergencies or other standards limiting usage. CCPOA authorization for use of bank time shall be provided to the local labor relations officer, or person designated by the Warden/Su-perintendent/Regional Administrator, by one of the five (5) authorized CCPOA representatives, in writing, on a form provided by CCPOA and mutually approved by the parties. In no case shall the State employer be required to release an employee if:
1.	It would require that the State employer fill the released employee’s position at time and one-half; or
2.	If there is no time credited to the bank at the time of the request.
The State employer will permit a reasonable number of CCPOA members off for use of release time bank time. Time drawn from the release time bank shall be in four (4) hour increments for the purpose of travel and eight (8) hour increments for all other purposes. No more than one (1) employee per facility or parole region shall be released for time off unless approved by the Director or his/her designee.
The State employer shall not withhold usage of release time bank time for unreasonable or capricious reasons. CCPOA agrees that CCPOA shall not cause, through the application of this clause, the State employer any undue burden in carrying out the mission of the Departments.
102
10.14	Union Paid Leave
A. CCPOA shall have the choice of requesting an unpaid leave of absence or a paid leave of absence (union leave) for a CCPOA bargaining unit official or steward. An unpaid leave of absence may be granted by the State pursuant to the unpaid leave of absence provisions in this MOU. A union leave may also be granted at the discretion of the affected department head or designee in accordance with the following:
1.	The department head or designee receives a written request, signed by the employee and the authorized CCPOA representative, two (2) weeks prior to the planned effective date of the leave.
2.	A union leave shall assure an employee the right to his/her former position upon termination of the leave. The term “former position” is defined in Government Code Section 18522.
3.	CCPOA agrees to reimburse the affected department(s) for actual expenses related to the affected employee’s salary and benefits for all the time the employee is off on a union leave, within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving a billing statement.
4.	The affected employee shall have no right to return from a union leave earlier than the agreed upon date without the approval of the employee’s Appointing Authority.
5.	Except in emergencies or layoff situations, a union leave shall not be terminated by the department head or designee prior to the expiration date.
6.	Employees on a union leave shall suffer no loss of compensation or benefits.
7.	Whether or not time for a union leave is counted for merit purposes shall be determined by SPB and such determination shall not be grievable or arbitrable.
103
8.	Employees on union leave under this provision and CCPOA shall waive any and all claims against the State for Workers’ Compensation and Industrial Disability Leave.
9.	In the event an employee on a union leave, as discussed above, files a Workers’ Compensation claim against the State of California or any agency thereof, for an injury or injuries sustained while on a union leave, CCPOA agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the State of California or agencies thereof, from both Workers’ Compensation liability and any costs of legal defense incurred as a result of the filing of the claim.
10.15	Catastrophic Time Bank
A. If an employee is catastrophically ill or injured, or if the spouse, child or any person residing in the immediate household of such an employee becomes catastrophically ill or injured, employees shall be allowed to donate an unlimited amount of CTO, PLP, holiday credits, or vacation credits, per individual case, with the Appointing Authority’s approval, in accordance with departmental policies and under the following conditions:
1.	The donation must be in whole hours.
2.	Transfer of vacation, CTO, PLP and holiday credits shall be allowed to cross departmental lines in accordance with the policies of the receiving department.
3.	Employees receiving the donations may receive an unlimited number of donations in hours. The donated hours can only be used after the affected employee’s leave credits have been exhausted, and may not exceed one (1) calendar year. If the need still exists, a new Catastrophic Time Bank (CTB) may be initiated in the following year with the Appointing Authority’s approval.
4.	Donations shall be made on a form to be developed by the State, signed by the donating
104
employee, and verified by the donating department.
5.	This section is not subject to the grievance and arbitration article of the MOU.
B.	Termination:
The CTB shall be terminated when the specific need no longer exists. The CTB shall be closed to donations upon the death of the ill or injured em-ployee/recipient, but the remaining, donated CTB credits shall become part of that employee’s estate.
C.	Unused CTB Donations:
Upon return to work, and when specific need no longer exists, placement on IDL or disability retirement, of the employee/recipient, the employee/re-cipient shall not retain donations that are being held and have not been used. The unused CTB donations shall be returned to the appropriate donor on a last received, first returned basis.
D.	In cases of natural disasters where the Governor has declared a state of emergency, employees living in the area of the declared emergency and who have suffered damage to their principal residence may be eligible for catastrophic time bank donations consistent with paragraphs A. through C. above, except that the employees need not have exhausted sick leave credits.
10.16	Youth Correctional Counselor/Youth Correctional Officer Use of Leave Credits
Youth Correctional Counselors/Youth Correctional Officers may submit in writing, to the appropriate supervisor, a request to use leave credits, excluding vacation, at least twenty (20) days prior to the issue of the work schedule. The granting of leave credits will be consistent with appropriate resources and not in conflict with previously scheduled time off nor allocated blanket resources for projected vacations. This provision does not prohibit the employer from scheduling leave credits, with the approval of the employee, excluding vacation, for the benefit of schedule management.
105
10.17	Absences for Duty in the Uniformed Services
A. General: The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) which is found at Title 38 U.S. Code, Chapter 43, Sections 4301-4333 covers rights and obligations of employees who are absent while serving in the Uniformed Services and the obligations of their employers. (see appendix #7) For California State employees USERRA is supplemented by the California Government Code Sections 19770 through 19786.
This section of the MOU serves as a summary of the relevant duties and obligations of both the employee’s and employer under the law.
1.	Service in the Uniformed Services (military service) means the performance of duty in a Uniformed Service. The Uniformed Services consists of:
a.	Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard
b.	Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard Reserve
c.	Army or Air National Guard
d.	Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service
e.	Others as designated by the President in time of war or emergency.
2.	Duty in the Uniformed Services (military service) can be voluntary or involuntary and consists of the following:
a.	Active duty (including initial or reoccurring training)
b.	Inactive duty training
c.	Absence from work for an examination to determine a person’s fitness for any of the above types of duty.
B.	ADVANCE NOTICE OF MILITARY SERVICE: Unless prevented by “military necessity”, or in cases where advance notice is unreasonable or impossible, the employee is required to provide the employer with advanced notice of all military service.
106
1.	Notice may either be written or oral. The notice may be provided either by the employee or by an appropriate officer of the branch of military service in which the employee will be serving.
2.	USERRA does not specify a minimum period of time for advanced notice. Employees are expected to make a good faith effort to notify their employer when they are notified or volunteer for military service.
C.	LEAVE FOR MILITARY SERVICE: Once an employee has been scheduled for military service the Department is required to approve leave for the employee to complete their service commitment.
1.	Employees are allowed, but not required, to use accrued leave credits (other than sick leave) to complete their military service commitment. Employees may, at their discretion, elect to take a leave without pay while performing military service.
2.	The employee must actually attend and complete the military service on the scheduled dates. The employee shall not obtain approval to fulfill military service obligations on a Saturday and/or Sunday, then complete his/her military obligation (without the department’s knowledge) on the employee’s RDOs (if other than Saturday and/or Sunday), and then use the pre-approved Saturday and/or Sunday leave for non-military, personal reasons. If an employee fails to notify management that the time on the weekend is no longer required for attendance at a military obligation, and still takes the time off, the employee may be subject to discipline.
a. For example, an employee’s RDOs are Tuesday/Wednesday and he/she is scheduled to attend a weekend drill on Saturday/Sunday. Then this employee subsequently fulfills his/her drill obligation by attending pre-drill or post-drill on his/her RDOs on Tuesday/ Wednesday.
107
This employee is then required to notify State management of this change as soon as possible. Authorization to use leave credits to cover the Saturday/Sun-day drill period is thus automatically rescinded.
D.	SICK LEAVE DURING MILITARY SERVICE: If an employee becomes unable to fulfill his/her scheduled military service obligation due to illness/in-jury, the employee is required to notify their employer so the absence can be appropriately recorded as sick leave. The employee must submit, with the 998A form, verification from the military confirming his/her absence from military service was due to illness or injury.
E.	REPORTING BACK TO WORK AFTER MILITARY SERVICE: Time limits for reporting to work after military service depend on the length of the military service completed.
1.	For periods of service less than 31 days, and fitness examinations, the employee must report to work at the beginning of the regularly scheduled work day following completion of the service plus a period for safe transportation to the person’s residence and an additional 8 hours rest period.
a. As an example, an employee may be released from military service duty at 5:00 p.m. Sunday and arrive home at 8:00 p.m. Sunday, after a three hour commute. Once the employee has arrived home he/she is entitled to an eight hour rest period. After the rest the employee must report to the employer no later than the beginning of the first regularly scheduled work day. In this case an employee could be required to report to work at 6:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
2.	For periods exceeding thirty (30) days reference USERRA.
F.	Where State or Federal Law is inconsistent with the language of this section, employees shall be
108
able to take advantage of whichever offers the most benefits.
10.18 Annual Leave - Enhanced NDI
A.	Annual Leave
1.	Employees who are currently subject to vacation and sick leave provisions may elect to enroll in the Annual Leave Program at any time. New employees may elect to enroll in the Annual Leave Program following the equivalent of completion of six (6) months of full-time employment. One hundred sixty (160) hours of paid employment equals one (1) month of full-time employment for employees who work on an intermittent basis. The effective date of the election shall be the first day of the pay period in which the election is received by the appointing power. Once enrolled in annual leave, an employee shall become entitled to an enhanced non-industrial disability insurance (NDI) benefit (50% of gross salary) upon serving a waiting period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days. If the employee files a claim for NDI benefits between the effective date of enrollment in annual leave and the end of the waiting period, the standard NDI benefit shall be payable. This waiting period does not apply to any employee who was enrolled in the Annual Leave Program upon appointment in a position requiring mandatory participation.
2.	Each full-time employee shall receive credit for annual leave in lieu of the vacation and sick leave credits of this provision in accordance with the following schedule:
7 months to 3 years .... 12	hours	per	month
37 months to 10 years .. 15	hours	per	month
121 months to 15 years . 17	hours	per	month
181 months to 20 years . 18	hours	per	month
241 months and over .... 19	hours	per	month
Part-time and hourly employees shall accrue proportional annual leave credits. Employees who work on an intermittent basis shall re
109
ceive annual leave credits in accordance with leave accrual schedule in paragraph A. 2. above, on the basis of one hundred sixty (160) hours of paid employment equals one (1) month of full-time employment. Employees shall have the continued use of any sick leave accrued as of the day before participation in the program in accordance with applicable laws, rules or Memorandum of Understanding.
Employees accrued vacation leave will be converted to annual leave, however, HOL, PLP, excess, or other accrued leave balances will be retained or accrued as before participation in the program.
DPA rule or Memorandum of Understanding shall provide all provisions necessary for the administration of this section.
3.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn annual leave credits as set forth in DPA Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
4.	Employees working less than full-time or who work in multiple positions accrue annual leave in accordance with the applicable DPA rules.
5.	If an employee does not use all of the annual leave that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/ her accrued annual leave credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of six hundred forty (640) hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than six hundred forty (640) hours of accrued annual leave hours if an employee was unable to reduce his accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking annual leave
110
because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
6.	Upon termination from state employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued annual leave credits for all accrued annual leave time.
7.	The time when annual leave shall be taken by the employee shall be determined by the Department head or designee. If on January 1 of each year an employee’s annual leave bank exceeds the cap in paragraph 5; the department may order the employee to take annual leave.
8.	Annual leave requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same annual leave time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred annual leave period in order of seniority set forth in Article XII Section 12.01 of this Agreement.
9.	Each department head or designee will make every effort to act on an annual leave request in a timely manner.
10.	Annual leave that is used for purposes of sick leave is subject to the requirements set forth in Article X Section 10.02 B. and 10.02 C. of this Agreement.
B.	Enhanced Non-Industrial Insurance (NDI)
1.	This enhanced NDI provision is only applicable to employees participating in the Annual Leave Program referenced in A. above.
2.	Once enrolled in annual leave and for periods of disability commencing on or after ratification of this MOU, an employee shall become entitled to an enhanced NDI benefit (50% of gross salary) upon serving a waiting period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days. If the employee files a claim for NDI benefits between the effective date of enrollment in annual leave and the end of the waiting period, the standard NDI benefits shall be payable.
111
This waiting period does not apply to any employee who was enrolled in the Annual Leave Program upon appointment in a position requiring mandatory participation.
3.	The enhanced NDI payments at fifty percent (50%) of the employees gross salary are payable monthly for a period not exceeding twenty-six (26) weeks for any one (1) disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to work for at least ten (10) consecutive work days. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days. Disability payments may be supplemented with annual leave, sick leave or partial payment to provide for up to one hundred percent (100%) income replacement. At the time of an enhanced NDI claim an employee may elect either the fifty percent (50%) enhanced NDI benefit rate or a supplementation level of seventy-five percent (75%) or one hundred percent (100%) at gross pay. Once a claim for enhanced NDI has been filed and the employee has determined the rate of supplementation, the supplemental rate shall be maintained throughout the disability period. The provisions contained in Article XI, Section 11.09 B., do not pertain to sick leave credits that are utilized to supplement IDL or enhanced NDI benefits.
4.	The employee shall serve a seven (7) consecutive calendar day waiting period before enhanced NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued paid leave or CTO leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived commencing with the first full day of confinement in a hospital, nursing home, or emergency clinic. The definition of hospital, nursing home, and emergency clinic is the same as defined by Section 2627.5 and 2627.7 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
112
5.	If the employee elects to use annual leave or sick leave credits prior to receiving enhanced NDI payments, he or she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
6.	Following the start of enhanced NDI payments an employee may at any time switch from enhanced NDI to sick leave or annual leave but may not return to enhanced NDI until that leave is exhausted.
7.	In accordance with the State’s “return to work” policy, an employee who is eligible to receive enhanced NDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to their full-time work during the period of his or her disability, may upon the discretion of his or her appointing power, work those hours (in hour increments) which when combined with the enhanced NDI benefit will not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of their regular “full pay.”
The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his or her position.
8.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State’s injured State Worker Assistance Program, enhanced NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.
9.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the eighteen (18) monthly pay periods (or the total number of pay periods for those employees who have not worked eighteen [18] pay periods) immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a
113
full-time employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for enhanced NDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of nine hundred sixty (960) hours of compensated work.
10.	All other applicable DPA laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
11.	Upon approval of enhanced NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
12.	All appeals of an employee’s denial of enhanced NDI benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22. All disputes relating to an employee’s denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party’s contractual rights, which are not related to an individual’s denial of benefits.
13.	Employees who become covered in the Annual Leave Program while on an NDI claim shall continue to receive NDI pay at the old rate for the duration of the claim.
14.	Employees who do not elect the Annual Leave Program will receive NDI benefits in accordance with the current program.
15.	Employees may elect to enroll in the annual leave program to receive annual leave credit in lieu of vacation or sick leave credits. Employees enrolled in the annual leave program may elect to enroll in the vacation and sick leave program at any time. The effective date of these elections shall be the first day of the pay period in which the election is received by the appointing power. Once an employee elects to enroll in either the annual leave program or the vacation/sick leave program, the employee may not elect to enroll in the other program until 24 months has elapsed from the date of enrollment.
114

ARTICLE XI
HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
11.01 Shift and/or Assignment Changes
A.	The State shall give notice to an employee at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the effective date of a change of shift, RDOs or hours of work. Unexpected changes required by emergencies, or which are due to other unforeseeable circumstances, are exempted from this notice requirement.
B.	CCPOA’s local Chief Job Steward or designee may waive the notice requirement in any particular instance.
C.	In CYA, an unexpected immediate job change of short duration may occur from time to time. The Department agrees to contact the local Chief Job Steward in each instance where an employee was required to involuntarily report to work on other than the regularly scheduled work shift. Except for emergencies, no employee will be required to involuntarily report to work on a scheduled day off.
On such occasions employees may be requested to report to work on other than their regularly scheduled work shift. Except for emergencies, no employee will be required to involuntarily report to work on other than their regularly scheduled work shift or on a scheduled day off.
The Department agrees to contact the local Chief Job Steward in each instance where an employee was required to involuntarily report to work.
D.	The State recognizes the value of flexibility in working hours and days as a means of reducing the use of sick leave. Likewise, the union recognizes the value of having employees report to work as scheduled. The parties therefore agree that an ap
117
propriate topic of discussion for the quarterly la-bor/management committee meeting provided for in Section 5.05 is a “sliding six” schedule for days off and alternative work hours (e.g., 4/10/40). Said discussion will not replace the duty to bargain as otherwise provided for in this agreement.
11.02 Shift Starting Time at CYA
A.	CYA Bargaining Unit 6 staff who are given an assignment by their supervisor (e.g., picking up mail, medication, etc.) after entry into the institution and while in route to their work stations will be paid overtime if they work more than the eight (8) hour shift for the day. This language is not intended to include those shift preparation activities such as, but not limited to, picking up keys, “panic” buttons, signing in at Control, etc.
B.	If it becomes apparent to the parties that the Portal to Portal Act contradicts this section, either of the parties may reopen this section.
11.03 Continuous Hours of Work/Dead Time
A. Except in the case of an emergency, employees shall not work in excess of sixteen (16) continuous hours in any given twenty-four (24) hour period. In the event employees are involuntarily ordered over, these employees are to be permitted an eight (8) hour break between shifts. With the exception of camps, if the eight (8) hour break extends into the employee’s next regularly scheduled shift, the employee shall receive paid administrative time off for the hours of the break that extend into the shift. For example, an employee assigned to a shift beginning at 0600, works a voluntary overtime to 2200 hours, and is involuntarily ordered to work until 0100 hours; the employee will be permitted a full eight (8) hour break before being required to return to his/her regular work; this employee would not be required to report to work until 0900 and would receive paid administrative time off from 0600 to 0900. However, the parties recognize that informational briefings of fifteen (15) minutes may be added before or after a regular shift, thus extending the sixteen (16) hours up to a maximum of sixteen (16) hours and fifteen (15) minutes.
118
B.	When a double involves one (1) hour or less on dead time, it shall not be counted as work time under this section, but will be paid time under hours of work.
C.	Employees shall not be allowed to work more than two (2) “doubles” back-to-back. For the purpose of this section, a double shall be defined as thirteen (13) or more contiguous hours of work which may or may not be broken by dead time. The dead time shall not be counted as work time and not break the continuity of the “double.”
D.	The State agrees to make its best effort to reduce or eliminate “dead time” for employees who work involuntary overtime hours. Where dead time exists, the State shall, subject to operational needs, try to schedule the employee to begin the overtime assignment immediately after the end of the employee’s regular shift or hours.
E.	Each institution administration and local CCPOA chapter representatives shall meet locally, within the life of this MOU, to make a reasonable effort to reduce the number of start and stop times.
F.	The State shall pay employees for up to the first sixty (60) minutes of dead time prior to an involuntary overtime assignment provided the dead time is three (3) hours or less. Unless an emergency situation exists, the employee will not be compelled to work during this dead time. No dead time shall be paid for voluntary overtime assignments.
11.04 Exchange of Days Off — Shift Assignment (Mutual Swaps)
A.	Employees may be permitted to exchange hours of work of one (1) hour or more with other employees in the same classification or level, performing the same type of duties in the same work area, provided:

2.	The supervisor(s) approves the exchange; and
119
3.	The employees exchanging hours of work shall not be entitled to any additional compensation (e.g., overtime or overtime meals, holiday credit/pay, shift differential) which they would not have otherwise received.
4.	An employee may have no more than two (2) persons working for them during a shift.
B.	Once approved, shift changes shall not be subjected to further review, except for operational needs. If a shift swap is denied, the supervisor denying the swap shall state the reason for the denial on the written request.
C.	Shift assignment positions under this Article are limited to:
1.	Correctional Officers
2.	Youth Correctional Counselors
3.	Youth Correctional Officers
4.	Medical Technical Assistants
5.	Firefighters
D.	Each employee shall be responsible for the coverage of the work assignment he/she accepts. If the employee who agrees to work for another employee fails to show for the swap, and provides proper medical verification, he/she shall be subject to repaying the actual length of the shift (e.g., eight [8] hours for an eight [8] hour shift, or ten [10] hours for a ten [10] hour shift).The swap sheet shall inform the individuals swapping that the employee who fails to pay back the swap shall be subject to repaying the actual length of the shift. The State shall first use the appropriate, accrued time credits for the repayment; then use “accounts receivable” should time credits be insufficient for the repayment. Once reimbursement is made by the employee, the employee may not be subject to adverse personnel action for this incident.
In the event the employee fails to show because of illness or injury, he/she shall be required to provide a medical verification in accordance with Section 10.02 of the MOU. If the employee fails to provide medical verification, the employee shall be charged twelve (12) hours of the appropriate leave credits.
120
E.	All swaps must be paid back within ninety (90) calendar days. Where the pay back cannot be accomplished without overtime being earned by one (1) or both of the affected employees the requested swaps shall be denied.
F.	Probationary employees normally shall not be allowed to exchange hours of work with other employees in the same classification or level at all during the first three (3) months of their probationary period. During the remainder of an employee’s probationary period, the employee shall be allowed up to one (1) swap per week.
11.05 Overtime Checks
Each institution shall make its best effort to process employees’ overtime checks in the shortest possible time. Overtime checks shall be released to the employee as soon as possible following their receipt and expeditious processing at the institution/facility/camp office.
Upon notice from CCPOA, the State agrees to meet at a job site where issuance of overtime checks is consistently beyond the 15th of the month for the purpose of developing a mutually acceptable overtime check distribution process. Part of this process may include Express Service (mail, delivery service, or personal service) to the Controller’s Office and, if possible, from the Controller’s Office.
11.06 Unused CTO
The employer retains the option to “buy-back” employees’ accumulated CTO at or near the end of each fiscal year. In no case, except with approval of the affected employee, shall the employer, through the “buy-back” process, reduce an employee’s CTO balance to less than forty (40) hours.
11.07 IST Overtime
Training of employees may be conducted either during regular work hours or during the employee’s off-duty hours.
A.	An employee shall be compensated for all training received during off-duty hours when directed by management to attend the training during those hours.
121
B.	When an employee is directed to attend an in-service training course, and the course is only scheduled on the employee’s regular day off (RDO), the employee shall be compensated in accordance with existing Call Back Rules.
C.	When an employee is directed to attend an in-service training course, and does attend on his/her regular day(s) off, pre-scheduled vacation, CTO, or holiday time, when an opportunity existed to attend in conjunction with his/her regular work hours, the employee will only be compensated for the actual time spent in training.
D.	When an employee is required to attend an IST class and the employee is only able to attend the class after an amount of standby (three [3] hours or less), the employee shall be compensated for the standby time, not to exceed one (1) hour, at time and one-half.
11.08 Overtime
A.	Except for 7k exempt employees, any employee working more than forty (40) hours per week shall receive compensation at time and one-half.
B.	Notwithstanding any other contract provision or law to the contrary, time which an employee is excused from work because of sick leave shall not count as hours worked within the work period for purposes of determining if overtime has been earned. Effective October 31, 1999, in CYA and November 1, 1999, in CDC/BPT/DMH for the purposes of computing the number of hours worked, time when an employee is excused from work because of the use of any leave credits shall be considered as time worked by the employee for the purposes of determining if overtime has been earned.
C.	Employees who are required to remain at their duty posts during designated meal periods or who are required to perform duties during meal periods shall be compensated for the meal period at the appropriate rate of pay, provided the total number of hours worked during the work period exceeds those referenced in MOU Article XI, Section 11.11 for employees on a 7k exemption or forty (40) hours for employees who are not on a 7k exemption.
122
D.	There shall be no change in the current hourly rate formula used to calculate overtime for non-7k exempt employees.
E.	An employee who is required by the supervisor to conduct business telephone calls outside his or her work hours of more than seven and one-half (7) minutes will receive credit for time worked. This section does not apply when a business call results in a call back to work.
11.0	9 Reduced Work Time

2.	The method of calculating the hourly overtime rate shall be based on the one hundred sixtyeight (168) hour8 work period according to the following formula:
Monthly salary + monthly differentials (except shift differential received) x 12 = annual salary divided by 13 = salary per 28 day work period.
Salary per 28 day work period + shift differential received in the work period divided by 168 hours9 (hours worked in 28 day work period) = hourly rate of pay x 1.5 = overtime hourly rate.
E.	Leave Credits
Employees shall only be required to utilize leave credits for posted duty hours only.
F.	Other Provisions
1.	The State and CCPOA agree that they have made a good faith attempt to comply with all requirements of the FLSA in negotiating this provision. If any court of competent jurisdic

Effective at the beginning of the first work period following July 1, 2004, no employee shall be credited less than one hundred sixty-four (164) hours of time worked in any work period unless he or she was on an unpaid status during the work period and then only the time on unpaid status shall be deducted from the one hundred sixty-four (164) hours.
Effective at the beginning of the first work period following July 1, 2004, the method for calculating the hourly overtime rate shall be based on the one hundred sixty-four (164) hour work period.
Effective at the beginning of the first work period following July 1, 2004, the salary + differential received in the work period shall be divided by 164.

tion declares that any provision or application of this Agreement is not in conformance with the FLSA, the parties agree to Meet and Confer immediately pursuant to Section 5.02.
2.	CCPOA agrees that neither it nor any of its employees acting on their own behalf or in conjunction with other law firms shall bring any suit in court challenging the validity of this provision under the FLSA.
3.	Nothing in this section shall be construed to deny any employee a vacation or any other time off or change any existing practices with regard to scheduling time off.
11.12 Priority Time Off Requests
A.	The State recognizes the value of permitting employees to take short periods of time off (e.g., one shift) using holiday credit, vacation and annual leave for purposes that cannot be foreseen or planned for at the time annual vacation requests must ordinarily be submitted. Likewise the union recognizes the value of having employees report to work as scheduled. The parties therefore agree that each appointing power (or designee) shall meet with the local union chapter president (or designee) within 90 days following ratification of this Agreement. They will meet for purposes of discussing whether a system that results in employees who have sick leave balances of 300 hours or more being able to request and receive priority for time off requested on short notice (i.e., 72 hours) using holiday credit, excess hours, vacation and annual leave is possible and feasible. Such systems shall not conflict with any other provision of this Agreement or result in additional cost to the state (e.g., overtime). Such systems would be in addition to any existing system for scheduling or “burning” employee’s accumulated holiday or vacation credit.
B.	This section shall be considered a prelude to, rather than a substitute for the duty to bargain as otherwise required by this Agreement.
129
11.13 Callback Time
A.	An employee in Work Week Group 1, 2 or Work Week Subgroup 4A who has completed a normal work shift, or an employee in Work Week Subgroups 4B or 4D on an authorized day off, when ordered back to work, shall be credited with a minimum of four (4) hours work time provided the call back to work is without having been notified prior to completion of the work shift, or the notification is prior to completion of the work shift and the work begins more than three (3) hours after the completion of the work shift.
B.	When such an employee is called back under these conditions within four (4) hours of the beginning of a previous call or an additional call is received while still working on an earlier call back, the employee shall not receive an additional four (4) hours credit for the new call back.
C.	When such an employee is called back within four (4) hours of the beginning of the employee’s next shift, call back credit shall be received only for the hours remaining before the beginning of the employee’s next shift.
D.	When staff meetings, training sessions, or work assignments are regularly scheduled on an employee’s authorized day off, the employee shall receive call back compensation; when staff meetings and training sessions are regularly scheduled on an employee’s normal work day and outside the employee’s normal work shift, overtime compensation shall be received in accordance with the employee’s work week group, the provisions of this Agreement, and regulations governing overtime. (7K training that occurs during hours employees must work to satisfy their 7K work period hours does not give rise to callback compensation pursuant to this subsection).
E.	If an employee entitled to call back compensation completes the specific task giving rise to his/her call back assignment before four (4) hours has lapsed, the employee will not be required to remain at work until four (4) hours have lapsed unless (1) s/he volunteers; (2) an emergency exists;
130
or, (3) there are operational needs that mean section 12.06 (Involuntary Overtime by Inverse Seniority) is inapplicable.
ARTICLE XII TRANSFER, SENIORITY, OVERTIME AND LAYOFF
12.01 Seniority
A. Effective the first day of the April 1999 pay period, seniority shall be determined as follows:
1.	For all purposes (including but not limited to, layoff, transfer in lieu of layoff, demotion in lieu of layoff), “seniority” shall be determined by total State service in classes represented by Unit 6 (R06), classifications identified as S06, and in CO classes as defined by Section 830.5 of the Penal Code, regardless of when such service occurred.
2.	“Total State service” is calculated as the period of time since the hire date, for which the employee has earned qualifying pay periods, as defined in paragraphs 3. and 4. below.
a.	An employee shall not accrue seniority points during a break in service.
b.	Those employees who were on qualified military leave shall accrue seniority points throughout the time they were on military leave. Additionally, military leave throughout this period shall not be considered a break in service for definition purposes of this Section 12.01.
c.	An employee on leave for union business shall continue to accrue seniority.
3.	Full-Time Employees’ Seniority Accrual: In determining seniority scores for full-time employees, one (1) seniority point shall be awarded for each qualifying monthly pay period of full-time State service in classifications defined in paragraph 1. above. A pay period in which a full-time employee works eleven
131
(11)	or more days will be considered a qualifying pay period except that when an absence from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive work days falls within two (2) consecutive pay periods, the second pay period shall be disqualified. This definition shall apply to all of the employee’s work history regardless of when it occurred.
4.	Intermittent Employees’ Seniority Accrual: Seniority points for time served as a PIE will be awarded as follows:
a.	Hours worked prior to the April 1999 pay period.
Intermittent employees shall be awarded one (1) seniority point for each qualifying monthly pay period of state service in classifications defined in paragraph B.1. above. A pay period in which an intermittent employee works one hundred sixty (160) or more hours will be considered a qualifying pay period. The hours in excess of one hundred sixty (160) hours in a monthly pay period shall not be counted or accumulated.
b.	Hours worked on or after the April 1999 pay period, unless extended by mutual agreement.
Intermittent employees shall be awarded one (1) seniority point for each qualifying monthly pay period of state service in classifications defined in paragraph 1. above. A pay period in which an intermittent employee works eighty-eight (88) or more hours will be considered a qualifying pay period for the purpose of accruing seniority. The hours in excess of eighty-eight (88) hours in a monthly pay period shall not be counted or accumulated. If an employee works less than eighty-eight (88) hours in a monthly pay period, it shall be a non-qualifying pay
132
period; such hours shall not be counted or accumulated.
5.	Ties in seniority shall be broken by first examining each employee’s initial hire date. The employee with the earliest initial hire date in a classification defined in paragraph 1 above will be considered the most senior. If a tie still exists, it shall be broken by examining each employee’s last four (4) digits of his/her social security number. If a tie still exists, the employee with the lowest middle two (2) digits will be considered the most senior; if a tie still exists, the employee with the lowest first three (3) digits will be considered the most senior.
6.	An employee’s initial hire date shall be the date the employee was initially hired into a Unit 6 position regardless of breaks in service.
a.	For employees who initially reported to a work site other than an academy, the initial hire date shall be the date they reported to work.
b.	For employees who initially reported to an academy and are subject to the Academy Start Date Settlement Agreement for Correctional Officers, the initial hire date shall be the one that they received through the Settlement Agreement.
c.	For employees who initially reported to an academy and are not subject to the above-mentioned Settlement Agreement, the initial hire date shall be the date that they originally reported to an academy. Employees claiming they are entitled to seniority credit pursuant to paragraph 6 must supply written documentation evidencing their report date to the academy.
7.	Employees claiming they are entitled to seniority credits pursuant to paragraph 6 must supply written documentation evidencing their report date to the academy.
133
12.02 Permanent Involuntary Transfer by Inverse Seniority
A.	When there are two (2) or more employees in a class, and the Department determines an involuntary transfer to a position in the same class is required, or to an appropriate class as designated by the SPB, in a location which reasonably requires that an employee change his/her place of residence, or which involves a change in the Appointing Authority, the method of selecting the employee for transfer shall be by inverse seniority, except where precluded by operational needs of the departments or in emergency situations under existing Government Code Sections and DPA Rules.
B.	For reimbursement purposes only, existing DPA and Board of Control rules shall be utilized to determine whether a transfer reasonably requires the involuntarily transferred employee to change his/ her place of residence.
C.	In the event the State needs to staff a new facility, the parties mutually agree to Meet and Confer to develop a mutually satisfactory method which takes into consideration voluntary transfers, involuntary transfers by inverse seniority and transfers required to meet operational needs.
12.03 Temporary Involuntary Reassignments and Transfers
A.	For the purposes of this section, temporary transfer or reassignment is a change in institution, camp or community-based program or office of not more than thirty (30) work days.
B.	In all cases, the State shall first attempt to fill vacant positions through voluntary means.
C.	If a position cannot be filled through voluntary means, and the temporary assignment or transfer requires the employee to be away from his/her permanent place of residence, the method of selecting the employee for transfer shall be by inverse seniority, except where precluded by the operational needs of the departments or in emergency situations.
134
D.	Employees who are involuntarily assigned shall receive short term per diem for the first thirty (30) days of their assignment and if required to work past the thirty (30) days assignment, short term per diem will commence on the thirty-first (31st) day and continue for each day the employee is removed from his/her place of permanent residence.
E.	Should the temporary involuntary transfer or reassignment require a temporary change of residence, and be within one (1) of the parole divisions of the department, the State and CCPOA shall Meet and Confer to identify the pool of employees (the region or area) from which the person(s) to be involuntarily transferred on a temporary basis shall be drawn. In any event, the person(s) selected shall be picked by inverse seniority based on time in Unit 6.
F.	No employee may be transferred or reassigned under this section more than one (1) time per fiscal year.
G.	This section shall not affect any per diem right the employee may have.
12.04 Employee Requested Transfers Between Appointing Authorities
A.	The State has varying business needs to fill vacant positions by using existing eligible lists, involuntary transfers, reassignments or other selection methods. A part of these needs may be to fill a position for such reasons as balancing the work force or pre-announced special skills, abilities or aptitudes.
The parties acknowledge that the needs of the State must be given first priority when the State deems it necessary to fill a vacant position. The parties further acknowledge the varying employee desires to permanently transfer to another location, within the employee’s department and classification, which the employee deems more desirable. Therefore, the following procedure is established to facilitate employee requests to transfer to a position within the employee’s classification and department at another location.
135
B.	Employees desiring to transfer shall apply in writing in a manner prescribed by the State to the Appointing Authority of the location to which the employee desires to transfer. Such requests shall be to permanent positions in the same department within the employee’s same classification. The employee’s written requests shall be processed within thirty (30) days of submission and placed in seniority order with those of others who have similarly filed a request to the same position at the location. The Appointing Authority or designee shall provide the employee submitting a request for transfer with an acknowledgment of receipt of the transfer request. Employee requests shall be kept on file at the location through June 30 of each fiscal year or removed earlier at the request of the employee. At the request of the CCPOA Chapter President, the location of employee transfer files will be furnished to the Chapter President.
C.	The State agrees to fill vacancies in the CO, YCO, MTA and YCC classifications by either lateral transfers, list appointments, reinstatements, permanent full-time appointments from the academy, or offering full-time appointments from the academy, or offering full-time employment to PIEs. In the interest of facilitating lateral transfers, three (3) of every ten (10) vacancies filled in the CO, YCO, MTA and YCC classifications must be via lateral transfers. This shall not preclude filling of vacancies at a higher ratio than specified. Offers to fill by lateral transfers will be made on a seniority basis consistent with B. above. A reconciliation of the lateral transfers will be made six (6) months after ratification of the MOU and every six (6) months thereafter with each local Chapter President and the Appointing Authority.
D.	When lateral transfer is the means being used to fill a vacant position, the most senior employee with a request to transfer on file at that location shall be transferred provided that (1) the employee is not currently under investigation for misbehavior which could lead to adverse action, (2) has not had an adverse action in the last three (3) years and (3)
136
has not had an overall substandard performance evaluation in the preceding 12 months.
E.	A PIE may submit a lateral transfer package using the process described in this Article provided the employee has successfully completed probation, is not currently under investigation, and does not have a pending adverse action. Selection of PIEs is at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
F.	If the State chooses to fill vacant positions by transfers, but has specified the need to fill positions based on special skills, abilities or aptitudes, paragraph C. and D. above need not apply.
G.	Those employees who obtained employee-requested transfer under the provisions of this section shall not be eligible to utilize the provisions of this section for a period of one (1) year from the effective date of such transfer unless the employee has demonstrated a hardship that did not exist at the time of the initial transfer.
H.	This procedure may be superseded in favor of an employee requesting a transfer based on a bona fide hardship. If the matter is contested, the Appointing Authority or designee shall explain the basis for the waiving of this section to CCPOA’s local Chief Job Steward or designee and/or CCPOA’s representative.
I.	Travel Time Allowance: Upon request, the State may authorize an employee to take a reasonable amount of vacation, PLP, CTO, or holiday time off between transfers from one (1) institution to another where the transfer requires the employee to move his/her residence. Such requests will not be unreasonably denied, by the receiving institution.
12	.05 Voluntary Overtime By Seniority
A.	Employees in Bargaining Unit 6 shall be assigned voluntary overtime by seniority except where precluded by operational needs of the departments or in emergency situations. Existing caps on voluntary overtime shall continue; where they do not exist, reasonable caps may be negotiated locally by the parties. There shall be no yearly caps. All
137
other existing rules and policies regarding voluntary overtime continue to remain in effect.
B.	In CDC institutions, COs shall not be eligible to accept an overtime assignment when he/she has worked ten (10) overtime shifts (80 hours) within the 7k work period.
When all employees signed up for a voluntary overtime shift meet or exceed the above overtime limits, the voluntary overtime list will be utilized, by seniority, prior to ordering over. Where this section does not abridge a local agreement, the local agreement shall be left intact. Where local caps are higher than the limits in this section, the local agreement shall be opened in order to insure compliance. Any issue within the local caps agreement that does not deal with the limit of time worked shall only be opened by mutual agreement.
C.	Each Appointing Authority or designee will establish a means by which a Bargaining Unit 6 employee may sign up for an overtime shift. The order of call for voluntary overtime shall normally be from the voluntary overtime roster. However, if the overtime assignment becomes available two (2) hours or less prior to the start time of the overtime assignment, the assignment will be offered to the most senior employee whose name appears on the voluntary overtime roster and who is currently on duty.
D.	Overtime at camps and community-based programs shall be on a rotational basis.
E.	In addition to the above within CYA, overtime under this provision shall be offered by seniority by classification. When there are no volunteers on the appropriate list within the classification, the Department shall use the following options in descending order:
1.	Use the volunteers from an appropriate classification (i.e., Youth Correctional Counselors can work for YCOs and vice versa);
2.	Use the involuntary overtime provisions; or
3.	Take necessary action to ensure adequate coverage.
138
F.	Existing institutional sign-up procedures and policies in effect during the terms of this MOU will not be changed without local negotiations.
G.	When an outside employer engages COs to work for a project on departmental grounds, the employees will be hired on an overtime basis pursuant to this section, or be placed on special assignment to work, and their positions filled behind with a PIE or on an overtime basis pursuant to this section, except if the position is not normally filled behind.
H.	When it is determined a violation of this section has occurred, the “wronged” employee shall be entitled to four (4) hours pay at time and one-half.
12.06 Involuntary Overtime By Inverse Seniority
A.	Employees in Bargaining Unit 6 shall be assigned involuntary overtime on a rotating basis by inverse seniority except when precluded by operational needs of the departments or in emergency situations. Specifically excluded from this section are camps and other CDC community-based programs.
B.	In the departments, the junior seventy percent (70%) of the employees assigned overtime in a particular classification shall only be assigned involuntary overtime twice during a monthly pay period before the senior remaining thirty percent (30%) of the employees are required to work involuntary overtime. If after the junior seventy percent (70%) have been worked twice in any monthly pay period and the senior thirty percent (30%) once in that same monthly pay period, then the junior seventy percent (70%) shall be required to work again.
C.	Normally employees will not be assigned involuntary overtime on their regular day off (RDO). For the purposes of this section, an employee’s RDO begins immediately after the completion of their normal shift before the RDO.
D.	The departments will make reasonable efforts to canvass on-duty employee volunteers prior to the implementation of this contract section.
139
12.07 Personnel Preferred Post Assignment (PPPA) for Correctional Officers and MTA (CDC/DMH)
A.	Methods
1.	There shall be seventy percent (70%) of the qualifying CO and MTA (CDC/DMH) post assignments at each CDC Institution assigned by seniority. These Personnel Preferred Post Assignments (PPPA) will be distributed among the watches and RDOs in the same proportion as their percentage of the total number of qualifying posts. The break point will be .6 of the total number of qualifying posts. For example: 32 jobs (70%= 22.4; 30%=9.6). Therefore, ten (10) jobs will be management assignments, twenty-two (22) jobs will be PPPA.
2.	Time For Implementation
All institutions will implement a continuous bid process as outlined in subsection E. (CONTINUOUS BID PROCESS)
a.	New implementation will follow the implementation time lines set forth in this procedure. However, if the implementation dates change, the time-frames will continue to be adhered to.
b.	All institutions shall conduct a bid to incorporate changes of this procedure. For MTA (CDC/DMH) this process shall begin within thirty (30) days after ratification of this MOU. For Correctional Officers the bid process shall be conducted so that all job changes are effective no later than the first Monday of November 2002.
c.	Implementation for new institutions: Within eighteen (18) months of activation (receipt of inmates) all new institutions will begin the implementation process for PPPA.
140
3.	Definitions
a.	Bid Period: Employees may bid as otherwise described in this agreement during the bid period. Each “bid period” shall be three calendar years (except that the first bid period shall end December 31, 2004). A Realignment of Posts process will be used at the outset of each new bid period.
b.	Realignment of Posts: A Realignment of Posts follows a re-determination by the Appointing Authority or designee and the local chapter representative about the number and specific posts which will be considered “qualifying posts” available for bid.
c.	Qualifying Post: Any authorized post listed on the Master Assignment Roster after it has been reconciled with the Post Assignment Schedule and the Governor’s Budget, except: The total post count equivalent to the Institution’s Vacancy Plan (IVP). The following posts may be exempted from the PPPA bid process, but will be included in the count for the purpose of establishing the 70/ 30 calculation: (1) total number of established transportation posts at the CO level; (2) total number of Investigative Services Unit ( ISU) posts at the CO level; and, (3) total number of In-Service Training (IST)/Armory posts at the CO level.
(1)	Camps shall retain their current agreements regarding post assignments.
d.	70/30 Split: Seventy (70%) percent represents the percentage of qualifying posts that shall be available for bid otherwise known as “Personnel Preferred Post Assignments” (PPPA). Thirty (30%) percent represents the percentage of qualifying posts that shall not be sub
141
ject to bid. The representative number of PPPAs at each institution will be determined by establishing an equitable distribution of qualifying posts by area, watch and RDO. An “equitable distribution” is as close to a 70/30 representation in each of these areas, in keeping with operational needs.
Upon completion of the 70/30 split, a reconciliation shall be completed to insure the institution’s overall representation is within plus or minus two (2) positions.
4.	Bid Process
a.	PPPA will consist of two (2) processes. One process consists of the bid as outlined in subsection C. IMPLEMENTATION.
b.	The continuous bid process is outlined in subsection E. CONTINUOUS BID PROCESS. The continuous bid process will be for the purpose of filling PPPA vacancies on a continual basis as they arise throughout the bid period.
B.	ELIGIBILITY
1.	Participation in the PPPA system is limited to eligible employees. An eligible employee:
a.	Must be a permanent, full-time CO or MTA (CDC/DMH). Apprentices are excluded.
b.	Must be permanently assigned to and working at the institution. Eligible employees may participate only in their institution’s PPPAs. There shall be no inter-institution bidding assignments by personal preference.
Eligible employees who laterally transfer will be permitted to participate in the continuous bid process.
c.	In order to participate and maintain the rights and privileges defined throughout
142
this procedure, the employee must maintain an overall standard performance rating as identified in Section 9.01.
(1)	Upon activation of a newly established institution, previous year employee performance evaluations will not be considered for the purposes of eligibility in the PPPA process.
d.	An employee successfully bidding to a PPPA who does not meet the qualifications (firearms, side-handle baton, chemical agents) for such post, must meet all qualifications, specified in this procedure, prior to the date of assignment to the PPPA. If the employee is not qualified for the PPPA, on the initial date of assignment, the employee will be assigned at management’s discretion and allowed to participate in the continuous bid process. The vacated PPPA will be subject to the continuous bid process.
(1)	For Correctional Officers, management shall be responsible to ensure that training for all qualifications are available through In-Service Training. Employees shall be responsible for scheduling and attendance.
(2)	If the failure to qualify is based upon unavailability of training, the employee will be placed in a non-qualifying post in the same watch, RDOs with similar start/stop times. The PPPA will temporarily revert to management until such time that the employee qualifies and is placed back into the PPPA.
(3)	Once the training has been provided, and if the employee qualifies, the employee shall be placed in the PPPA. If the employee is not successful in qualifying, they shall be
143
assigned at management’s discretion. The vacated PPPA shall be subject to the continuous bid process.
(4)	In order to be retained in a PPPA armed post, employees must maintain current weapons qualification. Failure to maintain quarterly qualifications in compliance with departmental policy will result in the employee being assigned at management’s discretion to an unarmed post. An otherwise eligible employee may participate in the continuous bid process. Removal of the employee does not preclude the employee from being subject to other action in accordance with departmental policy.
e.	For activation of a newly established institution, an employee may be precluded, in writing, from participating in the PPPA bid process to specific assignment areas as determined by the Appointing Authority. This preclusion must be based upon:
(1)	An employee who has an adverse personnel action which relates to the employee’s job performance including, but not limited to:
(a)	Inattentiveness on the job
(b)	Insubordination
(c)	Excessive force toward an inmate, ward, or parolee
(2)	The preclusion will not be based upon an adverse personnel action for:
(a)	Sick leave abuse, etc.
(b)	Off-duty conduct, etc.
(c)	The adverse personnel action must have occurred twelve (12) calendar months preced
144
ing the onset of the bid process (i.e., the third Monday in November).
An employee receiving a performance related adverse action that may have a greater impact related to a specific assignment area (i.e., Ad Seg, community crews, Security Housing Units, entrance gates, etc.), may be excluded by the Appointing Authority from bidding to the specific assignment area for one (1) bid period. (Refer to subsection H.14.)
f.	An otherwise eligible employee absent from the worksite during the bid process for such reasons as NDI, Workers’ Compensation, leave of absence, annual military leave, etc., may participate in the PPPA bid process. Employees who are successful in obtaining a bid post must assume the duties of such post within one year of posting of the bid results. Until such time as the employee occupies the post, it temporarily reverts to the conditional bid process.
In the event the employee is unable to assume the duties within one year, the employee will be placed in a post at management’s discretion.
g.	Failure of the employee to complete a PPPA bid will result in placing the employee in a post, at management’s discretion, without regard to watch, RDOs or start/stop times.
C.	IMPLEMENTATION
1.	At the first meeting of the local Joint Labor/ Management Committee, the total number of institutional posts available for PPPA shall be seventy percent (70%) of the total authorized posts listed on the Master Assignment Roster, as defined in subsection A.3.c. The remaining thirty percent (30%) shall be designated as management posts.
145
a.	November
(1)	On the first Monday in November the Personnel Assignment Office at each institution will post an updated seniority roster. Employees alleging errors in the computation of seniority dates may file a complaint to the Personnel Assignment Lieutenant. If unresolved, the employee may submit to the Appointing Authority for second level of review with resolution required within fourteen (14) days of the posting of the seniority roster. The second level shall be the final level of review in the complaint process. Errors in favor of the employee will result in the adjustment of the employee’s seniority date at their institution.
(2)	The local Joint Labor/Management Committee at each institution shall meet to determine and agree which posts will be management posts and which posts will be PPPAs. Such determinations must be completed no later than the first Monday in November.

(10)	Eligible employees bidding to a vacation relief (VR) PPPA shall be assigned as follows:
(a)	For the purposes of PPPA, all vacation relief PPPAs will be considered second watch.
(b)	The most senior employee will be permitted to select the vacation slots of the employee’s choosing for the duration of the bid period. The second most senior person will be permitted to select vacation slots from those remaining, etc.
(c)	In the event a vacation is canceled, the PPPA VR employee will replace the employee who is substituted for the original occupant.
(d)	In the event a cancellation is not filled or a vacation slot is not available, the PPPA VR employee will be assigned at management’s discretion until the employee’s next scheduled vacation coverage.
(11)	Eligible employees may bid on any number of PPPAs.
(12)	Upon request from the Chapter President, the institution may establish a walk-up bid process. Any disputes regarding this process must be resolved at the local level.

D.	TEN PERCENT RULE
This section does NOT apply to those employees subject to adverse action or substandard performance appraisals.
1.	In those instances when it becomes apparent an employee does not possess the knowledge, skills, aptitude, or ability to perform at an acceptable standard in the PPPA to which the employee has bid, a job change memorandum documenting the reasons for reassignment will be prepared by the immediate supervisor and attached to a job change request.
This document must be approved by the employee’s second line supervisor and section manager prior to being forwarded to the Personnel Assignment Office. The approved job change memorandum shall be maintained by the Personnel Assignment Lieutenant and filed in accordance with existing procedures regarding the archiving of all other job change requests and the employee shall be provided a copy of the job change memorandum. Management may then reassign the employee as follows:
a.	The reassignment must be completed within sixty (60) days of the date the employee assumed assignment to the post. The time an employee is absent from the post is not counted toward the sixty (60) days.
b.	The number of these reassignments may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total PPPA count based on seniority. The Personnel Assignment Lieutenant shall be responsible for maintaining an accu
150
rate count of reassignments made under the Ten Percent Rule.
c.	In the event assignment changes are necessary (within the ten percent [10%] factor allowed), the person being moved from that assignment shall be given a job change into an assignment with the same RDOs and substantially similar start and stop times.
d.	If the employee disagrees with the reasons for the removal from the PPPA, the employee can grieve the change, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of notification, directly to the Appointing Authority. This grievance must be heard, and a written response provided, by the Appointing Authority within fourteen (14) calendar days. The grievance may not be appealed beyond the Appointing Authority. The filing of a grievance shall not postpone any such removal.
E.	CONTINUOUS BID PROCESS
1.	Statement of Purpose
The Continuous Bid Process is to allow employees to continue to fill vacant PPPA’s, by seniority, once the initial process has been implemented.
2.	Implementation
a.	Vacant PPPAs will be posted on the first Monday of each month. Any eligible Correctional Officer will be allowed to bid including those already in a PPPA.
b.	All assignment for those who were successful in achieving an available PPPA, the results will be posted by the fourth Monday of each month. All job changes will have an effective date of not more than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the posting results.
c.	This posting and bid “window” will be a
151
minimum of ten (10) calendar days, with no bids being accepted after the close of business on the second Friday after the initial posting.
d.	Subsequent to the initial bid, an otherwise eligible officer may participate in the continuous bid process up to five times during the bid period. Bids due to deactivations or changes to a post’s RDOs or start/stop times shall not count towards this cap. Bids due to removal for cause, 10 percent rule, performance evaluations or adverse actions shall only be counted against the cap for a maximum of two bids.
F.	CONDITIONAL BIDS
The Conditional Bid Process will be the process in which PPPAs are filled on a temporary basis. Once it is determined that a PPPA could be temporarily vacant for more than thirty (30) calendar days, the PPPA will be posted for a “conditional bid”. The conditional bid would only be in effect until the original bidder returns to assume the PPPA within the following time frames. An employee displaced from a conditional bid post may participate in the continuous bid process, or will be assigned at management’s discretion without regard to watch, RDOs, or start/stop times:
1.	All vacancies with the exception of Military Leave or Union Officers:
These employees would be subject to a one (1) year time limitation before the conditional status of the post expires. The employee in the job could remain in said post. The Appointing Authority can extend this time on a case by case basis.
2.	Military Leave:
In the event an employee is ordered to active military duty, these employees would be subject to length of the bid period before the conditional status expires. The employee in the
152
job could remain in said post. The Appointing Authority can extend this time on a case by case basis.
3.	Union Officers:
All employees subject to being placed in to a post utilizing “super seniority” will submit a bid form based upon their seniority. Once this process has been completed Union Officials who are designated by CCPOA to fill Chapter President/Chief Job Steward posts based upon “super seniority” will be assigned to those designated posts upon their request. Should a union official assume the designated post utilizing “super seniority”, they would remain in said job until he/she is un-elected or the Chapter President designates a different Chief Job Steward. At this time, the employee would return to the position originally bid by their seniority. During the time that the employee is in a post based upon “super seniority”, their seniority bid post will be offered as a conditional bid subject to the length of the bid period.
G.	RE-EVALUATION
On or about June 30, 2004 and no later than July 31, 2004, or upon request of either party, the Joint Labor/Management Committee will be convened to discuss and evaluate the processes and parameters established for the Continuous and Conditional bid processes as defined in sections E and F. The Joint Labor/Management Committee may make any adjustment to the process deemed necessary prior to next bid period.
H.	MAINTENANCE
After the initial PPPAs have been made, the following steps will be adhered to regarding maintenance of the process:
1.	If a PPPA becomes vacant, the PPPA will be filled through the continuous bid process. Unless specifically authorized by the Bargaining Unit 6 MOU these procedures or local mutual
153
agreement, the designation of a particular post as a PPPA cannot be altered in any fashion without fulfilling the notice requirements of Section 27.01 of the Unit 6 MOU.
2.	Employees displaced from a PPPA as a result of a deactivation will be placed in an assignment with the same RDOs if available, and substantially similar start/stop times.
3.	Upon activation, all activated posts will be subject to subsection A. METHODS, of this procedure. Newly designated PPPAs will be subject to the continuous bid process.
4.	Upon written request of an employee to vacate a PPPA, management may, at its discretion, approve the employee’s movement to a management position. Such movement will be without regard to watch, RDOs or start/stop times.
5.	An employee shall be permitted to rebid to the same PPPA. Should the employee be successful in their bid attempt, the employee will be subject to all provisions of this procedure as if assigned for the first time.
6.	Employees shall not be permitted to remain in any PPPA in a high stress area, commensurate with the provisions outlined in DOM Section 33010.30.2, unless exempted by the Appointing Authority. The employee may rebid for a PPPA in a high stress area after one (1) year in a non high stress assignment.
7.	If after the bid process has occurred the RDOs and start/stop times attached to a post are significantly changed, the affected employee may choose to remain in the post; and/or participate in the continuous bid process.
8.	An employee may not be removed from a PPPA based upon the issuance of a LOI.
9.	An employee may be temporarily removed from a PPPA pending a personnel investiga-tion/EEO investigation, but will be assigned to substantially similar start/stop times and
154
RDOs. Once the investigation has been concluded and if the charges have not been substantiated, the employees may be returned to their PPPA.
10.	Any PPPA not bid during the bid period by an eligible employee shall temporarily revert to management, and be subject to the continuous bid process.
11.	For purposes of expressing a personnel preference, the Chapter President/Chief Job Steward(s) shall be given “super” seniority in order to select a PPPA. When an employee is removed from his/her position as a Chief Job Steward they will be subject to the guidelines of the Conditional Bid Process.
12.	Upon completion of the Apprenticeship period, an otherwise eligible employee, may participate in the PPPA continuous bid process.
13.	Unless otherwise allowed by this procedure, once an employee has successfully been assigned to a PPPA, the employee may only be moved involuntarily for cause. As used in this context, cause is NOT interpreted as adverse in nature or substandard for purposes of a performance appraisal. The supervisor must document the specific reasons for removing the employee from the PPPA and provide a copy to the employee. The employee must then be placed in an assignment with the same RDOs and substantially similar start/ stop times. The vacated PPPA will be subject to the continuous bid process.
If the employee disagrees with the reasons for the removal from the PPPA, the employee can grieve the change, within twenty-one (21) calendar days of notification, directly to the Appointing Authority. This grievance must be heard, and a written response provided, by the Appointing Authority within fourteen (14) calendar days. The grievance may not be appealed beyond the Appointing Authority. The grievance shall not postpone any such re-
155
moval for cause.
14.	If an employee is to be removed from a PPPA, as a result of an adverse action, the removal will be upon the effective date of the adverse action related to job performance (upon the conclusion of the Skelly hearing process and/ or time frames associated with that process). Such movement will be to the same watch, without regard to RDOs or start/stop times. The employee will not be eligible to participate in the PPPA process for one (1) year period. The vacated PPPA will be subject to the continuous bid process. The Appointing Authority may exclude the employee from bidding to a specific assignment area for the remainder of the bid period and subsequent bid period.
15.	In reference to subsection B.1.c., an employee may be removed from the PPPA upon receipt of the final copy of a substandard performance evaluation. Such movement will be to a post with substantially similar start/stop times. The vacated PPPA will revert to the continuous bid process. The employee will not be permitted to participate in the PPPA process for a one (1) year period.
I. DISPUTES
All disputes concerning PPPA issues, that are unable to be resolved at the local level shall be directed to the Joint Labor/Management Committee for final resolution, as the final level of review. The Joint Labor/Management Committee shall be comprised with equal representation of three (3) persons appointed by the Director of Corrections and CCPOA, respectively. Disputes will be resolved by majority vote.
12.08 Layoff and Reemployment
A.	Whenever it is necessary because of a lack of work or funds, or whenever it is advisable in the interest of the economy to reduce the number of permanent and/or probationary employees in the Depart
156
ments of Corrections, Youth Authority and Mental Health, the State may lay off employees pursuant to this section and DPA/SPB Law and Rules which are not superseded by this section.
B.	Order of Layoff
Layoff shall be made in order of seniority pursuant to Government Code Sections 19997.2 through 19997.7 and applicable DPA rules except as superceded by this MOU. Seniority scores shall be determined pursuant to Section 12.01 of this MOU. In determining seniority scores, one (1) point shall be allowed for each qualifying monthly pay period of full-time state service in Unit 6, regardless of when such service occurred. A pay period in which a full-time employee works eleven (11) or more days will be considered a qualifying pay period, except that when an absence from state service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive work days falls within two (2) consecutive qualifying pay periods, the second pay period shall be disqualified.
C.	Employees compensated on a monthly basis shall be notified in writing thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the effective date of the layoff. Where the notices are mailed, the beginning of the thirty (30) calendar day period will be determined by the postmark of the notice. Notice of the layoff shall be sent to CCPOA. The reason for the proposed layoff, the anticipated classifications affected, the number of employees in each class, the estimated number of surplus employees in each classification, and the proposed effective date of the layoff, will be clearly stated in the layoff notice sent to CCPOA and the employee.
D.	Transfer or Demotion in Lieu of Layoff
The State may offer affected employees a transfer or a demotion, in lieu of layoff, to another position deemed appropriate by the Department, pursuant to Government Code Section 19997.8 through 19997.10 and applicable DPA Rules. If an employee refuses a transfer or demotion, the employee may be laid off from state service.
157
E.	Whenever the State determines it necessary to lay off employees, the State shall Meet and Confer in good faith with CCPOA regarding the impact of said layoff(s) and alternatives to the layoff(s). The State and CCPOA shall meet in good faith to explore alternatives to laying off employees such as, but not limited to, voluntary reduced work time, retraining, early retirement, job sharing, and unpaid leaves of absence.
F.	In accordance with Government Code Section 19997.11 and 19997.12, the State shall establish a reemployment list by class for all employees who are laid off. Such lists shall take precedence over all other types of employment lists for the classes in which the employees are laid off. Employees shall be certified from department or subdivision reemployment lists in accordance with Section 19056 of the Government Code.
G.	An appeal of any portion of this layoff provision shall solely be through the procedures established in Government Code Section 19997.14 and shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration Article of this MOU.

162
13	.03 Employee Assistance Program
A. The State recognizes that alcohol, drug abuse and stress may adversely affect job performance and are treatable conditions. The intent of this section is to assist an employee’s voluntary efforts to receive treatment or counseling on a variety of substance-related or stress-related problems so as to retain or recover his/her value as an employee. As a means of correcting job performance problems, the State will normally refer employees who need assistance to obtain treatment or counseling on substance-related or stress-related problems, such as marital, family, emotional, financial, medical, prescription drug, legal or other personal problems. This is intended solely as a referral system.
B.	In an effort to keep records concerning an employee’s referral and/or treatment for substance-related or stress-related problems confidential, such records shall not be included in the employee’s personnel file.
C.	The State shall continue to provide confidential professional counseling benefits to all employees and their dependents, at the same level of benefits, including the same confidentiality protections as are presently provided employees and dependents. Up to seven (7) sessions per problem type per contract year shall be made available at no cost to the employee. There shall be no charge to employees or family members except for extended counseling (beyond the seven [7] sessions per problem type per contract year) which, if needed, is to be specifically and personally arranged between the employee and the counselor.
D.	If an employee desires counseling and wishes to maintain total confidentiality, he/she should call the independent Employee Assistance Program (EAP) vendor directly or CCPOA for assistance. The independent EAP vendor’s number is (800) 6327422. If this number for some reason has changed and/or is no longer in service, please be sure to call your local CCPOA office for the current provider number. CCPOA’s numbers are (800) 8216443 and (916) 372-6060 for its Northern office;
163
(800) 832-1415 and (559) 431-5390 for its Central office; (800) 221-7397 and (909) 980-6376 for its Southern office; (800) 468-0342 and (760) 3425514 for its Indio office; and (888) 592-3213 and (661) 328-0695 for its Bakersfield office.
E.	Should an employee contact the local EAP Coordinator for help, the EAP records concerning the employee’s problems are considered confidential and shall not be included in the employee’s personnel file. The local EAP Coordinator shall not be a Peace Officer employee.
F.	The State and CCPOA shall form a Joint Labor/ Management Committee to study common avenues of approach in preventing substance abuse problems among employees.

All participants in the FlexElect Program shall be subject to all applicable Federal statute and related administrative provisions adopted by DPA. All eligible employees must work one-half ( ) time or more and have permanent status or if a limited-term or TAU appointment, must have mandatory return rights to a permanent position.
B.	Employees may enroll in the Flexible Benefits Program and participate in all of the options with the exception of the cash option in lieu of dental insurance.
C.	PIEs may only participate in the pre-tax premium and/or the cash option for medical insurance. PIEs choosing the pre-tax premium must qualify for
164
State medical and/or dental benefits. PIEs choosing the cash option will qualify if they work at least one-half ( ) time, have an appointment for more than six (6) months, and receive credit for a minimum of four hundred eighty (480) paid hours within the six (6) month control period of January 1 through June 30 of the plan year in which they are enrolled.
This section is not grievable or arbitrable.
13.05 Long-Term Care Insurance Plans
Employees in classes assigned to Bargaining Unit 6 are eligible to enroll in the Long- Term Care Insurance Program offered by PERS. The employee’s spouse, parents, and the spouse’s parents are also currently eligible to enroll in the plans, subject to the underwriting criteria specified in the plan.
The long-term care insurance premiums and the administrative cost to the Controller’s Office shall be fully paid by the employee and are subject to payroll deductions.
Nothing herein prevents PERS from altering or modifying the terms of the plan or premiums at any time.
13.06 Industrial Disability Leave
A.	For periods of disability commencing on or after January 1, 1993, eligible employees shall receive IDL payments equivalent to full net pay for the first twenty-two (22) work days after the date of the reported injury.
B.	In the event that the disability exceeds twenty-two (22) work days, the employee will receive sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 %) of gross pay from the 23rd work day of disability until the end of the 52nd week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two (2) years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the 23rd work day with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to match, but not exceed, full net pay. Full net pay is defined as the net pay the employee
165
would have received if he/she had been working and not on disability. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one (1) hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
D.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any state employee who is a member of either PERS or STRS retirement system during the first fifty-two (52) weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two (2) year period. Any employee who is already receiving disability payments on the effective date of this provision will be notified and given thirty (30) days to make a voluntary, but irrevocable, change to the new benefit for the remainder of his/her eligibility for IDL.
E.	If the employee remains disabled after the IDL benefit is exhausted, then the employee will be eligible to receive TD benefits as provided for in Government Code Section 19863, except that no employee will be allowed to supplement TD payments in an amount which exceeds the employee’s full net pay as defined above.
F.	In the event that an employee is determined to be “permanent and stationary” by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	All appeals of an employee’s denial of IDL benefits shall only follow the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee’s denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party’s contractual rights which are not related to an individual’s denial of benefits.
166
13.07 Alternate Pre-Retirement Death Benefit The parties agree to allow for a pre-retirement death benefit as found in the applicable Government Codes.
13.08 Member Retirement Contribution
Rate for Peace Officers
A.	Member contributions to PERS shall be based on eight percent (8%) of the compensation in excess of eight hundred sixty-three ($863) dollars per month for employees who are in the Peace Officer/ Firefighter (PO/FF) member category. This contribution rate shall become effective April 1, 1995.
B.	Effective the beginning of the pay period following legislative ratification of this collective bargaining agreement, Unit 6 PO/FF members shall have their employee retirement contribution rate reduced from 8% of compensation in excess of eight hundred sixty-three ($863) dollars per month to 5.5% of compensation in excess of eight hundred sixty-three ($863) dollars per month.
C.	Effective July 1, 2002, Unit 6 PO/FF members shall have their employee retirement contribution rate reduced from 5.5% of compensation in excess of eight hundred sixty-three ($863) dollars per month to 3% of compensation in excess of eight hundred sixty-three ($863) dollars per month.
D.	Effective July 1, 2003, the employee’s retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001.
E.	The State employer will continue to ensure that pension benefits are properly funded in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices. In accordance with the provisions of the June 20, 2001 communication to DPA from CalPERS’ Actuarial & Employer Services Division, effective July 1, 2003, the State Employer’s CalPERS retirement contribution rate shall incorporate the impact resulting from the temporary reduction in the employee retirement contribution rate. As indicated in the above-referenced letter, “10% of the net unamortized actuarial loss shall be amortized each year”. However, if CalPERS Board of Administration alters the amortization schedule referenced above
167
in a manner that accelerates the employer payment obligation, either party to this agreement may declare this section of the MOU, and all obligations set forth herein, to be null and void. In the event this agreement becomes null and void, the employee retirement contribution rate shall be restored to levels in effect on August 30, 2001 and the parties shall be obligated to immediately meet and confer in good faith to discuss alternative provisions.
13.09 Survivors’ Benefits
The State agrees to cover Bargaining Unit 6 Peace Officers with the Fifth Level of the 1959 Survivors’ Benefits at no cost above the $2 existing rate.
A.	Employees in Unit 6 who are members of PERS will be covered under the Fifth Level of the 1959 Survivors’ Benefits which provides a death benefit in the form of a monthly allowance to the eligible survivor in the event of death before retirement. This benefit will be payable to eligible survivors of current employees who are not covered by Social Security and whose death occurs on or after the effective date of the MOU for this section.
B.	The contribution for employees covered under this new level of benefits will be two dollars ($2) per month. The State will contribute any difference required to provide the survivors’ benefits.
C.	The survivors’ benefits are detailed in the following schedule:
1.	A spouse who has the care of two (2) or more eligible children, or three (3) or more eligible children not in the care of the spouse .................................. $1,800;
2.	A spouse with one (1) eligible child, or two (2) eligible children not in the care of the spouse .................................. $1,500;
3.	One (1) eligible child not in the care of the spouse; or the spouse, who had no eligible children at the time of the employee’s death, upon reaching age sixty-two (62) .......... $750.
168
D.	When an active Bargaining Unit 6 employee on the payroll dies due to an illness or injury which was not incurred in the line of duty, a request may be made to the Appointing Authority to allow employees to donate annual leave, vacation, holiday, personal leave or excess time to the leave bank of the deceased employee. This time shall be cashed out to provide direct financial assistance to the person otherwise entitled to receive the value of the deceased employee’s leave balance. The maximum limit of contributions/compensation shall not exceed $50,000. Donations will only be accepted for 30 days following the approval of the request.
13.10 Rural Healthcare Equity Program (RHCEP)
A.	Effective July 1, 2001, the State shall continue the Rural Healthcare Equity Program for Bargaining Unit 6 members, which may be administered in conjunction with a similar program for state employees in other bargaining units, for excluded employees, and for annuitants. DPA shall administer any fund involving Bargaining Unit 6 members.
B.	The parties agree that in those areas/counties which CalPERS has defined as “rural” because no CalPERS HMO plan is available for enrollment in the area, Unit 6 members who are enrolled in a CalPERS-approved PPO plan shall be eligible for the Rural Healthcare Equity Program. Unit 6 members enrolled in a CalPERS-approved HMO plan, including an HMO plan offered by the CCPOA Health Benefit Trust, will not be eligible for the Rural Healthcare Equity Program; therefore, no monthly payment would be made into the Rural Healthcare Equity Program account as otherwise provided in this section and applicable statutes.
C.	The program shall operate in the following fashion:
1.	The State shall contribute $1,500 per year on behalf of each bargaining unit member (employee) who lives in a defined rural area (except for those enrolled in an HMO or CCPOA
169
Health Benefit Trust), as more definitely described in Government Code section (GC) 22825.01. For Bargaining Unit 6 members, payments into the account shall be on a monthly basis. For permanent employees, as in the “Medical Reimbursement Account” situation, the employee does not have to wait for reimbursement of covered medical expenses until the full amount has been deposited.
2.	As to any employee who enters state service or leaves state service during a fiscal year, contributions for such employee shall be made on a pro rata basis. A similar computation shall be used for anyone entering or leaving the bargaining unit (e.g., promotion in mid-fiscal year).
3.	The money shall be available for use as defined in GC section 22825.01.
4.	Pursuant to GC section 22825.01, the Rural Healthcare Equity Program will be established with a separate account for Bargaining Unit 6 members, as one of several similar accounts.
5.	Each Unit 6 employee who is not enrolled in an HMO or CCPOA Health Benefit Trust and who is otherwise eligible, shall be able to utilize up to $1,500 per year, pursuant to GC section 22825.01, but with the exceptions for greater utilization hereafter noted. The prorata limitation pursuant to paragraph C(2) is applicable here.
6.	If an employee does not utilize the complete $1,500 pursuant to the procedures and limitations described in GC section 22825.01, then the unused monies shall be put in a “same year pool”. That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred health care expenses in excess of the $1,500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in the GC section 22825.01. The monies in the same year pool would be distributed at the end, or even soon after, each fiscal year to that group of employees who
170
had expenses in excess of $1,500 in the relevant fiscal year. Those monies shall be distributed on a pro tanto (pro rata) basis.
a.	Any employee not in Bargaining Unit 6 all year shall receive credit under this paragraph utilizing the same pro rata formula as in paragraph C(2) above.
b.	If an employee is entitled to less than $25.00 under this paragraph, the money shall instead go into next year’s fund pursuant to paragraph 7 hereafter.
7.	If monies still remain after a distribution to such employees (i.e., all employees who spent more than $1,500 as provided in GC section 22825.01 were completely reimbursed), then those surplus monies shall be rolled over into the next fiscal year’s funds available for distribution to employees whose expenses pursuant to GC section 22825.01 exceed $1,500 in such subsequent year. Similar “rollovers” would occur in any years where all employees were completely reimbursed (or had payments made on their behalf) pursuant to GC 22825.01 and monies still remained in the pool.
D.	The State and CCPOA agree that the RHCEP premium reimbursement described in Government Code section 22825.01(f)(1) shall be provided on a monthly basis for eligible Unit 6 members beginning 90 days after ratification of this agreement by both parties, or as soon as possible thereafter. The premium reimbursement and the statutory claims reimbursement shall not exceed the agreed upon amount of $1,500, per individual, each fiscal year. Eligible expenses exceeding $1,500 will be applied to the secondary reimbursement process as described in this section.
E.	When implemented, the monthly reimbursement process described in paragraph D above will only be applicable to those eligible participants where the employer contribution and the monthly RHCEP reimbursement combined, do not exceed the
171
monthly premium of the lowest cost, CalPERS selffunded PPO.
13.11 Benefit Trust Fund Contributions
A.	The State shall contribute a mutually agreed upon amount to the CCPOA Benefit Trust Fund (BTF) for an increased vision benefit. This payment shall be given to the BTF on or before July 30 of each year in order to continue the increased vision benefit. The monies will be solely for plan members who are also members of Bargaining Unit 6.
B.	No later than July 30 of each year, the State shall contribute a mutually agreed upon amount to the CCPOA Benefit Trust Fund (BTF) to provide eligible members an offset to an increase in benefit premiums and/or reduction of premiums for programs offered by the BTF.
C.	The State shall contribute a mutually agreed upon amount each year to the CCPOA Benefit Trust Fund (BTF) for an increased death benefit to $20,000.
D.	The BTF is a “Trust” established pursuant to and governed by, federal statute, the Employee Retirement Income and Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The monies will be used solely for the benefit of the BTF’s beneficiaries and pursuant to said federal statute and the BTF Plan Document.
E.	CCPOA shall provide the State a copy of the BTF’s previous calendar year’s audited financial statements and a copy of the most recent CalPERS audit, by July 30 of each year.

C.	The position or post held by the employee is irrelevant to the employee’s entitlement to bilingual/ sign language pay status.
D.	The bilingual/sign language pay program is to be administered in accordance with DPA Rules and Regulations.
15.07 Physical Fitness Incentive Pay
A.	Effective July 1, 2002, all Bargaining Unit 6 employees with less than 60 qualifying pay periods in the bargaining unit shall receive a flat rate of $65 per pay period for successfully completing the physical fitness exam.
Effective upon ratification of this agreement by both parties all Bargaining Unit 6 employees with 60 qualifying pay periods or more in the unit shall receive a flat rate of $100 per pay period for successfully completing the physical fitness test. Effective July 1, 2002, the $100 flat rate for all Bargaining Unit 6 employees with 60 qualifying pay periods or more in the unit shall be increased to $130 per pay period for successfully completing the physical fitness exam.
For the purposes of this section, a qualifying pay period is defined as 11 days of work or more for full time employees, and 88 hours of work or more for Permanent Intermittent Employees(PIE) in a pay period. Should a PIE have worked 88 or more qualifying hours in any of the 60 qualifying pay periods prior to the effective date of this MOU, each of these pay periods shall count as a qualifying pay period for purposes of determining the employee’s eligibility for Physical Fitness Incentive Pay (PFIP). This paragraph shall not apply to employees who currently receive PFIP.
213
B.	The following list of fitness tests in effect until July 1, 2002 shall constitute the Physical Fitness Program: The Illinois Agility Run Test, The Vertical Jump Test, The Flexibility Sit and Reach Test or Sit-ups, and the Three-minute Step Test.

C.	If the employee fails the fitness test in effect until July 1, 2002 the first time, the employee shall be allowed sixty (60) days in which to successfully pass the physical fitness program. This incentive pay shall not be retroactive for those employees who fail the exam the first time.
D.	This physical fitness incentive pay shall be a part of the employee’s normal check for permanent fulltime and permanent part-time employees, but shall not be included for purposes of computing benefits (including, but not limited to, PERS calculations) and/or additional compensation. In terms of withholding for tax purposes, this stipend shall be subject to the same withholding rules as normal checks.
E.	The State and CCPOA shall Meet and Confer over the development of an alternate form or new form of the physical fitness program or if both parties agree to increase the number or frequency of testing dates.
F.	If an employee has missed a scheduled test either through scheduled vacation, injury and/or family illness, that employee will be allowed to take the examination at the next scheduled date.

15.09 K-9 Duty Compensation and Overtime
A.	The State agrees to compensate canine officers for routine time spent for canine care outside the regular work schedule at the prevailing federal or state minimum hourly rate per hour, whichever is greater. The parties further agree that routine daily canine care generally requires up to sixteen (16) hours each pay period beyond an officer’s regular work schedule. This daily “routine” K-9 care will be compensated based on the prevailing federal or state (whichever is greater) minimum hourly wage at time-and-one-half hourly rate. The officer is only pre-approved for up to sixteen (16) hours per pay period. The officer will submit this overtime via the daily timekeeping process and it will be in addition to any other regular overtime the officer may have worked.
If an officer needs to exceed the maximum daily routine care time allotment noted in A. above, the officer must obtain his/her supervisor’s approval prior to exceeding the maximum. The officer must justify the need to exceed the maximum in writing.
B.	Daily routine care performed outside the regular work hours consists of various tasks such as feed
215
ing, grooming, medicating, exercising the dog(s), performing incidental maintenance training, spraying for pest control in the area, and preparing and cleaning the living space for the dog(s).
C.	As long as the officer has K-9 responsibility even when they are on sick leave, vacation, or other approved leave, they may accrue up to thirty (30) minutes per day of daily routine care as noted in A. above.
D.	The employer will pay for food and veterinary care for the dog(s) and miscellaneous incidentals for dog care such as brushes, detergents, soaps, flea control products, and pest control sprays.
E.	The employer will pay the officer at his or her regular overtime rate of pay for extra duties such as emergency veterinary care, outside the normal work schedule or any duties assigned by management, such as, searches, pre-approved non-rou-tine training and all other dog-related matters not specifically enumerated in paragraph B. above.
F.	Management retains the right to call an officer and their dog to duty at anytime outside their regular work schedule. On such occasions, the employer will pay the officer, if applicable, in accordance with existing “callback” rules.
G.	The State prohibits canine officers from performing any work while traveling to or from the institution or worksite with the dog. If the officer must travel to an “other than normal” worksite, the State will compensate the officer for any increase in travel time in accordance with prevailing travel rules. The State may require the officer and the dog to travel only during regular work hours.
H.	The State reserves the right to discontinue the use of canine units, or to provide for their total care and maintenance at the institution.
I.	A K-9 officer is required to obtain a certification that he or she has received the required dog handler training.
216
15.10	401 (k) Plan
Employees in Unit 6 are to be included in the State of California, DPA’s 401 (k) Deferred Compensation Program.
DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The State of California will have two (2) voluntary deferred compensation programs under Sections 457 and 401 (k) of the IRS Code.
The IRS has approved the State’s 1985 request for a 401 (k) program. A single state plan paralleling the 457 will be provided to employees.
The 401 (k) is a currently qualified trust, which is subject to the 1986 and 1987 tax code revisions. As a result it will be, at least initially, more advantageous for those earning less than $66,000 per year, subject to COLA.
401 (k) programs hold in trust employees’ money while the 457 holds State money in trust for the employee.
Currently, the 401 (k) has the following provisions which differ from the 457:
•	Allows for a loan provision whereby an employee can borrow against his/her fund;
•	Allows IRAs to be rolled into the 401 (k) fund or out of 401 (k) into an IRA without first taxing;
•	Allows for a five (5) year forward averaging when the funds are drawn out;
•	Allows for a maximum contribution which increases each year by the increase in the national CPI rate.
Penalizes persons earning over $66,000 by reverting contribution for taxing purposes if the plan’s ratio of contribution by higher paid employees substantially exceeds lower paid.
IRS changes may make the 401 (k) program unattractive in the future. As a result, the State intends to offer the same investments to both the 457 and 401 (k) participants to assure both funds earn maximum interest. If the 401 (k) must be eliminated in later years, employee funds will be protected.
217
15.11	Salary Definitions.
For the purpose of salary actions affecting employees, the following definitions shall apply.
A.	“Salary range” is the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class.
B.	“Step” is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a salary rate, rounded to the nearest dollar.
C.	“Rate” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and, for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis, any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
D.	“Range differential” is the difference between the maximum rate of two (2) salary ranges of the pay plan.
E.	“Substantially the same salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate the same as or less than two (2) steps higher or lower than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
F.	“Higher salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two (2) steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
G.	“Lower salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two (2) steps lower than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
H.	Under paragraph B., one step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (rounded) (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415.00 [rounded to $2,415]). One (1) step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (rounded) (e.g., $2,415 divided by 1.05 = $2,300.00 [rounded to $2,300]).
I.	Under paragraphs E., F., and G., two (2) steps higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (rounded) and then multiplying the result by 1.05 (rounded) (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415.00 [rounded to $2,415]; $2,415 x 1.05 = $2,535.75 [rounded to $2,536]). Two (2) steps lower is calculated by di
218
viding the rate by 1.05 (rounded) and then dividing the result by 1.05 (rounded) (e.g., $2,536 divided by 1.05 = $2,415.2381 [rounded to $2,415]; $2,415 divided by 1.05 = $2,300.00 [rounded to $2,300]). This method is referred to as the Universal Salary Schedule calculation.
Unless otherwise provided by SPB, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movements between classes and salary ranges.
15.12	Overpayments/Payroll Errors (Accounts Receivable)
A.	This provision applies when the State determines that an overpayment has been made to an employee. “Overpayment” is defined as cash or time off that has been overpaid, regardless of the reason.
B.	When an employee is overpaid or owes the State money, the employee shall be given reasonable individual notice in writing prior to the State establishing an accounts receivable. Employees assigned to camp positions will be provided written notice of any overpayment. This notice will be sent certified mail/return receipt requested.
C.	If an overpayment occurs, reimbursement shall be made to the State through one (1) of the following methods:
1.	First, in cash payment(s) mutually agreed to by the employee and the State; or
2.	Installments through payroll deduction to cover the same number of pay periods in which they are accrued, provided the full amount is recovered in one (1) year or less. Where over-payments have continued for more than one (1) year, full payment may be required by the State through payroll deductions over the period of one (1) year. In those cases involving large accounts receivables,
219
longer periods of replacement may be agreed to; or,
3.	Upon employee request, the overpayment shall be satisfied by use of leave credits, excluding sick leave.
D.	In any event, the maximum part of the aggregate disposable earnings of an individual for any pay period which may be subject to garnishment may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of his/her disposable earnings for the pay period. The term “garnishment” means any legal or equitable procedure (including, but not limited to, tax payments, child support payments, spousal support payments, earnings withholding orders, and accounts receivable) through which the earnings of any individual are required to be withheld for payment of any debt.
E.	If an employee who was given an advance, signed a waiver and should have reasonably known that the overpayment occurred, the schedule of repayment may be determined by the State, and will not be subject to paragraphs C. above and H. below.
F.	An employee whose employment is terminated prior to full repayment of the amount owed shall have withheld from any money owing the employee, upon termination, an amount sufficient to provide full repayment. If the final amount owed to the employee is insufficient to provide full reimbursement to the State, the State shall have the right to exercise any and all other legal means to recover the additional amount owed.
G.	No provision of this section shall supersede the current procedure for the correction or repayment of errors or other losses directed by third parties covering areas such as insurance, retirement, social security, court ordered payments or disability pay.
H.	The State agrees to hold CCPOA harmless with respect to reasonable legal expenditures, costs and/or judgments.
220
I.	If the employee believes an overpayment did not occur, or that the repayment schedule is not equitable, he/she may appeal by grievance at the second level within ten (10) work days of the notice of overpayment. No action shall be taken to establish an “accounts receivable,” if a grievance has been filed, until after the Department has responded to the grievance at the third level.
J.	In CDC, if an accounts receivable is established because an employee has failed to submit a completed “998” pursuant to the 998A Agreement (see Sideletter #4), the employee may file a grievance at the second level of review. If the grievance is not resolved, the grievance may be appealed to arbitration under the mini-arb process pursuant to Article VI of this MOU. The arbitrator may order the reversal of the accounts receivable if he/she finds there are mitigating circumstances for failure to submit the 998A, or if the State fails to follow the correct process as outlined in the Agreement.
K.	No administrative action shall be taken by the State to recover an overpayment unless the action is initiated within three (3) years from the date of the overpayment.
15.13	Recruitment -- Avenal, Ironwood, Chuckawalla Valley, Calipatria, and Centinela State Prisons
A.	Employees who are employed at Avenal, Ironwood, or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons, CDC, for twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, shall be eligible for a recruitment and retention bonus of $2,400, payable thirty (30) days following the completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods.
B.	If an employee voluntarily terminates, transfers, or is discharged prior to completing twelve (12) consecutive pay periods at Avenal, Ironwood, or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons, there will be no pro rata payment for those months at either facility.
C.	If an employee is mandatorily transferred by the Department, he/she shall be eligible for a pro rata share for those months served.
221
D.	If an employee promotes to a different facility, or department other than Avenal, Ironwood, or Chuck-awalla Valley State Prison, prior to completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, there shall be no pro rata of this recruitment and retention bonus. After completing the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, an employee who promotes within the Department will be entitled to a pro rata share of the existing retention bonus.
E.	Part-time and intermittent employees shall receive a pro rata share of the annual recruitment and retention differential based on the total number of hours worked, excluding overtime, during the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods.
F.	Annual recruitment and retention payments shall not be considered as compensation for purposes of retirement contributions.
G.	If the State plans to make any changes to this section prior to the expiration of the MOU, they shall Meet and Confer with CCPOA over the impact of such change.
H.	Employees on IDL shall continue to receive this stipend.
I.	If an employee is granted a leave of absence, the employee will not accrue time towards the twelve (12) qualifying pay periods, but the employee shall not be required to start the calculation of the twelve (12) qualifying pay periods all over. For example, if an employee has worked four (4) months at a qualifying institution, and then takes six (6) months maternity leave, the employee will have only eight (8) additional qualifying pay periods before receiving the initial payment of $2,400.
J.	There shall be a Joint Labor/Management Committee to study how to convert the $2,400 per year bonus into a monthly stipend. This committee shall render its findings by June 30, 1998. Upon completion of the study, the parties may agree to reopen this section.
222

15.14	Personal Leave Program
Employees shall retain their personal leave balances from the Personal Leave Program (PLP) established under Section 16.13 of the 1992-1995 MOU. Employees may continue to request use of PLP credits in accordance with departmental policies for requesting the use of vacation.
Fifty percent (50%) of the personal leave balance described in Section 16.13 of the 1992-1995 MOU accrued by the employee, is not subject to State-initiated buyback without prior approval of the employee.

C.	For purposes of determining eligibility, all time spent in Bargaining Unit 6 or related non-repre-sented classes shall count, as long as the employee is in the bargaining unit at the time eligibility for the pay differential is approved.
D.	The above percentages are non-cumulative; i.e., an employee who has been in Bargaining Unit 6 for twenty (20) years is eligible for a pay differential of four percent (4 %) above base salary, not the cumulative total of years 17, 18, 19 and 20 (e.g., ten percent [10 %]).

C.	Such transfers are subject to and contingent upon all statutes, laws, rules and regulations authorizing such transfers including those governing the amount of annual deferrals.
228
D.	Employees electing to make such a transfer shall bear full tax liability, if any, for the leave transferred (e.g., “over-defers” exceeding the limitation on annual deferrals).
E.	Implementation, continuation and administration of this section is expressly subject to and contingent upon compliance with the SPP’s governing Plan document (which may at the State’s discretion be amended from time to time), and applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations.

16.03 Early Intervention Program/Work
Injuries
A.	CDC and CYA, in conjunction with CCPOA and other recognized employee bargaining unit repre
234
sentative associations are initiating a voluntary Early Intervention program within the Workers’ Compensation field at every Unit 6 institution, facility, camp and parole region. Early Intervention seeks to insure, before it becomes necessary to engage an attorney, that interested employees involved in Workers’ Compensation cases are fully informed of available options by an authorized, independent Early Intervention Counselor and are evaluated by the services of a mutually-agreed upon, independent medical panel to assist in expeditiously reaching timely decisions regarding compensability for qualifying employees. Important to this program is the fact that the Early Intervention counselors, the medical panel, and the rehabilitation counselors are picked by the departments in conjunction with CCPOA and the other recognized employee representative associations. Additionally, a primary goal of the Early Intervention program is to assist, if possible, expedited return to work of the injured employee; using where applicable, such concepts as, but not limited to, temporary limited-duty assignments; the employee being provided, if necessary, with special equipment; or job-site modification; or the retraining of the employee, and the provision of an alternate job in the same department or another state department.
If you desire further information regarding this program, you may call CCPOA’s “Early Intervention Coordinator” at (800) 821-6443, or call your local CCPOA office, or contact the State’s “Return to Work Coordinator” at your worksite. Additionally, CCPOA should have a local, institutional or parole region, Job Steward designated as an Early Intervention ombudsman who hopefully can help you.
B.	The State will conduct no meetings of local selection committees to choose additional Early Intervention counselors without a prior written notice to CCPOA’s main office in Sacramento. Such notice will be provided at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the proposed date. The parties shall then select a mutually satisfactory date for said selection committee to convene on.
235
C.	Disputes regarding this section shall be grievable only up to the Department Director or designee, which shall constitute an exhaustion of administrative remedies.
16.04 CDC and CYA Smoking Policies
Please refer to Appendix Item #14.
16.05 Post Orders/Duty Statements
Upon request, the local CCPOA chapter will be provided access to existing post orders/duty statements for review, and may make recommendations for changes to the Appointing Authority or designee.
16.06 Institutional Vacancy Plan
A.	The hiring authority at all CDC institutions will continue to operate under a standardized institutional vacancy plan (IVP) for Correctional Officer positions. To the extent that circumstances change (e.g., activations and deactivations) at an institution the appointing authority (or designee) shall notice CCPOA for purposes of meeting and agreeing upon a change to the institution’s vacancy plan.
B.	Vacancies identified in the IVPs are allocated from positions in the State budget for relief-for-relief, posts and partial posts to be held vacant on a permanent basis.
C. The number of Correctional Officer vacancies identified by CDC institutions for inclusion in their IVP shall not be more than 5% average on a statewide basis (plus the total number of Correctional Officer sick leave positions) by January 1, 2005. On this date, there shall be no vacation or holiday relief on the IVP. In the interim, the following progression of activation of PY’s from the IVPs statewide will take place:
1.	Within sixty (60) days after ratification of the MOU, two-hundred (200) vacation/holiday PY’s from the IVPs will be activated on a statewide basis. The funding for the activation of these PY’s will be accomplished by utilizing the funding approved from the Under Bud
236
geted Leave BCP for fiscal year 2001/02. Within thirty (30) days of ratification of this MOU, and on going as necessary, the CDC and CCPOA will meet to determine the distribution of the vacation and holiday posts to be activated.
2.	Effective January 1, 2003, an additional one hundred (100) vacation/holiday PY’s will be activated on a statewide basis from the IVP.
3.	Effective January 1, 2004 an additional one hundred (100) vacation/holiday PY’s will be activated on a statewide basis from the IVP.
4.	Effective January 1, 2005, all remaining va-cation/holiday PY’s on the IVPs will be activated on a statewide basis. Additionally, all post coverage for vacation and holiday relief will be restored to the 1.64 formula level for post assignments, inclusive of those posts which were activated in Section C.1 above.
D.	The State agrees that it will not hold any budgeted Correctional Officer positions vacant for purposes of generating salary savings, unless the positions are identified in an institutional vacancy plan. CCPOA recognizes that salary savings may, however, result as a by-product of the State’s inability to recruit and train new Correctional Officers for positions that are not identified for salary savings purposes in the IVPs. CCPOA therefore agrees that under these circumstances the actual vacancy rate may be higher than otherwise stated in subsection C above for IVPs.
E.	Each institution’s appointing authority (or designee) and the local CCPOA chapter president (or designee) shall meet at least annually to review and reaffirm in writing their agreement for the upcoming year as it relates to the contents of the IVP. This meeting normally shall be completed on or about September 1 of each year.
F.	The hiring authority at all CDC institutions will establish a standardized institutional vacancy plan.
237
G.	Disputes concerning this section shall first be brought to the attention of the local Warden, or designee, within ten (10) calendar days of having knowledge of the alleged violation. After the face-to-face meeting with the Warden, the Warden will respond to the local Chapter President within ten (10) calendar days. If not satisfied with the Warden’s response, the matter may be appealed to the Regional Administrator within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the response.
H.	The Regional Administrator shall review all appeals at a monthly meeting, if requested by the Union. The Regional Administrator shall respond to the Union within ten (10) calendar days following the meeting. If not satisfied with the decision of the Regional Administrator, the Union may appeal to the Chief Deputy Director of Operations within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the response. The Chief Deputy Director of Operations shall review the appeal and respond to the Union within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the appeal by the local Union.
If not satisfied with the decision of the Chief Deputy Director, the Union may appeal to the Director within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the response. This is the final level of review. The Director has the right to determine the remedy should there be a determination that a violation has occurred.
The established time lines may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
I.	The percentage in the IVP is computed by taking the authorized budgeted CO position count minus the budgeted CO sick leave positions and multiplying the difference by the percentage of the IVP outlined in subsection C.1 through C.4.
J.	Separate and apart from the institutional vacancy plan, management may reassign staff when post workload has been temporarily eliminated (e.g., when there are no inmates in the community hospital, staff may be reassigned to avoid overtime).
238
K.	Operational needs of the institution may require the Appointing Authority to alter the vacancy plan. Should this occur, management will meet and come to an agreement with the local Bargaining Unit 6 Chapter President.
16.07 CYA, CDC and DMH Information Documentation
A.	The State agrees to provide CCPOA with the following information when such information is necessary and relevant to CCPOA’s duty to represent Unit 6 employees in CDC/DMH/CYA under this MOU:
1.	The current Post Assignment Schedule (PAS, or its equivalent), complete with summary page(s), i.e., summary part A, B, and C.
2.	The current Master Assignment Roster (MAR or its equivalent).
3.	The Post Assignment Schedule “legend” (or its equivalent).
B.	The State agrees that such information is necessary and relevant in the following circumstances:
1.	When necessary for CCPOA to carry out a Meet and Confer obligation incurred under the terms of this MOU.
2.	When necessary to monitor compliance with specific sections of this MOU, and existing local agreements.
C.	The State agrees to provide this information in a timely manner, (for example, the information will be provided in enough time prior to a Meet and Confer or other contractual obligation for the local Unit 6 leadership to verify the document[s] validity).
D.	CCPOA agrees that the State is not obligated to provide a copy of the above in each and every instance as long as the most recent information provided to CCPOA is current. CCPOA agrees that it is prohibited from misusing requests for information to delay the completion of any Meet and Confer obligation under this MOU.
239
E.	The State agrees that, in keeping with the PERB Decision No. S-CE-730-S, it may be necessary to provide additional documentation that would allow CCPOA to reconcile the PAS and MAR with the most recent Governor’s Budget.
F.	Alleged violations of this section may be appealed to arbitration after the third step of the grievance procedure. The arbitrator shall adhere to PERB Decision No. S-CE-730-S and other relevant precedent in determining whether information requested and/or provided under this section is necessary and relevant.
16.08 Work and Family Labor/Management Committee
A. The parties agree to establish one statewide permanent joint labor/management committee on work and family. The committee shall serve in an advisory capacity to the Departments of Personnel Administration’s Work and Family Program. Work and family related activities that the Committee will engage in include sponsoring research, reviewing existing programs and policies, recommending new programs and policies, initiating marketing efforts, and evaluation of the effectiveness of initiatives implemented by the Work and Family Program. Such work and family programs and policies may include, but are not limited to childcare, elder care, family leave, flexibility in the workplace, and a variety of other family-friendly programs and policies.

The Union recognizes that membership on the committee may also include any or all other union’s representing State employees. The committee shall have co-chairpersons, one representing management and one representing labor. The union shall have one representative.
C.	The parties agree the union representatives shall attend committee meetings without loss of compensation. The co-chairpersons may determine that subcommittees are necessary or preparatory
240
work other than at committee meetings is necessary. If this occur, the management co-chairperson may request that additional release time be granted for this purpose.
D.	The committee shall meet regularly and shall begin meeting after the ratification of this contract.
E.	The $5 million dollars established in the Work and Family Fund shall be administered by the Department of Personnel Administration. Amounts to be allocated and expended annually from the fund shall be determined by the Department of Personnel Administration and the committee.

Board Coordinating PA, and Community Service
253
Consultant shall be one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours in a twenty-eight (28) day work period. Normally, the work period schedule shall reflect a four (4) day or five (5) day work sequence with traditional weekend days as RDOs. The above-referenced classes shall submit to the supervisor for approval a work period schedule, seven (7) work days prior to the beginning of each work/pay period, based on existing practices. Any changes in the work schedules, excluding emergencies, will require prior supervisory approval. There shall be no arbitrary denial of a submitted work schedule. If a work schedule is denied, the supervisor shall state, in writing, the reason for the denial.
The above referenced classes will advise their supervisor of emergency changes no later than the next work day. If the above-referenced classes do not submit a monthly work schedule, the supervisor shall schedule his/her work hours. The schedule shall reflect those hours of work needed to provide the necessary level of service for such concerns as classification, parolee/inmate contact, programs, custody, and other routine or special assignments appropriate to the above-referenced classifications and responsibilities.
B.	All CYA Field PAs, YOPB Board Coordinating PA’s, and Community Service Consultants may schedule at least one (1) four-ten-forty (4/10/40) work week per period.
18.04 CYA Field PA Workload
A.	Cases that go into custody or on to missing status should have case count credit calculated at 1.0 after 30 days.
B.	Administrative caseloads will not be assigned to the case carrying Parole Agents. Telephonic contact for this caseload shall not routinely be handled by the Parole Agents. Emergency/crisis situations (e.g. violations) may be distributed on a rotational basis to case carriers currently below caseload maximum. However, immediate emergency/crisis situations may be assigned to the OD.
254
C.	In covering cases for Agents who are out on extended sick leave, high service/high risk cases will be equitably distributed to other PAs within the Parole unit. Agents receiving redistributed cases will not exceed the case credit maximum. The remaining cases will be placed on an administrative caseload.
D.	All Field Parole offices will routinely receive facsimile notification of Field PA vacancies (existing and/or newly created). Vacancies filled by management due to hardship or employee right of return will be designated on the notice form.
E.	CCPOA will be provided by January 1, 2002 or sooner the policy and procedures created to increase the cooperative efforts between Institutions and Camps Branch and Parole Services and Community Corrections Branch concerning housing for parole violators.
F.	Once a supervisor approves deviations from casework standards, an office audit shall not be cause for an agent to receive discipline whether formal or informal.
G.	Only Sex Offender and Mental Health PA II Specialists will service and supervise Sex Offender and Mental Health cases. Training for those staff shall occur within six (6) months of assignment to service those specific cases.
Routine backup shall not be assigned to the PA Is. However, the cases that are stabilized may be reassigned to a PA I. Should these cases assigned to the PA I significantly impact the PA’s workload, the agent may then request a meeting with their supervisor(s). As a result of the meeting the supervisor may:
1.	Reduce workload by lowering service contact level on appropriate Case Management case(s).
2.	Redistribute case to an administrative caseload.
3.	Reassign the case back to the PAII Specialist through the crisis case staffing process.
255
H.	Management agrees that student interns will not independently have case supervision responsibilities. Student interns may only assist case carrying PAs in the performance of the agent’s duties under the direct supervision of the agent/supervi-sor.
PAs who regularly perform the following assignments will not be given case credits beyond 52:
1)	Special programs; i.e., Academic programs; Parenting, Drug Abuse and Counseling, etc.
2)	Institution Pre-Parole Classes
3)	Gang Information Coordinator
4)	Public Speaking/Job Fairs
5)	Any and all additional parolee self-help groups, educational programs and/or community public relation projects.
These assignments shall be made by the following progressive procedure:
1)	Announce the need for a volunteer at staff meeting
2)	Approach Agents individually to determine interest
3)	Assign an Agent with the understanding that they can decline
4)	Make the assignment to the least senior Agent in the office who is not already carrying a secondary assignment.
Management agrees to free up PA time on their OD day by 1) developing uniform prioritized parole office clerical telephone answering procedures (rather than routinely sending most incoming calls to the OD).
PS&CC
General Policy
To the extent possible, PA caseloads shall be balanced. Toward this end, Supervising or Assistant Supervising PAs will schedule caseload assessments during routine case conferences no less than quarterly. The following caseload assessment procedure will be utilized in maintenance of parole unit workload balance.
256
Step #1 Determine the total number of each case “type” and multiply that number by the case type “multiplier.”
Case Type Count x Multiplier = Case Type Credit Total
Step #2 Add all case type credit totals for the caseload “case credit” total.
“x”	Case	Type Count	x Multiplier =	Case	Type Credit Total
“y”	Case	Type Count	x Multiplier =	Case	Type Credit Total
“z”	Case	Type Count	x Multiplier =	Case	Type Credit Total
Total Caseload Credit (52, + or -5)
The assigned multiplier value for each case type is determined through dividing the standard or “base” caseload of 52 by the approved number of cases per caseload for that type of case (e.g., the EEPRP multiplier value is 3.5, or 52/15). Case count and multiplier values for designated case types are identified in the following table.
Case Type	Case Count	Multiplier
Intensive Re-Entry	15	3.50
EEPRP	15	3.50
Specialized (PA II)	30	1.75
Case Management/		
Z Cases	52 (base)	1.00
Substance Abuse		
Cases/GSP Pure		
Caseload	30	1.75
The procedure allows for mixing of differing types of cases (e.g., Specialized PA II) and cases assigned to programs with reduced case count assignment levels (e.g., EEPRP). In establishing and maintaining caseload equity, a deviation from the base 52 of plus or minus five (5) “cases” is acceptable, in consideration of periodic parole unit case count fluctuations and operational requirements.
Only PA II Specialists will receive 1.75 multiplier credit for CYA commitment cases designated “specialized.” When other case types are included in a PA II Specialist
257
caseload, the multiplier credit assigned those case types will be granted (see example Caseload No. 2).
Quarterly caseload reconciliation may include one or more of the following adjustments:
Provide overtime in accordance with PSM 2040 and Article 11.11 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the State and CCPOA. Any changes to 11.11 shall be reflected/applicable to the Agreement.
Fill vacant positions and/or new positions in a timely manner.
Reduce workload by reclassifying appropriate cases from Intensive Re-entry to Case Management so that “case count” is 57 or less. (LEAD and EEPRP Program cases may not be reclassified.)
Reduce workload by lowering service/contract contact level on appropriate Case Management cases. (This action does not impact “case count” reduction, but may be the only short term option available in remote “Resident Agent” locations.)
Redistribute cases to an administrative caseload (when the case carrying Agents are at caseload maximum) in the following order: Institutional Escapees, INScases, Missing, Minimum Service Designated or In-Custody cases, Case Management cases, within parole unit, preferably at appropriate casework transaction points.
EQUITABLE CASELOAD EXAMPLES
	Case Type	Cases	Multiplier Case	Credit
Caseload #1	Intensive Re-Entry	5	3.50	17.5
	EEPRP	2	3.50	7.0
	Case Management	28	1.00	28.0
			Total	52.5
Caseload #2	Intensive Re-Entry	5	3.50	17.5
	Specialized (PA II)	20	1.75	35.0
			Total	52.5
258
Caseload #3 Intensive Re-Entry	7	3.50	24.5
EEPRP	6	3.50	21.0
Case Management	6	1.00	6.0
Z-Case	1	1.00	1.0
		Total	52.5

H.	Agents may work as two (2) person team(s) with prior supervisory approval.
I.	The Department shall attempt to provide reasonable advance notice of scheduled mandatory training.
19.04 CDC PA Standby
A.	Standby is defined as an assignment whereby a PA must remain physically and geographically able to respond when contacted by telephone or electronic paging device. The assignment shall be in addition to the Agent’s normal work schedule.
The State will determine when and where standby assignments and back-up Agents’ assignments will be made. The Parole Agent will be notified in writing at least three (3) working days prior to the start of the standby assignment. Operational needs may prevent the State from notifying the Parole Agent of the standby assignment three (3) working days prior to the assignment, however, the Parole Agent shall be notified in writing prior to the start of the standby assignment.
266
B.	Any time a PA is on standby, he/she shall receive two (2) hours of compensation per day (straight time pay).
19.05 CDC PA Caseload Audits
A.	PA IIIs will complete all audits/roster reconciliations. The person performing the audit must, within ten (10) work days of the completion of the audit, provide to that PA a written summary of the audit. This will include deficiencies, requirements that are waived as a result of excessive caseload, and all departmentally-recognized absences, and those areas that the PA is performing to expectations or higher.
B.	Grievances under this section may be grieved according to Article VI of this MOU but shall only be arbitrable under the mini-arb process described in Section 6.13.
C.	This provision shall only apply to P&CSD PAs.
19.06 CDC PA Workload
A. All PAs I and II shall have full workload responsibilities and shall perform all duties specified as part of their regular assignment. The workload responsibilities of case-carrying PAs are specified in Appendix Item #8.
B. On the first of each month, the unit supervisor will use the unit workload summary to review the workload assigned. Within a parole unit, the range in workload points will not exceed twenty (20) points between agents. Effective January 1, 2001, the standard Agent workload is one hundred sixtyeight (168) points., Parole Agent II one hundred twenty-six (126) points. Effective July 1, 2001, the standard workload for Parole Agent I will be one hundred sixty-two (162) points, Parole Agent II one hundred twenty-two (122) points; effective July 1, 2002, the standard workload for Parole Agent I will be one hundred sixty (160) points, Parole Agent II one hundred twenty (120) points; effective July 1, 2003, the standard workload for Parole Agent I will be one hundred fifty-eight (158) points, Parole Agent II one hundred nineteen (119) points; effec
267
tive July 1, 2004, the Parole Agent I standard workload will be one hundred fifty-four (154) points, Parole Agent II one hundred sixteen (116) points.
On the tenth (10th) and twentieth (20th) of each month, the workload adjustments will be completed. If it is not possible to reduce the Agent’s workload by reclassifying or transferring cases, the supervisor shall provide workload adjustments in writing by:
1.	Modifying case supervision specifications; or
2.	Authorizing paid overtime; or
3.	A combination of the above.
It is clearly understood that the State has discretion to determine which of the above options to select. Within a parole unit, the range in workload points will not exceed twenty (20) points between agents.
C. If workload adjustments have not occurred under the provision of paragraph B., CCPOA may file a grievance directly to Step 2 of the grievance process. If the Agent is not satisfied with the grievance response, the grievance may be filed at mini-arb under the provisions of Section 6.13 of Article VI of this MOU. Should CCPOA request the payment of overtime, any arbitrator’s award shall be limited to actual hours worked by the employee to accomplish work in the work period(s). This shall not preclude payment for other ordered overtime.
D.	Additional work/special assignments outside of the Agent’s caseload such as, speakers bureau, special assignments or caseload coverage due to sick/ vacation leave may be given to any Agent. If the additional work/special assignments are given to an Agent whose workload exceeds the standard workload, the Agent will be authorized an hour for each point over the standard workload. If any Agent is below the standard workload, and is given additional duties, the agent will be authorized a point for each hour and will be compensated for actual hours worked in the work period(s) pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
268
E.	The PA II Specialist, will be assigned seventy-five percent (75%) of the average Agent workload in the unit, regardless of supervision classification. If the additional work/administrative assignments are given to a Parole Agent II whose workload exceeds the standard workload, the Parole Agent II will be authorized an hour for each point over the standard workload. The remaining twenty-five percent (25%) of available time in a work period will be administrative duties. The twenty-five percent (25% of the administrative duties may include, but will not be limited to the following: case reviews, sign reports, assignment of RPSs, TIRs, transfers, balance the workload summaries, serve as the lead training agent, and attend meetings. Hours worked in an administrative capacity that exceed twenty-five percent (25%) in a work period shall entitle the Parole Agent II to hours worked under FLSA.
The following responsibilities cannot be delegated to PA II Specialists: employee grievances, employee evaluations, adverse actions, letters of instruction, performance reports. This provision shall not be circumvented by calling the Parole Agent by another title such as: “Agent in Charge” or “Lead Agent.”
F.	This section will expire July 1, 2004.
19.07 CDC PA’s Use of State Vehicles
Assigned state vehicles for home storage for all CDC PAs I, II and Parole Service Associates (PSA) assigned to institution-based revocation units, gang coordinators, jail liaison duties, INS/Deport Units, non-case carrying re-entry duties, Interstate Unit, Regional/Parole Headquarters, administrative or special assignments shall be subject to local agreements in each region.
A.	State vehicles may be made available for those parole staff at their work locations for use during the scheduled work day. A parole staff person, with prior supervisory approval, may be permitted temporary overnight home storage of a state vehicle based on workload or operational needs.
269
B.	PAs, with prior supervisory approval, may be authorized to use their private vehicle and be reimbursed for mileage.
C.	Specially funded programs which provide state vehicles for PAs I and II are excluded from this provision.
D.	State vehicles assigned to PAs shall have adequate trunk space to accommodate safety equipment. Depending on the availability of a vehicle with adequate trunk space, PAs currently assigned flexible fuel vehicles shall have the option of exchanging them.
E.	PAs will not be held liable for safety equipment stored in the passenger compartment of the flexible fuel vehicle that does not provide adequate storage space.
ARTICLE XX
CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS
20.01 Correctional Counselor Work Hours
A.	The normal work schedule for Correctional Counselors shall be either a four (4) day or five (5) day work week, Monday through Friday up to a maximum of twelve (12) hours per day. The Counselor may deviate from the normal work days or hours with prior supervisory approval.
B.	Each Correctional Counselor shall submit a work schedule to the supervisor for each work period at least seven (7) calendar days, but no more than fourteen (14) calendar days, prior to the beginning of each work period. Schedules must reflect a total of one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours for the twenty-eight (28) day work period. In submitting his/her schedule for supervisory approval, each Correctional Counselor will propose whether or not he/she will take a lunch break during the period of time which is covered by that schedule. The supervisor shall approve the work schedule at least three (3) days prior to the scheduled work period, provided it meets the Correctional Counselor’s duties, responsibilities and institutional need, and
270
the definition of a normal work schedule as identified in paragraph A. above. If a requested work schedule is denied, the reasons for the denial will be given to the employee in writing. All denials must be based on case circumstances specific to a counselor’s duties rather than “blanket denials.” If the Counselor does not submit a work schedule, the supervisor will assign the work schedule.
C.	Current daytime schedules will be maintained unless deviation therefrom is mutually agreed to by the supervisor and employee. The institution may require Correctional Counselors, excluding camp counselors, working a given unit (on a non-overtime basis) to work up to one (1) evening per week (up to 8:30 p.m.) based on legitimate institutional program needs. Evening work is defined as those hours worked after 6:00 p.m. None of this precludes scheduled or unscheduled overtime work.
D.	The supervisor may occasionally require a work schedule change for events that were not originally foreseen when the work schedule was originally submitted. This might occasionally include evening work or a weekend day based on legitimate institutional program needs. The supervisor shall give a seven (7) calendar day prior notice for this temporary change.
E.	Employee-requested changes in the work schedule will require supervisory approval.
20.02 Correctional Counselor Workload
A.	CDC shall provide equitable workload assignments
for all Correctional Counselors within an institution. The status of Correctional Counselor workload assignments shall be monitored by management, and appropriate steps will be taken to balance the workload. Management shall authorize overtime, when necessary, or a reasonable accommodation will be made to avoid unrealistic work expectations. The Correctional Counselor I can request an accommodation in writing, and the Department has seven (7) calendar days to respond in writing. Management will reasonably accommodate by rescheduling his/her normal duties at another time,
271
reassigning the duties to another Correctional Counselor, or authorizing overtime when a need exists.
Correctional Counselors utilized for short-term acting assignments which preclude them from performing their full range of normal duties shall be reasonably accommodated by rescheduling the normal duties at another time, reassigning the duties to another Correctional Counselor, or authorizing overtime when a critical need exists.
B.	The State shall fill vacant positions and/or new positions in a timely manner.
C.	In order to increase inmate access to counselors, Correctional Counselors shall be able to ducat inmates for classification and other related casework subject to administrative approval.
20.03 Post and Bid by Seniority for Correctional Counselor I
A.	There shall be seventy percent (70%) of each institution’s budgeted CC-I positions assigned by Unit 6 seniority. Once a CC-I successfully bids for a seniority assignment, he/she shall not be eligible to bid again for a twelve (12) month period. An employee who bids to a lock-up unit cannot remain longer that two (2) years without a management waiver.
B.	In order to remain in the seniority position of choice, the employee must maintain a satisfactory level of performance.
1.	Once a bid position becomes vacant, if there is no interest in the vacant “seniority” position, management shall fill the assignment by existing rules, policies and practices. For those positions retained by management, existing rules, policies, and practices, with regard to filling vacancies, shall remain in effect.
2.	Nothing in this section shall diminish management’s right to carry out departmental goals and objectives nor interfere with management’s rights to meet operational
272
needs. The afore-stated will not be done in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
3.	Employees who laterally transfer may bid on any vacant seniority position.
4.	After an employee completes the apprenticeship program, s/he can bid on any vacant seniority position.
C.	When an employee requests, local management may approve an exemption to the time frames in paragraph A. above. This will only be done on an exception basis.
D.	A legitimate reason to change a seniority bid would be if the CC-I bid position became a special needs unit requiring specific knowledge, skills, and training for casework.
1.	The local Chief Job Steward and the affected employee must be notified in writing prior to the change as to the specific reasons for the change. The bid employee will have the first right of refusal for special training to do the special needs casework; therefore, no change would be necessary.
2.	The affected employee may either: (a) remain in the position, (b) bid to a vacant seniority bid position, or (c) request placement and be placed in a management position. If the affected employee accepts the management position, then the bid position reverts to management until the employee returns to another bid position.
E.	Upon initial implementation, the Warden/hiring authority and the Chapter President will meet and come to an agreement on the positions available for bid.
1.	The bid forms will be available by March 1, 2002.
2.	The bid forms are due to management by March 31, 2002.
3.	Job changes will be posted by April 15, 2002.
273
F.	Disputes
All disputes concerning PPPA issues that cannot be resolved by local levels shall be directed to the Joint Labor/Management Committee.
G.	No later than April 15, 2002, all facilities will have completed the post and bid process for CC-Is.

The Department will prepay for an RN licensure course through the New York State Regents or an equivalent program acceptable to the RN Licensing Board at the MTA’s option and departmental approval. This will be afforded to all MTAs who do not currently possess an RN license and will subsidize the thirty (30) unit course at an approximate cost of up to $3,200 per MTA. If the MTA fails to complete the course, they will be expected to repay the entire cost of the course.
C.	CYA agrees to assist in adjusting work schedules for MTAs who are assigned rotating, irregular shifts (i.e., VR, PIE) in order to accommodate any testing requirement of the New York State Regents course or equivalent, and the National Council Licensure Examination.

Each IPA and Casework Specialist shall submit to the supervisor for approval a monthly work period schedule, seven (7) work days prior to the beginning of each work period. All IPAs and Casework Specialists may schedule one (1) Late-night shift per work period schedule, which shall end no later than 7PM. Any changes in the work schedules, excluding emergencies, will require prior supervisory approval. IPAs and Casework Specialists will advise the supervisor of emergency changes no later than the next work day. If the IPA or Casework Specialist does not submit a work period schedule, the supervisor shall schedule his/her work hours. The schedule shall reflect those hours of work needed to provide the necessary level of service for such concerns as classification, ward/ inmate contact, programs, custody and other routine or special assignments appropriate to the IPA and Casework Specialist classification and responsibilities.
B.	All IPAs and Casework Specialists may schedule at least one (1) four-ten-forty (4/10/40) work week per month.

CYA YOUTH CORRECTIONAL COUNSELORS AND
YOUTH CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS
24.01 CYA Living Unit
The existing practice concerning hand-held radios shall continue at each facility/institution.
A.	Each living unit will be assigned at least two (2) hand-held radios, with the necessary charging equipment.
B.	The State will arrange to have enough radios available so that during each movement away from a living unit the Youth Correctional Counselor assigned to that movement can be issued a handheld radio.
24.02 Youth Correctional Counselor/Shift Duties
Employees shall receive Post Orders and Duty Statements annually at the time of performance appraisal.
24.03 Youth Correctional Counselor Workload A. The Youth Correctional Counselor caseload will normally be eleven (11) wards. Youth Correctional Counselors shall, with prior approval from the supervisor, handle excess workload and caseload assignments on an overtime basis.
B.	Youth Correctional Counselor Workload:
1.	CYA will establish a casework plan for each institution with Youth Correctional Counselors (YCC) which includes a formal casework schedule, identification of formalized casework responsibilities, a process for weekly verification of casework time, and definition of casework roles for the YCC, Senior Youth Correctional Counselor (SYCC), and IPA.
2.	Each institution, by living unit, will establish a monthly small group and casework schedule for each YCC. It is understood the amount of casework time relief may vary based on the
282
level of formalized casework required during a given month.
3.	YCC casework will be prioritized at all institutions and camps operated by CYA. There are many potential casework priorities. Each YCC and his/her SYCC have a responsibility to discuss and evaluate specific casework priorities on a weekly basis. If there are any doubts on priority, the SYCC will make a final prioritization of specified casework assignments.

4.	SYCC will provide a daily schedule of preassigned casework and small group time for the living unit.
5.	It will be the SYCC’s responsibility to provide the YCC with sufficient opportunity to use the assigned casework and small group time to complete his/her formalized casework.
6.	YCCs and SYCCs will meet to discuss casework needs and modify the schedules monthly. By the 25th day of each calendar month, the IPA and SYCC must inform each YCC who provides casework to the PA, what reports and other casework are due between zero and thirty (0-30) calendar days from the beginning of the upcoming calendar month and what reports and other casework are due between thirty-one (31) and sixty (60) calendar days from the beginning of the upcoming calendar month. The YCC will provide the SYCC with an estimate of how much casework time the YCC needs during the next month.
284
7.	Using a negotiated format, the YCC will verify his/her ability to use casework time on a daily basis. A Casework Verification Form (CVF), is an example of such a verification sheet.
8.	On a weekly basis, the SYCC will assess the availability of casework time for the YCCs. Regardless of the reason for the lost time, all lost time is to be replaced within two (2) calendar weeks or ten (10) work days.
9.	The appropriate Treatment Team Supervisor (TTS) will review the assignment and availability of casework every two (2) weeks as recorded on the CVF. The TTS will monitor the effort to provide an equitable distribution of casework time and, where available and necessary, casework relief coverage to all YCCs.
10.	Each Superintendent will provide, upon request, the local CCPOA Chapter President or a designee, copies of the CVF, living unit schedules, and negotiated assignment and verification sheets to substantiate the allocation of formalized casework time. These documents shall be maintained for a period of one (1) year, and made available to the Chief Job Steward to copy in cases of dispute.
11.	The parties agree to establish local Forms Management Committees to review the paperwork currently required as part of the YCC’s overall casework responsibilities. They will make every effort to ensure the casework process is efficient and timely.
C.	For casework purposes, YCCs will be permitted to hold back or have brought to them wards who are assigned in school and trade. Since casework is an integral part of the CYA program, casework will be considered part of the CYA’s educational and rehabilitative program.
The Program Manager will monitor all hold-backs or callbacks to ensure that they do not impact on required attendance or the function of any work/ trade program. The Program Manager will not arbitrarily and capriciously withhold approval.
285
D.	It is recognized that a committee is currently evaluating the staffing patterns for the living units. Should that committee’s recommendations impact this section, the parties agree to re-open this section.
24.04 CYA Staffing/Ward Population
CYA agrees that institutional population will be distributed and balanced in a manner that will provide for optimum staff and ward safety while maintaining a full range of program services given operational needs and constraints. For purposes of counting posts, the first watch YCO(s) do/does not count as a post and SYCCs, absent regular day off relief, are considered in post. However, effective July 1, 2002 and continuing each July 1 for the life of the MOU, the CYA agrees to phase in the equivalent of 56 YCC’s (this includes YCO’s and Clinic living Units) PY’s for the purpose of adding SYCC’s (this includes Clinic living unit Sergeants) Regular Day Off (RDO) relief into the posting pattern. The 56 PY’s are in addition to any existing SYCC’s RDO relief. CYA agrees to phase in the SYCC’s RDO relief in equal numbers with priority given in the following order: Open Dorm Living Units, SMP’s, Clinics, Drug Programs, Single Room Living Units, all other programs. For the purpose of counting posts, as the SYCC’s RDO relief is activated, it shall be considered part of the posting pattern.
A.	CYA agrees that open dorms shall be staffed in the following manner:
Population
Open Dorm
Living Units
50 (§12.08(c):	46	- 55)	5	Post
60 (§12.08(c):	56	- 65)	6	Post
70 (§12.08(c):	66	- 75)	6	Post
80 (§12.08(c):	76	- 85)	7	Post
90 (§12.08(c):	86	- 95)	8	Post
100 (§12.08(c): 96 - 105)	9 Post
286
B.	The Youth Authority agrees that housing units containing individual rooms shall be staffed in the following manner:
Population
Single Room
Living Units
50 (§12.08(c):	46	- 55)	4	Post
60 (§12.08(c):	56	- 65)	5	Post
70 (§12.08(c):	66	- 75)	6	Post
80 (§12.08(c):	76	- 85)	7	Post
90 (§12.08(c):	86	- 95)	7	Post
100 (§12.08(c): 96 - 105)	8 Post
C.	In order to enhance safety, CYA agrees to place wards on living units in a manner which maximizes YCC posting patterns and is based on the wards age and individual program needs. To this extent, management agrees not to assign incoming wards to a unit that is at the break point of 65 in open dorms and 85 in single rooms until all units of like age and/or programming are at the same break point. However, should a ward pose such a safety concern, such as, a threat or/and assault on staff or a safety concern to other wards or self, management may place such a ward(s) in a manner, which is safer and more secure for staff and wards. It is not the intent of the Department to contravene A. and B. above. CYA will not use “sleepers,” “wards in transition,” “contract wards” or any other device to artificially lower the population on any living unit. To this end to ensure harmonious labor relations, the CYA agrees, if so requested by the local Chapter President, that the Daily Movement Sheet as well as any other population, movement justification and/or ward accountability documents(s) shall be provided (in a timely manner), to satisfy that the ward placement and movement is being accomplished to enhance safety and is not being done in an arbitrary and or capricious manner. Grievances filed by CCPOA citing that wards are being placed in an arbitrary and/or capricious manner may be elevated through the miniarbitration process. When CYA lists a ward on a living unit roster, that ward is on the living unit population for purposes of YCC posting. Wards on court furlough statues are not on living unit rosters for
287
purposes of this section. For living unit count increases beyond those illustrated within 24.04 A and 24.04 B, the methodology of increases by increments of ten (10) shall be continued for the purposes of adding additional YCC/YCO Post(s) to relevant units(s).
D.	CYA agrees to notice and Meet and Confer with CCPOA over the impact of overcrowding as it relates to the utilization of nontraditional living areas for the housing of wards. This will also include meeting and conferring over the impact of overcrowding when any housing unit experiences overcrowding of one hundred ninety percent (190%) or more.
E.	If management violates this section, the employee(s) on the overtime by seniority list who was/were eligible for the post assignment(s) will be awarded six (6) hours of overtime (nine [9] hours pay).
F.	CYA agrees that the minimum staffing will be 5 posts for an Open Dorm Living Unit and 4 posts for Single Room Living Unit. In the event that the Department of Finance or the Legislature impose a significant budget reduction, CYA retains the right to modify the staffing levels described in this section and will provide appropriate notice to CCPOA and will Meet and Confer with CCPOA.
G.	CYA agrees to Meet and Confer with CCPOA within ninety (90) days of the ratification of this MOU to establish post patterns for all staff assigned to institution-based camps. The scope of this Meet and Confer shall also include post assignment schedules, post orders, YCC caseload assignments and PIE scheduling. (See Appendix Item #12) It is recognized that a committee is currently evaluating the staffing patterns for the living units. Should that committee recommendations impact this section, the parties agree to re-open this section.
24.05 Post and Bid by Seniority for YCCs
A.	There shall be seventy percent (70%) of the YCC assignments in CYA allotted according to seniority. Once a YCC successfully bids for a seniority
288
assignment, he/she shall not be eligible to bid again for a twelve (12) month period. An employee who bids to a lock-up unit cannot remain longer than two (2) years without a management waiver. Staff bidding to the Intensive Treatment Programs, Sex Offender Programs (SOP) and Special Counseling Programs (SCP) shall make a commitment of at least two years.
B.	In order to remain in the shift assignment of choice, the senior employee must maintain a satisfactory level of performance.
If there is no interest in the vacant “seniority” shift assignment, management shall fill the assignment by existing rules, policies, and practices. For those shift assignments retained by management, existing rules, policies, and practices, with regard to filling vacancies, shall remain in effect.
Management shall have the discretion to review and re-designate the selected shift assignments. Nothing in this section shall diminish management’s right to carry out departmental goals and objectives nor interfere with management’s rights to meet operational needs in making shift assignments. The afore-stated will not be done in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
CYA agrees not to alter existing “day off” patterns, unless the Chapter President and the Appointing Authority mutually agree to do so.
C. If the local CCPOA Chief Job Steward is a YCC, the Department will hold one (1) seniority second watch assignment with Saturdays and Sundays off vacant for that Chief Job Steward or the Chief Job Steward may use “super seniority” to bid upon any available post. In the event the Chief Job Steward uses “super seniority” to bid upon an available post, the second watch assignment with Saturdays and Sundays off held vacant will revert to conditional bid.
D.	When an employee requests, local management may approve an exemption to the time frames in paragraph A. above. This will only be done on an exception basis.
289
E.	In the event the employer has a legitimate reason to change a seniority bid, the following will occur:
1.	The local Chief Job Steward and the impacted employee must be notified in writing prior to the change as to the specific reasons for the change.
2.	The impacted employee may either: (a) remain in the position, (b) bid to a vacant seniority bid position, or (c) request placement and be placed in a management position with the same RDOs and substantially similar start and stop times as the employee’s original bid position. In this latter case, the employee may not remain in the management position longer than twelve (12) months without prior management approval.
F.	No later than April 1, 2002, all facilities with the ITP, SOP, SCP units will have completed the post and bid implementation process for YCCs.
24.06 YCC Voluntary Demotion
YCCs shall be able to apply for vacant YCO positions within their institution/facility consistent with the seniority provisions contained in this MOU. Demotion to YCO shall be effective on the date the YCC is awarded the YCO post.
24.07 CYA Incident Debriefing
Designated management or supervisory staff will interview affected staff immediately following the settling of any major incident or disturbance within one and one-half (1 ) hours of the incident, and no later than the end of the shift. The purpose of this interview will be to assess whether the affected staff has undergone any negative impact. If, in the supervisor’s opinion, the affected staff has undergone a negative impact, it will be the responsibility of the designated manager or supervisor to refer that employee to the appropriate agency, or provider of the necessary services.
24.08 PIE Usage Behind YCCs
When a PIE is assigned YCC casework relief, supervisory staff should not be permitted to use the PIE to be relieved from their (the supervisor’s) duties.
290
24.09 Post Assignment by Seniority for YCOs
A.	There shall be seventy percent (70%) of the YCO post assignments in CYA allotted according to seniority. Once a YCO successfully bids for a seniority assignment, he/she shall not be eligible to bid again for a twelve (12) month period of time.
B.	In order to remain in the post assignment of choice, the senior employee must maintain a satisfactory level of performance.
If there is no interest in the vacant “seniority” post assignment, management shall fill the assignment by existing rules, policies, and practices. For those post assignments retained by management, existing rules, policies, and practices, with regard to filling vacancies, shall remain in effect.
Management shall have the discretion to review and re-designate the selected post assignments. Nothing in this section shall diminish management’s right to carry out departmental goals and objectives nor interfere with management’s rights to meet operational needs in making post assignments. The afore-stated will not be done in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
CYA agrees not to alter existing “day off” patterns, unless the local Chapter President and the Appointing Authority mutually agree to do so.
C. If the local CCPOA Chief Job Steward is a YCO, the Department will hold one (1) seniority second watch assignment with Saturdays and Sundays off vacant for that Chief Job Steward or the Chief Job Steward may use “super seniority” to bid upon any available post. In the event the Chief Job Steward uses “super seniority” to bid upon an available post, the second watch assignment with Saturdays and Sundays off held vacant will revert to conditional bid.
D. In the event the employer has a legitimate reason to change a seniority bid, the following will occur:
1.	The local Chief Job Steward and the impacted employee must be notified in writing prior to the change as to the specific reasons for the change.
291
2.	The impacted employee may either: (a) remain in the position, (b) bid to a vacant seniority bid position, or (c) request placement and be placed in a management position with the same RDOs and substantially similar start and stop times as the employee’s original bid position. In this latter case, the employee may not remain in the management position longer than twelve (12) months without prior management approval.
24.10 Ward Medication
A.	CYA agrees to pursue funding to eliminate all direct or indirect dispensing of medication by YCOs or YCCs.
B.	Until such funding is appropriated, the Department will continue to implement unit dose packaging and delivery where available and will assure that medication is properly packaged and labeled in every setting.
C.	CYA/CCPOA agree to form a quarterly working committee to oversee the unit dose delivery system and resolve any problems until an alternate system is implemented.
ARTICLE XXV CAMPS
25.01 CDC/CYA Camp Files
A.	The State will provide a copy of an employee’s personnel file via the US Postal Service mail process upon his/her request.
B.	The State will ensure that the supervisory file will be maintained at the camp to which the employee is currently assigned. These files will be maintained in a central location under lock and key and accessible to the employee at his/her request.
25.02 CDC Continuous Hours of Work/Dead Time/Emergencies
A.	Section 11.03 shall not apply to camp officers during emergencies. Once an officer has returned to
292
the camp from an extended emergency (three [3] days and over), the officer shall be afforded one (1) hour to complete all paperwork and clean and repack equipment in order to be ready for the next fire. If, at that point, the officer has put in sixteen (16) or more continuous hours of work, the Department representative shall ask the officer if he/she is able to complete the officer’s shift. If not, the officer shall be allowed to go home and have at least an eight (8) hour break. If the officer feels that the officer can complete that shift, the officer shall be allowed to do so and then be allowed the eight (8) hour break.
B.	In the event that an employee has been involuntarily ordered over and works more than sixteen (16) hours in camp, the employee will be given an eight (8) hour break. If the eight (8) hour break extends into the employee’s next regularly scheduled shift, the employee shall receive paid administrative time off for the hours of the break that extended into the shift.
ARTICLE XXVI PERMANENT INTERMITTENT APPOINTMENTS
26.01 Permanent Intermittent Appointments
A.	A Permanent Intermittent appointment is an appointment in which the employee is to work periodically or for a fluctuating portion of the full-time work schedule. A Permanent Intermittent Employee (PIE) may work up to two thousand (2,000) hours in any calendar year.
The number of hours and schedule of work shall be determined based upon the operational needs of each department. he State will make every effort to offer each PIE, not otherwise employed by the State, an average of one hundred (100) hours of work per pay period provided that work is available and the employee is ready, willing, and able to work as needed. The employer is not obligated to offer any hours to a PIE who holds or secures a full-time appointment with any State agency.
293
B.	Each department may establish an exclusive pool of PIEs based upon operational need.
1.	Each department will endeavor to provide PIEs reasonable advance notice of their work schedule.
C.	Availability to Work
1.	Except in camp settings, PIEs must be available to work all available shifts.
2.	PIEs may be assigned regular days off, to a specific watch or area, except by local agreement or when an institutional need arises.
3.	In CDC, work assignments will be offered to PIEs based on an alphabetical rotational basis.
4.	In CDC, PIEs may be assigned to a post in two (2) week increments. PIEs assigned to these posts will be rotated using the continuous alphabetical listing every two (2) weeks.
5.	In CDC, once a PIE accepts work or refuses to work, or contact with the employee was unsuccessful, the employee will not be offered another assignment until his/her name reappears on the alphabetical rotation list.
6.	Any refusal to work other than for reasons of verified illness (self or family), jury duty, or military obligations constitutes a waiver.
7.	Definitions:
a.	Contact: Verbal contact with the PIE or other adult living at the PIE’s address, a page, or message left on voice mail or an answering machine.
b.	Waiver: Verbal refusal by the employee to work when offered a work assignment. Failure to respond to an electronic page, voice mail message, or answering machine message does not constitute a waiver.
8.	Only three (3) waivers in a twelve (12) month period are permitted. The fourth waiver to ac
294
cept a work assignment within a twelve (12) month period may result in non-punitive termination proceedings.
D.	Nonavailability
1.	Upon request, the Appointing Authority may grant a PIE a period of nonavailability not to exceed twelve (12) months during which the employee shall not be charged with a waiver. Nonavailability may be granted based on the employee’s enrollment in an educational program or hardship based on a documented family health care problem.
2.	Approved nonavailability status may impact the hours of work available to the employee.
3.	The period of nonavailability may be revoked based on operational needs.
4.	An employee on nonavailability status who files for unemployment insurance benefits shall be immediately removed from such status.
E.	The Appointing Authority or designee may grant a PIE limited availability.
F.	A PIE earns one (1) “qualifying pay period” for every one hundred sixty (160) hours of paid employment in a monthly pay period or accumulated pay periods. The hours of paid employment in excess of one hundred sixty (160) hours in a monthly pay period shall not be counted or accumulated. When an employee has a break in service or changes to full-time, any combination of time worked which does not equal one (1) qualifying pay period of fulltime service shall not be counted or accumulated.
G.	Retirement
A PIE qualifies for retirement membership after working one thousand (1,000) hours in a fiscal year (July I through June 30). All hours paid in a pay period are credited toward retirement membership eligibility.
After accruing one thousand (1,000) hours in a fiscal year, a portion of each employee’s monthly pay
295
is deducted and put into the retirement fund. In addition, the State contributes an amount on an employee’s behalf each month according to a formula.
H.	Each department will establish a date by which its PIEs shall receive their regular pay.
I.	All remaining conditions of employment that relate to the employee shall be administered in accordance with applicable rules and regulations, unless modified by this MOU.
J.	Change in Time Base to Full-Time
1.	To be considered for a change in time base, the PIE must:
a.	Be eligible for a change in time base pursuant to SPB Rule 277, or be reachable on the CO eligibility list; and
b.	Have a satisfactory performance evaluation for the prior six (6) month period or term of service, whichever is shortest. Satisfactory performance is an overall average of standard or above on the employee’s most recent performance evaluation.
2.	Once eligibility is determined, appointments to full-time positions will be made in accordance with Bargaining Unit 6 Institutional Seniority. Tie breakers shall be made in the following order:
a.	Total Bargaining Unit 6 Seniority;
b.	Score on CO Eligibility List;
c.	Last four digits of the Social Security Number (ascending order).
K.	The number of PIEs in the classification of CO at each institution in CDC as a general rule, will not exceed twelve percent (12%) of the institutions’ budgetarily-authorized CO position count. The cap may be exceeded, upon discussion with the local CCPOA Chapter President due to the following:
296
1.	Change in status is requested by employee in writing and approved by the Appointing Authority to go from Permanent Full-Time to Permanent Intermittent.
2.	When a PIE has requested in writing and has been approved by the Appointing Authority to work less than the full number of hours available to all PIEs at the institution. This exception applies when the employee works less than one hundred (100) hours.
3.	Where the institution is authorized to conduct an activity or program and has been funded for said activity or program in lieu of PYs. In most instances this would be a temporary situation pending submittal and approval of a Budget Change Proposal.
4.	Assignment of PIEs from the Academy when: (a) the PIE was not requested by the Appointing Authority, or (b) the PIE was requested but the need for the PIE no longer exists.
5.	Where a deactivation has occurred resulting in an overage of Permanent Full-Time Employees.
6.	A PIE who has declined an offer of full-time employment may not be included as an exception as it applies to K. 1., and K. 4., above.
No PIE shall be subject to an involuntary transfer or layoff as a result of implementation of this section.
Where the cap has been exceeded and the reason for it no longer exists, the institution will meet with the local CCPOA Chapter President to discuss a plan to return to the authorized level.
Disputes concerning this section shall first be brought to the attention of the Warden or designee within ten (10) calendar days of having knowledge of the alleged violation. After a face-to-face meeting with the Warden, the Warden will respond to the local Chapter President within ten (10) calendar days.
If not satisfied with the Warden’s response, the matter may be appealed to the Regional Administrator within five (5) calendar days of receipt of the response. The
297
Regional Administrator shall review all appeals at a monthly meeting, if requested by the Union. Otherwise, the Regional Administrator shall respond to the Union within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the appeal.
If not satisfied with the response of the Regional Administrator, the Union may appeal to the Director as the final level of appeal via the Chief Deputy Director within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the response. The Director has the right to determine the remedy should there be a determination that a violation has occurred.
The established timelines may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties.
Any modification of the statewide cap in this section is subject to the notification process in accordance with Section 27.01, Entire Agreement.
26.02 Minimum Work Time for Intermittent
Employees
A.	When an intermittent employee is offered an assignment of less than four (4) hours, the employee may decline the assignment without the refusal being counted as a waiver under Section 26.01. Employees declining an assignment shall maintain their position on the hire list.
B.	Anytime an intermittent is ordered to work, the employee shall be credited with a minimum of four (4) hours of work. For the purposes of this section, “ordered to work” is defined as any offer of work that, if declined, would constitute a waiver under Section 26.01 of the MOU.

DPA RULES/TITLE 2, ARTICLE 29 Article 29, Substance Abuse
599.960.	General Policy
(a)	It is the purpose of this Article to help ensure that the State workplace is free from the effects of drug and alcohol abuse. These provisions shall be in addition to and shall not be construed as a required prerequisite to or as replacing, limiting or setting standards for any other types of provisions available under law to serve this purpose, including employee assistance, adverse action and medical examination.
(b)	Consistent with Government Code Section 19572 and Governor’s Executive Order D-58-86, no state employee who is on duty or on standby for duty shall:
1.	Use, possess, or be under the influence of illegal or unauthorized drugs or other illegal mind-altering substances; or
2.	Use or be under the influence of alcohol to any extent that would impede the employee’s ability to perform his or her duties safely and effectively.
A-13
(c)	Employees serving in sensitive positions shall be subject to drug and alcohol testing, hereinafter referred to as substance testing, as provided in this Article when there is reasonable suspicion that the employee has violated subsection (b). In addition, when such an employee has already been found in violation of subsection (b) through the adverse action or medical examination processes under the Civil Service Act (Government Code Section 19253.5; Government Code Sections 1957019593), as a result of substance testing under this article, or by the employee’s own admission, the employee may be required to submit to periodic substance testing as a condition of remaining in or returning to State employment. Unless otherwise provided in the settlement of an adverse action the period for this testing shall not exceed one (1) year.
(d)	No employee shall perform duties which, because of drugs taken under a legal prescription, the employee cannot perform without posing a threat to the health or safety of the employee or others. Employees whose job performance is so restricted may be subject to reassignment, medical examination or other actions specified by applicable statutes and regulations.

599.961.	Sensitive Positions.
(a)	For the purposes of this Article, sensitive positions are Peace Officer positions, as defined by Section 830 of the Penal Code, and other positions in which drug or alcohol affected performance could clearly endanger the health and safety of others. These other positions have the following general characteristics:
1.	Their duties involve a greater than normal level of trust, responsibility for or impact on the health and safety of others; and
A-14
2.	Errors in judgment, inattentiveness or diminished coordination, dexterity or composure while performing their duties could clearly result in mistakes that would endanger the health and safety of others; and
3.	Employees in these positions work with such independence, or, perform such tasks that it cannot be safely assumed that mistakes such as those described in 2. could be prevented by a supervisor or another employee.
(b)	Filled positions shall be identified as sensitive through the following process:
1.	Subject to DPA approval, each Appointing Authority shall identify the positions under his/ her jurisdiction that meet the standards in (a).
2.	The employees serving in the identified positions and, where applicable, their union representatives, shall receive an initial notice that the position has been identified as sensitive and shall be given thirty (30) days to respond.
3.	After considering responses to the initial notice and meeting with employee representatives as required by the Ralph C. Dills Act (Government Code Sections 3512-3524), DPA shall issue a final notice to the employees serving in the positions that have been identified as sensitive. This notice shall include a description of the provisions of this Article. Existing practices in this area shall not change for any position until sixty (60) days after the final notice concerning it is issued.
(c)	Vacant positions shall be identified as sensitive through the procedures specified in (b), including those procedures involving employee organizations, except that the employee notification provisions as stated in (b)2. and (b)3. shall not apply.
(d)	Once a position has been designated sensitive, the Appointing Authority shall take measures to reasonably and likely ensure that future appointees to it are aware that it is sensitive and are informed of the provisions of this Article.

599.962.	Reasonable Suspicion.
(a)	Reasonable suspicion is the good faith belief based on specific articulable facts or evidence that an employee may have violated the policy prescribed in section 599.960(b) and that substance testing could reveal evidence related to that violation.
(b)	For the purposes of this Article, reasonable suspicion will exist only after the Appointing Authority or his/her designee has considered the facts and/ or evidence in the particular case and agrees that they constitute a finding of reasonable suspicion. A designee shall be an individual other than the suspected employee’s immediate supervisor and other than the person who made the initial observation leading to the question of reasonable suspicion. The designee shall be a person who is authorized to act for the Appointing Authority in carrying out this Article and who is thoroughly familiar with its provisions and procedures.
(c)	After it has been confirmed by the designee the facts and/or evidence upon which the reasonable suspicion is based shall be documented in writing. A copy of this shall be given to the affected employee.

(c)	After consulting with expert staff of the laboratory or laboratories selected to perform the testing under this Article, the Department shall set test cutoff levels that will identify positive test samples while minimizing false positive test results.
(d)	Test samples will be collected in a clinical setting such as a laboratory collection station, doctor’s office, hospital or clinic or in another setting approved by the Department on the basis that it provides for at least an equally secure and professional collection process. The Department shall specify procedures to ensure that true samples are obtained.
A-17
(e)	The Department shall specify measures to ensure that a strict chain of custody is maintained for the sample from the time it is taken, through the testing process, to its final disposition.

APPENDIX ITEM #12 — ADDENDUM TO SECTION 7.07 INFECTIOUS DISEASES
CYA
REGARDING BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS CCPOA and CYA have reached a complete and final agreement related to Bloodborne Pathogens. This Agreement is an addendum to the master agreement between the State of California and CCPOA which expires on June 30, 1995.
1.	CYA agrees to complete initial infectious disease training for all staff no later than Janu
A-50
ary 31, 1995. The last of the series of three (3) Hepatitis B vaccinations will be offered to employees by November 1, 1995.
2.	CYA agrees that all medication prescribed to treat bloodborne pathogen infections will be administered/delivered by a licensed health care provider. Single (unit) dosage packaging will be utilized in those locations where delivery of medication by a licensed health care provider is not operationally feasible.
3.	The State agrees to reimburse all employees for receipted, reasonable and necessary costs for the Hepatitis B vaccine series, limited to $60, not reimbursed by their insurance carrier providing the expense occurred between January 1, 1993 and is prior to the implementation of the Hepatitis B vaccination series at their institution.
4.	With the exception of lock-up units and medical units, management will not routinely require Unit 6 members to personally clean-up potentially infectious body fluid spills. When wards are used, they will be properly trained to clean-up potentially infectious body fluids prior to being utilized to clean-up such spills.
Ward clean-up crews will be limited to two wards per staff person and will be under direct supervision of staff from start to finish of the clean-up process.
The intent of this policy is to eliminate exposure to potentially infectious body fluids by ensuring the proper clean-up of body fluid spills.
5.	CYA agrees that all employees’ medical information on bloodborne pathogens will be stored in a secure location which is not accessible to wards, and which ensures confidentiality. Confidentiality for the purpose of this agreement means such confidentiality as required by the doctor-patient relationship but is not to exclude the normal administrative functions necessary for the workers compensation process.
A-51
6.	CYA agrees to develop a statewide policy, which is adaptable to meet local site needs, that minimizes staff handling of ward razors. The policy will be shared with CCPOA Headquarters and the Local CCPOA Chapters for review and discussion, prior to implementation.
CYA agrees to pursue an official determination from Cal/ OSHA regarding the definition of whether used razors are considered “contaminated sharp waste” and the proper method of disposal.
7.	CYA agrees to handle, store, label, and dispose of all biohazardous waste, medical waste, and contaminated sharps (as defined in the Health and Safety Code 25080-25082), in accordance with applicable Health and Safety Codes and Cal/OSHA regulations.
8.	The Department will maintain a “Communicable Disease List” at each facility, institution, camp, and parole office which contains a listing of ward/parolees diagnosed with a life threatening communicable disease (diseases reportable to local health authorities), and the necessary precaution to prevent exposure and infection. This list shall be readily accessible to all employees and volunteers, but inaccessible to wards/parolees. The Communicable Disease List shall be updated as changes occur.
9.	CYA agrees that CCPOA Chief Job Stewards,
Job Stewards, Field Representatives, Legal Staff, or Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), shall have the right to inspect the implementation of this bloodborne pathogen agreement of the Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan. This inspection will include access via a tour by the Superintendent or his/her designee as to where safety equipment is stored, the proper marking for storage of equipment, a review of local training materials that may be used to update staff awareness, or any other relevant information.
A-52
10.	CYA agrees that Bargaining Unit 6 staff will receive two (2) hours of infectious disease control training annually.
11.	CYA recognizes human body fluids identified by the Center for Disease Control as potentially infectious materials. These body fluids include: blood, semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peridoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood.
12.	CYA agrees to provide employees who have been contaminated with a bloodborne pathogen the ability to wash the contaminated areas with soap and water at the worksite, per Cal/OSHA Section 5193(2)(F). CYA also agrees to provide the employee with a change of clothing to be determined by the institu-tion/parole office. Nothing in this agreement will be construed to require the State to construct any new shower facilities.
Where immediate accessibility to hot water is not available, those areas of the institution, camp, field parole, or any other structure or work crew that is under the control of CYA will have antiseptic type towelettes for the cleansing of bodily fluid clean-up of a person.
Immediate for the purpose of this proposal means within five (5) minutes of accessibility to hot running water.
13.	CYA agrees that each local site Administrator will develop policy for handling wards who deliberately expose staff to body fluids or other potentially infectious material. This policy should include placing the ward in a secure detention room and processing through the disciplinary procedure as a Level B disciplinary incident. The reason for this proposal is to help ensure compliance with rules and policies related to exposing individuals to potentially infectious body fluids. If for some reason the Level B charge is dropped or reduced to a Level A charge, the employee/victim will be informed of the reasons why.
A-53
14.	CYA agrees to provide plastic face shields to Unit 6 members who work in high-risk areas, i.e., lockup units.
15.	CYA agrees to provide CCPOA a list of the Department’s health care staff charged with custodial responsibilities of employee medical files. When changes to this list occur, CCPOA will be provided an updated listing.
16.	Each Field PA shall be given the following:
a)	One (1) pair of gloves
b)	One (1) Red Bag
c)	One (1) twist tie
17.	Each Field PA who is certified to administer CPR shall be provided with a CPR mask with a one-way valve per Cal/OSHA.
18.	The State agrees to develop and provide a list of recommended cleaners/disinfectants which effectively kill bloodborne pathogens and a description of the situations in which each Agent is to be utilized. These recommendations will be updated as technology and products become available. Recommendations will be forwarded to all facilities and CCPOA headquarters.
19.	CYA is committed to supporting and protecting staff from wards who would intentionally contaminate staff or other persons with body fluids capable of transmitting potentially fatal infectious disease.
CYA will take pro-active steps to ensure wards compliance with current laws related to incidents of wards’ deliberately contaminating staff with potentially infectious body fluids. In cases where a ward intentionally contaminates a staff member with body fluids capable of transmitting a potentially fatal infectious disease, the local site administrator will review the incident with the intent to refer the case for prosecution under the appropriate applicable laws.
A-54
20.	CYA agrees to develop and maintain a system, using Form YA 8.279 to track incidents of staff exposure to potentially infectious body fluids. This system will be in effect in all CYA facilities and such records will be maintained with the Chief of Medical Services.
21.	CYA agrees to reimburse staff for a State Board of Control claim up to $100 for their clothing that has been contaminated with infectious body fluids during the course of their duties and such clothing cannot be cleaned or is held for evidence. Reimbursement to the employee will be accomplished within forty-five (45) days from the date the claim is filed.
The employee will assist CYA in pursuing the claim through the State Board of Control.
22.	CYA agrees to defer a job-related determination of bloodborne exposure or disease to the Chief of Medical Services or a licensed SCIF physician.
23.	CYA agrees that no wards will be permitted in the immediate area where confidential HBV vaccinations are being administered.
CYA

F.	To the degree possible, interdepartment overnight “in-transit” wards will be housed in institutional locations where exposure to the resident population is minimized.
CYA agrees to initiate a contact investigation immediately, but no later than 24 hours, following the discovery of a confirmed contagious TB case (Class III). The contact investigation shall include all legally mandated TB testing/examinations that meet the requirements of Section 6006.5(b) P.C. of all identified potential exposed contacts (wards and staff) and/or medical evaluations of those with previously documented positive skin test results.
A-58
Repeat TB testing/examinations shall be administered in 90 days on all those with a negative skin test reading.
CYA agrees that wards having contagious Tuberculosis (Class III) shall immediately be placed in respiratory isolation. If a negative pressure room is not available, the ward shall be transported, using necessary precautions, to an appropriate facility. Wards shall not be discharged from a negative pressure room without the Chief Medical Officer’s authorization.
When the ward is housed in an institutional negative pressure room, the ward will not be permitted outside of that room, except for legitimate medical reason(s), as authorized by the Chief Medical Officer.
CYA agrees that PAs involved in tuberculosis testing or evaluated at a CYA location will do so on State time and may use their assigned State vehicles. PAs who select to be tested by their personal physicians or at a county health department must do so on their own time and at their own expense.

Reports and documentation of the exposure incident will be completed as soon as possible following treatment.
40.	The State will conduct an annual audit of local Emergency rooms and 30 Day Providers to ensure the availability of prophylactic medications.
41.	Whenever an employee has an unprotected contact with bodily fluids, the employee shall be entitled to counseling. This counseling shall be done in a confidential manner and shall include at least, information on the potential for bloodborne patho
A-68
gen exposure, testing options, and precautions to be taken by the employee in the event transmission has occurred. The employee shall be entitled to post-trauma services.
42.	The State agrees that transportation teams and officers assigned to outside hospitals, clinics and infirmaries will be specifically advised as to the appropriate universal precaution to take when dealing with an inmate who has an infectious disease. This knowledge of the specific universal precaution will be passed on to relief shifts as they take over responsibility for either transportation or watching inmates housed in one of the abovementioned areas.
43.	The State agrees that if, at a future date, the U.S. Public Health Services Guidelines recommend routine booster dose(s) of Hepatitis B vaccine, such booster dose(s) shall be made available to BU6 employees.
44.	The parties agree to re-open this Agreement to address bloodborne pathogen issues at camps.
45.	The parties mutually agree that this Agreement will be referred to as the Bloodborne Pathogen Agreement. Negotiations will begin as soon as possible on a separate agreement regarding infectious diseases.

This Agreement represents the conclusion to negotiations concerning employee Tuberculosis testing. This Agreement is an addendum to the master agreement between the State of California and CCPOA which expires on June 30, 1995. This Agreement shall be effective upon signature.
1.	CDC agrees that TB testing of Unit 6 members will be accomplished prior to February 1, 1994. CDC agrees that TB testing of Unit 6 members assigned to P&CSD will be accomplished prior to February 28, 1994.
A-69
2.	CDC agrees that each institution will meet locally with the CCPOA Chapter Presidents. These discussions will deal with each institution’s plan for TB Testing.
These discussions will permit input from the local chapter. Any agreed upon plans should be shared with the local membership.
3.	Prior to staff TB testing, CDC agrees to notify all employees of their legal obligations under Senate Bill 910 (Calderon). Notification will be provided by paycheck stuffers, posters and any other means appropriate. Copies of all notification materials will be provided to CCPOA headquarters.
4.	CDC agrees to distribute self-education materials on TB prevention and practices to all employees prior to staff testing. These materials will contain a self-test and a contact person for further questions. The self-test will be completed and returned by each employee prior to TB testing. Each employee will receive one hour of IST credit for completing the self-test.
5.	CDC agrees that for those employees who opt to have the TB testing and evaluation performed at the worksite or designated location, it will occur on State time. For employees who choose to see their private physician, the test and evaluation will be on the employees’ own time.
6.	CDC agrees that no inmates will be involved in any phase of chest x-rays for Bargaining Unit 6 staff.
7.	CDC agrees that all Bargaining Unit 6 chest x-rays will be stored in a secured area to ensure confidentiality. This secured area may be in the CMO’s office, or other appropriate place.

13.	CDC agrees that no inmates/parolees will be allowed in any area where TB testing and evaluation of employees is occurring.
14.	CDC agrees that no employee will receive a Notice of Adverse Action prior to receiving counseling about the employee’s responsibilities under the staff TB testing law (SB 910). The employee will have a right to representation at this counseling and this counseling will occur immediately, or as soon as possible thereafter, after the employee’s refusal to comply with any requirements of SB 910. In any case, the counseling will occur prior to the initiation of any part of the investigative process.
15.	CDC agrees that the only CMO permitted to override an employee’s personal physician certification that the employee is free of infectious TB is the CMO of the Public Health Section.

CDC agrees to provide CCPOA headquarters with a copy prior to issuance.
17.	CDC agrees that no Unit 6 member will be tested or evaluated for TB infection or disease more frequently than required by law or official regulation,
A-71
unless there is a reasonable medical justification for the test/evaluation.
Prior to any such test/evaluation (other than the required testing), CDC agrees to give written notice to the affected employees and the CCPOA local Chapter President. If a group of employees is to be tested/evaluated, a copy of this letter to the Chapter President will also be sent to CCPOA headquarters to the attention of the Chief Administrative Officer. This notice will state the reason(s) for the test/evaluation. This notice is an information sharing process and not to be considered as defined under Section 19.01 of the current MOU.
If CCPOA has a problem or concern as to the testing, the employer agrees to meet with CCPOA concerning their concerns.
18.	CDC agrees that all information generated for TB staff testing on employees, except chest x-rays will be stored in the employees medical file and that file will be stored in a secured location that is inaccessible to inmates.
19.	CDC agrees that if any PA requests to see his/her medical file, a request of medical information request shall be forwarded to the custodian of the P&CSD medical files. The employee’s medical file will be copied and mailed to the employee’s personal residence or physician, if requested.
20.	CDC agrees to furnish protective equipment deemed appropriate by the Department to PAs for use when handling parolee TB cases.
This equipment will be available for storage in PA’s car and in unit offices/complex.
21.	CDC agrees that the following procedures are to be adhered to for the access and/or release of employee’s medical files/medical information:
1.	Medical information will only be accessible to a licensed health care professional or designee, i.e., CMO’s secretary.
2.	Any non-licensed health care professional requesting access and/or medical information
A-72
will be required to provide a signed medical release of information form from the affected employee.
22.	CDC agrees that once an inmate is identified to have infectious TB, that inmate will, as soon as possible, be appropriately housed in a negative air flow cell. If no such cell is available, the inmate will be transported to an appropriate facility. CDC also agrees that once an inmate is identified to have infectious TB, that employees will immediately be informed to take universal precautions.
23.	CDC agrees that transportation teams will be specifically advised as to the appropriate respiratory precautions to take when dealing with an inmate who is identified with an infectious airborne disease.
24.	CDC agrees that for the testing of all Unit 6 PAs, that this testing will be done on state time. CDC further agrees that PAs, while on the state clock, will be allowed to use their state-issued vehicle for transportation to any test site. It is further agreed that in the event that a PA chooses to have an x-ray at a CDC institution, the parole administrator will be responsible for the scheduling of said test, as well as providing the opportunity for the PA to have this x-ray performed on state time.
25.	If an employee so requests, his/her chest x-ray will be sent to the employee’s personal physician for a second reading. The normal procedures and protocols for the mailing and sharing of x-rays will be followed.
CDC
HIV POSITIVE MAINLINE POLICY
This Agreement represents the full and complete agreement between CCPOA and the CDC regarding the HIV positive mainline policy. This Agreement is a separate agreement between the State of California and CCPOA covering Bargaining Unit 6 and shall be effective upon approval and signature of the appropriate DPA Labor Relations Officer and will expire on the same date as a successor to the 1989-91 Memorandum of Understanding.
A-73
1.	CDC agrees to provide Protective Personal Equipment (PPE) for Unit 6 members who come into contact with identified HIV positive infected inmates.
The PPE kit will contain, at a minimum the following:
1.	10 mm latex gloves
2.	body-fluid-resistant jump suit with:
a.	hood
b.	booties
c.	suit
3.	goggles
4.	mask
As the technology changes and improvements to this kit are available, CDC will provide the most up-to-date and safe equipment in these kits.
Mouthwash, eyewash and medical face shield with appropriate head apparatus will be provided separately.
The location of the PPE, including the mouthwash, eyewash and medical face shield, will be discussed at the local level between CCPOA and the appropriate institution management. These discussions will be designed to deal with the storage of these kits within housing units and other areas of the institution in which HIV positive inmates have access.
2.	CDC administration will provide cleanup kits for each housing unit, tier, dormitory, and any work areas in which HIV positive inmates may be assigned. Supervisors will be responsible for maintaining the supply of additional cleanup kits at the central location to be locally discussed between CCPOA and institution management. Cleanup kits will contain at the minimum the following items:
1.	10 mm latex gloves
2.	body-fluid absorbing material
3.	disposable bag for used absorbent material
4.	scoop
5.	red infectious disease bag for disposal of all articles in kit
A-74
6.	hand wash solution or towelettes (germicide type)
7.	germicidal cleaner and deodorant
Additionally, common areas of the institution such as visiting, dining room, and yards will also have a substantial number of these cleanup kits.
In the event inmates are used to clean up body fluid spills, the following procedures must be adhered to:
1.	there should be only two inmates per staff supervisor
2.	said inmates must be fully trained under SB-198
3.	said inmates must be under direct supervision from conception to completion of the clean up of the body fluid spill through the disposal of the bio-hazardous waste
As the technology changes and improvements to this kit are available, CDC will provide the most up-to-date and safe equipment in these kits.
The cleanup kits will not be used on crime scene situations until approved by institution supervisors or managers.
3.	CDC administration agrees to provide for all inmate transportation vehicles a sufficient number of the PPE kits for all employees assigned to the vehicle. Additionally, CDC will provide at a minimum two cleanup kits for each vehicle used in inmate transportation.
On CDC buses, these numbers will increase appropriately for the number of staff assigned on a bus.
4.	Signs shall be placed at strategic locations throughout institutions housing identified HIV infected inmates to advise employees to take universal precautions in compliance with Health and Safety Code Section 199.99. Any Unit 6 staff who work in those areas containing an identified HIV infected inmate, whether it be in the housing unit or work area, shall have access to the weekly up
A-75
dated list of known HIV positive inmates as stated in Health and Safety Code Section 199.99.
5.	Whenever an employee has an unprotected contact with bodily fluids, the employee shall be entitled to counseling. This counseling shall be done in a confidential manner and shall include at least information on the potential for HIV exposure, testing options, and precautions to be taken by the employee in the event transmission has occurred. The employee also shall be entitled to post-trauma services.
6.	CDC administration will provide a minimum of two (2) hours training of initial HIV positive formal IST class to twelve (12) institutions which are now implementing the HIV positive mainline agreement. This training will consist of:
a.	One hour of instruction — video and live — hands-on at least in the following: “Basic AIDS 101”; precautions to be used in daily work activities to avoid exposure to HIV; hands-on dealing with identified HIV positive infected inmates; and, laws governing involuntary HIV positive anti-body testing of inmates (Health and Safety Code Section 199.95 et al).
b.	One hour of instruction—video and live on at least in the following: Universal precautions; use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), including practice in putting on, taking off, and disposal of PPE; use of body fluid cleanup kits, including a demonstration of use; proper body and cell search; and, what to do in the event of exposure to body fluids.
c.	The training materials will consist of the modules developed and used at CMF and or other appropriate materials as approved by the Department and reviewed by CCPOA.
d.	For CMF, CIW, CIM, CMC, San Quentin and Corcoran, this training will be provided as an annual refresher. This training will be given to each of these institutions thirty (30) days after implementation of this new program.
A-76
e.	For CRC, CCWF, CCI, RJD, DVI, and WSP, this training will be given prior to implementation of the HIV positive housing policy and as a refresher course thereafter annually.
This training will be made mandatory and standardized for academy department-wide use subject to approval of CCPOA and the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.
7.	CDC administration agrees to participate in an information sharing program with CCPOA wherein the Chief Medical Officer (CDC) will prepare on a quarterly basis an informational article and send said article to the Peacekeeper. This Article will detail the scientific advances in the area of HIV research. This Article will further provide information on the most up-to-date means in which correctional staff can use common sense and appropriate safety equipment to protect them from exposure to the HIV virus.
CDC further agrees that this Article can also be a means by which new and up-to-date information concerning infectious diseases in general is distributed to the bargaining unit membership.
8.	CDC agrees that every officer, MTA, and Correctional Counselor who comes into contact with an identified HIV positive infected inmate will be issued to the above-named COs an appropriate supply of 10 mm latex gloves and the appropriate carrying equipment.
At the institutions that are new to the HIV positive infected inmates policy, this supplying of the latex gloves and appropriate carrying equipment will be done at the training the Unit 6 staff receive prior to the activation of this program. At the institutions which are carrying on their HIV positive housing policy, this issuance will occur as the local dialogue directs.
It is the responsibility of the supervisors at these institutions to maintain and assure that each CO has an appropriate supply of latex gloves available. The availability and location of these gloves will be worked out during the local dialogue.
A-77
9.	CDC agrees that known HIV positive inmates will be tested with the Purified Protein Derivative once a year. Secondly, because of the nature of the inmates’ illness, the Department will chest X-ray at least once a year each identified HIV positive inmate.
10.	CDC agrees that transportation teams and officers assigned to outside hospitals, clinics and infirmaries will be specifically advised as to the appropriate universal precaution to take when dealing with an inmate who has an infectious disease. This knowledge of the specific universal precaution will be passed on to relief shifts as they take over responsibility for either transportation or watching inmates housed in one of the abovementioned areas.
11.	CDC agrees that as the negotiations on other infectious diseases take place, issues related to the HIV positive Mainline housing of inmates table may cause the HIV positive negotiated agreement to be amended.
These amendments would be the result of Tentative Agreement reached at the Infectious Disease Negotiations.
12.	With advance notice of no more than twenty-four (24) hours, CDC agrees that CCPOA, Chief Job Stewards, Job Stewards, Field Representatives, Legal Staff, or Chief Administrative Officer, have the right to inspect the implementation of this HIV positive housing policy. This inspection will include access via a tour as to where safety equipment is stored, the proper markings for said storage of equipment, and a review of local training materials that may be used to update staff’s awareness of this serious problem.
13.	CDC agrees that at each institution housing known HIV positive infected inmates, they will develop a procedure that deals with the emergency care, transportation and other life-saving techniques to cover the HIV positive infected inmates when in need.
A-78
This will include specific requirements as to who is responsible for the administering of life support practices; to include CPR, breathing enhancers, and other medical procedures to help in life-threatening situations.
Once this local policy is developed through meetings with the local chapter, it will be incorporated into the training for the new institutions in the HIV positive housing project.
For those institutions which already house known HIV positive inmates and have said support system developed, in the refresher training given these procedures will be enunciated.
Chapter Presidents at the impacted institutions are encouraged to review the policies that are developed, and at the new institutions work with the local administration in developing said policies.

APPENDIX ITEM #14 — ADDENDUM TO SECTION 16.04
CDC
SMOKING POLICY
This Agreement represents the full and complete understanding of the parties at the conclusion of the negotiations completed on November 29, 1993 regarding CDC’s implementation of the Administrative Bulletin -Smoking Policy.
1.	The State will post “No Smoking” signs in the outside areas where smoking is prohibited.
2.	In the event legislation is introduced to ban tobacco products for the inmates, the Department agrees to duly consider supporting such a bill.
3.	It is the intent and expectation of the Department and CCPOA that effective Corrective Action will be taken prior to any Adverse Personnel Action (APA) for violation of the Department’s smoking policy.
Therefore, as part of the State’s process of progressive discipline, an employee who violates the Department’s AB on smoking policy will be offered the opportunity to receive medical treatment and/ or counseling for smoking cessation.
This offer will be made prior to any referral for APA for the employee’s first documented violation (i.e., Employee Counseling Record or LOI). Other means of effecting corrective action shall be evaluated and documented; including, but not limited to, an assignment which will allow the employee access to a smoking area.
A-83
Additionally, this offer only applies to the first documented violation of the smoking policy itself, i.e., Willful Disobedience/smoking in an unauthorized area. However, in the event the employee’s behavior warrants charges of Insubordination, Discourteous Treatment of the Public, Other Failure of Good Behavior, etc. or it is the employee’s second violation of the smoking policy, he/she may be subject to APA.
If the employee requests a change in job assignment to facilitate the corrective action, and the Department cannot grant the change within 21 calendar days of the employee’s request, then the employee will be given a written explanation as to the reason(s) why his/her reassignment request cannot be granted.
After the first opportunity for medical treatment or counseling, APA will not be held in abeyance for subsequent violations.
In those geographical areas where the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) cannot provide the required service (smoking cessation programs) and the employee’s medical insurance does not cover such services, then In-Service Training (IST) funds will be made available to reimburse the employee for fees paid for a cessation program. The maximum reimbursement shall be fifty dollars. If the smoking cessation program is only offered during the employee’s normal working hours, Holiday Time Off (HTO) or vacation time shall be granted so the employee may attend the smoking cessation program.
4.	The Department agrees to include smoking cessation in the IST programs. The Department will ensure that all instructors of the smoking cessation programs are vendor qualified, e.g. American Lung Association, Cancer Society.
5.	Bachelor Officers’ Quarters at the institutions, will be considered “Primary Place of Residence” for employees when the employee becomes a tenant by “paying rent” for use of such facilities. Nothing in this agreement may be construed as a waiver of
A-84
any rights or privileges under existing DPA rules relating to moving, relocation or per diem and the Unit 6 Memorandum of Understanding, Article XIV, Section 14.01.
6.	The Department will issue a letter (memorandum) emphasizing the Department’s commitment and intent to enforce the guidelines outlined in the AB. This memorandum will be signed by the Director.
7.	The Department agrees that all inmates will only be allowed to smoke tobacco products on prison yards and, except for safety and security considerations, some yards may be designated no smoking, e.g., administrative segregation, security housing units.
8.	The Department agrees to develop enforcement policies and procedures regarding inmate visitors and members of the public for violation of the Department’s smoking policy.
9.	The Department agrees not to punitively job change smokers into a job assignment where they do not have the ability to smoke.
10.	Prior to enforcing the AB regarding the Department’s smoking policy, each local administration will present the new smoking policies and procedures in On-the-Job training classes. These classes will include the details to this negotiated agreement and the AB, as they relate to employee expectations for compliance and enforcement of the smoking ban.
11.	CCPOA will be allowed to review the Unit’s Disciplinary logs and the institution’s Register of Institution Violations, upon request. Additionally, upon request, copies will be provided the local CCPOA representative.
12.	The parties agree that the term “building” means indoor, enclosed areas. Breezeways such as 270/ 180 design (for example the breezeway at New Folsom that separates the Level IV yard and the Level III yard) are not considered a building.
13.	The following is to clarify the recently issued CDC’s smoking policy which prohibits smoking in state-
A-85
owned or leased buildings; within five feet of entrances and exits of such buildings or space; and in state-owned or leased passenger vehicles. The smoking policy does not prohibit Parole and Community Services Division employees from utilizing other designated smoking areas within a leased building or complex where employee access to the smoking area is not restricted by other tenants within the building.
This Agreement represents the full and complete agreement of the parties regarding the implementation of the Department’s Administrative Bulletin - Smoking Policy.

SIDELETTER #5- REGARDING SECTION 27.01
- ENTIRE AGREEMENT
All existing agreements negotiated pursuant to the Entire Agreement clause of previous MOU’s (27.01 or 19.01), or pursuant to the Ralph C. Dills Act, are made a part of this MOU. If the provisions of any existing agreement are inconsistent with this MOU, this MOU supercedes the inconsistent provisions.
SIDELETTER #6 - REGARDING SECTION 15.17 — EDUCATIONAL INCENTIVE
The parties agree that should CPOST develop intermediate and/or advanced CPOST certificates during the term of this Agreement, the State and CCPOA will reopen this Agreement to Meet and Confer over the application of the educational incentive relating to the CPOST certificate.
SIDELETTER #7 - REGARDING SECTION 16.02 - GUN LOCKERS AND STATE FIRING RANGES
It is understood between the parties that the course of fire for the off-duty weapons qualification is subject to change by CPOST without a Meet and Confer between the parties.
S-3
SIDELETTER #8 - REGARDING SECTION 27.01 — NOTICE REQUIREMENTS
The CDC and CCPOA agree that the Meet and Confer process has at times been viewed as cumbersome and inefficient. In an effort to modify this perception, the CDC and CCPOA agree to the following:
During the term of the MOU, in the event the CDC finds it necessary to make changes in areas within the scope of negotiations, and also believes that it has a business necessity to expedite the standard procedure for noticing CCPOA of such changes, or believes that the proposed change will have a diminimus impact on employees in Unit 6, then the CDC may notify CCPOA and request a waiver of the thirty-day notice requirement and/or the necessity to Meet and Confer over the proposed change.
CCPOA is cognizant of the need of the CDC to move quickly to implementation in some circumstances. Further, CCPOA is cognizant of the need to avoid unnecessary or excessive meetings on diminimus matters. On implementation of this procedure, some of the possible outcomes could be: Waiver of the right to Meet and Confer; deferral to local negotiations, or waiver for implementation, but Meet and Confer over impact. The potential flexibility inherent in these procedures will meet the needs of the CDC and CCPOA.
The CDC Chief of Labor Relations or the CDC Assistant Chief of Labor Relations will contact the CCPOA representative, as described below, and provide the following information regarding the proposed change: The nature of the proposed change, location of the proposed change, the proposed implementation date for such change, and an explanation why the proposed change is appropriate for notice under this Agreement.
CCPOA agrees to provide to CDC a prioritized list of CCPOA employees to whom telephonic notice may be conveyed under this procedure. The CDC agrees to provide notice to the highest listed individual who is available to take the call. This telephonic contact must then be confirmed in writing by both the CDC and CCPOA.
This expedited procedure does not apply to matters covered by the MOU.
S-4
SIDELETTER #9 - REGARDING EXPEDITED ARBITRATION FOR ALLEGED VIOLATION OF SECTION 27.01
The Settlement Agreement between CCPOA, DPA and CDC, dated January 7, 1990, regarding expedited arbitration for alleged violations of Section 19.01, shall be extended through the term of this Agreement pursuant to paragraph 8 of Arbitrator Kathy Kelly’s Award.
SIDELETTER #10 - REGARDING SECTION 27.01 — BARGAINING REQUIREMENTS — ENTIRE AGREEMENT
Once the State has noticed CCPOA pursuant to the Entire Agreement clause of the MOU (Section 27.01) and has fulfilled any reasonable CCPOA request for information, which is relevant to the issue noticed, the State and CCPOA agree to mutually engage in good faith bargaining for at least a thirty (30) day period of time. This, in part, means each side will Meet and Confer as often as necessary to potentially reach agreement. Both sides agree to work extended hours if necessary. If after the expiration of the thirty (30) day calendar period, the parties have failed to come to an agreement, the State may unilaterally implement the proposed change, including any items tentatively agreed upon up to that point in bargaining, without engaging in the Dills Act impasse procedures. Unilateral implementation does not mean that the parties cannot continue meeting and conferring through to agreement, if possible.
If the State believes CCPOA’s information request to be unreasonable, or if CCPOA believes the State’s response to an information request to be unreasonable, the “grieved party” may request to meet with the appropriate departmental Chief Deputy Director in an effort to resolve the problem. If the problem remains unresolved, either party may request the intervention of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency Secretary or Undersecretary, who shall determine the issue.
If either party believes the other party to be engaged in bad faith bargaining, either party may take the issue to the Agency Secretary or Undersecretary. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent either party from filing a complaint with PERB.
S-5
SIDELETTER #11 — REGARDING SECTION 27.01 — RETIREMENT BENEFITS
During the term of this Agreement, if legislation is enacted providing any state employees either an increase of the income cap on retirement benefits above eighty-five percent (85%) or a Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP), the State agrees to include Bargaining Unit 6 employees in the legislation.
SIDELETTER #12- REGARDING SECTION 9.09 - CDC/CYA PERSONNEL INVESTIGATIONS
This addendum does not diminish any of the employee rights and protections in Section 9.09.
Employees ordered to attend an investigatory interview by CDC/CYA shall be informed in one (1) written document of: (1) the subject matter (scope) of the investigation, (2) whether the employee is deemed a witness or a subject of the investigation, (3) whether the investigation is for purposes of administrative discipline or is considered a criminal investigation, and (4) his/her right to representation. If the employee is designated a witness, the notice shall allow a reasonable amount of time for the employee to obtain a representative. In criminal investigations, the representative will be an attorney or a member of the legal staff of CCPOA working under the direction and supervision of an attorney and the notice will allow a reasonable amount of time for the representative to travel to the location of the interview. If the employee is designated a subject of the investigation, the employee will be given at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice of the investigatory interview.
If CDC/CYA decides to immunize a witness in an administrative or criminal investigation, the immunization shall be accomplished by reading into the tape recording, the administrative or criminal witness admonishment form provided in Appendix Item #17. The employee shall be given a copy of the signed form at the conclusion of the interview.
An employee or the employee’s representative will be permitted to tape record the interview. At the conclusion of the interview, if the employee was designated a
S-6
witness in the notice of the interview, the tape made by the employee or employee’s representative shall be sealed by the employee or the employee’s representative in an envelope or evidence bag to be provided by the employee or employee’s representative and retained by the investigator. The bag shall not be opened or magnetically compromised by any agent of CDC/CYA. The sealed employee’s tape shall be made available to the employee in advance of any subsequent interview of the employee regarding the same or related subjects, and will be provided to the employee on request after the investigation has been concluded. Employees designated as the subject of an investigation in the notice of the interview will be permitted to retain the tape at the conclusion of the interview.
SIDELETTER #13 - REGARDING SECTION
18.04 - CYA FIELD PA WORKLOAD
It is understood that the “General Policy” section of Section 18.04 represents the current PS&CC Branch policy and, therefore, is grievable up to Step 3 of the grievance procedure pursuant to Section 6.02(b) of the MOU. It is further agreed that if the Department changes the “PS&CC General Policy,” a notice letter will be sent to CCPOA, and, if requested negotiations will ensue over the impact of the change.
SIDELETTER #14 REGARDING PROPOSED COURT ORDERS
Every time a court, a judge, or a special master proposes (or has a motion before him/her) to enter an order that may impact terms and conditions of employment, the State employer shall notify CCPOA’s Chief of Labor in writing as soon as possible of the proposed order and the hearing date relative thereto.

It is agreed that Medical Technical Assistants assigned to the Northern California Youth Correctional Center shall be eligible for Watch/Regular Days Off preference, effective January 1, 2002.

SIDELETTER #18 REGARDING 13.10 RURAL HEALTHCARE EQUITY PROGRAM (RHCEP)
The parties agree that in those areas/counties which CalPERS staff have defined as “rural” due to PERS HMO plans not being offered at all in the area, or PERS HMO plans in the area, Unit 6 members shall be eligible for the rural area subsidy program if they enroll in PERS PPO plan. If they cannot manage to enroll in a CalPERS approved HMO plan still offering services in that area, they are free to do so, but will not receive the rural area subsidy.
SIDELETTER #19 REGARDING 12.04 CDC/ PAROLE AND COMMUNITY SERVICES DIVISION (P&CSD) TRANSFERS
A. For the purpose of filling vacant Revocation, Reentry, USINS, and field Parole Agent (PA) I/II positions by lateral transfer, agents may permanently request to transfer to another location, within the employee’s department and classification.

If an employee is not approved for transfer, he/she must be informed in writing within fifteen (15) calendar days of the specific reasons for said denial.
