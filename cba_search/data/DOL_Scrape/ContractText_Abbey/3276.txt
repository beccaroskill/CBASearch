ARTICLE XIV - REDUCTION IN FORCE
A.	School Board Rights
The School Board has a sole and exclusive right to determine the number, nature, and location of positions in the school system and to reduce or increase staff accordingly . In so exercising this right, the Board will confer with and receive recommendations from the Union.
B.	Definition
A Reduction In Force (RIF) will be said to exist when the number of personnel within any given job or salary classification has been decreased in number or when the number cf teachers exceeds the number of positions in the instructional bargaining unit.
C.	Procedures
1.	Retention - Instructional staff shall be certified and/or qualified for the position held.
2.	Qualifications - Instructional staff will be deemed qualified for any position for which they hold the appropriate certification and endorsement (where required by the State) unless as specified below. They will also be considered to be qualified for any position presently held by an uncertified teacher and for all positions that do not require specific certification.
3.	Seniority - Instructional staff will be subject to layoff based on the least amount cf continuous service in the Sarasota County School System. Seniority for layoffs will cover al! cost centers in system wide fashion. Seniority will be defined as time since effective date of hire in the instructional bargaining unit. A teacher who had previous employment in the classified bargaining unit and who did not break service with the School Board of Sarasota County, will retain his/her seniority in the, classified bargaining unit in case s/he has been laid off from his/her instructional position. Such time, however, will not count towards seniority in the instructional bargaining unit A teacher who transferred to the classified bargaining unit and then returned to the instructional bargaining unit will retain ail prior instructional bargaining unit time(s) for seniority purposes, provided that no break in service to the school district occurred.
4.	Date of Hire - The effective starting date as designated by School Board action in appointing a given teacher will be considered to be his/her official date of hire. In cases of ties with regard to Board appointment, the date and time of receipt of the application shall apply. In cases where no time stamp exists, the date of the application will be the deciding factor. Should a tie still exist, it will be broken by a coin toss.
5.	Administrators Returning to Bargaining Unit - Any administrator who returns to a bargaining unit position with the appropriate reduction in salary and a surrendering of his/her administrative status will begin to earn seniority placement within the unit at that time. Any administrator who had previous status within the bargaining unit and has not had a break in service shall retain those previous years in the bargaining unit toward his/her seniority status. All administrators returning to tire bargaining unit will be placed into vacancies following those procedures described below.
6.	Preferences - Each teacher will complete a preference form that may be updated as described below. The form will include a listing of the teacher’s school site preferences and whether or not s/he would desire a voluntary transfer to a particular school site(s).

7.	Placement
a.	Each cost center will compile a list of all positions to be eliminated for the following school year. At that time the cost center head will also identify the least senior teacher at that cost center currently working within the certification area in which the position(s) is/are being eliminated. Pursuant to the procedures outlined in subparagraph (b) below, the cost center head, prior to May 20 of any given school year, will transmit to the Human Resources Office a listing of all positions eliminated, teachers surplussed, and vacancies anticipated.
b.	The teacher(s) to be surplussed at each cost center will be the least senior at that cost center currently working within the area of certification of the position(s) to be eliminated; provided however, that a teacher who has had his/her position eliminated may elect to remain at that cost center should s/he possess more seniority than a teacher at that cost center in an alternate area of the first teacher’s certification. In such a case the teacher possessing the least seniority in the alternative certification area at that cost center will be surplussed. A teacher whose position has been eliminated must be given the opportunity to elect to remain at his/her cost center in an alternative area of certification, and must exercise his/her election, prior to surplus lists being transmitted from the cost center to the Human Resources Office.
c.	Upon receipt of surplus lists from all cost centers, the Human Resources Office will compile a listing, in seniority order, of all teachers who have been surplussed. That listing, as well as a listing of all vacancies county wide (excluding Board approved charter schools), will be posted for a period of five working days. Teachers may update their preference lists through the conclusion of this five day period.
d.	All teachers will be placed into vacant assignments on a seniority basis based upon their expressed preferences (excluding Board-approved charter schools). The most senior surplussed teacher will be considered first and placement will continue on a seniority basis. Each teacher must be certified and endorsed (where required by the.State) for the assignment selected. During the placement process, if no vacancy remains for which a teacher is certified, the teacher will replace the least senior teacher in either the north or south county region (as selected by the teacher) in his/her area of certification. The teacher may elect to switch his/her region selection and pick from vacancies in the other location. This process will continue until there remains no teacher on the surplus list who has more seniority than any teacher in the district holding a position in that area of certification. Those teachers who are junior to all others in the district within their areas of certification will thus be identified. Those junior, teachers, for whom there are no positions available within their areas of certification, will be laid off. Those laid off teachers will have recall rights within the parameters set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. • -
e.	During the placement process, should a teacher not be reassigned due to his/her failing to be assigned to one of the work sites stated on his/her preference form or because a Preference Form was not filed, management will attempt to contact said teacher to explain to him/her those positions remaining available at that time. Should management not be able to contact said teacher, the teacher will be reassigned to a work site and position most similar to that which s/he was last assigned or those expressed on his/her preference form.
8.	Return to Former Placement- Any teacher displaced from an instructional position due to the implementation of those procedures described above will be able to return to an instructional position vacancy at his/her last former work site for which s/he is certified, should such a position become available within a period of five years. Such return will be automatically granted upon receipt of the teacher’s request. In such cases, the transfer will become effective upon the employee’s request and s/he will be considered a member of his/her former school’s staff for placement purposes, but the employee will not occupy that position until the beginning of the next school year. It will be the teacher’s responsibility to monitor such opportunities.

The Assistant Superintendent or his/her designee shall submit his/her written response to the Step Two grievance no later than ten working days following the Step Two meeting.
4.	Formal Step Three: If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance in Step Two, s/he may schedule a meeting to submit it on the adopted form to the Superintendent or his/her designee no later than ten working days after the written response was received in Step Two. The Superintendent or his/her designee shall submit a written response no later than ten working days after the Step Three meeting. Should the response be a rejection of the grievance, the Superintendent or his/her designee will summarize his/her reasons for so ruling.
5.	Step Four (optional): Should the parties mutually agree, the next step in the processing of a grievance will be through the inclusion of an impartial mediator. The decision to undertake this option must be made by the grievant within 15 working days from receipt of the Step Three written decision. The mediator will be chosen through mutual agreement of the parties. There will not be a binding decision on the parties except by mutual agreement.

IMPLEMENTATION:
1.	Credit for experience will be granted as follows:
a.	For newly hired teachers (i.e., those not previously employed by the Board at any time prior to June 30, 2003), one step will be granted for each full year of full time teaching experience in any public school for which he or she received a satisfactory performance evaluation. The employee’s initial step placement will then be one step above that determined herein. Teachers designated as “experts-in-field” will be placed on Step One of the Bachelor’s lane.
b.	If a teacher is employed by the Board at any time prior to June 30, 2003, separates from service with the Board and is subsequently is re-employed by the Board, he or she will return to the step from which he or she left the 30-step schedule or, for those who separated from service while still on the 15-step salary schedule, the step on the 30-step salary schedule to which the teacher would have been converted had he or she been employed on June 30, 2003. Additionally, the teacher will receive credit for any full time public school teaching experience for which he or she received a satisfactory performance evaluation that he or she might have accrued in the period between when he or she left service of the Sarasota District Schools and his or her rehire. Prior service time will apply to the determining of the appropriate longevity bonus.
c.	Full time service for one day more than one-half of the contractual period may be counted as a year of service. Part years may not be combined to achieve a full year. Any teacher who works one-half time or more and who works for more than one day more than half a year will receive salary credit for the respective year of service. Time spent as a graduate assistant or intern may not be considered for salary purposes.
2.	Credit also will be granted for:
a.	Credit hours necessary to meet requirements of a planned program leading toward an advanced degree.
b.	Additional courses which will increase the teacher’s professional effectiveness.
3.	Credit for teaching experience will be granted for military service during a national emergency providing that military service was an interruption of teaching duties. Teaching experience in military service will be considered in the same way as other teaching experience outside Sarasota County.
4.	Salary credit may be granted to newly hired R.OTC teachers over and above the Step 3 cap specified in Number 1, above. Such advanced credit may be granted only as is necessary to bring the ROTC teacher to the federally mandated minimum salary level.
5.	The increase for a teacher may be withheld above step six by official action of the School Board of Sarasota County in a regular meeting or a special meeting, based upon the recommendation of the Superintendent that the teacher’s service has been less than satisfactory for the previous year. Such a recommendation shall be based upon the criteria and procedures defined in the official Board rules on the evaluation of instruction.
6.	The following job classifications or job titles will receive a supplement of 14.3% above the appropriate teacher’s daily rate of pay due to a lengthened normal duty day and an increased responsibility level. The duration of work year figures shown below represents the normal work year for each position (except those employees covered by a prior contractual obligation).
School Psychologist (11 month position)
School Social Worker (11 month position)
Program Specialist (11 month position)

work year figures shown below represents the normal work year for each position.
Teacher Trainer (11 month position)
Elementary or Middle School Lead Teacher (10 month position)
Consultant ('0 month position)
All of the above supplemented activities with the exception of the school psychologist and school social worker job classifications and those program specialists appointed to their positions prior to June 30, 1995, will be considered temporary in nature. Any position vacancies in an above listed supplemented activity (with the exception of Lead Teachers) must be posted county wide, in a manner consistent with other position vacancies (as specified in Article XIII). All qualified applicants will be interviewed for the position vacancies. The supplements for each of these positions will be for one year’s duration and be renewable thereafter. The employee will be told of his/her status for the coming school year, no less than four weeks prior to the last work day of the prior school year. Teachers must have completed at least three years of service with the Board to be qualified for a lead teacher position. An employee (other than a school psychologist or school social worker) will accrue no property right to, or expectation of, continued employment in the supplemental activity. During the period in which the teacher is serving in this supplemental activity, s/he will continue to be considered a member of the staff of his/her former work site assigned to temporary duty elsewhere for placement purposes.
To determine a teacher or former specialist’s salary level for receiving one of the aforementioned responsibility supplements, each teacher or specialist’s former daily rate of pay will be computed. His/her daily rate of pay will then be converted to a new step on the Teacher’s Salary Schedule by using a Conversion Scale. This Conversion Scale will consist of the regular Teacher’s Salary Schedule with the appropriate 14.3% or 7.1% supplements added to each lane and step. Each teacher or specialist’s former daily rate of pay will be placed on the next highest rate of pay in the appropriate salary lane on the Conversion Scale. The teacher will then be moved one additional step above that rate of pay on the Conversion Scale. That will become the teacher’s new salary step on the regular Teacher’s Salary Schedule. To compute his/her new salary', add the appropriate 14.3% or 7.1% supplement to the teacher’s newly determined step on the Teacher’s Salary Schedule Any teacher who fails to receive that supplement in a future year, will be replaced on the Teacher’s Salary Schedule in such a fashion as if s/he had remained in continuous employment in his/her former position. No existing teacher or specialist’s base salary will be decreased due to the implementation of these procedures.
7.	Longevity Implementation	... ■
a.	Longevity payments will be based upon total time of employment as an appointed employee (except as modified below) with the School Board of Sarasota Count)’ as a member of either the instructional or classified bargaining units. It will be the employee’s responsibility to apply for the recapture of prior service time in cases where service has been broken.
b.	For purposes of determining the length of continuous service for longevity purposes, an employee must have worked in an active duty capacity, one day more than one half of a norma! work year. Multiple partial years of service may not be combined. Active service is defined to include time on duty plus any time the employee is on any form of paid leave or worker’s compensation leave.
c.	Longevity payments are calculated by multiplying the appropriate multiplier (found in Appendix A of the respective agreements) by the Step 1 amount of the employee’s present salary lane, including any appropriate position supplement. (This does not include lead teacher supplements.)
d.	Each employee must have entered the appropriate longevity salary grouping by October 1 of any given school year in order to qualify for that grouping’s bonus payment. For example, for an employee to qualify for the 19 to 21 year grouping, s/he must have started his/her nineteenth year of service prior to October 1.
e.	Less than full time employees during the year of the payment will receive the appropriate 0.6 longevity payment proration.

g.	Longevity payments will be made in December of each year.
h.	Longevity payments will be taxed at the normal lump sum distribution level as required by the present IRS Code. Should the IRS rules change in the future, the Board agrees to tax this distribution in a fashion most favorable to the majority of bargaining unit employees.
i.	Longevity payments will be based upon a normal work year (e.g., teachers and consultants, 196 days; psychologists, social workers, and teacher trainers, 220 days; grandfathered 240 day employees, 240 days, etc.). Summer school teaching service and extra duty days will not apply in that calculation.
j.	Any employee must be in an active duty status (i.e., not on unpaid leave) as of December 1 of any given school year to be eligible to receive his/her longevity payment. Employees who separate from service from the Board prior to December 1 of any given school year, will not be eligible to receive that year’s iongevity payment.

The team leader’s index is based on the existing formula (.006 per teacher in his/her department, grade level, or team including him/herself) with step increments added. All appointed teachers at a given work site will be assigned to a team.
A. General Guidelines:
1.	To be eligible for a supplement, faculty members, except for department chairpersons, must be scheduled for a regular class load. To find the amount of supplement, multiply the index of the supplement by the Bachelors column salary according to the number of years experience in a particular position or activity. Verification of experience will be required for anyone initially appointed after July 1, 1977. In coaching, an assistant coach moving to a head coaching position in another sport will start on Step One. A head coach who moves to an assistant coaching position in another sport will begin on Step One. An assistant coach moving to a head coaching position in the same sport will advance one step and will receive the head coaching index times the base of that step in the Bachelors column. For purposes of determining salary step, the athletic director’s position shall be considered in the same manner as the head coach. S/he will receive an increment one step above that which s/he received as a coach. Coaches will receive pay for all sports coached, but will receive only one head coaching salary.
2.	Post-Season Contest Supplements: Any post season contests in which schools are eligible to participate at the district level shall be counted as part of the season’s schedule when determining the amount of supplement. If a season is extended beyond district competition, each coach will be paid ten percent of his/her regular supplement for each week the team advances beyond the district competition.
3.	Department Chairpersons in high schools (in teams of three or more teacher units) shall be paid .006 of the Bachelors schedule for each teacher unit in his/her department, grade level, or team. The chairperson will count himself/herself as a teacher unit and anyone else who does most of his/her teaching in the department, grade level, or team. Team leaders must be designated as such by the principal. The number of teacher units in a department, grade level, or team will be determined as of September 15 and will remain the same throughout the year even though the number of teacher units may change. Department Heads for School Psychologists and Social Workers will be paid in accordance with the above guidelines except the

index shall be multiplied times Step One of the Teacher’s salary schedule with the appropriate supplement added.
4.	Peer teachers will receive a supplement of .02 for each beginning teacher on the 180 day program to whom they are assigned. Peer teachers will receive a supplement of .01 for each 90 day program beginning teacher to whom they are assigned.
5.	Any exception to the supplement salary schedule, the allocation of coaching units, or implementation of such exceptions must be approved by the appropriate director and must comply with those terms and conditions specified herein..
6.	Supplements will be rounded to the nearest dollar. All salaries paid by the Board are in full compensation for all duties assigned to teachers by the Superintendent unless additional compensation is expressly provided by the Board.

This summer school Agreement is adopted by the SC/TA and the Beard as an amendment of the main collective bargaining Agreement. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of the main Agreement and those of this summer school Agreement (pertaining to summer school) the terms and conditions of this summer school Agreement shall prevail. Certain provisions of the main Agreement have no relevance to summer school because of operational differences. Such portions of the main Agreement shall not apply to summer school.
B.	Summer School Benefits

All benefits will be prorated according to the number of days of summer school. Summer school teachers who work at least half the summer school term, will receive benefits at one-haif the rate or amount received by full time summer school teachers.
C.	Selection of Summer Schoo! Teachers
All currently employed instructional staff are eligible for summer school employment. Teachers selected for summer school should be certified in the subject area to be taught. Except as otherwise agreed, when two or more teachers are eligible for a summer school position, the teacher with the greatest seniority' shall be selected, provided the teacher has taught in the subject area sometime within the previous five years. Otherwise, the teacher selected shall be the teacher with the greater length of service in Sarasota County. If no certified candidate applies for a position, such position may be filled at the Superin^ adent’s disc.riion. Band directors, coaches, media specialists, counselors, and other positions as agreed to by the parties to have a special need to teach at the school to which they are normally assigned, may be hired without regard to any limitation stated in this Agreement. The school principal and the Director of Summer School may designate ether positions which may be filled without regard to seniority. Any building principal who selects outside the scope of this condition must substantiate such reason(s) in writing, consult with the SC/TA and provide a copy to the teacher(s) affected.
D.	Placement
Eligible teachers who during the preceding regular school year were assigned to a school in which summer school is being held, shall be assigned to that school site during summer school, if a sufficient number of positions are not available at that school, the teacher with the greater seniority will be selected.
E.	Salary
The summer school salary schedule daily rate will be equivalent to the teacher salary schedule daily rate of the immediate past year.
F.	Work Day
The parties agree that the implementation of the regular daily rate during summer school will not be construed to be a precedent with respect to what constitutes the work day in terms of hours during the regular school year. The parties agree that the length of the non-instruciionai summer school day can be increased by management if so desired, not to exceed the length of the regular school year day.

2	ANNUAL LEAVE/VACATION PAY
3
4	The BENCOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT PLAN1"'* (BENCOR SPECIAL PAY
5	PLAN™) is offered by BENCOR, Inc. to help governmental units and their employees save up to 7.65% of Social
6	Security/Medicare taxes and to defer income taxes on eligible Plan contributions. Provided below is an explanation
7	of how the Plan works:	>
8
9	Eligibility
10	• Employees who are retiring or going into DROP and have at least $2500 of accumulated sick-leave
11	pay or annual leave/vacation pay will participate in this Plan.
12	• Accumulated sick-leave pay or annual leave/vacation pay will be placed into the BENCOR NA-
13	TIONAL PLAN subject to contribution limits and Board Policy.
14	Contribution Limits
15	• The maximum Plan contribution cannot exceed 100% of the Plan Year Salary or $40,000; whichever
16	is less. (Plan year 7/1/2002 - 6/30/2003)
17	• In the last year of employment, (and in the year before entering DROP), if Plan Year Salary is less
18	than $40,000, the maximum Plan contribution cannot exceed 50% of the Plan Year Compensation or
19	$40,000; whichever is less. (Plan Year Compensation = salary (July 1-June 30) + sick leave pay +
20	annual leave/vacation pay + incentive pay (“Special Pay”) that is to be paid in that year.)
21	• The maximum Plan contribution limit is calculated each year.
22	• There is a dollar-for-dollar set-off against the $40,000 Special Pay Plan annual contribution limit for
23	money placed into a 401 (k) plan or into the State Investment Plan.
24	• In addition, you can fully fund your eiective deferral 403(b) Plan. Please consult your TSA advisor or
25	your tax advisor regarding your 403(b) Pian contribution limits.
26	Investments	. : ’ .

29	Investment Expenses
30	• There is no asset-management fee charged against the Potentia General Account (i.e. guaran-
31	teed/fixed). An asset-management fee is deducted from variable accounts only. The fee is charged 32 quarterly and will be indicated on the quarterly statements sent to all Plan participants.
33	Distributions
34	•	Distributions may be taken at termination of employment or because of total disability or death.
35	•	The participant may choose to leave money in the Plan, self-directing future investments and taking
36	distributions as desired in a tax-deferred manner. Distributions may be taken in a lump sum or as pe-
37	riodic payments taken monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. (Remember, it may be advan-
38	tageous under Federal tax laws to delay taking distributions until a later tax year when the individ-
39	ual’s tax rate may be lower.)

»	There is no 10% IRS penalty if the employee is at least age 55 in the year of separation from employment.	' • -
•	Employees who have retired and fall within a certain age category (those who were less than age 55 in the year of separation from employment) and elect to withdraw these funds are subject to a 10% early-withdrawal penalty by the IRS. The employer will “make whole” those employees who fall within this category, if they request all of their funds from the Plan Administrator within 30 days of separation from employment. This would normally require a make-up of 2.35% (10% penalty less 7.65% previous savings on social security taxes). However, individuals who have met their FICA salaiy limit before retiring would receive an 8.55% (10% penalty - 1.45% savings) reimbursement for amounts over the limit.
*	Please consult your tax advisor for information regarding the taxability of Plan distributions.
•	Loans - for loan provisions, contact the BENCOR Administrative Services at 1-888-258-3422. . ■.	• 1 t	,	,
DROP Participants’ Terminal Sick Leave Pay/Annual Leave will be processed as follows:
•	Annual Leave - Employees participating in DROP receive their annual leave as a lump sum payment at the time of enrollment in DROP. Annual leave will be paid into the “BENCOR NATIONAL PLAN” subject to contribution limits. Any annual leave in excess of Plan contribution limits will be paid to the participant subject to Federal tax and related payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare). The participant does not have access to this money until the end of DROP - other than through' loan provisions. This dollar amount will be included in the employee s compensation for retirement benefit calculation purposes (FRS).
•	Terminal Sick Leave Pay - An employee participating in DROP will have a percentage of his/her accumulated sick leave pay balance deposited into their account each year of DROP. For example, an employee participating in DROP for a period of five (5) years will have terminal sick leave pay deposited into their account as follows:	... . •
Year 1 r ?0% of balance of terminal sick leave
Year 2	25%	Qf balance of terminal sick	leave

Year 5	100%	of balance of terminal sick	leave

Employees terminating prior to the fifth year of DROP will have 100% of their remaining eligible sick leave balance paid into the Plan, subject to contribution limits. Any excess amount will be paid to the participant, subject to ail applicable taxes. This method of payment allows employees to take maximum advantage of Federal tax law. .
Existing DROP participants (entered DROP prior to 1/1/2003) will have their special pay balance paid into the Plan subject to contribution limits at the end of DROP. Any excess amount will be paid to the participant, subject to all applicable taxes.
