ARTICLE 15.	SIGN-UPS
147.	Section 15.1 The parties agree that force levels and stability of runs are factors in sign-up problems (e.g. disruption of operations). If after the next two sign-ups following the ratification of this MOU, there has been an opportunity to experience the force level and stability effect, and there is still a problem with sign-ups, the sign-ups may be shifted to evenings or Saturdays.
148.	Section 15.2 There shall be one general sign-up and three division sign-ups each calendar year at dates to be agreed upon between the Union and the Director of Transportation. Any variation from this pattern will be mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Director of Transportation.

When the Division dispatcher has knowledge of an open run due to no operator or has received notification from the Yard Starter (or the shop supervisor in the absence of a yard starter) that there will be a shortage of equipment available for the next day’s AM pull-out, the Division dispatcher can then reassign an SDR operator from his/her regular assigned run to another run for that day.
The method of reassignment shall be:
1.	To a run that finishes earlier or within one (1) hours of the regularly assigned run.
2.	Reassignment of SDR runs shall be a rotation basis only. All SDR runs shall be utilized first before a second application/reassignment occurs for any specific SDR runs.
3.	Operators on SDR runs shall be paid the higher of the regular run or the run reassigned to for that day, plus $1.00 per hour premium for the run change.
4.	Reassignment of SDR runs shall be applied only after the extraboard is exhausted.
The Division Manager and the Division Chairman, to ensure compliance, will review these daily procedures.
Section 15.6 Expert Operator Premium
An “Expert Operator” is defined as a full time or part time employee who has worked consecutively for five (5) years in one location (e.g. Woods, Flynn, etc). Expert Operators must also individually qualify for the Accident Incentive Program as defined in Article 36.
The adjusted effective qualifying period will be an annual period beginning on the second full pay period in January of each year. An operator who elects to sign out of the division after the January qualifying date, and upon transfer to the new division, will no longer be eligible for the premium pay.
Operators performing burn-ins do not have to meet the requirement, as set forth in the Accident Incentive Program, requiring a specific amount of hours be spent operating a vehicle in revenue service.
Having met the above stated requirements, and remaining in the location, the operator will be paid the premium in each succeeding year for which they qualify. If an operator is temporarily moved from his/her division for the

ARTICLE 18. WORK ON REGULAR DAY OFF (RDO)
215.	Section 18.1 Policy. It is MUNI’s desire that the days off scheduled for an operator remain available to the operator for non-work activities. However it is recognized occasionally that MUNI’s needs for operators will not be met from the extra board and the use of volunteer operators working on their day off may be necessary.
216.	Section 18.2 Ineligibility for Work on RDO. An operator who within the last 10 scheduled work days has:
217.	(1) been AWOL and said AWOL is not excused by the Division Manager, or

absences (as defined below) in addition to working time in the previously scheduled work week totaling 40 hours.
222.	Authorized absences include vacation, holidays, jury duty leave, maternity
leave, bereavement leave and absences pursuant to section 9.7(f). For operators with 80 or more hours accumulated sick leave, authorized absences will include sick leave with pay. For operators with less than 80 hours accumulated sick leave, authorized absences will not include sick leave with pay. For the purpose of this section sick leave without pay will not be included as authorized absences. The distribution and eligibility for RDO work shall be subject to rules established by the Director of Transportation after consultation with the Union. RDO assignments shall be made first from the RDO list in the division. If the RDO list in the division is exhausted, the Division Dispatcher may call from other division's RDO lists, with the first priority given to operators on the same mode of equipment.

Operators required to go to the Instruction School on their own time shall be paid travel time to and from their division at applicable rate. If an operator switches modes of equipment more than once in a three year period, on the second or subsequent switches he or she will be permitted 5 days of training only at his or her regular rate of pay. Training required thereafter shall be on the operator's own time.
Section 19.2 Retraining After Personal Leave.
225.	If an operator is granted personal leave for a period of 60 days or more, any
retraining required shall be on the operator's own time.

The proposals will be given to the Union and meet and confer sessions shall be held as to all rules that significantly affect terms and conditions of employment.
234.	In an emergency, MUNI management may give immediate effect to a rule or
policy if it determines that immediate imposition is necessary for the safety of passengers or operators or the operational sufficiency of the system. The time period for which the emergency is in force will be indicated on the order announcing the emergency rule or policy. An emergency rule or policy may not remain in force for longer than 30 days unless reissued by MUNI management after discussions with the Union.
ARTICLE 23.	DISCIPLINE
Section 23.1 Standards for Discipline.
235.	The MTA agrees that in imposing discipline the Director of Transportation
will continue to act in a fair and equitable manner and any punishment will be related to the offense committed with due regard for the employee's past record. Employees shall be entitled to a Skelly hearing prior to charges

while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, the unlawful use or possession of a drug or alcoholic beverage, mishandling of funds, vicious conduct, or serious willful abuse of MUNI equipment, any discipline proposed must be preceded by a charge in writing communicated to the individual employee and the Union simultaneously. In the case of the major offenses mentioned above, the charge shall be communicated to the individual employee and the Union as soon as possible. A charge against an employee shall contain the precise offense with which the operator is being charged and the specific rule the operator has been alleged to have violated. Failure to cite the specific rule(s) will result in the charge being waived. The charge must be communicated to the employee and the Union not later than 14 calendar days after MUNI had knowledge of the event or occurrence charged or the offense will be deemed waived.
Section 23.3 Timing of Discipline.
239.	If an employee raises a grievance in connection with any proposed
discipline, except in cases of an operator reporting to work or operating a MUNI vehicle while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or any drug, or under the combined influence of an alcoholic beverage and any drug, the unlawful use or possession of a drug or alcoholic beverage, mishandling of funds, vicious conduct, or serious willful abuse of MUNI equipment, the discipline will not be carried out unless, at the conclusion of the grievance procedure, it is determined that the discipline is appropriate.
240.	If, during the grievance procedure, an extension is requested by the Union,
the employee shall be “Off the Clock” for the period of the extension and until the next available hearing or meeting date at the appropriate step in the Memorandum of Understanding Between

	grievance procedure. If the extension is requested by management, the employee shall remain “On the Clock”.
241.	After the expiration of one year after the imposition of discipline, no reference may be made to that entry in any future disciplinary proceeding. Section 23.4 Passenger Service Reports, (PSRs)
242.	(a) The parties acknowledge the list of Major PSR’s currently in use, and which are attached as an Appendix to this agreement. MUNI may modify the list of major PSR’s upon 14 days notice to the union, subject to the requirements of Meyers, Milias Brown Act.
243.	(b) Minor PSRs will be discussed with the operator and filed for a period of 12 months with no record entry made. When an operator has received a total of five minor reports within the previous 12 months or three minor reports of a similar nature within the previous 12 months, the operator will receive a formal warning, to be entered on the personnel record, that, the next PSR received will be treated as a major report.
244.	(c) After a finding by the department against an operator based on a Major or sufficient number of Minor PSR’s as described above, the findings shall be referred to a hearing officer to be selected by the Director of Transportation.
245.	(d) Before an operator is suspended or terminated as a result of a major passenger service report, the operator shall have the right to be heard and the right to face his or her accusers or witnesses subject to (e) below, and may be accompanied by a Union Representative at the hearing. Hearings shall be held at a MUNI leased or owned property convenient to complainant and witnesses, and shall be scheduled at a time when complainant, witnesses and the operator can attend. The complainant shall have the right to be present throughout all phases of the hearing except for the hearing officers final determination.
246.	(e) If a hearing is scheduled at a time when the operator can attend, and if the operator has been properly notified and proper arrangements made for relief, and the operator fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer may hear the testimony of the complainant and the witnesses, who may be examined by the Union representative. Under these circumstances, the hearing officer may make a decision regarding the merits of the PSR in the absence of the operator and/or the Union. The weight given to testimony provided in the absence of the operator shall be at the discretion of the hearing officer. Memorandum of Understanding Between Transport Workers Union, Local 250-A (9163) and Municipal Transportation Agency July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2008 36
247.	(f) If a PSR is appealed to the grievance procedure, and, if at the completion of the grievance procedure it is determined that the operator was not responsible for the behavior charged, the PSR shall not be entered into the operator's record.
248.	(g) No record shall be made relating to a PSR if the PSR is anonymous.
249.	(h) The parties agree that it may cause a hardship for some passengers to appear during normal working hours (8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.) for a hearing on a PSR. Therefore, in addition to holding hearings during normal work hours, MUNI may hold PSR hearings beyond normal business hours when required to provide for complainant testimony.
250.	(i) Management shall keep a record of the name of the complaining passenger, nature of complaint and date of complaint for a period of 12 months. If a passenger has a record of making complaints against operators, said record shall be taken into account in evaluating that passenger's complaints. For the purpose of representing an employee in connection with a PSR, the Union may review the record relating to prior complaints by the passenger, if any.
251.	(j) In reviewing major PSRs, the employee's record of major PSRs over the prior 36 months may be considered.
252.	(k) PSR Joint Study MUNI agrees to establish a Joint Union/Management Task Force to review and evaluate the fairness and efficiency of the PSR Process. The Task Force shall prepare a report of its findings and recommendations within 90 days after the Task Force is formed. (See Attachment B). Section 23.5 Lateness and Absence Without Leave (AWOL) Program
253.	It is jointly recognized by MUNI and TWU that the most effective approach to the lateness and Absence Without Leave (AWOL) problem is to prevent them from happening. Such an approach can most effectively be introduced by managerial behavior dealing with operators as individuals rather than merely applying formulas of punishment for behavior. The Director of Transportation recognizes that substantial training of managers in managing would benefit the department.
254.	The steps needed to affect change will take more time than is available in the present negotiations. A joint committee is hereby established to develop a new lateness and Absence Without Leave (AWOL) Prevention Program. While the steps to achieve the new program are not clear, the following are agreed to be part of the program: Memorandum of Understanding Between Transport Workers Union, Local 250-A (9163) and Municipal Transportation Agency July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2008 37
255.	(a) Statistics will be maintained focusing on individuals and individual
behavior. The Director of Transportation recognizes that attention by managers to preventing lateness and Absence Without Leave (AWOL) would benefit the department.
256.	(b) If an operator reports late for duty without approval but does report and
takes a scheduled non-overtime run, such late reports will be tracked and recorded on a rolling five month period with the disciplinary procedures up to the following:
257.	i. First violation within a five (5) month period - oral warning
258.	ii. Second violation within a five (5) month period - written warning of
suspension
259.	iii. Third violation within a five month period - up to five 5 day suspension
260.	iv. Fourth violation within a five (5) month period - up to ten 10 day
suspension
261.	v. Fifth violation within a five (5) month period - up to termination
262.	(c) When an operator fails to report for duty, and does not receive approval,
the absence will be defined as a Absence Without Leave (AWOL) and will be tracked and recorded on a rolling eight (8) month period with the disciplinary procedures up to the following:
263.	i. First violation within an eight (8) month period - Discipline up to a two
(2) day suspension
264.	ii. Second violation within an eight (8) month period - Discipline up to a
ten (10) day suspension
265.	iii. Third or further violation within an eight (8) month period - Discipline
up to termination.
266.	(d) The Joint Committee will explore the possibility of developing a point
system in lieu of suspensions for lateness and Absence Without Leave (AWOL). If lateness and Absence Without Leave (AWOL) are not reduced, thereby avoiding points, discharge will result. This system, when introduced, will result in substantial savings because overtime working will be reduced. The savings can be used to introduce an incentive program for the great majority of operators who are not late or Absence Without Leave (AWOL).

The Committee shall meet and report back no later than December 1, 2000. Absent an agreement on a new policy, the provisions of ‘b’ above will be implemented on 12/29/2000.
Section 23.6 Accidents.
On the occurrence of an accident, the Division Safety Instructor shall review and determine the category into which the accident falls and whether the accident was "avoidable" or "unavoidable".
Accidents are divided into two categories:
Group (a): Serious or major accidents, accidents involving serious injuries and accidents involving a violation of traffic laws or MUNI safety rules. Examples of Group “a” accidents are attached as Appendix F.
Group (b): All other accidents.
An Operator involved in a Group (a) accident who, after proper investigation, is charged by his Division Manager with that accident may appeal that decision to the Accident Review Board ("ARB"). This appeal must be made in writing within nine business days of being charged. The ARB will determine if the operator contributed to the cause of the accident.
An Operator involved in a Group (b) accident which is determined to be avoidable by the Division Safety Instructor will be referred to the training department for needed training. The Operator may appeal an avoidable determination to the ARB. This appeal must be made in writing within nine business days of such determination by the Division Safety Instructor
All hearings by the ARB shall be completed within 20 business days of the date the appeal is filed.
The ARB shall consist of 3 members. One selected by the Union, one selected by MUNI management, and an independent neutral. The independent neutral will be paid equally by both parties. The neutral will be selected from a list to be agreed upon by both the Union and MUNI management.
Should any member of the panel above become unavailable during the life of the MOU, replacement members may be selected. Such individuals shall have transit investigation experience, and may include senior safety officers of major public transit systems and safety oversight agencies.

278.	The ARB will be supplied with all documents relevant to the case and may call for the presence of any relevant witnesses requested by the parties. All testimony before the ARB will be sworn and only information relevant to the facts of the accident will be admissible. Nothing in this section shall preclude any party (the MTA, the Union, and/or the Employee) from obtaining its own representation, provided that each party provides notice and bears its own costs and fees. Upon the request of any party, the hearing may be transcribed, provided that the requesting party shall pay for the cost of the court reporter. Each party shall bear its own costs for copies of the transcript.
279.	The fact that a claim has been settled, and the amount of the settlement shall not be considered in determining fault for an accident.
280.	If, after a hearing, the ARB determines that the operator contributed to the cause of the accident, any appeal of discipline relating to the accident shall be initiated at Step 3. The only issue that may be raised in the grievance procedure is the extent of the discipline appropriate in the case.
281.	The provisions of the MOU dealing with accidents may be reopened as of January 1, 2002 by either party to resolve any problems with the above procedures.
282.	The timelines of the above procedure shall be mandatory, and may be waived only in exceptional cases by mutual agreement. Failure by the MTA to meet the timelines set forth above shall render any discipline based upon that accident null and void. Failure by the union or the employee to meet the above timelines shall waive any challenge by the employee or union to the discipline imposed.
283.	Within sixty (60) days of approval of this MOU by the MTA Board, the parties agree to meet and confer over revisions to General Bulletin 85-10. Section 23.7 Loss of Funds.

	been suspended or discharged; and no entry shall be made in the employee's personnel record of such suspension or discharge. Section 23.9 Notification to Operators
286.	Notification to operators through Certified Mail will be used for: a.	Step 3 Dismissal/Termination Cases (scheduling and decisions) b.	Civil Service Rule 22 Hearing c.	Arbitration
287.	Notification of Operators for initial charges or Step 2 scheduling or decision will not be Certified Mail.
288.

SAFE DRIVER INCENTIVE PILOT TEST PROGRAM
For each calendar month during which a permanent full-time 9163 Transit Operator has driven in revenue service without any “absences” and no “accidents,” he/she shall earn a $50.00 Safe Driver Incentive Bonus. (Permanent part-time Transit Operators must have driven in revenue service without any “absences” and no “accidents,” to earn a $25.00 Safe Driver Incentive Bonus.)
This Safe Driver Incentive Bonus will be included in a paycheck during the second calendar month immediately following the month in which the incentive bonus was earned. This incentive bonus shall not be considered as part of an employee’s compensation for the purpose of computing retirement benefits, and shall be subject to all applicable taxes.
For purposes of this section, “absences” are exclusive of legal holidays, vacations and floating holidays that are approved in advance, and “accidents” include both “avoidable” and “unavoidable” accidents.
The parties have agreed to implement this Safe Driver Incentive Program as a “pilot” initiative to reduce vehicle accidents and improve employee attendance. This program shall remain in effect until June 30, 2005. No later than April 30, 2005, the parties shall meet and evaluate the impact this “test” program has had on reducing vehicle accidents and improving overall Operator attendance. This program may be extended by the mutual written agreement of the parties for the duration of this agreement. If, however, the parties are unable to reach agreement to extend the program, it shall terminate on June 30, 2005. If this program is not extended, Operators shall be paid incentive bonuses for qualifying performance through June 30, 2005. Termination of this pilot program shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

Efforts will be made by TWU and MUNI to recruit senior, experienced operators to fill these important positions. The Director of Transportation recognizes that additional training for supervisors and managers covering the same matters covered in operator training would be beneficial.
446.	No operator will be held responsible for failing to do any part of her/his job
which is governed by a rule or regulation of MUNI unless the alleged rule/regulation violation has been covered in training or provided to the operator in writing.

The MTA reserves the right to take any action necessary to comply therewith.
448.	The MTA agrees to provide notice to the Union prior to taking an action
required by the provisions of the ADA which is in conflict with the provisions of this MOU, and, to meet and confer with the Union on request.
ARTICLE 39.	MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT
449.	Benefits of employment established by this Memorandum of Understanding

APPENDIX C	- PRIVATIZATION
August 1, 1986 - PRIVATIZATION
This section acknowledges the Public Utilities Commission policy regarding privatization of Municipal Railway transit service adopted in Resolution 86-0103 March 25, 1986 is as follows:
The Public Utilities Commission reaffirms its commitment to maintain the most cost effective means of providing transportation and transportation related services, specifically to include fair and adequate consideration of the private enterprise providers’ role therein.
The Public Utilities Commission continues the policy of seeking and considering the widest possible range of public input and comment, especially from private sector providers, in the planning and decision making process.
In furtherance of these goals, the Public Utilities Commission hereby directs the staff to: a. Further develop a model of the “full costs” of transportation and transportation related services now being provided by the Municipal Railway in order to provide an improved method of making valid cost comparisons between the costs of Municipal Railway provided services and the costs of providing these services through private sector providers who have the capability of doing so.
b.	Review the process of soliciting private sector input into the planning and decision making of the Public Utilities Commission with respect to the Municipal Railway and to eliminate any constraints to such input as may exist.
c.	Establish, with the approval of the commission, a fair and effective means of resolving the complaints of any private sector provider who believes that private sector opportunities to reduce cost while maintaining service levels and fare structures have not been fairly or adequately considered by the Public Utilities Commission or staff.
The Commission has at various times executed 13 (c) agreements in connection with UMTA grants. The Commission will adhere to the terms of such agreements, including terms relating to the rights of employees and their Union, which may be involved in the process of considering the privatization of Municipal Railway transit service. Local 250A will be informed whenever an issue involving 13 (c) agreements of which it is a party is under active review.

ATTACHMENT A
ATTACHMENT A - Basic Wage Rates 2004-2005
Basic Wage Rates for 2004-2005
San Francisco Charter Section A8.404(b) provides that the base wage rate for Transit Operators shall not be in excess of the average of the two highest wage schedules for comparable jurisdictions. For fiscal years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, the two highest wage schedules for comparable jurisdictions are projected to be Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (“SCVTA”) and Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (”MBTA”).
On August 5, 2003, the Municipal Transportation Agency (“MTA”) certified the two highest wage schedules for comparable employees in effect as of July 1, 2003. The SCVTA was one of the two highest comparable transit agencies. At that time, the SCVTA had negotiated a labor agreement with its transit operator union that required an additional 5% wage increase (or $1.26) on February 2, 2004. The increase would have set the hourly wage rate at $26.10 per hour. Based on the recalculated average of the two highest wage schedules, including this scheduled increase, the MTA certified that its transit operator wages would be increased from $24.815 to $25.445 on February 2, 2004. This amounts to a 2.54% wage increase.
On January 8, 2004, the General Manager of the SCVTA notified the SCVTA Board of Directors that the terms and conditions of the transit operators’ labor agreement had been amended. The labor agreement was opened up for re-negotiation because of fiscal shortfalls facing the agency. Because the SCVTA re-negotiated its labor agreement, SCVTA transit operators received only a 1.25% wage increase on February 2, 2004, instead of the expected 5% increase.
As a result of SCVTA’s re-negotiated labor agreement, the average of the two highest wage schedules for comparable jurisdictions was reduced as follows:
January 31, 2004 July 1, 2004 September 1, 2004 November 1, 2004 July 1, 2005 November 1, 2005	$24.97/hour $25.34/hour $25.66/hour $25.825/hour $26.335/hour $26.50/hour
Since January 31, 2004, the base wage rate for Transit Operators has been $25.445/hour. As a result of SCVTA’s contract re-negotiations, this base wage rate exceeds the revised “average wage rate” of $24.97/hour for the period January 31, 2004 through June 30, 2004, and will exceed the revised “average wage rate” of $25.34/hour for the period July 1, 2004 through August 31, 2004. On September 1, 2004, the average wage rate of $25.66/hour will exceed the current $25.445/hour wage rate paid to Transit Operators.

Transport Workers Union, Local 250-A (9163) and Municipal Transportation Agency
July 1, 2004 - June 30, 2008
83
ATTACHMENT A
In a letter dated April 13, 2004, the MTA informed the union of the change in the “average wage rate”. Based on discussions with the union at that time, the MTA decided not to address the matter and chose to defer further discussions until the FY 2004-2005 contract negotiations. Now, in recognition of the Transport Workers Union, Local 250’s request that the MTA not reduce transit operator wages from $25.445 to $25.34 on July 1, 2004, and the MTA’s desire to recoup any wage payments in excess of the average wage rate for the period from January 1, 2004 through August 31, 2004, the parties have entered into the following agreement.
Effective immediately, Transit Operators and Trainees shall not receive any further wage increases during the period from January 31, 2004 through April 22, 2005, so that the MTA can recoup the approximate $1,360,847.00 in total excess wage payments made to Transit Operators and Trainees for the period from January 31, 2004 through August 31, 2004. The next wage increase shall become effective on April 23, 2005, based on the “average wage rate” of the two highest comparable jurisdictions then in effect, and shall be paid during the first payroll period following April 22, 2005. Wage increases after April 22, 2005 shall be made according to the provisions of Section 4.1 Basic Wage Rates of this agreement.
