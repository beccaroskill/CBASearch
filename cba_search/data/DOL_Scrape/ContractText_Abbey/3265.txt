16
B.	Each teacher is entitled to full rights of citizenship, and no religious or political activities of any such teacher outside the regular hours of employment, or the lack thereof, will be grounds for any discipline or discrimination with respect to the professional employment of such person.
C.	The Board and the Association agree that academic freedom is essential to the fulfillment of the purpose of the Frederick County School System, and they acknowledge the fundamental need to protect teachers from censorship or restraint which might interfere with their obligations to present fairly all sides of issues in their teaching functions.

b.	If the associate superintendent determines that a formal remediation plan is necessary, the appropriate administrative personnel and the teacher will develop a specific written plan for improvement of the noted deficiencies.

ARTICLE X	- PERSONNEL EMPLOYMENT
A.	1. All new teachers or reinstated teachers will be placed on the proper step of the salary schedule according to their certification status, experience, and education.
a In calculating experience, newly hired teachers who have worked one-half (1/2) year or more of a work year for their prior employer, will be given credit for a full year. The one-half (1/2) year cutoff date for experience credit will be the first day of the second semester.
b All currently hired teachers who work one-half (1/2) year or more of the work year shall be given credit for a full year.
c All teachers hired to fill vacancies which they have served in for one-half (1/2) year or more of a work year shall be given experience credit for a full year and paid a pro-rated salary for the actual period worked.
d The Board shall recognize courses, programs, and degrees from institutions which have accreditation accepted by the Maryland State Department of Education.
2.	No more than two (2) persons will be employed in a full-time position.
3.	Credit will be given from previous outside teaching experience in duly accredited schools upon initial employment in accordance with the provisions of Article V. Additional credit not to exceed two (2) years for military experience, or alternative civilian service required by the Selective Service System, and not to exceed two (2) years for appropriate Peace Corps, VISTA, or National Teaching Corps work, and time spent on a Fulbright Scholarship will be given upon initial employment.
4.	All part-time teachers (.5 or more) shall receive health and life insurance benefits, as governed by their employment. Salary, sick leave, and personal leave shall be prorated for all part-time teachers regardless of percentage of time employed.
B.	1. Up to all the maximums set forth in section A above including the exclusion of longevity increments:
a.	Teachers with previous teaching experience in the Frederick County school system will, upon returning to the system, receive equivalent credit on the salary schedule for all subsequent outside teaching experience, military experience, or alternative civilian service required by the Selective Service System, Peace Corps, VISTA, or National Teacher Training Corps work, and time spent on a Fulbright Scholarship.
b.	Subject to certification status, such teachers who have not been engaged in other teaching or other activities indicated above will, upon return
20
ing to the system, be restored to the next position on the salary schedule above that at which they left.
2.	Previously accumulated unused sick leave days will be restored to all teachers returning from an approved leave of absence.
C.	In any reduction in the bargaining unit as a result of budgetary actions or curriculum and/or administrative organization, every effort will be made to transfer affected teachers to other similar positions within the school system where vacancies exist and for which the affected teachers are certified.
1.	If no similar positions are available, non-tenured teachers in the subjects and/or grade levels affected will be laid off or separated from the active employment rolls prior to tenured teachers in the same subjects and/or grade levels. If it becomes necessary to lay off tenured teachers, they shall be laid off in the inverse order of their seniority. An appropriate seniority list will be made available for inspection when a tenured teacher has been laid off and disputes a seniority ranking. The seniority list will be developed from the last date of employment and furnished to the Association. If there is a tie, the affected teachers will have seniority calculated as defined in Article I.B.
Teachers on an unpaid leave of absence shall retain accrued seniority. Teachers on military leave, Association leave, and on lay-off shall continue to accrue seniority during that time.
A county-wide list of all certificated personnel employed as of July 1 of each year shall be compiled and available upon request of FCTA. The list will indicate name, date of first employment, date of current employment, and cost center.
2.	Teachers on lay-off shall be placed on a priority recall list in accordance with their seniority. The teachers shall be recalled as vacancies become available in accordance with their position on the list and their certification for said vacancies.
3.	When vacancies become available, the teacher will be notified of the vacancy by certified mail sent to the last known address. The teacher so notified shall notify the responsible administrator, in writing, in not more than ten (10) days after receipt of notification of the vacancy as to whether or not the position will be accepted. The teacher may decline the first offer of employ-ment. If the teacher declines the second offer of a position, reemployment rights shall be forfeited. All teachers shall remain on the priority recall list for a maximum of three (3) years.
4.	While a lay-off continues, no new teachers shall be hired except in those unique circumstances where (a) there are no teachers on the priority recall list qualified to fill the vacancy, or (b) all qualified teachers on the priority recall list decline the offer to fill the vacancy.
21
5.	Any lay-off due to reduction-in-force shall not be subject to any dismissal procedure required elsewhere in this Agreement.
6.	Teachers recalled under these provisions shall have restored to them all previously accrued sick leave and personal leave.
7.	The Board and the Association recognize that appropriate governmental agencies which have jurisdiction may promulgate rulings and/or regulations that may impact this Article. If such rulings or regulations cause any provisions to be in conflict, the parties shall meet within ten (10) days for the purpose of renegotiating only the provision(s) held to be contrary.
ARTICLE XI	- TRANSFERS
A.	A vacancy posting calendar will be identified annually by the end of the first week of January. Principals will notify their directors of all vacancies that develop in their buildings. The directors will verify to Human Resources Office the positions eligible for posting for the voluntary transfer process. All teachers who have completed at least one (1) year of satisfactory experience as evidenced by the evaluation cycle, teachers returning from extended leave and excessed teachers are eligible to participate in the transfer process if they hold the appropriate certification for a posted vacancy. Vacancies will only be advertised once during the transfer process. The principal shall consult with the appropriate director when requesting a transfer of a nontenured teacher.

Posting will occur around the 15th of each indicated month. Announcements will include closing dates for notification of candidates not selected for a posted position. If teachers remain on the “To Be Placed List” certain related positions may not be resolved in the window period.
2.	The following positions when not filled by staff within a building will be posted at the time they occur for ten (10) days. All current FCPS teachers will have an opportunity to apply for a transfer to these assignments:
•	Reading Specialist
•	Guidance Counselor
•	Media Specialist
•	School Support Teacher
3.	Teachers requesting an increase/decrease in their assignment should use this transfer process to achieve their desired increase/decrease in assignment. The job share option (Article XXXIV) is also available as a means for a teacher to request a reduction in assignment. The teacher is responsible to identify the teacher with whom they wish to partner, as well as the position, 22 within the published timelines.

After the sabbatical has been completed, the teacher shall present to the executive director of human resources adequate verification of program completion.
G.	A teacher on sabbatical leave (either for one-half [1/2] of a school year or for a full school year) will be paid by the Board at fifty (50) percent of the salary rate which the teacher would have received if the teacher had remained on active duty, provided that such teacher agrees to return to employment in the Frederick County School System for a period of one (1) year. Should the teacher not return to the service of the Board, the teacher will be required to refund the salary granted for sabbatical leave.
H.	Upon return from sabbatical leave, a teacher will be placed on the salary schedule at the level which the teacher would have achieved had the teacher remained actively employed in the system during the period of absence.

2.	Aggrieved person

Both parties agree that these proceedings will be kept as informal and confidential as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.
C.	Procedure

A teacher with a grievance shall first discuss it with the principal or immediate superior directly, the objective being an informal resolution to the matter.
Level One
1.	A teacher may present a grievance directly to the principal or immediate superior within twenty (20) days of first occurrence or first reasonable knowledge of alleged act. Such grievance must be in writing, signed by the FCTA president and must state specifically that this grievance procedure is being invoked.

If the Association determined that the grievance is meritorious, it may submit the grievance to arbitration no later than forty (40) days after receipt by the superintendent. If the Association fails to serve such notice of its intention to arbitrate within this time limitation, the grievance shall be considered settled. No individual employee shall have the right to invoke this arbitration procedure.
D.	Selection of Arbitrator
1.	If the Association and the Board are unable to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator within seven (7) calendar days after the Association’s notice of appeal to arbitration, the Association shall submit the grievance to arbitration under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.

The arbitrator shall have no authority to modify any provision, or to hear or decide on more than one grievance without the mutual consent of the Board and the Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the aggrieved person, the Association, and the Board.
E.	Miscellaneous
1.	The number of days indicated at each level shall be considered as a maximum and every effort shall be made to expedite this process. The time limits, however, may be extended by mutual agreement.
2.	In the event a grievance is filed at such time that it cannot be processed through all the steps in this grievance procedure by the end of the school
51
year, the time limits set forth herein shall be waived to that the grievance procedure may be exhausted as soon as it is practicable following the end of the school year.
3.	The Association and the Board shall each bear its own expenses in these arbitration proceedings, except that they shall share equally the fee and other expenses of the arbitrator in connection with the grievance submitted.
4.	By mutual agreement of the Association and the Board, the time limits stated herein may be compromised to allow the collection of pertinent information and in the interest of prudent resolution of the grievance.
5.	If a grievance affects a group or class of teachers, it may be initially filed with the superintendent at Level I\vo.
6.	Any aggrieved person may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure alone or, with a representative(s) selected or approved by the Association, and the Association shall have the right to be present and to state its views at all stages of the grievance procedure.
7.	No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the Board or by any member of the administration against any aggrieved person, any representative, any member of the Association, or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
8.	All documents, communications and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed in a separate grievance file and shall not be kept in the personnel file of any of the participants.

B.	This Agreement constitutes Board policy for the term of said Agreement, and the Board will carry out the commitments contained herein and give them full force and effect as Board policy. The Board will amend its written policies and take
