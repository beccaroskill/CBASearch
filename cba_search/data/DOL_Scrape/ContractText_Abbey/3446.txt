(f)	Any disputes concerning the process in the Expedited Grievance Arbitration procedure will be resolved pursuant to the Standard Arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
(8)	The Union acknowledges the concern expressed by the Agency that an excessive number of cases may be appealed to the expedited arbitration process. If in any calendar year, the number of expedited arbitration cases exceeds the number of regular arbitrations, the Union, upon request, agrees to meet with the Agency to negotiate a maximum number of expedited arbitration cases to be heard each year. If a number cannot be reached, the matter will be submitted to a third party, appointed by the FMCS, whose decision shall be binding.
C.	GRIEVANCE TIME LIMITS. The following procedures will apply to time limits set out in the Grievance Procedure in the Employee Guidelines dated December 1, 1994.
(1)	The time limits shall be followed unless extended by mutual agreement. Any mutual agreement to extend the time limits shall extend the forty-five (45) working day time limit for a final grievance answer established in this subsection. In the absence of such mutual agreement to extend the time limits, the time limits set out below shall apply.
(2)	Failure of the Union to appeal the grievance to the next step of the Grievance Procedure within the time limit will result in the grievance being withdrawn and closed. Failure of the Agency to answer a written grievance, with rationale, within said time limits will result in the grievance being advanced to the next step of the Grievance Procedure, subject to the provisions contained in this subsection relating to a final answer to the grievance.
(3)	If the Union has appealed the grievance within the established time limits or the grievance has been advanced in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and the Agency has not given a final answer to the grievance within forty-five (45) working days of the date the written grievance was filed (subject to the time limit extension provisions contained in this subsection), the grievance will be granted in favor of the employee. Failure of the Union to appeal a final answer to arbitration within forty-five (45) calendar days as provided in this Agreement, will result in the grievance being withdrawn and closed.
(4)	“Working days,” as used in this subsection, shall mean Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.
(5)	The provisions of this subsection shall apply to grievances filed in writing on or after November 1, 1990.

5
or prevent, the joining of the Union by any person or persons employed by the Agency, who is qualified to become a member of the Union, and it will be entirely satisfactory to the Agency if they should so join. The Agency will neither discharge nor discriminate against any employee because of his connection with the Union.
The Union agrees that it will not in any way interfere with or limit the right of the Agency to discharge or discipline its employees where sufficient cause can be shown, except for membership in the Union.
It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that as a condition of continuous employment, all persons who are hereafter employed by the Agency in the unit which is the subject of this Agreement shall become members of the Union not later than the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following the beginning of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is later; that the continued employment by the Agency in said unit of persons who are already members in good standing of the Union shall be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the periodic dues of the Union.
The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such required time shall obligate the Agency, upon written notice from the Union to such effect and to the further effect that Union membership was available to such person on the same terms and conditions generally available to other members, to forthwith discharge such persons. Further, the failure of any person to maintain his Union membership in good standing as required herein shall, upon written notice to the Agency by the Union to such effect, obligate the Agency to discharge such person.
The Agency shall furnish to all new employees, the name, address, telephone number, regular office hours of the Union, and a written copy of the provision of this Section 5 of the Agreement.

The Committee will work subject to the following:
1.	There will be an equal number of Union and Management Committee Members. Total committee membership will not exceed ten (10).
2.	The President of Local 788 ATU will be a member of the Committee; and, within seven (7) days following the ratification of this Agreement, will appoint the other Union representatives to the Committee.

If during such period, he is relieved from the performance of his regular work or if the Agency elects that said period be carried on without relieving the employee from his regular work, he shall be paid for such period at the prevailing federal minimum wage for the number of hours required by the Agency.
SECTION 11.	WAGE RATES FOR POSITION CHANGE. Any employee who is taken from his regular position and placed in another position shall receive the rate of pay of the new position for the full time he occupies such position, unless the rate of pay of the new position is lower than his regular rate of pay, in which case he shall receive his regular rate of pay while occupying the new position, except that any employee desiring to familiarize himself with the duties of any other position than his regular position, may, upon filing a request in writing, be placed in any other position than his regular position at his regular rate of pay for periods not to exceed ninety (90) days; provided, however, that any employee who may become incapacitated, or who is unable for any reason to continue in his regular position, may, upon the written request of such employee, be assigned to another position carrying a lower rate of pay than his regular rate of pay, in which case, he shall receive the lower rate of pay.
A.	JOB CLASSIFICATION CHANGES.

An employee who, in connection with his duties, is required to appear at police headquarters or any law enforcement agency, shall be paid at the overtime rate for time spent traveling from his home to police headquarters and return to his home, plus the actual time spent at police headquarters if he works his run or if it is his regular or scheduled day off. If unable to work his run, he shall be paid the time called for on his regular run and not be required to work another run or a piece of work.
B. ASSAULT PAY. Whenever any operator of a bus covered by this Agreement becomes unable to perform his regular duties, through no fault of his own, by reason of injury intentionally inflicted upon him and arising out of, and in the course of his employment with the Agency, compensable under the Worker’s Compensation Law, the Agency will pay such employee a supplemental benefit equal to the difference between his normal weekly wage and the disability benefits to which he is entitled under said law, for a period of absence from work due to the same injury not exceeding fifty-two (52) weeks. Payments herein provided for shall be prorated when absence from work due to such injury is for partial weeks. The foregoing obligation of the Agency to pay such employee for absence from work due to such injury the foregoing supplemental benefits shall not be deemed to be the payment of wages to said employee within the meaning of Paragraph 3, Section 287.160 (Revised Statutes of Missouri, 1959) of the said Workers’ Compensation Law, and the Agency hereby waives and forgoes any right it may have under said law to claim credit therefore against any of the various disability benefit liabilities imposed upon it by said law in favor of such employee.

SECTION 21.	A. OPERATOR SENIORITY & SYSTEM SELECTION.
Seniority of each of the full-time operators covered by this Agreement shall be on a system basis. The years of service of each of the full-time operators with each of their respective, immediate predecessor transit companies shall be counted from date of last employment and given full credit in the seniority roster. There shall be a system selection by the operators every year effective the first Monday following Thanksgiving Day of each year, for the purpose of selecting the station at which operators desire to work, except that upon request by the Union, an interim system selection pick shall be held when a station has been abandoned or consolidated or a major bus line shifted from one station to another or a major change in scheduling made. At least one (1) month prior to every such system selection of work, the Agency shall post a notice at all stations announcing that a system selection of stations will be held at some central location. In accordance with a Master System Seniority List, also posted by the Agency, the operator with the highest seniority in service on the system may select any station of his choice, provided he is qualified for the work selected. The operator with the next highest seniority in service may then make his selection, and so on down the seniority list.
The term “seniority” for the purpose of this Section 21 shall be computed from the date of last employment with the Agency as a full-time operator.
In selecting the station at which they desire to work, the number of operators are not to exceed the quota established by the Agency for each station. Operators who fail to appear at the central location of selection on the date designated and at the time specified, will be deemed to have elected to remain at the station to which they are then assigned.
17
Operators may send in written notice of their selection provided it is received at least two (2) days in advance of the date designated for the pick to commence.
System selections are to be completed in time to permit the posting of station seniority lists in advance of the station pick of runs which follow system selections.
B.	PICK OF RUNS. There shall be a scheduled service change four (4) times per year, effective on or about March 15, June 15, September 1 and November 30. For purposes of definition, “on or about” shall be defined as ten (10) days prior to or ten (10) days after the dates indicated above. A pick of runs shall occur in association with each of the schedule change dates outlined above. The Agency shall post schedules no later than 12:00 noon on the Thursday prior to pick of runs unless a necessary extension is agreed on by the Union. The Union shall conduct the pick and shall complete such picks at least five (5) days prior to the effective date of the runs.
In the event that the Union fails to complete such picks, the Agency will conduct the pick and where runs are not selected or where sufficient choices are not provided, the Agency will assign the runs, assigning the previous run, if available, and if not available, another run.
In the event special picks are required, the Agency and Union will agree on how they shall be conducted.
Selection of runs will be made at such times as to permit the run picks to become effective on the first day of a pay period.
At any pick of runs, operators shall select a run of their choice or select extra board in accordance with their seniority standing at their particular station. The oldest operator in service at each station may select any run or any line or the extra board, until filled to the capacity that operates from that station. The next oldest operator in service may then select any other run or the extra board until filled to capacity at the station, and so on down the list. Operators picking extra board shall pick on the extra board in numerical (seniority) order until extra board has been filled to capacity. Operators picking the extra board shall adhere to all the rules and regulations governing the operation of the extra board.
C.	PAYMENT FOR RUN PICK. The Union shall pay all expenses in connection with the annual system selection.

The expense of re-picks necessitated through the error or omission of either party shall be borne by the responsible party as otherwise agreed upon.
D.	RE-PICK OF RUNS. In cases of change of schedule during any of the periods referred to above involving a change of thirty-five (35) minutes or more in the hours of any run, the operator who has that run at the time of such change may, by giving
18
six (6) days notice in writing call for a new pick of runs at the station involved, and such pick shall be made immediately, and the Agency shall bear the expense of the picking.
E.	NEW OPERATORS. New Operators in training at the time of a pick of runs will be allowed to participate in the pick at the station to which they are to be assigned. Such new Operators will be assigned to their selected runs upon completion of training.

Metro and the Union will negotiate the change over dates.
SECTION 25.	UNION BUSINESS. Employees who may be called upon to transact business for the Union which requires their absence from duty shall, upon application, be allowed to absent themselves for a sufficient time to transact said business for the Union, provided twenty-four (24) hour notice is given in the application and the number applying for leave of absence is not so great as to be detrimental to the service.

At least once during each six month period (January through June and July through December) the Agency will post and administer a mechanical aptitude test to such employees. Employees who desire to enter the training program will be given a mechanical aptitude test and standard oral interview. Those employees who successfully pass the mechanical aptitude test and the oral interview will be selected in seniority order for the training course as training slots become available. The Agency will develop written tests and demonstrated skill measurements to determine successful completion of the training program. The Agency will certify those students who have successfully completed the training program.
Only those employees who successfully complete the training program will be eligible to bid on a mechanic position. Employees promoted into such positions will be
28
subject to the thirty (30) day qualification period applicable to other employees bidding on positions as provided in this Agreement. Newly hired employees will have to successfully complete the training course before beginning the qualification period established in this Agreement for newly hired employees. Employees selected for training will be paid their current rate of pay, or the beginning rate for a newly hired mechanic, whichever is higher. Such employees will advance to the next higher rate in the progression after completing the required time in the program and will receive all contractual adjustments.
Successful graduates of the mechanic training program may be assigned to a work location for a minimum period of thirty (30) days, or assigned temporarily to open positions while the bidding process for these open positions is in effect. After being temporarily assigned to an open position, these employees will follow the bid process until they successfully bid on positions which their seniority may allow them to hold. If, in the process of bidding, two or more mechanics have the same seniority and qualifications on the same job bid, then the deciding factor will be in following:
1.	Preference will be given to employees holding seniority in the Maintenance Seniority District prior to becoming mechanics. After completion of the step rate these employees will acquire full maintenance seniority.
2.	Employees with seniority in the Operations Seniority District.
3.	Any other employee who may have seniority prior to becoming a mechanic in any of the other unions.
B.	ASSIGNMENTS. The new mechanic will be assigned to the vacancy temporarily until the bid process is completed and the job has been assigned. The successful bidder will be assigned to the position and the new mechanic will be reassigned to the vacated position. To resolve any seniority problem over days off, a day off pick will be conducted prior to his/her arrival. The internal bid process will be repeated and should there be no bidders, then the position will be assigned to the new mechanic using the above criteria.
It is understood that on all standard oral interviews a permanent documented record that has been reviewed and signed by the employee, will be kept and in the event the employee files a complaint, then this record will be made available to the Union for review.
C.	The Agency shall make records of personnel who have been trained and certified in CNG readily available.
SECTION 35.	TUITION ASSISTANCE

If said course is conducted during working hours, the employee shall be excused from work during those course hours and his/her pay will remain whole.
3.	When in the opinion of the Agency it is desirable to send a maintenance employee to a trade school or other technical class, the Agency will assume all expenses involved, such as tuition, hourly wages, etc.
SECTION 36.	INCLEMENT WEATHER. During inclement weather, effort shall be made to reduce to a minimum the need for bus washers to shift buses into and out of the garage building.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 40.A. SENIORITY DISTRICT. There shall be two seniority districts for all employees covered by this Agreement. One seniority district shall cover all employees in the job titles of operator and their seniority rights shall be as defined in Section 21 above. The other seniority district shall cover all other employees, such seniority district being known as the “Maintenance Employees Seniority District.” Seniority of such employees shall be on a system basis. The years of service of each of the full-time maintenance employees shall be counted from date of last employment and given full credit on the seniority roster and their seniority rights are defined as follows:
(a)	The Maintenance Employees Seniority District includes all the employees in the main shops, including the truck shop, stations shops, general service section, stores section, plant maintenance, fare box maintenance, and custodians at all stations.
(b)	No employee in the Maintenance Employees Seniority District shall have the right to change his job to any other job on the basis of seniority alone unless there is a layoff or job opening and then only in the manner as described in this Agreement upon the happenings of either event.
(c)	Maintenance seniority district employees may exercise their seniority in bidding on job openings in accordance with the provisions of this agreement providing the job is in an equivalent or higher pay rate and providing the employee is qualified.
B.	BIDDING PROCEDURE. If a job opening occurs in the Maintenance Employees Seniority District, notice to that effect shall be posted on all bulletin boards system-wide, and a period of five (5) days exclusive of Saturday and Sunday, shall be given within which the employees in said district shall be entitled to bid on such job openings.
CLASS 1A MECHANIC JOBS. The filling of Class 1A Mechanic jobs by bid in the various departments in this district will be done on a system seniority basis among Class 1A Mechanics, subject to the requirements and procedures established for acceptance of bids on particular jobs as set out in this Agreement. Notices of vacant
36
Station Mechanic jobs will be posted for bid by shift (e.g. day, second or third). Promotion to Class 1A Mechanic jobs will be made in accordance with the provisions of Section 34 of this Agreement.
OTHER CLASS 1A JOBS. The filling of Class 1A jobs that do not require passing a mechanical aptitude test, oral interview and formal training (Material Handler and Painter) shall be on a system seniority basis among employees in the Maintenance Seniority District subject to the requirements and procedures for acceptance of bids on particular jobs as set out in this Agreement. Employees who are awarded these jobs as a promotion will be subject to a twenty (20) calendar day self-withdrawal period and a sixty (60) calendar day period for disqualification by management.
OTHER CLASSIFICATIONS. The filling of other jobs in this district will be on a system seniority basis subject to the requirements and procedures established for the acceptance of bids on particular jobs as set out in this Agreement.
C.	LOCK-IN/WITHDRAWAL/GENERAL PROVISIONS. Any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, an employee who bids into any job in the Maintenance Seniority District shall remain in the job for a period of six (6) months following the effective date of the job award, subject to a ten (10) working day self-withdrawal period and a thirty (30) working day period for disqualification by management, or to the twenty (20) working day self-withdrawal period and sixty (60) working day period for disqualification by management provided herein for promotion to certain Class 1A jobs. However, no maintenance employee can be awarded more than two (2) such jobs in one (1) calendar year. Movement caused by a “bump” or “layoff” will not be affected by these restrictions. It is also understood that the job opening will be awarded and the employee moved to the new position within ten (10) working days from the closing date of the job bid. No bid in any manner will be accepted after the last day of the posting period. If within ten (10) working days, the employee withdraws, disqualifies himself or is disqualified from the job by management within a period of thirty (30) working days, the second candidate in the same bid package will be awarded the job and this process will be continued until the job is filled permanently. This same process will apply to other Class1A jobs which are filled by promotion. The term “workday” or “working day” as used in this Agreement with reference to the qualification/self-withdrawal period shall mean a day on which the employee has actually worked. The qualification period for an employee set out in this section may be extended by mutual agreement between the Agency and the Union. During the qualification period, the employee will be notified in writing and counseled regarding improving any deficiencies in performance of the duties of the new job.
D.	OTHER VACANCIES. When a vacancy is created in any Maintenance job class and the Metro decides to fill the position, the position will be posted for internal bid and a new temporary employee may be hired to fill the position until the bid and award process is completed. Preference will be given in order to the Maintenance Seniority District employees, Operations Seniority District employees, and other Union seniority district employees over any new hire. If the vacancy is not filled
37
by internal bid, the temporary new hire will fill the position. If the position is successfully bid internally, then to resolve any seniority problems over days off, a day off pick will be conducted prior to his/her arrival, but not later than one week after arrival.
The successful bidder will be assigned to the position and the temporary hire will be reassigned to the vacated position.
The internal bid process will be repeated and should there be no bidders, then the position will be awarded to the new hire permanently.
(a) Provisions applicable to other than Class 1A jobs: If within five (5) calendar days the first bidder withdraws the bid, or within five (5) calendar days, after working on the job, the employee withdraws from the job or disqualifies himself from the job or is disqualified from the job as provided for otherwise in this Agreement, the employee will be returned to his former position. The second bidder in the same bid package will be awarded the job and this process will be continued until the job is filled permanently or no further bidders are available in the same bid package. It is understood that if the employee withdraws from the job or disqualifies himself from the job, or is disqualified from the job, it will count as one (1) of the two (2) job awards as outlined in this Agreement. It is understood that if an employee was previously qualified to perform the duties of the classification, he may not disqualify himself nor may he be disqualified. When an employee bids on and is awarded a vacancy which is out of his seniority district receiving a lower base rate of pay, he will not be allowed to bid back after a five (5) day disqualification period.
E.	DISQUALIFICATION & PAY on CHANGE of POSITION. Subject to the provisions of this Section relating to bidding, any employee who bids on and is awarded a job which is out of his classification receiving a lower base rate of pay will not be allowed to bid back after the five (5) day disqualification period for a period of one (1) year. These classifications are mechanics, others, and operators. The above clauses do not apply to employees who move for any other reason such as bumps. Employees who exercise this option will be informed in writing, with copy to such employee, that after five (5) days, he cannot bid back. Any employee covered by this Agreement who bids and is awarded another job shall receive the top rate of their new position unless he/she is in the progression step rate, then he/she shall be paid the progression step rate of the awarded job. On jobs with a lower base rate of pay than the vacated job, the employee will receive the top rate of pay of the new position unless he/she is in the progression step rates, then he/she will be paid the progression step rates of the new job at the same step held at the time and continue progression to the top rate of the awarded job. No employee will be required to serve more than one progression.
Frozen pay rates will be adjusted for all contractual increases. It is understood that wage increases will be added to the base rate of the classification and adjusted proportionately to the step rate of the employee.
38
(a)	Whenever any employee is awarded a job which requires a qualifying period, and if he is thereafter disqualified, he shall be returned to his original job, but such employee shall not bid on a similar job for a period of one (1) year and then only if such employee can demonstrate a change in circumstances as to his qualification which merits his reconsideration. When an employee has bid another job having a qualifying period, his job may be held open while determination is made as to whether such employee qualifies. Whenever an employee takes the Standard Mechanical Aptitude Test for Automotive Mechanic and fails, he shall be required to wait at least ninety (90) days before he can take the test again.
(b)	If a maintenance employee is disqualified by the Agency doctor because of physical inability to perform his regular duties or loses his job through no fault of his own, he shall have the right to exercise his seniority to select a job which he is physically able and qualified to perform.
(c)	Any employee in the Maintenance Employee Seniority District who is taken from his regular position and placed in another position shall receive the rate of pay of the new position for the actual time he occupies such position unless the rate of pay of the new position is lower than the employee’s regular rate of pay, in which case he shall receive his regular rate of pay while occupying the new position.
F.	MAINTENANCE SYSTEM PICK.
1.	There shall be a Maintenance system-wide Selection of all employees of the Maintenance Seniority District once each year effective the first Monday following Thanksgiving Day of each year for the purpose of selecting a location and a job at which said employees desire to work. A similar system-wide selection shall be conducted in the event of a closing or opening of a garage and at other times as may be designated by the Agency. At least one month prior to every Maintenance System-wide Selection of work, the Agency shall post a notice at all stations announcing that a Maintenance System-wide Selection will be at some specified central location. Employees may send in written notice of their selection provided it is received at least two (2) days in advance of the date designated for such system selection. An employee may pick any job classification in which he has previously qualified which is available when it is his turn to pick.
2.	STANDARDS FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE MAINTENANCE SYSTEM SELECTIONS:
A.	Participation in the system selection: (1) Employees who have been absent due to illness or injury for thirty (30) or more calendar days and who do not have a medically determined return to work date shall be allowed to pick, however, the position picked shall remain open and available for pick by another employee. If the employee subsequently returns to work, he or she shall be placed in the job selected during the pick. The work unit and shift will then carry an extra employee until such time as normal turnover eliminates the overstaffing or until
39
the next pick. No employee will be displaced or “bumped” as the result of the employee returning to active employment.
(2)	Employees who are in a “lock-in” period on their current job shall not participate in the pick unless “bumped” from the job by a more senior, qualified employee.
(3)	Employees who are retiring on the first day of the month following the effective date of the pick shall not participate in the pick.
B.	Qualifications to pick a job classification. In order for an employee in the Maintenance Seniority District to exercise seniority and pick into a classification, he/she must be qualified in the classification. “Qualified” means an employee has been awarded the position as a result of a bid, has successfully passed the training and qualification period and possesses any required license.
C.	Bids & Jobs Awarded prior to the pick. If an employee has bid on and been awarded a job prior to the pick and the job is not picked by another more senior and qualified employee, the employee may select the job. In such cases the employee will remain subject to all of the provisions in the Agreement relating to employees awarded a job in the classification.
D.	The parties agree that the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) set out in Section 2, A, B, and C (above) will be in effect after this MOU is signed by both parties and will be incorporated into the new Labor Agreement for the time period starting October 1, 2002.
(G) Amend the Agreement by adding the following:

Electromechanics will continue to receive an additional $0.50 cents per hour following successful completion of the formal Electromechanic training.
3.	Any employee in a job class not specifically included in the changes relating to the establishment of Work Groups and training that pays an additional $0.50 per hour is unaffected by the changes.
4.	QUALIFICATION AND WITHDRAWAL PERIOD Other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the following qualification and withdrawal standards will be applicable to employees who bid on and are awarded a job in a job class in a Work Group or to the job classes of Engine Mechanic, Transmission / Clutch and Differential Mechanic, Vehicle Electrician and Paint Application Specialist following the development of the training for each Work Group or job class:
40
(a)	Each employee awarded a job in a 1A-MAT Work Group classification or in the job classes of Vehicle Electrician and Paint Application Specialist shall be subject to a qualification period of forty-five (45) work days following completion of formal training. Such period of formal training shall not exceed the actual formal classroom and practical training, or twelve (12) weeks following the expiration of the withdrawal period, whichever period is the lesser. Each employee may voluntarily withdraw during the first-ten (10) workdays following the job award. Any employee who voluntarily withdraws from any position will not be eligible for that position for a period of two (2) years. Any employee who voluntarily withdraws from position training for a second time will not be allowed to bid on that position for a period of five (5) years following each withdrawal.
(b)	. LOCK IN. Employees who are awarded any of the positions in this proposal will be subject to a twelve (12) month lock-in period during which the employee cannot bid or pick into another classification.

b.	Employees currently holding any a position in a job class within a Work Group will be permitted to attend training, on a seniority basis, whenever a training class normally occurs due to vacancies within the group
c.	Any employee who has previously qualified under the qualification standards in the Agreement that expired September 30, 2002 for all of the job classes in a work group will receive the additional $0.50 per hour while in a job class in the Work Group without completing of the training.

(1)	Employees hired prior to November 17, 1995 who were promoted to fulltime status prior to November 20, 1992, and employees hired prior to November 17, 1995 who accept promotion to full-time status when it is first available to them following November 20, 1992, will receive credit for their part-time service up to a maximum of five (5) years and the following contribution requirements will apply.
(a)	Employees will make pension contributions at a rate which is two (2) times the current weekly participant contribution rate for a period of time equal to their period of part-time service up to a maximum of five (5) years.
(b)	The Agency will make no contributions for the part-time service which is credited under the above provision; however, Agency contributions as set forth in this Agreement will begin on the date the employee is promoted to full-time status.
(2)	Employees hired on or after November 17, 1995 will receive credit for their part-time service and will make contributions as described in C. (4) below.
(3)	Employees who have declined promotion to full-time status prior to November 17, 1995 will become part-time participants in the pension plan effective on November 17, 1995 and will receive credit for their part-time service and will make contributions as described in C. (4) below.
60
(4)	Effective on November 17, 1995
(a)	each week of part-time service will be credited as 70% of a full-time week, and
(b)	part-time participants and the Agency will make contributions equal to 70% of the current weekly contribution rates for each week of part-time service.
D.	VESTING. Effective September 1, 1990, when participants who have at least ten years Credited Service leave the employment of the Agency, they must provide a written election (a) to accept a refund of their pension contributions or (b) to accept a vested pension. If a participant elects a vested pension, benefit payments will be deferred to age sixty-five (65), and will be determined by the participant’s accrued Credited Service and the pension formula which was in effect at the time the participant left employment. If a vested, deferred participant dies before attaining age sixty-five (65), his/her designated beneficiary will become eligible for benefit payments beginning on the first of the month following the month in which the participant would have attained age sixty-five (65). Participants who accept a refund of their pension contributions waive their right to claim any future benefits from the pension plan. Participants who elect a vested pension waive their right to a lump sum refund of their pension contributions. Vested, deferred pensioners are not eligible for coverage under other benefit programs which may be offered to retired participants.
The joint pension committee will establish consistent procedures for determining how participants elect a deferred, vested pension.
E.	PAYMENT OPTIONS. The following methods of benefit payments shall be available to a retiring participant:
(1)	Straight Life Option - provides an unreduced monthly benefit to the participant for his/her lifetime.
(2)	Ten Year Certain Option - provides a reduced monthly benefit to the participant for life and guarantees the same reduced monthly benefit amount to the participant’s designated beneficiary (ies) for the balance of a ten (10) year period in the event the participant dies within ten (10) years of retirement. The monthly benefit reduction for the Ten Year Certain Option shall be ten percent (10%).
(3)	Fifteen Year Certain Option - provides a reduced monthly benefit to the participant for life and guarantees the same reduced monthly benefit amount to the participant’s designated beneficiary (ies) for the balance of a fifteen (15) year period in the event the participant dies within fifteen (15) years of retirement. The monthly benefit reduction for the Fifteen Year Certain Option shall be seventeen percent (17%).
(4)	Contingent Annuitant Options - provide a reduced monthly benefit to the participant for life and continue fifty percent (50%) or one-hundred percent (100%) of
61
such reduced monthly benefit to participant’s surviving spouse for the spouse’s lifetime if the participant predeceases his/her spouse. The monthly benefit reduction shall be actuarially determined based upon the participant’s and spouse’s ages at the time of retirement.
F.	ADMINISTRATION. A joint committee whose membership equally represents the Agency and the Union shall administer the provisions of the Plan.
G.	FUNDING. As of March 31 each year, the Agency and the Union shall direct their committee representatives to request an actuarial valuation of the Plan. Funding recommendations provided by the actuary in this valuation shall be adopted by both parties with the Agency contributing seventy percent (70%) and individual participants contributing thirty percent (30%) of the funding recommendation. If the actuarial valuation finds that the Plan’s Funded Ratio (actuarial value of Plan assets divided by the actuarial accrued liability) is below sixty percent (60%), Metro and the Union will meet and, based on a recommendation from the plan actuary, negotiate a special contribution amount designed to restore the Plan’s Funded Ratio to sixty percent (60%) or higher within a defined timeframe of not more than five (5) years. This special contribution will be made at the same Agency: employee contribution ratio as other contributions to the Plan. Individual contributions shall be withheld from each participant’s wages for any week during which Credited Service accrues.
Pension changes negotiated in this Agreement will be amortized over a period of thirty (30) years with the Agency contributing seventy percent (70%) and individual participants contributing thirty percent (30%) of the actuarially recommended cost.
As a benefit for the employee and without deduction or reduction in the employee’s compensation, the employee’s required contribution to the pension plan shall be paid by the Agency as an “employer pick-up of employee contributions” under Section 414 (h) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code. The amount of contribution picked up shall be treated as wages for the purpose of determining compensation related welfare benefits.
H.	PARTICIPATION. It is mandatory for full-time employees who are members of the Union to participate in this Plan. The provisions of this Section shall apply to any employee otherwise eligible for pension who is on leave of absence while holding office in the Union or its International Office.
If an employee who was receiving LTD or disability pension benefits returns to active employment within five (5) years, service under the Plan shall be credited and contributions shall be made to the Plan for the period of disability.
I.	APPLICATION FOR PENSION. An application for pension must be filed on or before the first day of a month to become effective on the first of the following month.
An eligible, disabled participant who has exhausted the maximum duration of benefits provided by the insured LTD Plan will become eligible for retirement benefits
62
under this Plan based upon his/her age, length of service and the provisions of this Plan at the time the participant left the active service of the Agency.
J.	PENSION INVESTMENT ADVISOR. The Division 788, A.T.U. Administrative Pension Committee will retain the services of a recognized, professional investment advisor.
SECTION 50b. DISABILITY PENSION
A. For disabilities occurring on or after the first day of the month following ratification of this agreement.
1.	Disability pensions will be subject to a three (3) year own occupation limit. After three (3) years the participant receiving a disability pension shall have to meet the Social Security definition of disability and show proof of a Social Security disability award, or have his/her benefits suspended until age 65, or the earliest age the participant is eligible for a normal form pension benefit.
2.	Provide that if a disability participant fails to meet the income and continued disability tests set out in this Agreement, the pension will be suspended until age 65, or the earliest age the participant is eligible for a normal form pension benefit.
3.	Effective January 1, 2003, amend the monthly limitation on gross earnings from employment that a disability pensioner can earn from fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) to two thousand dollars ($2,000) per month.
Subject to the following provisions, participants with at least ten (10) years Credited Service who become disabled on or after April 1, 1990 will be eligible for disability pension benefits. For purposes of this section, disability shall be defined as becoming mentally or physically incapable of performing the job duties of the last position held with the Agency.
If a participant is approved for disability pension benefits, the participant’s status as a disability pensioner will be effective on the later of:
1. the first day of the month following a six (6) month waiting period. The waiting period begins on the participant’s first day off work as a result of the disabling condition, or
.	2. the first day of the month following receipt of a participant’s application
for disability pension; however, the effective date of a disability pension will not be earlier than the first day of the month following the date a participant attains ten (10) years Credited Service; however,
63
3. if a participant is approved for social security disability benefits, such participant’s disability pension will be effective the first of the month following a three (3) month waiting period or the first of the month after all sick leave has been exhausted, whichever comes first from the participant’s first day off work as the result of the disabling condition.
The monthly disability benefit will be equal to the amount of the Normal Form pension as of the effective date of the participant’s disability pension. Payment options available to Normal Form retirees will be available to disability pensioners. The disability pension benefit will be reduced by any amount of Unemployment Compensation or weekly Workers’ Compensation payments for the period following the effective date of a participant’s disability pension. The disability pension benefit will not be reduced by any amount of Social Security benefits or by any other governmental benefit received, not otherwise described herein.
Participants are required to file an application for disability pension benefits not later than six (6) months from their first day off as the result of a disabling condition. Participants who apply for disability pension benefits must furnish the agency with medical records and a statement from their attending physician that they are incapable of performing their job duties. The statement must contain a description of the mental or physical condition causing the disability.
Eligibility for a disability pension shall be determined in the following manner:
1.	(a) Any participant approved for Social Security Disability Benefits
shall be eligible for disability pension benefits; or,
(b) Any participant determined to be disabled by an Agency appointed physician shall be eligible for disability pension benefits.
2.	If a participant has not been approved for Social Security Disability or if there is disagreement between a participant’s attending physician and the Agency appointed physician, the Pension Plan will procure the services of an independent physician to render a disability determination which shall be final and binding. The independent physician will be selected as follows:
(a)	by mutual agreement between Agency and Union appointed representatives to the Pension Committee; or, if mutual agreement cannot be achieved,
(b)	by mutual agreement between the participant’s attending physician and the Agency appointed physician; or, if mutual agreement cannot be achieved,
(c)	each physician will be asked to provide the Pension Committee with the name of a non-affiliated physician who is Board Certified in an appropriate medical specialty. The two physicians provided will constitute a selection pool from which the independent physician will be chosen by lot; providing, however,
64
(d)	if the Pension Committee has not received the names of two physicians in accordance with (c) above within sixty (60) days of such request, Agency appointed and Union appointed Pension Committee representatives will each nominate two physicians who are Board Certified in an appropriate medical specialty. These four (4) physicians will constitute a selection pool from which the independent physician will be chosen by lot.
(e)	The independent physician selected in accordance with the provisions of this section will have final and binding determination with respect to the disability status of the applicant.
If a disability pensioner regains sufficient health or mental capacity to resume his/her job duties, disability pension benefits will be discontinued and the individual will be restored to his/her former position with full seniority rights. Provided the participant was in Disability Pension Status for five (5) years or less, upon the participant’s return to duty, the participant and the Agency will make pension contributions in an amount equal to the contributions which were not made on behalf of the participant during the period of disability, and pension service for the period of the disability will be credited. However, if such a disability pensioner returns to duty for a period of less than on (1) year and is unable to perform his/her job duties because of the same disabling condition, the participant shall revert to his/her initial disability pension status; participant contributions for the period of disability will be refunded; and, only the service recognized for the initial disability pension benefit will be credited.
Disability pension benefits will not be payable for any month in which a disability pensioner receives gross earnings from employment exceeding $1,500.
If a disability pensioner fails to report to the Pension Committee that he/she has regained sufficient health or mental capacity to return to duty or fails to disclose said gross earnings from employment exceeding $1,500 in any month, disability pension benefits will be suspended until such time as the disability pensioner complies with the medical and/or earnings limitation provisions of the Pension Plan.
If a participant’s application for disability pension is denied; the participant will return to duty immediately, or, upon providing proper medical documentation, will be placed on a Leave of Absence for a period which cannot extend beyond one (1) year from the participant’s first day off. If a participant fails to return to work immediately, or fails to provide medical documentation to be placed on Leave of Absence or fails to return to work by the end of the Leave of Absence period, such employee will be dropped from the rolls.
B.	Disabilities from January 1, 1988 through March 31, 1990:
If a participant’s first day off work due to a disabling condition occurred from January 1, 1988 through March 31, 1990 and the participant was initially approved for disability benefit payments under the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company’s Long Term Disability (LTD) policy but subsequently denied continued LTD benefits for failure to satisfy the policy’s disability definition:
65
1.
The participant will be eligible for disability pension benefits provided:
(a)	he/she exhausts all administrative appeal provisions under the LTD policy through the Disability Claims Manager level, and
(b)	he/she voluntarily elects to apply for disability pension benefits rather than arbitrate the discontinuation of his/her LTD benefits with the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, and
(c)	he/she is determined to be disabled pursuant to provisions of the Pension Plan as set forth in this section.
2.	A participant who arbitrates the discontinuance of LTD benefits shall thereby forfeit his/her right to apply for disability pension benefits with respect to that incident of disability. A participant who is denied disability benefits under the LTD policy or the Pension Plan shall return to duty within thirty (30) calendar days, or, such employee will be dropped from the rolls.
3.	The amount of monthly pension benefit will be determined as follows:
(a)	If the participant does not return to work or returns to work for less than one year
(i)	he/she will receive the disability pension benefit negotiated in the collective bargaining agreement effective March 1, 1990, and
(ii)	only service recognized at the time of the initial disability will be credited, providing however, any participant approved for LTD benefits shall be deemed to have a minimum of ten (10) years of Credited Service.
(b)	If a participant returns to work for at least one year
(i)	he/she will receive the pension benefit in effect on the date of his/her pension, and
(ii)	contributions will be paid and service credited for the period of disability.
(c)	If the participant is disabled due to the same condition, the six (6) month waiting period required by these disability pension provisions will be waived.
C.	Unsuccessful Long Term Disability (LTD) Arbitrations:
If a participant’s first day off work due to a disabling condition occurred from January 1, 1988 through March 31, 1990; and, the participant’s claim for LTD benefits was denied as the result of an arbitration between the Union and the insurance company; Section 50b. of the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the period March 1, 1987 through February 28,1990 will apply unless the participant is determined by the Agency to be medically unable to perform the duties of his/her last position with the Agency, in
66
which case he/she will be paid a disability pension in the amount of the pension benefit in effect on the date of the participant’s first day off. The disability pension will be effective on the date he/she is determined to be medically unable to return to work.
SECTION 50c. A.T.U. RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN.
Metro agrees to provide payroll deduction for employees who elect to participate in the Union’s 401 (k) savings plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service guidelines. It is understood that the Union shall administer the plan and that Metro’s obligation is solely related to payroll deduction.
SECTION 51.	COST-OF-LIVING CLAUSE. All employees covered by this Agreement shall be entitled to receive a cost-of-living allowance to be determined in the following manner based on the Consumer Price Index (United States average 1967=100) published by the United States Department of Labor.
Effective October 1, 1980, the One dollar and forty-eight cents ($1.48) per hour cost-of-living (COLA) which has accumulated from March 1, 1978, through September 30, 1980, (which was being paid on September 1, 1980) shall be added to the base rate.
All COLA accumulation between October 1, 1980, and September 30, 1981, shall be paid to all employees.
Effective October 1, 1981, the cost-of-living allowance shall be in the amount of one (1) cent per hour for each four-tenths (.4) point increase in the Consumer Price Index. The first adjustment shall be based on the increase, if any, of the May 1981 and August 1981 Index payable October 1, 1981. The cost-of-living allowance shall be redetermined at three (3) month intervals thereafter.
Effective October 1, 1981, the cost-of-living adjustment shall not exceed nineteen (19) cents per hour in any one quarter for the remainder of the COLA year. In any COLA year (a cola year ends April 1), the amount that is over any quarterly cap of nineteen (19) cents will be held and in the event any quarterly payment is below the cap, the amount will be applied to that up to the cap or to that amount available. This will continue from quarter to quarter until April 1 adjustment to the cap each year. These adjustments shall apply to all employees with the exception of those in the Maintenance Employees Seniority District Classifications 10, 11, 12 and 13.
The rate of pay for all employees hired after ratification shall be computed by adding all COLA accumulated since October 1, 1980, which has not been added to the base rate and then applying the progression rate to the total.
Should the CPI decline after having risen to the extent of producing an increase of one or more cents per hour, wages shall be reduced at the same intervals and rates as specified above for increases except that no reduction shall take place until the decline of
67
the Index extends to three tenths (.3) of a point below the point at which the increase occurred.
Beginning October 1, 1981, the COLA adjustment shall be calculated by comparing the increases in the Index, if any, between May 1981 and August 1981. Subsequent adjustments shall also use the May 1981 Index as the base index.
All Cost of Living Adjustments accrued up to April 7, 1983 are included in the base rates.
The Cost of Living Clause presently in the Agreement will remain in the Agreement. However, no increase or decrease computations will be made for the term of this Agreement.
SECTION 52.	SUPERVISORS WORKING. Station foremen and day foremen in maintenance operations shall not perform any manual or mechanical work except in an emergency other than such work as may be necessary in instructing employees or testing machines or mechanical equipment.
SECTION 53.	REQUIRED LICENSES and TRAINING.
A.	Reimbursement for Required Licenses. The Agency shall reimburse employees for commercial driver’s license or chauffeur’s license for those employees that must have such licenses to perform their duties.
B.	Commercial Driver’s License Training. Metro will provide training for employees desiring to bid on jobs that require a Commercial Driver’s License. At least once during each six (6) month period (January - June and July - December) Metro will post an announcement of a training program for employees who desire to obtain a Commercial Driver’s License (CDL), a different Class CDL, or to obtain an endorsement for a current CDL. Employees who desire to enter the training program must meet the basic State-required standards by obtaining the appropriate CDL student permit to obtain such license. Employees will enroll in the training in accordance with procedures established by Metro that are similar to the job bid process. In the event there are more employees desiring to enroll in the training than there are available training slots, employees will be selected based on seniority.
Training will be designed to teach employees the skill and knowledge required to pass the State-administered CDL Test. Training will be scheduled at a specified time. Enrolled employees and their supervisors will be notified of the Training Schedule. Employees who are scheduled to work during the hours of Training or State Testing will be excused from work for the time required and will not have their pay reduced. Employees who are off work at the time of the Training or State Testing will not receive additional pay for the training or test. Metro will provide the equipment necessary for the employee to take the State Test two (2) times following completion of Training.
Only those employees who are successful in obtaining a Commercial Driver’s License of the proper Class and endorsement will be eligible to bid on positions requiring
68
such licenses. Employees will be reimbursed for the cost of obtaining the CDL or endorsement following the award of the job requiring such CDL or endorsement.
Employees who are not successful in obtaining a CDL after taking the Training will be required to wait one (1) year before taking the training again.
The first Training provided by this Section 54.B will be held within ninety (90) days following the ratification of this Agreement.
2.	Amend the qualification requirements for all jobs in the Maintenance Seniority District that are filled as promotions through the internal bid process to include the following language: “Possession of a current, valid Commercial Driver’s License of the required Class and with required endorsements at the time of job bid.” This qualification requirement will become effective and be included in job bid announcements starting on the first day of the month beginning two (2) years after the completion of the first Training provided by Section 54. B of this Agreement.
SECTION 54.	UNION DUES.	Union dues shall be deducted from
the employee’s pay once each month and shall be wire transferred to the Union’s bank account, provided, however, this provision shall be applicable only with respect to such employees who have delivered to the Agency their duly executed assignment and authorization to do so as prescribed by Section 302 (c) (4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended. The Agency agrees to a check-off of COPE deductions upon the written request of any employee.
SECTION 55.	RULES AND REGULATIONS. The Agency shall from time to time make such reasonable rules and regulations for the conduct of its employees and the protection of the property under its care as may be consistent with the intent and terms of this Agreement, and all employees shall be required to observe the letter and spirit of such rules and regulations in their conduct toward each other, toward those in authority over them in service, and toward the public. Repeated disobedience of such rules and regulations shall be deemed sufficient cause for discharge.
SECTION 56.	LAYOFFS. When it becomes necessary to lay off employees because of insufficiency of work, affected employees will be given at least ten (10) calendar day’s notice of such layoff. The employees so laid off shall be those standing last in the order of seniority within the particular seniority district in which such layoff occurs, except that with respect to a layoff affecting employees in the Maintenance Employees Seniority District, the employees affected by such layoff will be entitled to exercise their seniority within their seniority district subject to the following:
(a)	Seniority may be exercised in changing from one job to another, but only if the employee has held the job and has previously qualified in the classification. “Previously qualified” means the employee has successfully passed the training and qualification period and possess any required license.
69
(b)	Prior to exercising seniority in changing from one job to another, an employee shall be responsible for knowing and being equipped to perform the exact duties of the new job. If, within a period of five (5) working days, the employee is disqualified by management or disqualifies himself, all employees affected by the disqualified employee’s original bump shall return to the jobs they held prior to the bump, and a new bumping program shall begin with the disqualified employee. No selfdisqualification shall be allowed after five (5) working days have elapsed.
(c)	For the purpose of determining which employees are to be laid off, the employees to be so laid off shall be those standing last in the order of system seniority within the Maintenance Employees Seniority District.
(d)	Any employee affected by a layoff in the loss of his job shall have the right to exercise his seniority within a period of time, not more than two (2) working days, from the effective date of such layoff. Failure of any such employee to so exercise his seniority rights within such period of time shall terminate whatever rights he may have hereunder.
SECTION 57.	RECALL FROM LAYOFF. When, within a period of five (5) years, it becomes necessary to employ additional employees, any former employees laid off within such period of time shall be entitled to preference over all new employees for any hiring within their particular seniority district in the order of their seniority within such district and shall be credited with all seniority accumulated prior to layoff.
The Agency will notify any such former employees by certified mail at their last given address and any such former employees so notified must report to the Agency within three (3) days or their names shall be taken from the eligible list. It shall be the responsibility of the furloughed employee to keep his mailing address current with the Agency.

A Safety Committee will be established at each station and the main shops consisting of equal representation of the Union and the Agency with a maximum of three (3) each. The Committee shall meet monthly unless mutually agreed that fewer meeting are needed and shall consist of the shed captain and/or shop steward. The Union representatives of the Committee shall be paid their straight time wage rate for one (1) hour during such meeting. Prior notice will be given one (1) week in advance of the monthly Safety meeting.
SECTION 59.	NONDISCRIMINATION. The Agency and the Union shall continue to comply with all provisions of Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, Executive Orders 1141, 11246, and 11375 in hiring and treatment of employees during employment without regard to their age, race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
SECTION 60a. PART-TIME DRIVERS (School Bus Service). The Agency shall be privileged to employ part-time drivers at a wage rate twenty-five percent (25%) below that of the applicable top wage rate for regular operators for the purpose of
70
handling school bus service during the school term where part-time drivers had been formerly employed by the various transit companies previously operating in the area and such additional part-time drivers as may be required to service additional schools in St. Louis County, St. Clair County, Madison County, St. Charles County, Monroe County and Jefferson County. All school work as incorporated into the schedules in St. Louis and St. Louis County shall remain in the schedules of the Agency. All new schools established in the City of St. Louis and served by the Agency shall be incorporated into the schedules in the future. All school work presently incorporated into the schedules shall remain in the schedules of the Agency. It is understood that every effort shall be made to incorporate all school work into the regular schedules of the Agency. Part-time drivers shall not be used to perform charter service or any other type duty being performed by regular or extra operators. Part-time drivers shall not be allowed to operate any type of service where cash fares are collected. Part-time drivers shall only be permitted to operate school work not required to be incorporated into schedules, and they shall be limited to school work only and shall at no time or under any circumstances or in any manner affect the work of regular or extra operators; nor shall the hiring and use of part-time drivers for said work at any time or under any circumstances result in a laying off or a reduction in work of regular or extra operators; provided, however, the foregoing is not intended to limit use of part-time drivers for handling school bus service as herein provided.
Part-time drivers shall be required to become members of the Union in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. It is expressly understood that any such part-time drivers employed by the Agency, other than regular operators electing to accept part time work, shall not be entitled to any of the benefits under the terms of provisions of the Agreement other than the grievance procedure as therein provided and that the pay rate and conditions of employment of said part-time drivers shall be governed by the provisions of this section only.
Regular operators employed by the company shall be entitled to preference in bidding for such part-time work at the beginning of each fall school term but at the parttime drivers’ rate and at straight time rates only, and any regular operator so bidding shall be required to work such part-time pieces of work for the duration of the station pick.
After the initial assignment of runs, the annual pick of runs for part-time school work shall become effective no later than the third Monday of October for each year. Run selections shall be made in the following order: regular operators, maintenance employees, pensioners, with part-time employees picking last and according to last date of employment. Thereafter, any adjustments of runs, make up of runs, time worked, routes, and distance traveled shall not be cause for a re-pick of runs.
Regular bus operators working part-time school runs shall pick their work assignments in seniority order.
Part-time female drivers shall be granted maternity leave for maternity purposes. It shall be the responsibility of part-time drivers to notify the Company in writing of such pregnancy and probable date of birth, together with a supporting statement from her physician.
71

After giving timely notice of her intention to return to work, the part-time driver shall satisfactorily pass a medical examination administered by a physician representing the Agency.
All part-time drivers shall receive two (2) hours holiday pay for each piece of work on Washington’s Birthday and Veterans’ Day.
It is expressly understood that in no event shall an employee heretofore or hereafter employed as a part-time employee be entitled to or credited with seniority or seniority benefits on account of service performed as such part-time driver.
SECTION 60b. PART-TIME OPERATORS. The Agency may employ part-time operators subject to the following conditions:
1.	Hours of work performed by part-time operators shall not exceed seven (7%) percent of the platform hours. To the extent possible, a.m. and p.m. work shall be distributed evenly.
2.	Work performed by part-time operators will be limited to twenty-eight (28) hours per week. On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, part-time operators may not work more than eight (8) hour runs except when the assigned run is scheduled for more than eight (8) hours.
3.	No full-time operator shall be laid off, as outlined in Section 57, so long as part-time operators are employed.
4.	Part-time operators shall be covered under the provisions of this Agreement dealing with union membership, union representation, grievance procedures and arbitration.

72
8.	The probationary period for part-time operators shall be seventy-five (75) calendar days after having completed their examinations and instructions and assigned to work. Part-time operators hired as full-time operators will not have to repeat another probationary period.
9.	Part-time operators are hired and assigned to work on the basis of predetermined availability to work in the a.m., p.m., weekends or combination thereof. There shall be no pick of runs.
10.	Part-time operators who are called to jury service shall be paid for wages lost from regularly scheduled work while on jury service and may retain the jury fee.
11.	Part-time operators shall be entitled to funeral leaves in accordance with the standards established for full-time operators in this Agreement. Part-time operators shall be paid for wages lost from regularly scheduled work as a result of such funeral leave.
12.	Newly hired part-time operators shall be paid an hourly rate equal to at least seventy (70%) percent of the top rate established for full-time operators in this agreement. Thereafter part-time Operators shall advance in accordance with the progression for full-time Operators set out in this Agreement. For the purpose of applying the progression, two thousand eighty (2,080) hours of work as a part-time Operator shall equal one-year (12 months) of service as a full-time Operator. When a part-time Operator is promoted to full-time, his or her step in the progression shall not change. Operators who are promoted to full-time shall be given credit for their work as a part-time Operator in determining the date of their advance to the next step in the full-time progression; for example, a promoted Operator who had worked one-thousand forty (1,040) hours as a part-time Operator would advance to the next step in the progression following six (6) months of full-time service.
Within thirty (30) days following the ratification of this Agreement, Metro will review the pay record of any currently employed Bus Operator who was promoted from part-time to full-time during the period October 1, 2005 through the date of ratification of this Agreement. The purpose of this review is: (1) to determine if any employee promoted after October 1, 2005 was not started in the full-time progression at the same step as occupied in the parttime progression; and, (2) to determine whether the employee received credit for part-time service in determining advancement in the full-time pay progression as set out above. Any employee who was not started in the fulltime progression at the same step and/or did not receive credit for time in part-time service, the employee will be paid any back pay due; and, if necessary the employee’s pay will be adjusted to the correct step in the fulltime progression.
Retired ATU Local 788 full-time Bus Operators performing part-time work shall be paid the top rate.

It is specifically agreed that the Union can protest any disqualification of a MetroLink employee through the grievance procedure if it believes such disqualification by the Agency was arbitrary and capricious. Employees who are disqualified by the Agency may bid on the job classification in an attempt to re-qualify after two years have lapsed from the date of the disqualification. An employee who is disqualified on two separate occasions will not be considered for the same job classification in the future.
SECTION 65.	LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM SELECTIONS
A.	Light Rail Vehicle Operators will participate in the annual System Selection for the Operations Seniority District under the following conditions:
(1)	In order for an employee in the Operations Seniority District to exercise seniority and pick into the Light Rail Section, he/she must be a currently qualified LRV Operator. “Currently Qualified” means an employee has successfully passed the training and qualification period, possesses any required license and has been re-qualified on current Rules and Operating Procedures by management within thirty (30) days prior to the pick. The Agency will establish procedures to assure that Operators are given a timely opportunity to re-qualify on current Rules and Operating Procedures.
(2)	Starting with the first annual Systemwide Selection following the ratification of this Agreement, LRV Operator jobs available for selection shall be posted by station as follows:
a.	Ewing: LRV Operator jobs assigned to the Ewing facility.
b.	29th Street: LRV Operator jobs assigned to the 29th Street facility.
Run picks will be conducted among regular LRV Operators at Ewing and 29th Street, respectively. Vacations for LRV Operators shall be posted for selection at Ewing or 29th Street.
This change in the system wide selection for LRV Operators will not in any way restrict Metro’s ability to construct schedules for MetroLink as a unit (rather than by station); determine relief points, assign pull-out and turn-ins of runs to Ewing, 29th Street or a future station; or in any other way restrict Metro’s ability to efficiently manage the light rail system; providing however, Metro will use its best effort to assign runs to Ewing and 29th Street, respectively, as provided in the section of this Agreement relating to Light Rail Schedule Construction. If, at any pick of runs that is
79
not concurrent with the annual system wide selection, the portion of daylight straight runs assigned to Ewing or 29th Street decreases by onefifth (1/5) or more, a special pick will be conducted to allow LRV Operators to select either Ewing or 29th Street prior to the station pick of runs.
(3)	In order for an LRV Operator to exercise seniority at the system selection, he/she must have previously qualified as a Bus Operator and possess any required license.
(4)	An LRV Operator cannot exercise seniority and pick out of the LRV Operations Section unless there are a sufficient number of qualified LRV Operators to meet manpower needs. Providing however, if qualified LRV Operators are not available, the Agency will train a sufficient number of LRV Operators so the employee (s) can move to Bus Operations at the time of the next 90 day station pick of runs.
(5)	At least once each year, the agency will offer training to a minimum of five (5) Bus Operators. Bus Operators will be selected in seniority order in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement relating to Bid and Award Procedures for Light Rail Jobs and Training Slots. Employees who successfully pass the training will be awarded LRV Operator jobs in the order of their seniority as vacancies occur.
During such training employees will retain their current hourly rate of pay. Following training, employees will return to their prior run, if open, or the Extra Board.
