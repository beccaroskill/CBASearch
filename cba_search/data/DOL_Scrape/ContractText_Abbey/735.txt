CUNA MUTUAL GROUP VDT GUIDELINES
The CUNA Mutual Group has adopted the following guidelines for the use of VDTs. These guidelines should be implemented by department managers within their respective area. Consideration must be given to these guidelines with proper concern for expense control.
Lighting
1.	Departments using VDTs will have room lighting in the range of 30 to 50 foot candles to reduce eye fatigue. Light fixtures in A, G, and H wings with parabolic diffusing louver and light intensity adaptability need no change. VDT users in these wings will be advised to use one or two tube lumination.
2.	Overhead lighting in B, C and D wings will eventually be reduced to 30 to 50 foot candles.
3.	Lighting considerations will be assessed before moving Employees and/or departments to
new locations.
4.	Whenever possible, VDTs will be positioned perpendicular to windows.
Equipment
1.	Older VDTs will be replaced by attrition through lease arrangements with newer models having both tilt and rotational flexibility and movable keyboards. Ideally, VDTs should be perpendicular with the desk surface. However, ten (10) to twenty (20) degrees of backward tilt of the screen is acceptable providing the angle doesn't cause additional glare.
2.	VDT screens should be even or no more than fifteen (15) degrees below visual level.
3.	Screen surfaces will have neutral density or similar glare reducing coatings.
4.	’ ■< Anti-glare screens will be provided on an “as needed” basis.
Furniture
1.	Task lights will be provided on an "as needed" basis. They will be both adjustable, movable, and louvered to reduce potential reflective glare.
2.	Seat height should allow elbows, wrists and keyboard to be parallel with the floor. After adjusting the seat height, feet should be flat on the floor and upper legs parallel to the floor. Back support should be present with support focused on belt fine.
3.	Employees transferring information from written materials to VDTs should be encouraged to use vertical holders placed the same level as the VDT screen.
4.	Chairs for VDT operators will meet corporate economic standards and have adjustable ■ features for height, tilt, swivel, and back height support. Chairs with arms are not recommended for Employees who key more than 2 hours per day. Employees will be instructed in proper positioning and adjusting of chairs by their department managers.
65
5.
All new furniture will be site tested prior to purchase.
Eye Examinations
1.	Initial and yearly eye exams will be conducted for all users on VDTs more than 30 percent
of the workday. Facilities in the Medical Department are adequate for yearly screenings on a scheduled basis (block times).
2.	Eye examinations done outside CUNA Mutual Group will be scheduled on the Employee's own time.
Break Periods
1.	Periodic eye rest breaks are desirable. Flexible interval breaks will be available under the discretionary control of the Employee’s supervisor. Break periods for eye rest are not convertible into longer exercise periods.
2.	Periodic overtime work for users of VDTs is a recognized necessity, but should be limited to two (2) hours a day or ten (10) hours a week with the exception of emergency situations. Excess hours will contribute to fatigue factors resulting in decreased productivity.
Miscellaneous
I.	Reflected glare will effectively be reduced by using darker .hued carpeting, louvered diffusers, and matte surfaces of keyboards and desk tops. Use of vertical window blinds is less effective than current drapes, but will diffuse outside light and allow distant vision relaxation.
2.	Hard copy printers will be placed in areas not proximal to VDTs to reduce noise distraction or hearing injury with concern for space limitations.

CUNA MUTUAL GROUP VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PLAN
This CUNA Mutual Group Voluntary Severance Plan (“Plan”) is amended and restated, effective June 16, 2005, pursuant to an agreement between Office & Professional Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, Local No. 39 (“Union”), and CUNA Mutual Insurance Society (“CUNA Mutual”). The purpose of this Plan is to provide a severance option for employees employed by CUNA Mutual Insurance Society who are being laid off as a result of the reduction of bargaining unit staff.
1.	Eligible Employee. An “Eligible Employee” is an Employee as defined in Article II, Section 2, Subsection A. of the parties’ 2005 collective bargaining agreement who:
(a)	(i) Is employed by CUNA Mutual and receives a notice of lay off from CUNA
Mutual; or (ii) was on a medical leave of absence, had his or her position eliminated or was bumped while out on the medical leave of absence, and was released by his or her treating health care provider to return to work within one year of the date on which the medical leave began; and	.	• . . •
(b)	Submits (i) a resignation which is irrevocable unless it is subsequently determined by CUNA Mutual that the Employee is not eligible for a severance benefit under ' this Plan and (ii) a written application for severance to the Labor Relations ..	.. Consultant in CUNA Mutual’s Human Resources Division by the date which is four
(4) weeks after he or she receives written notice of lay off. A person described in section l(a)(ii) above must submit his or her resignation and application for severance within four (4) weeks after being released by his or her health care provider to return to work and receiving notification that his or her position is filled or eliminated.
(c)	In any event, an Employee who is or who might otherwise be an Eligible Employee shall cease to be an Eligible Employee at the time he or she successfully bumps another Employee.	■
2.	Severance Pay. An Eligible Employee who files an application for a severance benefit and provides CUNA Mutual a waiver and release, will receive severance payments in an amount equal to two (2) weeks salary multiplied by the Eligible Employee's number of full years of Continuous Service; provided, however, that the minimum amount of severance pay shall be eight (8) weeks if the Eligible Employee has at least one -full year of Continuous Service; seven (7) weeks if the Eligible Employee has at least ten (10) full
■ months of Continuous Service; five (5) weeks if the Eligible Employee has at least seven (7) full months of Continuous Service; and three (3) weeks if the Eligible Employee has less than seven (7) full months of Continuous Service. The maximum amount of severance pay shall be equal to fifty-two (52) weeks of salary. The period of time for which severance pay is payable shall be known as the Severance Period. For purposes of calculating an Eligible Employee’s severance pay, the term "salary” shall include only base compensation, and shall not include overtime, shift differential, bonuses, incentive compensation, fringe benefits, or any other compensation or payments to the Eligible Employee. The salary of part-time Employees will be determined by hours reflected in CUNA Mutual's records. If a dispute arises concerning a part-time Employee's salary or work hours, it will be resolved by
72
examining actual hours worked during the 13 week period immediately prior to the Employee’s termination. The term "Continuous Service" shall be calculated in accordance with Article X, Sections 3 and 4 of the collective bargaining agreement, except that employment with any company within the CUNA Mutual Group shall be treated as employment with the Employer. The severance pay will be subject to deductions which are either required by law or authorized by the Employee.
The severance pay will be paid in bi-weekly installments, with each installment being in an amount equal to the Eligible Employee's bi-weekly salary at the time the Eligible Employee terminated employment with CUNA Mutual; provided, that if an Eligible Employee is entitled to an odd number of weeks of salary (3,5 or 7), either the first or the final severance pay installment will be in an amount equal to one-half of the Eligible Employee's bi-weekly salary at the time the Employee terminated employment with CUNA Mutual. The first installment of severance pay will be paid within thirty (30) days after the later of (a) the date the Eligible Employee delivers a properly-executed waiver and release to CUNA Mutual; or .	(b) the Eligible Employee's last day of work at CUNA Mutual. However, CUNA Mutual
has . the right to combine two or more installment payments. In the event an Eligible Employee dies before receiving all the severance pay installments due the Eligible Employee, the remaining installments will be paid to the Eligible Employee's estate, with CUNA Mutual retaining the right to pay the remaining installments in a lump sum.
. In the event the Eligible Employee becomes re-employed by CUNA Mutual prior to receiving all of the severance pay installments to which he or she would otherwise be entitled, no further severance pay installments will be due or paid to the Eligible Employee.
3.	Health Benefits. If an Eligible Employee who provides a waiver and release has group medical, dental and/or vision coverage in effect at the time the Eligible Employee terminates employment with CUNA Mutual, CUNA Mutual will continue, for the duration of the Severance Period, the medical, dental and/or vision coverage that the Eligible Employee had in place at the time his or her employment terminated, subject to the Eligible Employee paying the premium for such coverage to the same extent as is required of similarly-situated, actively employed Employees. The amount of the required contribution will change as the amount required of similarly-situated, actively employed Employees changes. In the event that at some point during the Severance Period, the medical, dental or vision coverage that the Eligible Employee had in place at the time of termination is no longer available to Employees, the Eligible Employee will be offered coverage which is the same as or substantially similar to the coverage then being offered to similarly-situated, , actively employed, Employees, at a cost equal to the cost required of similarly-situated, actively employed, Employees. In the event the medical, dental or vision provider requires that coverage for terminated employees be continued under COBRA, then if the Eligible Employee wishes to continue the medical, dental or vision coverage, such coverage will have to be continued pursuant to COBRA; the Eligible Employee will have to complete the appropriate COBRA continuation form(s); and the Eligible Employee will have to pay the premium for the COBRA-continued coverage to the same extent as is required of similarly-situated, actively employed, Employees who are enrolled in the program covering active employees.
All compensation paid to an Eligible Employee for waiving coverage for group medical, . dental or vision will cease to accrue and no further payments will be paid after the date the Employee terminates employment
73
4.	Life Insurance. For an Eligible Employee who provides a waiver and release, CUNA Mutual will continue, subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of the applicable plans, the Eligible Employee's life insurance coverage which was in place at the time of the Eligible Employee's termination of employment for the duration of the Severance Period. As a condition to continued coverage under this Section 4, an Eligible Employee must make such premium contributions as are required to be made from time to time by similarly-situated, actively-employed Employees. For purposes of this Section 4, the coverages which continue, subject to an Eligible Employee's paying the applicable premium therefor, include basic life insurance, optional Group Term Life Insurance, Spouse/Dependent Term Life Insurance, and Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance. When the extended coverage period under this Section 4 terminates, the Eligible Employee will have such continuation or conversion rights as may be provided by law or CUNA Mutual's plan(s).
5.	Other Benefits.
(a)	Time-Off Benefits. An Eligible Employee’s right (if any) to receive payment for any accumulated time off benefits and an Eligible Employee’s right (if any) to use accumulated sick leave to pay for a portion of the Eligible Employee’s retiree medical coverage will be governed by the terms of the Collective Bargaining
* Agreement in effect-at the time the- Eligible Employee terminates his or her employment, and will not be affected by an Eligible Employee’s decision to take a severance benefit.
(b)	Outplacement. An Eligible Employee who provides a waiver and release will be eligible to receive the basic level of outplacement assistance from an outplacement firm or consultant selected by CUNA Mutual. If the Eligible Employee wishes to use the outplacement assistance, the Eligible Employee must utilize the benefit within one month after his or her employment terminates.
6* Bridging to Qualified Retirement Events. If an Eligible Employee who provides CUNA Mutual with a waiver and release has a “Qualified Retirement Event” that occurs within the Severance Period, .CUNA Mutual will place the Eligible Employee on paid leave of absence for such period of time (the “Leave Period”) as may be necessary for the Eligible Employee to reach his or her Qualified Retirement Event. The sole purpose of the Leave Period is to enable the Eligible Employee to attain his or her Qualified Retirement Event. The Eligible Employee will not be required to (and shall not) perform any labor or service for CUNA Mutual during the Leave Period. Once the Eligible Employee has attained his or her Qualified Retirement Event, the Eligible Employee will be taken off of paid leave status and his or her employment will officially be terminated; however, the Eligible Employee will continue to be eligible for the benefits outlined in Paragraphs 2,3,4 and 5 for the balance of the Severance Period.
During the Leave Period segment of the Severance Period, in addition to the benefits outlined in Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5, the Eligible Employee will also continue to participate in CUNA Mutual’s retirement plans for Represented Employees and will also continue to accrue vacation, sick leave and personal leave. Other than as described above, the Eligible Employee will not participate in any CUNA Mutual benefit plans nor will he or she be eligible to receive any bonuses (Longevity, CSSP, Holiday, other) that might otherwise be payable within the Leave Period.
74
For purposes of this Paragraph 6, a Qualified Retirement Event is defined as, and limited to, one of the following: the date on which an Eligible Employee first (a) attains Magic 85 under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan; (b) becomes eligible for an Early Retirement benefit under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan; (c) attains “Qualified Retirement" for retiree medical purposes; or, (d) becomes vested under the Defined Benefit Pension Plan.
Example of Bridging: An Eligible Employee with 24-1/2 years of Continuous Service would become eligible for Magic 85 twenty weeks after her employment would terminate in the absence of the special bridging feature. If the Eligible Employee opts for a severance, the first 20 weeks of the Severance Period will be treated as a Leave Period. At the end of die
• .	Leave Period, the Eligible Employee would have 28 weeks remaining in the
Severance Period.
7.	Seniority on Rehire. This is a voluntary severance program. Persons who receive benefits ' under this Plan have voluntarily resigned from CUNA Mutual. Should such persons : ^become rehired by CUNA Mutual, they will be treated as persons who had previously voluntarily resigned their employment.
8.	; c Waiver of Rights. The parties agree that Eligible Employees who elect this severance have ‘ voluntarily resigned their employment with CUNA Mutual. Therefore, severing Employees do not have contractual rights afforded under the collective bargaining agreement to Employees who are involuntarily laid off. This includes, but is not limited to, loss of bumping, notice and recall rights. Further, Eligible Employees who elect a severance are not Employees of CUNA Mutual after the last day they are actively at work even though they may be receiving severance pay or other benefits under this Plan.
As a condition precedent to receiving any benefits under this Plan, an Eligible Employee is required to sign the waiver and release in a form determined by and provided by CUNA Mutual.
9.	Term of Agreement This Severance Plan shall be in full force and effect for the term of the collective bargaining agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
CUNA MUTUAL INSURANCE SOCIETY
AND
OFFICE & PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION LOCAL-39
(Information and Technology Services Division Work Week Agreement)
June 16,2005
This ITS Work Week Agreement is entered into this date of June 16, 2005 by and between Office & Professional Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, Local 39 (“Union”) and CUNA Mutual Insurance Society, (“CUNA Mutual”).
CUNA Mutual and OPEIU Local 39 wish to replace the current ITS Voluntary Work Week Agreement (which became effective April 1, 1997) with this new ITS Work Week Agreement for a certain group of positions in the Information and Technology Services Division.
The parties mutually agree as follows:
1.	Employees Covered. ITS represented professional staff, salary grades 225 through 245 are covered by this Agreement and listed in Appendices I and II to this Agreement. CUNA Mutual will establish and maintain Appendices I and II which will list both employees and positions.
2.	Participation.
(a)	Covered employees who chose to participate in the 40 hour work week under the April 1,1997 Agreement shall continue to participate under this Agreement. The following employees who have not previously elected to participate in the 40 hour work week will be able to choose to participate in the future and their base salary will be increased according to the conversion formula described in 6(a) in this agreement.
None
Once an employee begins participation in the 40 hour work week schedule, he/she will continue to participate in such schedule until the employee no longer occupies a position listed on Appendices I and IL
(b)	Existing non-exempt CUNA Mutual employees who bid on a non-exempt position listed in Appendix I, but who occupy a position not listed in Appendix I or II shall become participating employees under this agreement on the date they begin the new position.
(c)	Existing non-exempt CUNA Mutual employees who bid on an exempt IT professional position listed in Appendix II, but who occupy a position not listed in Appendix I or II shall become participating employees under this agreement on the date they begin the new position.
(d)	Existing exempt CUNA Mutual employees who bid on an exempt IT professional position listed in Appendix II, but who occupy a position not listed in Appendix I or II shall become participating employees under this agreement on the date they begin the new position.
(e)	Existing exempt CUNA Mutual employees who bid on an non-exempt IT professional position listed in Appendix I, but who occupy a position not listed in Appendix I or II shall become participating employees under this agreement on the date they begin the new position.
,(f) Persons hired from outside CUNA Mutual into one of the positions listed in Appendix I or II will become participating employees on their first day of work at CUNA Mutual.
(g)	Employees transferring out of IT will be placed on such work week and schedule as determined in accordance with Article IV, Section 1 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and will no longer be participating employees: .	...
3.	Work Week. Employees who become participating employees covered by this Agreement will have a change in the contractual work week from 37.5 to 40 hours.
4.	Work Schedules. This Agreement is not intended to change any existing work schedules for covered employees. However, such schedules are subject to change as set forth in Article IV, Section 1. Non-exempt.employees will not be.assigned a schedule which results in more than 40 hours weekly.
5.	Overtime, Compensatory Time. For participating employees, Article IV of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties.is amended to replace 37.5 hours with 40 hours as the weekly maximum used to determine payment of overtime or granting of compensatory time for non-exempt employees, and the work week for pay purposes will be forty (40) hours (Collective Bargaining Agreement Article-IV, Sections 1 and 2). All work hours which result in the payment of overtime or the crediting of compensatory time must be scheduled and approved.
6.	Salary Administration for Participating Employees.
(a)	The conversion formula for changing from a 37.5 hour work week schedule.to 40 hour schedule is as follows: The present 37.5 hour annual base salary will be multiplied by 1.12162. The result will be divided by 2080 hours to determine their new hourly rate.
(b)	If the 40-hour work week annual salary exceeds the maximum salary of a participating employee’s position, as identified in the current Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties, the participating employee will receive the entire 40-hour salary increase added to his or her base salary on the effective date of this Agreement. Any future salary increases will be administered according to the terms and conditions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in effect at that time.
(c)	Participating employees scheduled to work a 40-hour work week retain the 40 hour work week until they transfer out of the Information and Technology Division. Should they transfer out of IT, the employee’s work schedule will be determined by the employee’s manager, in accordance with Article IV of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In addition, their salary will be reduced
•	accordingly. The intent and effect of this salary reduction is to place the transferring participating employee in the salary position he or she would have been in had the participating employee worked a 37.5 hour work week.
7.	Record Keeping for Participating Employees. Paid time off, vacation, personal time and sick leave, will be earned and used based on a (40) forty hour work week while on the 40 hour work week, but will revert to the earning schedules in the Collective Bargaining Agreement at the time of the covered participating employee’s transfer out of the Information and Technology Division.
8.	Terms of Agreement This Agreement is effective on the 16th day of June, 2005 and will terminate coincidentally with the duration of the current 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement (6/15/05-3/31/08); provided that this Agreement can be terminated prior to the expiration of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement by mutual agreement of the parties.
9.	- ■ Other than as set forth in this Agreement, no other contractual amendments are being made or intended. If unforeseen problems or interpretations arise, the parties agree to meet and resolve those issues swiftly and with due diligence.
10.	The Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties hereto and supersedes
any and all prior agreements, arrangements or understandings between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof.

A.	The Employer and the Union agree that those positions attached to this Memorandum of Agreement, as Attachment A, will, as of the execution of this Agreement, be added to the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union.
B.	The incumbent employees of said positions will be given a joint letter from the Employer and the Union within ten (10) days of the execution of this Agreement advising the incumbent employees of their right to make a determination whether they wish to become a member of the collective bargaining unit and be represented by the Union or whether they wish to remain unrepresented by the Union. The joint letter will state the option being given to the employee, why that option is being given to the employee, what will be the general terms and conditions of employment for the employee should he/she determine they want to be represented by the Union. The incumbent employee will be informed that as of January 1, 1996, or the expiration date of the parties’ successor collective bargaining agreement, whichever is later, the employee will be placed in the collective bargaining unit.
C.	The incumbent employee will have a three (3) month period, commencing from the execution date of die parties’ successor collective bargaining agreement to decide whether he/she wishes to join the collective bargaining unit and be represented by the Union. The incumbent employee must notify the Employer and the Union in writing in the form of a letter or memorandum. The incumbent employee will have this same opportunity during the periods November 1 -November 30, 1994, November 1 - November 30,1995, and November 1 -November 30, 1996. If an incumbent employee makes a decision to join the Union and collective bargaining unit, the employee will not be allowed to change his/her decision in the future. At the time the incumbent employee joins the collective bargaining unit and joins the Union and on or before the effective date of said transfer from non-Union to Union status, the employee will sign a statement acknowledging the wages, hours, benefits and working conditions which will cover the employee.
If an incumbent employee does not opt for Union representation during the three (3) month period from the execution date of the parties’ successor Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Employee will sign a statement acknowledging that the Union has no legal obligation to represent them for as long as the Employee chooses not to be represented by the Union, even though the parties to this Agreement have agreed the position occupied by the incumbent Employee is a position within the collective bargaining unit.
D.	When the incumbent Employee leaves the position, now placed in the collective bargaining unit by this Agreement, and should the Employee assume another position in the Company, whether the former incumbent Employee is now represented by the Union will be determined by whether the new position is a position represented by the Union.
E.	When the incumbent Employee leaves the position, the position will be posted and filled pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
F.	Should an incumbent Employee determine to become a member of the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union, the Employee’s continuous service and seniority shall be based upon employment in both represented and nonrepresented positions and seniority shall apply as determined by the parties’ collective bargaining agreement then in effect. The Employee will receive the same fringe benefits as other Union represented Employees. The Employee’s job grade will be determined by the appropriate joint Employer and Union Evaluation Committee.
Incumbents in positions which the Employer and the Union agree will be placed in the bargaining unit who choose to join the collective bargaining unit will have their salaries determined by the Employer and the Union. In many cases, it might be appropriate to maintain current salary. The pay and benefits of the employee will be determined by a committee set up under this Agreement with two (2) representatives of the Employer and two (2) representatives of the Union. The goal of the Committee will be to have a result that is cost and compensation neutral. That Committee must reach agreement as there will be no adjudication procedure for any dispute. This determination would be on a case-by-case basis.
-2-
II.	Vacant Positions.
A.	If the vacant positions that the Employer and the Union have agreed will be in the collective bargaining unit are filled, the new incumbent will automatically be in the collective bargaining unit. (See Attachment A for vacant positions the Employer and the Union have agreed are in the collective bargaining unit.)
B.	Those vacant positions the Union removed from its unit clarification petition, when filled, the new incumbents will be excluded from the collective bargaining unit.
III	. Secretarial Exclusions From the Collective Bargaining Unit.
A.	The joint memorandum, dated July 25,1985, and signed by Robert L. Wermuth for the Employer and Joyce Roseneau, former Chief Union Steward for the Union (Employer Exhibit 6 in the hearing before the National Labor Relations Board in this matter), as of the execution of this Agreement, shall no longer be effective.
B.	The following secretaries will be excluded from the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union:
•	Secretaries in the President’s Office	•
♦	Secretaries in the Legal Department
•	Secretaries to persons with the title of Senior Vice President or comparable or greater titles. (Example: Executive Vice President)
•	Secretaries to Senior Marketing Officers
•	Secretaries to Officers in the Human Resources Department
•	Secretaries to Business Division Vice Presidents
•	Secretaries to the Vice President of Internal Auditing and the Vice President of Communications and Public Relations
•	Other secretarial positions will be excluded from the bargaining unit if they meet the legal standards for "confidential” Employees
If a Senior Vice President is replaced by a Vice President and/or should the Employer add Senior Vice Presidents after the date of this Agreement, the Employer will advise the Union as to the particulars of the position.
C.	The Employer and the Union agree that secretaries to the above positions who are currently in the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union will be given the same option as those Employees in paragraph I to decide whether they no longer wish to be in the collective bargaining unit and represented by the Union or that they wish to remain in the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union. As of January 1,1996, or the expiration of the parties’ successor collective bargaining agreement, whichever is later, the secretary will be removed from the collective bargaining unit.
-3-
D.	The Employer and the Union agree that there may be other secretaries who are confidential. The confidentiality of those secretaries, not delineated above, shall be determined by the labor nexus standard of the National Labor Relations Act, as interpreted by the National Labor Relations Board.
IV	. Employees Who Travel/Sell.
A.	The parties recognize that positions that regularly travel as part of their jobs, which positions are being placed in the bargaining unit, will have to have their compensation reviewed by a committee to ensure equity to the employee and CUNA Mutual, recognizing that the overtime language of the contract may be inappropriate for these positions.
B.	The parties recognize that it is appropriate to include incentive pay as one of the elements of compensation for positions which sell products or services or which directly interface with and represent CUNA Mutual’s interests in dealings with the senior management of CUNA Mutual’s credit union customers.
C.	Incentive and compensation issues will be addressed by the Committee under paragraph I (f).
V.	Procedure for Considering Disputes Over Inclusion or Exclusion of Job Classifications in the Future After the Execution of This Agreement.
A.	The Employer and the Union recognize that it is not in the best interests of the parties to allow disputes over whether a position should be included in the collective bargaining unit to remain unresolved. The Employer and the Union agree that the procedure set forth herein is a reasonable attempt to resolve such . disputes expeditiously.
B.	When the Employer posts an entry level management position (Grade 300-335), the Union will be given a copy of the posting and may request an “informational" meeting on the posted management position. Such meeting will be informational only to afford the Union the opportunity to receive from an Employer representative the reasons why the position was posted as management. This meeting will not delay the filling of the management position.
C.	The Union will be afforded the same opportunity to request an “informational” meeting for management positions that are not posted. The purpose of this meeting is, again, to afford the Union the opportunity to receive from a representative of the Employer the reasons why the position is considered by the Employer to be management. (Note: A management position may also be supervisory or confidential - the word ‘‘management” is used merely to represent , a position not subject to the collective bargaining unit and representation by the Union.)
-4-
D.	Should the Union disagree, after explanation by the Employer, that the position is management or an unrepresented position, the Union must, within fifteen (15) working days from the informational meeting with the representative of the Employer, file a written grievance pursuant to Article XVIII of the Employer and Union Collective Bargaining Agreement. The grievance must be resolved or scheduled for hearing (hearing date selected) before an arbitrator no later than sixty (60) calendar days from the filling of the grievance. This timetable takes precedence over the time limits in Article XVIH of the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The Employer and the Union agree, by their representatives whose signatures are affixed hereto, that the aforestated terms and conditions of this Agreement are the complete agreement between the Employer and the Union to resolve the unit clarification petition in Case No. 30-UC-320. This Agreement and any of its terms can be modified only by the written agreement of both the Employer and the Union. This Agreement will continue in effect from year to year without any action by the parities but may be terminated by the written agreement of the Employer and the Union.
The parties’ representatives, whose signatures are affixed hereto, state that they have read, understand and, on behalf of the Employer and the Union, agree with the terms of this Agreement.
