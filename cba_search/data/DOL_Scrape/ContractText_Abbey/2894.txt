Re: COBA Agreement for the period of February 1, 2003 to April 30, 2005 - Change of Sick Leave Language
Dear Mr. Seabrook:
The sole intent of the change in the sick leave language in Article X, Section 2 of the October 1, 1991 -March 31, 1995 Agreement was to acknowledge enactment of Section 9-117.1(a) of the New York City Administrative Code which allows Correction Officers to continue to exclude line of duty sick leave payments from gross income in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 104 (a)(1) and Section 1.104 (b) of the Internal Revenue Service Regulations.
Please be assured that the 1987-90 Police Agreement varied in the same manner from the 1984-87 Police Agreement as did the Correction Officers Agreement, and that there was no intent to nor does it deprive any Correction Officer of any benefit nor diminish any benefit, but rather to keep and further an existing benefit.
The sick leave provisions of Article X, Section 2 (i) and (ii) of the 2003-2005 Correction Officer Agreement have no other purpose, nor shall they have any other use, but to continue the benefit therein previously contained.

Dear Mr. Seabrook:
The City and the COBA recognize that, pursuant to Administrative Code Section 12-127, the City is obligated to pay for the cost of line of duty injury prescription drugs for COBA members. The parties further recognize that a significant number of COBA members have utilized the COBA Health and Welfare Fund to pay for these prescription drugs without reimbursement by the City. The COBA agrees to waive any and all claims retroactively and prospectively against the City for the reimbursement of the cost of line of duty injury prescription drugs.

Re: COBA Agreement for the period of February 1, 2003 to April 30, 2005
Dear Mr. Seabrook:
This is to confirm the mutual understanding of the parties with respect to the above captioned Agreement.
The Department of Correction plans to expand the application of “unit management” on a phased-in basis.
The Department reserves its rights to staff its facilities in accordance with the needs of the Agency. To this end, “unit management” shall not impede the assignment of staff, at the discretion of management, between and/or among units in a facility under unit management. The terms of the “travel time” sideletter shall continue to apply in instances where a Correction Officer is assigned to a location outside his/her parent command, except for field assignments.
The Department of Correction will schedule vacations in the most efficient and cost-effective manner (i.e., “vacation smoothing”). Vacation picks shall be based on seniority by tour within the command to assure to the greatest extent practicable an even distribution by tour in each of the respective vacation picks, that is, no more than ten percent of the command by tour per pick.
In the event that unit management is not implemented, or discontinued at management’s discretion after implementation, the vacation scheduling modifications shall nevertheless continue to apply. In such an instance, however, the parties agree to reopen the contract on a limited basis with respect to negotiations on an alternate disposition of the savings associated with this issue.
Nothing contained herein shall limit or diminish the Employer’s or the Union’s rights pursuant to §12-307(b) of the New York City Collective Bargaining Law, except as specifically provided herein. Notwithstanding this, the Union waives its right to raise any claims of any nature relating to this vacation scheduling modification including, but not limited to, a claim of practical impact relating to this scheduling modification, and the Union agrees that all matters subject to bargaining have been disposed of in this Agreement. Notwithstanding this, a claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of the vacation scheduling modification may be the subject of a grievance.
Correction Officers Benevolent Association	February 1,2003 to April 30,2005
Norman Seabrook Page Two
The Employer and the Union agree to convene a labor-management meeting at the request of either party to meet and confer on issues that may arise from the implementation of unit management in the various facilities. The Office of Labor Relations will send a representative at the request of either party.
The Employer and the Union understand and agree that in the event that any aspect of this agreement is contingent on the amendment of Section 9-116 of the Administrative Code for the purpose of effectuating this agreement, then the Union shall cooperate and assist the Employer in its efforts to achieve the necessary amendment, if any, subject to approval by both the City and the union of the language and other terms of the said legislation.
If any part of this Agreement is found by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, then the terms of this Agreement in its entirety will immediately terminate and be given no further effect. In such event, the parties agree to negotiate immediately over substitute savings to be achieved.
If the above accords with your understanding, please execute the signature line provided below.
