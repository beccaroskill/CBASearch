Section 2.	Operations Covered
The execution of this Agreement on the part of the Employer shall cover all employees of the Employer in the bargaining unit at any existing terminals at which the TNUPSFNC has been certified as the collective bargaining representative. The Locals designated by the TNUPSFNC to administer the Agreement shall also be deemed parties to this Agreement.
Section 3.	Transfer of Company Title or Interest
In the event the Company is sold or any part of its operations covered by this Agreement is transferred, the Company shall give notice to the Local Union to the extent required by applicable law.
- I -
The Company shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any entity involved in the sale or other transaction by which the operation covered by this, or any part thereof, may be transferred. Such notice shall be in writing, with a copy to the Local Union, at the time of the purchase and sale negotiation are made known to the public or the Company executes a contract or transaction as herein described, whichever first occurs. The Local Union shall also be advised of the exact nature of the transaction, not including financial details.

Section 1.	Agreement
The execution of this Agreement on the part of the Company shall apply to the job classifications defined and set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 3
RECOGNITION, UNION SHOP, AND CHECKOFF
Section 1.	Recognition
(a)	The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the Teamsters National United Parcel Service Freight Negotiating Committee is the exclusive representative of all employees of the Employer in covered classifications. The employees covered by this Agreement shall constitute one (I) bargaining unit. The Local Unions designated by the TNUPSFNC to represent the covered employees shall be parties to this Agreement.
(b)	When the Employer needs additional employees, it shall give the Union equal opportunity with all other sources to provide suitable applicants, but the Employer shall not be required to hire those referred by the Union.
Business agents and/or a steward shall be permitted to attend new employee orientations. The Employer agrees to provide the Local Union at least one week’s notice of the date, time, and location of such orientation. The sole purpose of the business agent’s or steward’s attendance shall be to encourage new employees to join the Union.
Section 2.	Union Shop and Dues
(a)	All present employees who are members of the Local Union on the effective date of this Subsection or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, shall remain members of the Local Union in good standing as a condition of employment. In order to assist the Local Unions in maintaining current and accurate membership records, the Employer will furnish the appropriate Local Union a list of new employees. The Employer agrees to notify the Local Union when a new employee attains seniority. This notification will be made in conjunction with the new employee listing. The list will include the name, address, social security number, date of hire, service center to which assigned, shift, and classification or position hired into. The list will be provided on a monthly basis. All present employees who are not members of the Local
-3-
Union and all employees who are hired hereafter, shall become and remain members in good standing of the Local Union as a condition of employment on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of their employment, or on and after the thirty-first (31 st) day following the effective date of this Subsection, or the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. An employee who has failed to acquire, or thereafter maintain, membership in the Union, as herein provided, shall be terminated seventy-two (72) hours after the Employer has received written notice from an authorized representative of the Local Union, certifying that membership has been, and is continuing to be offered to such employees on the same basis as all other members, and further that the employee has had notice and opportunity to make all dues or initiation fee payments. This provision shall be made and become effective as of such time as it may be made and become effective under the provision of the National Labor Relations Act, but not retroactively.
(b)	No provision of Section 2(a) of this Article shall apply to the extent that it may be prohibited by state law. In the event Subsection (a) above may not be validly applied, the Employer agrees to recommend to all new employees that they become members of the Union and maintain such membership during the life of this Agreement.
Section 3.	Dues Checkoff
The Employer agrees to deduct from the pay of all employees covered by this Agreement the initiation fees, dues and/or uniform assessments of the Local Union having jurisdiction over such employees. The Local Union will electronically provide the Employer a weekly amount to be deducted from each employee. The Local Union will individually specify the weekly amount to be deducted for initiation fees, union dues and/or assessments. For initiation fees and assessments, the Local Union will notify the Employer the number of weeks these deductions are to be taken from the employee. Notification of deductions to be made by the Employer for the benefit of the Local Union must be received at least one (1) month prior to the date the deduction is to be made. The obligation of the Local Union to provide this information shall be satisfied by the transmission of a computer file in mutually agreeable format.
-4-
The Employer shall make no deductions that are not listed on the Local Union’s monthly or weekly checkoff statement in those locations which send a checkoff statement to the Employer. In the event the Employer improperly deducts too much dues money, the amount improperly withheld shall be remitted to the involved employee(s) on the second (2nd) scheduled workday following notification to the Employer. The Local Union(s) shall return any overpayment(s) to the Employer within one (1) week following written notification from the Employer.
The Employer will provide a remittance to the Local Union within fifteen (15) days following the check date the deduction was taken. With each remittance, the Employer shall submit a report listing all employees alphabetically with their social security number and job classification. For those employees who had no deduction for the week, the Employer will provide a reason. In the event the Local Union does not want to receive a weekly remittance, the Employer will provide a monthly remittance by the fifteenth (15th) day of the following month. However, if this option is chosen, the Employer will still make weekly deductions as described above.
Where law requires written authorization by the employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law.
The Employer agrees to deduct from the paycheck of all employees covered by this Agreement voluntary contributions to DRIVE. DRIVE shall notify the Employer of the amounts designated by each contributing employee that are to be deducted from his/her paycheck on a weekly basis for all weeks worked. The phrase “weeks worked” excludes any week other than a week in which the employee earned a wage. The Employer shall transmit to DRIVE National Headquarters on a monthly basis, in one (I) check, the total amount deducted along with the name of each employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the employee’s Social Security number and the amount deducted from that employee’s paycheck. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters shall reimburse the Employer annually for the Employer’s actual cost for the expenses incurred in administering the weekly payroll deduction plan.
-5-
The Employer agrees to deduct certain specific amounts each week from the wages of those employees who shall have given the Employer written notice to make such deductions. The Employer will remit amounts deducted to the applicable credit union once each week. The amount so deducted shall be remitted to the applicable credit union once each month or weekly. The Employer shall not make deductions and shall not be responsible for remittance to the credit union for any deductions for those weeks during which the employee’s earnings shall be less than the amount authorized for deductions.
ARTICLE 4 STEWARDS
The Company recognizes the right of the Local Union to designate job stewards and alternates from the Company’s seniority list. The authority of job stewards and alternates so designated by the Local Union shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the following duties and activities:
(a)	The investigation and presentation of grievances with his/her Company or the designated Company representative in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement;
(b)	The collection of dues when authorized by appropriate Local Union action;
(c)	The transmission of such messages and information, which shall originate with and are authorized by the Local Union or its officers, provided such messages and information:
1.	have been reduced to writing; or
2.	if not reduced to writing, are of routine nature and do not involve work stoppages, slowdowns, refusals to handle goods, or any other interference with the Company’s business.
When requested by the employee, there shall be a steward present whenever the Company meets with the employee to conduct investigatory interviews which may result in discipline or discharge or to
-6-
discuss a grievance. If a steward is unavailable, the employee may designate a bargaining unit member who is immediately available at the service center at the time of the meeting to be present. Meetings or interviews shall not begin until the steward or designated bargaining unit member, if requested, is present. An employee who does not want a Union steward or designated available bargaining unit member present at any meeting or interview where the employee has a right to Union representation, must waive Union representation in writing. If the Union requests a copy of the waiver, the Company shall promptly furnish it.
Stewards and alternates have no authority to take strike action or any other action interrupting the Company’s business, except as authorized by official action of the Local Union. The Company recognizes these limitations upon the authorized Job Stewards and their alternates, and shall not hold the Union liable for any unauthorized acts. The Company in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to impose proper, nondiscriminatory discipline, including discharge. However, in the event the Job Steward or the designated alternate has led, or instigated or encouraged unauthorized strike action, slowdown or work stoppages in violation of this Agreement, he/she may be singled out for more serious discipline, up to and including discharge. Stewards and/or alternate stewards shall not be subject to discipline for performing any of the duties within the scope of their authority and defined in this Section, in the manner permitted by this Section.
The Steward or the designated alternate shall be permitted reasonable time to investigate, present and process grievances on the Company’s property without interruption of the Company’s operation. Upon notification to his or her supervisor, a steward shall be afforded the right to leave his/her work area for a reasonable period of time to investigate, present and process grievances and to represent a fellow employee concerning grievances or discipline so long as such activity does not interrupt the Employer’s operations. The Company will make a reasonable effort to ensure that its operations are not interrupted by the steward’s engaging in such activities. The Company shall not use interruption of its operation as a subterfuge for denying such right to the steward. Time spent in handling griev
- 7 -
ances during the job steward’s or his/her designated alternate’s regular working hours shall be considered working hours in computing daily and/or weekly overtime if within the regular schedule of the “job steward.”
The Employer shall only be obligated to respond to information requests that are approved by the business agent of the Local Union assigned to represent employees covered by this Agreement.
Union stewards shall be allowed to wear a Union Steward pin while on the Employer’s property.
ARTICLE 5
Section 1.	Seniority
(a)	Upon completion of the probationary period, the employee’s seniority for all purposes shall be the first (Ist) day worked as a probationary employee. Seniority shall be broken only by discharge, voluntary quit, normal retirement, or more than a two (2) year layoff, or leave, except for employees on workers compensation leave who shall not suffer a break in seniority unless on leave for more than three (3) years.
(b)	A list of employees arranged in the order of their seniority shall be posted on the Union bulletin board no less often than once every six (6) months. A copy of the seniority posting shall be sent to the Local Union.
(c)	Any controversy over the seniority standing of any employee on the seniority list shall be subject to the grievance procedure. An employee shall have thirty (30) days to protest his placement on the seniority list once it is first posted. If there is no written protest within this thirty (30) day period, the employee shall not have a right to challenge his placement on the list thereafter.
(d)	For full-time employees there shall be two seniority lists, “local cartage” and “over-the-road.” There shall also be a separate “casual local cartage” seniority list. Employees in the following classifications shall be included on the local cartage seniority list: all truck
- 8 -
drivers, helpers, dock workers, jockeys, and such other employees as may be presently or hereafter represented by the Union, engaged in local pickup, delivery, and assembling of freight. The “over-the-road” seniority list shall include all over-the-road drivers whose primary job is to transport freight between the Employer’s facilities. Nothing within this paragraph shall preclude the Company from requesting a road driver to make extra stops to pick up or deliver freight in connection with his regular run or performing other local cartage work as the Company may assign. It is not the intent of the Company that this provision be utilized to diminish cartage employees’ work.
(e)	The Company shall offer extra city or dock work to road employees who are on layoff and who are qualified and immediately available for city or dock work prior to using casual employees, except where there is a mutually agreed procedure to the contrary. No road employee shall gain “local cartage” seniority under this provision, but he/she shall accrue Company seniority.
(f)	The following shall apply to casual employees:
1.	The date an employee is hired as a casual will be the casual seniority date.
2.	A casual employee laid off due to lack of work for less than one year will retain his/her casual seniority. Company and job classification seniority shall be lost due to discharge, voluntary quit or retirement.
3.	The date a casual employee obtains full-time employment shall be the employee’s regular seniority date.
4.	A casual employee whose layoff exceeds one (1) year shall be considered to have been terminated and shall lose seniority, but may reapply for employment.
5.	A full-time employee’s seniority shall prevail over a casual employee’s seniority in case of layoff.
6.	If a full-time position is available for bid, and is not bid upon by
-9-
a qualified regular full-time employee, the casual employee with the most seniority who bids on the position will be awarded the position if he/she meets the minimum qualifications of the position.
7.	Casual employees will be laid off and recalled to their job classification in accordance with Section 2 below.
8.	When a casual or combination of casuals works the same shift for eight (8) continuous hours forty-five (45) days in ninety (90) consecutive calendar days, other than as a temporary replacement for an employee on vacation or leave of absence, the Company shall create a full-time position that it may classify, at its discretion, as a fulltime dock with CDL or fulltime dock only; pay will be in accordance with Article 26.
(g)	In developing the initial Local Cartage seniority list referenced above, the Company shall use the employee’s Company seniority date unless a particular employee transferred into his current service center from another service center. In such event, the employee’s transfer date to the current service center shall be used to develop the seniority list.
Section 2.	Layoffs
(a)	When it becomes necessary to.reduce the working force, the last employee hired on the affected classification seniority list shall be laid off first, unless CDL qualifications are necessary. The affected regular employee may bump the most junior employee in another job classification provided the bumping employee is qualified to do the job. The bumping employee goes to the bottom of the new job classification seniority list. If the employee exercises the right to bump and receives a recall notice, the employee must return to the position from which he/she was laid off. Company benefits will be provided in accordance with the terms of the applicable SPD.
An employee on layoff will be offered work in any or all classifications (road, city, or dock) at his domicile ahead of any casual or probationary employees, provided he/she is available and qualified.
- 10-
(b)	An employee shall be entitled to a notice of layoff from the Company if they are subject to the daily elimination of their job under paragraphs (c) or (d) below for a period of at least two (2) consecutive weeks. The notice shall be provided to the employee and the Local Union, upon request. If such notice is provided, the employee shall be considered laid off and have the right to exercise the privileges of the first paragraph of this Section.
(c)	If a road driver’s run is cut for the day, the road driver will have the option of (1) holding until his/her next bid, (2) dovetailing into the extra board or (3) working ahead of a casual employee. Option (2) and (3) will only be available to the driver if he/she will be able to meet their next bid start time.
(d)	If a P&D driver’s run is cut for the day, the P&D driver will have the option of (1) taking the day off pursuant to (e) below, or (2) displacing the junior P&D driver who starts at the same time or after them, if any. The displaced P&D driver may work ahead of a casual employee for available hours, provided the driver will be able to meet their next bid start time.
(e)	When more than one employee within a job classification requests a day off, the Company will offer any available time off in seniority order.
Section 3.	Recall
Employees on layoff (including employees who exercised their right to bump) shall be recalled in the reverse order of their layoff, provided the employee is qualified to perform the work, if work is available. Notice of recall shall be mailed to the employee's last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall set forth the time and date the laid off employee is to report back to work. The employee shall have seven (7) calendar days from the date the return receipt is signed to contact the Employer and seven (7) calendar days to return to his/her previous job. In the event an employee fails to make himself/herself available for work at the end of the seven (7) calendar days, he/she shall lose all seniority rights under this Agreement.
- 11 -
Section 4.	Posting
(a)	Starting times, by classification will be posted for bid on the Union bulletin board on a semi-annual basis in June and December of each year. The bids will contain a description of the run or job. Bids shall remain posted for seven (7) calendar days, from Wednesday noon to Wednesday noon. The most senior employee bidding on the job shall be awarded the bid. The Company retains all rights to change the contents of any job after the bid process as necessary to service its customers. If the start time of a job changes more than two (2) hours or more than one hundred (100) miles (total within a week) for an “over-the-road” driver, the job shall be subject to re-bid under paragraph (b) below. In addition, if a bid job is cancelled more than ten (10) times in a calendar month, the job shall be subject to re-bid under paragraph (b) as well, provided the employee holding the job does not decide to remain in the job.

The decision of the NGP shall be final and binding. The NGP shall determine whether a decision submitted to it raises an issue of interpretation of Master Agreement language.

ARTICLE 27 DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING
Section 1. Controlled Substances Testing
The parties have agreed that the procedures as set forth in this Article shall be the methodology for all testing and will be modified only in the event that further federal legislation or Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations (as set forth in 49 CFR Parts 40 and 382) require revised testing methodologies or requirements during the term of this Agreement. To the extent that a subject is not covered by this Article the appropriate regulation shall control.
Should other categories, modifications or types of testing be required by the government, the parties will meet as expeditiously as possible to develop a mutually agreeable procedure.
Section 1.1	Employees Who Must Be Tested
UPS Freight employees subject to Department of Transportation mandated drug testing are drivers of vehicles with a vehicle weight rating over 26,000 pounds, requiring a Commercial Drivers License (CDL). This includes employees who relieve for vacations or other temporary vacancies.
In addition to testing mandated employees, controlled substance testing will be required as part of prequalification for driver positions.
-55 -
Employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement who are not subject to DOT mandated drug testing are subject to the same types of test as those employees who are covered by the DOT regulations. The substances for which testing shall be conducted, and cut-off levels thereto, shall be consistent with those listed for the DOT covered employees. This provision also applies to testing conducted pursuant to rehabilitation and after care programs.
Section 1.2	Testing
Because of the consequences that a positive test result has on an employee, UPS Freight will employ a very accurate, two-stage testing program. Urine samples will be analyzed by a highly qualified independent laboratory which is certified by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). All samples will be tested according to DOT drug testing requirements. Validity testing for the presence of adulterants shall be conducted on all specimens, per HHS requirements.
Section 1.3	Screening Test
The initial test uses an immunoassay to determine levels of drugs or drug metabolites. The following initial cutoff levels shall be used when screening specimens to determine whether they are negative for these five (5) drugs or drug classes.
Substance	Initial Test Level (ng/ml)
Marijuana Metabolites	50
Cocaine.Metabolites	150
6-Acetylmorphine	10
Opiate Metabolites	2000
Phencyclidine	25
Amphetamines	500
MDMA/MDA/MDEA	500
These substances and test levels are subject to change by the Department of Transportation as advances in technology or other considerations warrant.
Section 1.4	Confirmatory Test
All specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
-56-
techniques at the cutoff values listed. The following cutoff levels shall be used to confirm the presence of drugs or drug metabolites:
Substance	Confirmatory Test Level (ng/ml)
Marijuana Metabolite (I)	15
Cocaine Metabolite (2)	100
Opiates:	
Morphine (3)	2000
6-Acetylmorphine	10
Codeine (3)	2000
Phencyclidine	25
Amphetamines:	
Amphetamine	250
Methamphetamine (4)	250
MDMA/MDA/MDEA	250
(1)	Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA)
(2)	Benzoylecgonine confirmatory cutoff of 100 ng/ml.
(3)	Test for 6-AM when morphine concentration is greater than or equal to 2000 ng/ml. Morphine is the target analyte for codeine/morphine testing.
(4)	Specimen must also contain amphetamine at a concentration greater than or equal to one hundred (100) ng/ml before reporting methampetamine positive.
(5)	Methyleneddioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its analytes MDA and MDEA.
In the event the initial urine test indicates a positive response the confirmatory test must be done. These substances and test levels are subject to change by the Department of Transportation as advances in technology or other considerations warrant.
Section 1.5	Laboratory Testing
All laboratories selected by UPS Freight for analyzing Controlled Substances Testing will be HHS certified.
-57-
Section 1.6	Types of Testing Required
Testing procedures will be performed as part of pre-qualified practices, after defined DOT reportable accidents, on the basis of reasonable cause, upon return to duty after a positive test, under random testing and as follow-up testing for post drug rehabilitation.
Section 1.7	Pre-Qualification Testing
Controlled substance testing will be part of UPS Freight’s regulated pre-qualification conditions for driver positions.
Drivers will be advised in writing prior to the application process that pre-qualification testing will be conducted to determine the presence of controlled substances. Applicants will be required to acknowledge in writing an understanding of this request before they receive an application.
Section 1.8	Reasonable Cause Testing
Upon reasonable cause, UPS Freight will require an employee to be tested for the use of controlled substances.
Reasonable cause is defined as an employee’s observable action, appearance, or conduct that clearly indicates the need for a fitness for duty medical evaluation.
The employee’s conduct must be witnessed by at least one (I) supervisor, two (2) if available. The witnesses must have received training in observing a person’s behavior to determine if a medical evaluation is required. When the supervisor(s) confront(s) an employee, a Union representative should be made available, if requested. If no steward is present, the employee may select another hourly paid employee to represent him.
Documentation of the employee’s conduct shall be prepared and signed by the witnesses within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior, or before the test results are released, whichever is earlier. In addition, a copy will be sent to the Local Union in a timely manner. The employee shall not be required to waive any claim or cause of action under law.
-58-
Section 1.9	Post-Accident Drug Testing
All employees will be required to submit to a drug test after a DOT defined serious accident, which is one in which:
I.	There is a fatality, or;
2.	A citation is issued and there is bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, receives immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or;
3.	A citation is issued and one or more motor vehicles incur disabling damage as a result of the accident requiring a vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
Non-DOT mandated employees may be required to submit to drug testing if there is any reasonable suspicion of drug usage or reasonable cause to believe that the employee has been operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs, or reasonable cause to believe the employee was at fault in the accident and drug usage may have been a factor.
Drivers are required to submit to such testing as soon as possible, but in all events within thirty-two (32) hours. Union representation will be made available, as provided in this Agreement.
It is not the intention of this language to prohibit the driver from leaving the scene of an accident for the period of time necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to receive necessary medical attention.
The result of a urine test for the use of controlled substances, conducted by federal, state, or local officials having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of post-accident testing, provided such tests conform to applicable federal, state or local requirements, and that the results of the tests are obtained by the Employer.
Section 1.10	Notification
UPS Freight employees, subject to random drug testing, will be
-59-
notified of testing in person or by direct phone contact. Notification shall be given by the management person responsible for such notification. The procedure for selection of employees for random testing shall comply with DOT regulations. A copy of the procedures shall be supplied to the Union. The procedure shall be subject to the approval of the Union’s UPS Freight Safety and Health Committee, which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably.
Section 1.11	Rehabilitation and Testing After Return To Duty/SAP and Employer Duties
All employees shall be entitled to a leave of absence on a one-time basis for the purpose of rehabilitation for substance abuse. Such leave must be requested prior to notification of a drug or alcohol test and prior to engaging in any conduct that results in discipline.
The employee will be permitted to return to work from an approved leave of absence for rehabilitation, after the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully complied with prescribed education and/or treatment and the employee has provided a negative drug test result, as per cutoff levels contained in Section 1.3 or Section 1.4 of this Article, as applicable, and/or an alcohol test with an alcohol concentration less than 0.02.
It is understood that if the grievance procedure is utilized contractual time limits on disciplinary action and the employee’s request for rehabilitation will be suspended until resolution of the grievance.
Substance Abuse Professional (SAP)
Each Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) must be a licensed Doctor of Medicine or Osteopathy, or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, employee assistance professional, or drug and alcohol counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission) with knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol and controlled substance-related disorders and be knowledgeable of the SAP function as it relates to Employer interest in safety-sensitive functions and applicable DOT agency
-60-
regulations. In addition, the SAP shall keep current on applicable DOT agency regulations and comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements.
The SAP is responsible for performing the following functions:
1.	Conducting the initial face-to-face clinical assessment and evaluation to determine what assistance is needed by the employee to solve problems associated with alcohol and/or drug use;
2.	Referring the employee to an appropriate education and/or treatment program;
3.	Conducting a face-to-face follow-up evaluation to determine if the employee has actively participated in the education and/or treatment program and has demonstrated successful compliance with the initial assessment and evaluation recommendations;
4.	Providing the Employer with a follow-up drug and/or alcohol testing plan for the employee; and
5.	Providing the employee and Employer with recommendations for continuing education and/or treatment.
Follow-up testing shall consist of at least six (6) tests in the first (Ist) twelve (12) months following the employee’s return to duty. The one (1) year period may be extended as necessary by written verification of the Substance Abuse Professional.
Employer Responsibilities
Prior to allowing an employee to return to duty, after the employee has successfully completed rehabilitation, the employer shall:
(a)	Ensure that the employee is "drug free”, based on a drug test that shows no positive evidence of the presence of drug or a drug metabolite in the employee’s system.
(b)	Ensure that the employee has been evaluated by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) for drug use or abuse.
-61 -
(c)	Ensure and confirm with the Substance Abuse Professional that the employee demonstrates compliance with all conditions or requirements of a rehabilitation program in which he or she participated.
Section 1.12	Disciplinary Action
Employees may be subject to discipline up to and including discharge if they test positive for drugs as specified elsewhere in this Article. The one exception is if an employee tests positive for a drug as part of a random drug test. In such event, the employee shall be allowed to return to work provided he has successfully completed rehabilitation. A second positive drug test regardless of the type of test, shall result in termination.
An employee shall also be subject to discipline for the following reasons:
(a)	Failure to successfully complete rehabilitation.
(b)	A positive specimen as part of after-care drug testing.
(c)	Failure to comply with after-care treatment plan.
(d)	An adulterated or substituted specimen.
(e)	An employee’s refusal to submit to a test required under this Agreement.
Section 1.13	Preparation for Testing
Pursuant to Department of Transportation regulations, the Employer reserves the right to utilize on site or off site collection facilities.
Upon arrival at the collection site, an employee must provide the collection agent with:
- Photo identification issued by the Employer or a federal, state or local government;
-62-
If the employee arrives without the above-listed items, the collection agent should contact the responsible Human Resources manager.
A standard DOT approved urine custody and control form will be supplied by the appropriate laboratory for use with test for DOT mandated employees. This form must be used by all collection facilities and signed by the employee and the collection agent in the appropriate areas. The form used for non-DOT test will contain the same information and procedures as the DOT form.
Section 1.14	Specimen Collection Procedures
The Employer agrees to use the Specimen Collection Checklist approved by the National UPSF/Union’s UPSF Safety and Health Committee. The checklist is to be used with the affected employees at the collection site by the person performing the collection services for the Employer.
The checklist is to be used at all locations, but it is understood that failure to use or the refusal to use the checklist does not invalidate a properly conducted controlled substance testing procedure. Nor does it prohibit an employee’s recourse to the collective bargaining agreement and/or the grievance procedure.
All procedures for urine collection will follow Department of Transportation guidelines to ensure an individual’s privacy. An employee who gives reason to believe that he or she may have adulterated or substituted a sample will be required to provide a specimen under direct observation by a same gender collection agent. If it is determined that an employee has adulterated or substituted a sample it shall result in the termination of his/her employment.
No unauthorized personnel will be allowed in any area of the collection site. Only one (I) controlled substances testing collection procedure will be conducted at a time and the specimens can only be handled by the collection site person.
The employee being tested should remove any outer garments, such as coats, jackets, hats or scarves, and should leave any personal
-63-
belongings (purse or briefcase) with the collection agent. The employee shall display the items in his/her pockets to the collection agent. If the employee requests it, the collection agent shall provide the employee a receipt for his or her belongings. The employee may retain his or her wallet.
After washing his/her hands, the employee shall remain in the presence of the collection agent and shall not have access to any water fountain, faucet, soap dispenser, cleaning agent or other materials which could be used to adulterate the specimen.
The collection agent provides the employee with a new, sealed kit selected by the employee.
The employee will provide his or her specimen in a stall or otherwise partitioned area that allows for privacy. The Employer agrees to recognize all employees’ rights to privacy while being subjected to the collection process at all times and at all collection sites. Further, the Employer agrees that in all circumstances the employee’s dignity will be considered and all necessary steps will be taken to insure that the entire process does nothing to demean, embarrass or offend the employees unnecessarily. Authorization for collection under direct observation will be in accordance with Department of Transportation regulations. All procedures shall be conducted in a professional, discreet and objective manner. Refusal to provide a specimen under direct observation when requested shall be considered a refusal to test and a terminable offense.
The employee shall be instructed to provide at least forty-five (45) milliliters of urine in the collection container. The employee shall hand the specimen to the collection agent. The specimen shall remain in the sight of both the collection agent and the employee at all times. A minimum of thirty (30) milliliters of urine shall be placed in the primary specimen container by the collection agent. The collection agent then must pour at least fifteen (15) milliliters of urine from the collection container into the second specimen bottle to be used for the split specimen. If the individual is unable to provide forty-five (45) milliliters of urine, the collection agent shall direct the individual to drink fluids, not to exceed forty (40) ounces distributed reasonably over a period not to exceed three (3) hours or
-64-
until a sufficient specimen is provided, whichever occurs first. (The original specimen, if any, should be discarded, unless it was out of temperature range or showed evidence of adulteration or tampering.) If the individual is still unable to provide forty-five (45) milliliters of urine, he/she will be taken out of service and a medical evaluation will be conducted within five (5) business days by a licensed physician who has the expertise in this type of medical issue, and is approved by the Employer to determine if there is a medical reason for the inability to provide a specimen. If it is not determined that there is a medical reason, the individual will be treated as having refused to take the test. If the employee fails for any reason to provide forty-five (45) milliliters of urine, the collection agent should contact a third party administrator (TPA) and either the District Safety and Health Manager or another Employer designee.
The regulations specify the privacy procedures and the reasons to believe that a specimen has been adulterated which includes, but is not limited to, conduct clearly and unequivocally indicating an attempt to substitute or adulterate the sample, e.g., abnormal urine color or urine temperature outside the acceptable range. All specimens suspected of being adulterated shall be packaged and forwarded to the laboratory for testing.
In the event of suspected specimen adulteration, a second specimen will be immediately collected under direct observation and the entire procedure should be repeated including initiation of a new custody and control form and separate packaging for shipping. If an employee refuses to provide a second specimen, it shall be noted as a refusal to test and shall be a terminable offense.
The collection agent shall document any unusual behavior or appearance on the urine custody-and-control form.
Specimen handling (from one (1) authorized individual or place to another) will always be conducted using chain-of-custody procedures. Every effort must be made to minimize the number of people handling specimens. Both specimen containers shall be sealed and then forwarded to an approved laboratory for testing.
-65-
When a retum-to-duty or follow-up test is being conducted, the collection process may be observed. If observed, the observer shall be the same gender as the employee being tested.
When a test kit is received by a laboratory, the thirty (30) milliliter sealed urine specimen container shall be removed immediately for testing. The shipping container with the remaining sealed container shall be immediately placed in secure refrigerated storage.
If an employee is told that the first (1st) sample tested positive, the employee may, within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of actual notice, request that the second (2n<*) urine specimen be forwarded by the first (1st) laboratory to another independent and unrelated HHS approved laboratory of the parties’ choice for GC/MS confirmatory testing of the presence of the drug. If an employee chooses to have the second (2nc*) sample analyzed, he/she shall at that time execute a special checkoff authorization form to insure payment by the employee. For those employees who choose to have the second (2nd) specimen tested, disciplinary action can only take place after the MRO verifies the first (Ist) test as positive and the second (2ntb laboratory confirms the presence of the drug. However, the employee must be taken out of service once the first (Ist) test result is verified as positive by the MRO while the second (2nth test is being performed. If the second (2ntb laboratory report is negative, the employee will not be charged for the cost of the second (2ntb test and will be reimbursed for all lost time. It is also understood that if an employee opts for the second (2ncb specimen to be tested, any contractual time limits on disciplinary action are waived.
Section 1.15	Specimen Shipping Preparations
After measuring temperature and visibly inspecting the urine specimen, the collection agent should tighten and seal the specimen shipping container.
The collection agent places a security label (initialed and dated by the employee) over the bottle cap, overlapping the bottle sides.
A double-pouch bag will be used for shipping, with one (1) side for the urine specimen and the other for paperwork.
-66-
The collection agent places the urine specimen in the sealable pocket of the specimen bag and then seals the bag.
The collection agent places laboratory copies of the urine custody and control form in the back sleeve of the double-pouch bag.
The collection agent places the sealed specimen bag in the shipping box.
Section 1.16	Medical Review Officer
Any person serving as a Medical Review Officer (MRO) for the Company must be a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy with knowledge of substance abuse disorders, issues relating to adulterated and substituted specimens, possible medical causes of specimens having an invalid result, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the MRO shall keep current on applicable DOT agency regulations and comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements.
The MRO is responsible for performing the following functions, in addition to those specified in the DOT regulations:
1.	Reviewing the results of UPS Freight’s drug testing program.
2.	Receiving all positive and negative drug test reports as prescribed under the DOT regulations, and making all reports of drug test results to the Employer.
3.	Within a reasonable time, notifying an employee of a confirmed positive test result.
4.	Reviewing and interpreting each confirmed positive test result in order to determine if there is an alternative medical explanation for the specimen’s testing positive. The MRO shall perform the following functions as part of the review of a confirmed positive test results:
a.	Provide an opportunity for the employee to discuss a positive test result.
-67-
b.	Review the employee’s medical history and relevant biomedical factors. A driver is allowed to use a controlled substance (except for methadone) only when taken as prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner who is familiar with the driver’s medical history and assigned duties.
c.	Review all medical records made available by the employee to determine if a confirmed positive test resulted from legally prescribed medication or other possible explanation.
d.	Verify that the laboratory report and assessment are correct.
5. Processing an employee’s request to test the split sample. Such testing will be conducted at the employee’s expense. The employee shall be reimbursed by UPS Freight for any such expense should the retest provide a negative result. If a reanalysis is negative, then the MRO will declare the test cancelled.
Section 1.17	MRO Determination
If the MRO determines, after appropriate review, that there is a legitimate medical explanation for the confirmed positive test result, the MRO shall report the test to the Employer as a negative. If the MRO determines, after appropriate review, that there is no legitimate medical explanation for the confirmed positive test result, the MRO shall report the positive test result to the appropriate member of management in accordance with DOT regulations.
Based on a review of laboratory reports, quality assurance and quality control data and other drug test results, the MRO may conclude that a particular confirmed positive drug test result should be cancelled. Under these circumstances, the MRO shall report that the test is cancelled.
Not later than seventy-two (72) hours after notification of a confirmed positive test result or refusal to test because of adulteration or substitution, an employee may submit a written or verbal request to the MRO for testing of the split sample. The laboratory used must be certified by the HHS and must follow usual chain-of-custody procedures.
-68-
The employee shall be reimbursed for any pay lost if taken out of service based upon a positive test result which is negated by the second (2nd) test or as the result of the resolution of the grievance.
Section 1.18	Record Retention
The Medical Review Officer is the sole custodian of individual test results. The MRO shall retain reports of individual positive test results for a minimum of five (5) years. Individual negative test results will be maintained for at least twelve (12) months. UPS Freight shall maintain in a driver’s qualification file only such information as required by the DOT to document compliance with the drug testing requirements.
Section 1.19	Release of Drug Testing Information
The MRO shall inform the employee before beginning the verification interview, that the MRO could transmit to appropriate parties information concerning medications being used by the employee or the employee’s medical condition only if, in the MRO’s medical judgment, the information indicated that the employee may be medically unqualified under applicable DOT agency rules.
When a grievance is filed as a result of a positive test the Employer shall obtain from the laboratory its records relating to the drug test. Upon receiving the records, the Employer shall provide copies to the appropriate official of the Union, by the end of the following business day after receiving the documents from the laboratory or the MRO, as applicable, provided that the employee has executed written consent authorizing release to the Union, a copy of which must be provided to the Employer.
The Company agrees to notify the Union of any change of HHS approved laboratories used for drug testing, for whatever reason.
Section 2.	Alcohol Testing
The parties have agreed that the procedures as set forth in this Section shall be the methodology for all testing and will be modified only in the event that further Federal legislation or Department of Transportation regulations required by regulation, revise testing methodologies or requirements during the term of this Agreement.
-69-
Where such regulations allow revised testing methodologies such modifications shall be subject to mutual agreement by the parties.
Section 2.1	Employees Who Must Be Tested
UPS Freight employees subject to Department of Transportation mandated alcohol testing are drivers of vehicles with a vehicle weight rating over 26,000 pounds, requiring a Commercial Drivers License (CDL). This includes employees who relieve for vacations or other temporary vacancies.
Employee’s covered by this collective bargaining agreement who are not subject to DOT mandated alcohol testing are subject to the same types of testing as those employees who are covered by the DOT regulations.
Section 2.2	Testing
Because of the consequences that a positive test result has on an employee, UPS Freight will employ a very accurate, two-stage testing program. Breath samples will be collected by a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT), who has been trained in the use of the Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device, in a course equivalent to the DOT’S model course. All samples will be tested according to DOT alcohol testing requirements. In the event that breath testing is not possible in such cases as reasonable cause, or post accident, the Employer has the right to use alternative DOT approved methods.
Section 2.3	Screening Test
The initial screening test uses an Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device to determine levels of alcohol. The following initial cutoff levels shall be used when screening specimens to determine whether they are negative for alcohol. The EBT must also be capable of distinguishing alcohol from acetone at the 0.02 concentration level, test an air blank, and perform an external calibration check.
Breath Alcohol Levels:
Less than 0.02 - Negative
0.02 and above - Positive (Requires Confirmation Test)
-70-
Section 2.4	Confirmatory Test
All specimens identified as positive on the initial screening test, showing an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or higher, shall be confirmed using an EBT that is capable of providing a printed result in triplicate; is capable of assigning a unique and sequential number to each test; and is capable of printing out, on each copy of the printed test result, the manufacturer’s name for the device, the device’s serial number, and the time of the test.
A confirmation test must be performed not sooner than fifteen (15) minutes after the screening test, but not more than thirty (30) minutes after the screening test.
The following cutoff levels shall be used to confirm the presence of alcohol:
Breath Alcohol Levels:

Section 2.6	Reasonable Cause Testing
Upon reasonable cause, UPS will require an employee to be tested for the use of alcohol.
Reasonable cause is defined as an employee’s observable action, appearance, or conduct that clearly indicates the need for a fitness for duty medical evaluation.
The employee’s conduct must be witnessed by at least one (I) supervisor, two (2) if available. The witnesses must have received training in observing a person’s behavior to determine if a medical evaluation is required. When the supervisor confronts an employee.

2.	A citation is issued and there is bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, receives immediate medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or;
3.	A citation is issued and one or more motor vehicles incur disabling damage as a result of the accident requiring a vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
Non-DOT mandated employees may be required to submit to alcohol testing if there is any reasonable suspicion of alcohol usage or reasonable cause to believe that an employee has been operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, or reasonable cause to believe the employee was at fault in the accident and alcohol usage may have been a factor.
Alcohol testing will be required after accidents under the above conditions and drivers are required to submit to such testing within two (2) hours of the accident, if possible, and within eight (8) hours at the latest.

It is also the responsibility of the driver to not use alcohol for eight (8) hours or until an alcohol test is performed under this section, whichever occurs first. Union representation will be made available pursuant to this Agreement.
It is not the intention of this language to prohibit the driver from leaving the scene of an accident for the period of time necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to receive necessary medical attention.
Law Enforcement Testing
The result of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol or a urine test for the use of controlled substances, conducted by Federal, State, or local officials having independent authority for the test, shall be considered to meet the requirements of post-accident testing, provided such tests conform to applicable Federal, State or local requirements, and that the results of the tests are obtained by the Employer.
Section 2.8	Random Testing
UPS Freight employees, subject to random alcohol testing, will be notified of testing in person or by direct phone contact. Notification shall be given by the management person responsible for such notification. The procedure for selection of employees for random testing shall comply with DOT regulations.

Employer Responsibilities
Prior to allowing an employee to return to duty, after the employee has tested positive for an alcohol concentration higher than 0.02 (but lower than 0.07), or has successfully completed rehabilitation, the Employer shall:
(a)	Ensure that the employee is “alcohol free”, defined as less than 0.02, based on an alcohol test.
(b)	Ensure that the employee has been evaluated by a SAP for alcohol use or abuse.
(c)	Ensure and confirm with the SAP that the employee demonstrates compliance with all conditions or requirements of a rehabilitation program in which he or she participated.

If the employee arrives without the photo identification, issued by the Employer, or a federal, state or local government, the BAT should contact the District Safety and Health manager or the District Human Resources manager.
A standard DOT approved alcohol testing form must be used by all testing facilities. The form used for non-DOT tests will contain the same information and procedures as the DOT form.
Section 2.12	Specimen Testing Procedures
The Employer agrees to implement a “Specimen Testing Checklist”. The checklist, approved by the UPSF/Union UPSF Safety and Health Committee, is to be used with the affected employees at the testing site by the person performing the testing for the Employer. The checklist is to be used at all locations, but it is understood that failure to use or the refusal to use the checklist does not invalidate a properly conducted alcohol testing procedure. Nor does it prohibit an employee’s recourse to the collective bargaining agreement and/or the grievance procedure.
Procedures for alcohol testing will follow Department of Transportation guidelines to ensure an individual’s privacy. ■
-75-
No unauthorized personnel will be allowed in any area of the testing site. Only one (I) alcohol testing procedure will be conducted at a time.
The employee will provide his or her specimen in a location that allows for privacy. The Employer agrees to recognize all employees’ rights to privacy while being subjected to the testing process at all times and at all testing sites. Further the Employer agrees that in all circumstances the employee’s dignity will be considered and all necessary steps will be taken to insure that the entire process does nothing to demean, embarrass or offend the employees unnecessarily. Testing will be under the direct observation of a BAT. All procedures shall be conducted in a professional, discreet and objective manner. Direct observation will be necessary in all cases.
The employee shall provide an adequate amount of breath for the EBT device. If the individual is unable to provide a sufficient amount of breath, the BAT shall direct the individual to again attempt to provide a complete sample. If the employee fails for any reason to provide the requisite amount of breath, the BAT shall contact the District Safety and Health manager or Human Resources manager.
If an employee is unsuccessful in providing the requisite amount of breath, the Employer then must have the employee obtain, within five (5) business days, an evaluation from a licensed physician chosen by the Employer who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee’s medical ability to provide an adequate amount of breath. If the physician determines that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability, could have precluded the employee from providing an adequate amount of breath, the employee’s failure to provide an adequate amount of breath will not be deemed a refusal to take the test.
If the physician is unable to make a determination that the employee was medically unable to provide a sufficient amount of breath, the employee will be regarded as refusing to take the test.
The BAT shall document any unusual behavior or appearance on the alcohol testing form.

-89-
ARTICLE 44 SUBCONTRACTING
(a)	For the purpose of preserving work and job opportunities for the employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer agrees that no work or services of the kind, nature or type, and including new operations or buildings, covered by, presently performed, or hereafter assigned to the collective bargaining unit will be subcontracted, transferred, leased, assigned or conveyed in whole or in part to any other plant, person or non-unit employees, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. The Employer may not subcontract work in any classification for the purpose of avoiding overtime, or to avoid filling existing, or creating additional bargaining unit positions. The Employer may not subcontract work at a facility in any classification if any employee who normally performs such work at that facility is on layoff or is receiving less than his/her appropriate daily guarantee in his/her classification.
(b)	The Employer may subcontract work in order to meet service commitments if it does not possess the facility, equipment or personnel to perform such work. In no event shall this paragraph be used as a basis to subcontract Road Driver work.
(c)	The Employer may continue its practice regarding runs that do not have loads returning to the home domicile or its practice (including pay equivalency) concerning the reassignment of Company drivers to cover peak periods. However, if sufficient freight is generated in the future to provide loads returning to the home domicile, the run shall be performed by Road Drivers.
The parties agree these freight loads and/or LTL freight loads assigned to an LHD will be converted to a scheduled run covered by a Road Driver if the two (2) way movements are sufficient to constitute a full-time job; occur for at least four (4) consecutive weeks; and can meet all customer and service commitments. Terminals within thirty (30) mile driving distance from each other shall be considered one (I) terminal for the purpose of determining if there is a “two-way” run.
(d)	Line Haul Driver
-90-
i.	In order to create full-time bargaining unit jobs, replace outside vendors utilized on one-way runs permitted under paragraph (c) above, and enhance the Company’s ability to compete, the Company may create a new classification of employee named line haul driver (LHD). The attached Addendum shall control how LHD’s are used and their terms of employment. Any run assigned to an LHD pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall be assigned to a Road Driver once the LTL freight volume meets the criteria set forth in that paragraph for determining two-way runs.
ii.	If a Road Driver’s job is cut for the day, the Road Driver will have the option, in addition to those set forth in Article 5, Section 2(c), to displace any LHD provided he will be able to meet his next bid start time. If a Road Driver’s job is cancelled more than five (5) days in a calendar month, then the Road Driver shall have the right, in addition to the other rights set forth in Article 5, to take the job of any junior LHD who is domiciled in that facility. In such event, the Road Driver shall maintain his regular rate of pay and benefits. The displacement rights in this paragraph do not in any way diminish the Road Drivers’ seniority rights set forth in Article 5. If a Road Driver displaces a LHD pursuant to this paragraph, the displaced LHD shall be allowed to displace the junior LHD. If the facility is one in which a LHD only terminates his run, the Company will re-domicile the LHD run to that facility if it can do so and still meet customer commitments.
iii.	In order to ensure that Road Driver jobs are protected from the implementation of LHD positions, the following rules will apply in those terminals into or out of which a LHD operates:
The Company will guarantee at each such terminal the number of Road Driver positions in existence as of ratification. This number shall not be subject to reduction except for a demonstrated loss of volume, a change of operations pursuant to Article 40 or the equipment on a run being upsized. Any disputes regarding such reduction shall be subject to review and approval by the 1BT/UPSF Competition Committee. No Road Driver position will be eliminated as a result of the creation of a LHD position.
1.	The Company shall not use a LHD to perform work assigned to a Road Driver or to avoid creating an additional Road Driver posi
-91 -
tion at any terminal where the volume of freight increases sufficiently to require the creation of a full-time job.
2.	The Joint UPSF/IBT Competition Committee will review and approve or reject any LHD runs that may be proposed by UPS Freight. A LHD run will not be approved unless it replaces a vendor. In the event the parties do not agree, the LHD run shall not be implemented.
3.	The UPSF/IBT Competition Committee will review on a quarterly basis the use of LHDs to ensure they are not being used to perform work that contractually should be performed by Road Drivers. In the event the Committee finds that any LHD runs were created without eliminating subcontracting, those runs shall be bid as Road Driver runs pursuant to Article 5.
(e)	As part of this Agreement, the Company will recall all Road Drivers to full employment within their classification or the LHD classification as per the memorandum of understanding, at all facilities where subcontractors are being used no later than ninety (90) days from the ratification of this Agreement. Full employment shall be defined as a Road Driver receiving his/her daily guarantee in his/her classification. The recall shall include Road Drivers laid off to the street as well as those working outside their classification. Once a Road Driver is returned to work all provisions of the contract will apply. The Company will guarantee at each terminal that Road Drivers recalled pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to layoff except for a demonstrated loss of volume, a change of operations pursuant to Article 40 or the equipment on a run being upsized. Any disputes regarding such reduction shall be subject to review and approval by the IBT/UPSF Competition Committee. No recalled Road Driver position will be eliminated as a result of the creation of a LHD position.
(f)	In addition to the protections set forth above, the Company agrees that it will provide to the Union Chair of the TNUPSFNC a monthly report in writing detailing the number of runs completed and loads pulled by outside vendors sorted based on the origination and destination terminals. These monthly reports will also include a system wide comparison of the total miles run by outside vendors
-92-
versus the Company’s Road Drivers. Each report will include the described data for the prior calendar month and will be provided within fifteen (15) calendar days of the beginning of the following calendar month.

All newly manufactured road tractors regularly assigned to the fleet after the effective date of this Agreement shall be equipped with air conditioning.

“The execution of this Agreement on the part of the Employer shall also cover all employees described in the second paragraph of Article 1, Section 1 in the bargaining unit at any existing terminal at which the TNUPSFNC has been certified or designated to act as the collective bargaining representative. The following locals have been designated by the TNUPSFNC to represent covered employees and, as such, are parties to this Addendum: 25, 41, 63, 89, 107, 120, 135, 251, 299, 385, 431, 492, 523, 577, 612, 657, 667, 707, 710, 728,745, 891, and...”

Section 1	.(d) For employees covered by this Addendum there shall be two (2) seniority lists, one (1) for full-time clerks and one (I) for casual clerks.
Section l.(g) In developing the initial Clerks’ seniority list referenced above, the Company shall use the employee’s Company seniority date unless a particular employee transferred into his/her current service center from another service center. In such event, the employee’s transfer date to the current service center shall be used to develop the seniority lists.
Section 2.	When it becomes necessary to reduce the working force the last employee hired on the casual seniority list shall be laid off first. If a clerk job is eliminated, the affected employee may bump the most junior employee within the classification provided the bumping employee is qualified to do the job. If a full-time clerk displaces a casual clerk, he/she shall be governed by the four (4) hour
-96-
guarantee. The bumping employee goes to the bottom of the classification seniority list. If the employee exercises the right to bump and receives a recall notice, the employee must return to the position from which he/she was laid off.

The resulting vacancy, or the initial vacancy, if no full-time employee is awarded it, shall be available for bid by part-time clerical employees, if any, in that service center. If there are no part-time clerical employees in the service center, the Company shall have the right to fill the resulting vacancy, or the initial vacancy if it is not awarded, by a new hire. If a part-time employee is awarded the full-time vacancy, the Company shall have the right to fill it with a new hire.
If an employee is going to be off work for more than forty-five (45) days, the job will go up for bid, provided however, when the employee returns he/she shall return to his/her original bid job. Any bidder must be available and qualified to perform the work.
7.	As a substitution for those Article 18 provisions which the parties agree will not apply to employees covered by this Addendum, the following will apply:
Section 2. Casual and full-time employees’ schedules will be posted by Friday of the preceding workweek if there is any change. If there is no change, the schedules need not be posted. An employee’s start time can be altered by this posting by up to two (2) hours of its normal time. The Company may also alter the start time on a
-97-
daily basis by more than two (2) hours, provided the employee is notified prior to reporting to work.

8.	Any Article or Section of the UPSFA that is applicable to employees covered by this Addendum and references “casual” employees shall be deemed to cover part-time clerks.
9.	As a substitution for Article 44 of the UPSFA, the parties agree that the following will apply to employees covered by this Addendum:
For the purpose of preserving work and job opportunities for the employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer agrees that no work or services of the kind, nature or type, and including new operations or buildings, covered by, presently performed, or hereafter assigned to the collective bargaining unit will be subcontracted, transferred, leased, assigned or conveyed in whole or in part to any other plant, person or non-unit employees, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. The Employer may not subcontract work in any classification for the purpose of avoiding overtime, or to avoid filling existing, or creating additional bargaining unit positions. The Employer may not subcontract work in any classification if any employee who normally performs such work is on layoff.
10.	Asa substitution for Article 30, Sections I and 2, the following will apply:

(b)	.

(d)	. The Employer will meet with if requested, the National Teamster/UPS Freight Committee for Technological Change, promptly after notification to negotiate regarding the effects of the proposed technological changes.
-99-
(e)	. If a technological change creates new work that replaces, enhances or modifies bargaining unit work, bargaining unit employees will perform that new or modified work. The Employer shall provide bargaining unit employees with training required to utilize the new technology, if necessary.
(f)	. In the event that the National Committee cannot reach agreement on the dispute, either party may refer all outstanding disputes to the National Grievance Committee for resolution in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 in order to determine if the Employer has violated the provisions of this Section or if the change will result in a violation of any other provision of the collective bargaining agreement.
13. The only part of any prior Letter or Memorandum of Understanding, Letter of Agreement, or settlement between the parties under the UPSFA that will apply to the employees covered by this Addendum are:
(i)	The Letter of Understanding on Article 8, Section 1; and
(ii)	Paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 7 (except for the reference to the 90% employee) of the May 11, 2009 MOU.
National UPS Freight Agreement “Zone” Addendum
UPS Freight (“Employer” or “Company”) and the Teamsters National UPS Freight Negotiating Committee (“Union”) agree to the following as an Addendum to the UPS Freight Agreement (“NFA”):
1.	This Addendum applies to those employees represented by the Union who have been hired to perform functions described in the NFA, in geographical areas which were previously serviced by a vendor. The employees and geographical zones covered by this Addendum are as described in Attachment A;
2.	The NFA shall apply to employees covered by this Addendum except as modified in this Section:
- 100-
(a)	Article 18, Section 2, shall be amended to delete the requirement to provide an eight (8) hour guarantee per day for the 90% employees. However, the parties agree that when drivers are not working a full 8 hours, vendors will not be used in that geographical area unless necessary due to equipment needs or service reasons;
(b)	Employees whose pay rates are above the scale in Article 26, shall retain their current pay rates until such time as the pay rate is commensurate with the Agreement. At such time, the employee will receive contractual increases due beyond that date;
(c)	In recognition of the fact that employees covered by this Addendum do not have a service center in their established zone, Articles 19 and 33 of the NFA shall not apply, but any established practices in that zone relating to what is made available to the employees will continue to be observed.
(d)	In recognition of the fact that employees covered by this Addendum may be requested to perform business development (“BD”) work in their assigned zones, the parties agree that such assignments shall not be a basis to claim that business development functions are covered bargaining unit work; and
(e)	In recognition of the fact that the Company’s conversion of zones from vendor to employees is experimental and can only be successful if costs are controlled. Article 44 of the NFA shall be amended to also permit the use of vendors in the following circumstances;
(i)	Vendors can be used if inbound and/or outbound volume exceeds the capacity of existing employees or the capability of exceeding equipment. The Company commits it will not use this provision to eliminate or reduce overtime or to avoid hiring additional new bargaining unit employees if the growth in volume makes it economically feasible;
(ii)	Vendors may be used to cover for employee absences, including, but not limited to, vacations and any approved
- 101 -
leave of absence. Before using a vendor, the Company is obligated to first order this work to any employee in the zone who is in a layoff status, if any; then to any UPS Freight qualified employee on lay-off within service center that feeds that zone area provided the Company has sufficient notice of the absence; and
(iii)	The Company retains the right to revert to vendor coverage if volume levels do not make it economically feasible to continue to provide service in that area through Company employees. If the Company determines that it is not economically feasible to continue service in any area, it shall provide the Union thirty (30) days notice of the transition. The Company will meet with the Union within the thirty (30) days to review the data in order to determine if there is mutual agreement on the economic feasibility. Mutual agreement will not be unreasonably withheld by the parties. If a vendor is implemented then the Company will engage in effects bargaining with the Union.
3.	This Addendum shall continue to apply to the zones listed in Attachment A until such time as the Company opens a service center in that zone. The terms of the existing NFA shall apply in full at that time.
4.	Additional employees may become covered by this Addendum if the Union obtains representational rights to any “Zone” employees in the future.
5.	This Addendum shall remain in effect for the duration of the underlying NFA.
Memorandum of Understanding
UPS Freight agrees that it will notify the TNUPSFNC in the event it intends to increase in any significant way the number(s) of runs that include a lay over in excess of fourteen (14) hours.

Memorandum of Understanding
Teamsters National UPS Freight Negotiating Committee (Union) and UPS Freight (“UPS” or “Employer”) agree to the following in connection with Article 5, Section 2 of their National Freight Agreement:
1.	It is the parties’ intent that the phrase “.. .last employee hired on the affected classification seniority list...” is a reference to the date an individual became a full-time employee with the Employer, not the date the employee entered the job classification in which the layoff may be occurring.
- 103 -
2.	This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) shall become effective on the date it is signed and will be applied prospectively. However, the parties agree that any pending grievances concerning the Company’s use of classification seniority to identify employees for layoff, shall be considered settled on the basis of this MOU. The Company shall apply the language in paragraph 1 in those cases and take the steps necessary to notify those employees who need to be recalled. No monetary payments shall be made.
3.	This MOU shall not apply to any provision of the contract other than Article 5, Section 2.
Memorandum of Understanding
I.	The parties agree that the Company may continue its practice regarding 4 day /10 hour work schedules where they were in place at the time of ratification. This would also apply to locations where the parties have negotiated 4/10’s since ratification. Overtime will be after 10 hours, and any future implementations would need to be agreed to locally. Additionally, if any of the nine (9) named Holidays in Article 25, Section 4 occur on the regular scheduled workday for a 4/10 employee, the employee shall receive 10 hours straight time pay for the Holiday. 4/10 drivers working on a holiday will be included in item # 4 below. Employees holding 4/10 job bids will be required to work 120 work reports as otherwise defined in Article 25, Section 5 to obtain vacation or 32 reports to obtain the partial vacation calculation.
2.	The parties agree that the Company may continue its practice regarding Sunday through Thursday work week schedules as they existed at the time of ratification. This would also apply to locations where the parties negotiated Sun-Thur work schedules since ratification. Any future implementations would need to be agreed to locally.
3.	The parties agree that Full-Time employees laid off and displacing casual employees shall not be reduced to the casual rate of pay; rather, they shall be paid the full-time rate for the job performed.
- 104-
Full-Time employees laid off and in progression will slot to the same progression step in the job they are performing. The full-time employees that were paid the casual rate while on layoff shall receive back pay.
4.	The parties agree that employees who start and work on a Holiday shall be compensated at one and one-half (1 Vi) their hourly rate; this does not pertain to employees whose regular scheduled workday concludes on a Holiday. The Company may continue its practice of moving the Holiday for operational needs, but must pay one and one-half (1 16) for employees who start work on a Holiday. The Company shall not change the start times in an effort to negate the Holiday Premiums.
5.	The Company shall pay any sleeper team delays as follows: after 15 minutes each driver shall be paid the appropriate Local Cartage wage rate for P & D as specified in Article 26, Section 4 or equivalent progression step for the duration of the delay.
6.	If a mileage road driver experiences a traffic delay in excess of 15 minutes, then he or she shall be paid the appropriate Local Cartage wage rate for P & D as specified in Article 26, Section 4 back to the first minute. A traffic delay is defined as the wheels being completely stopped for the duration of the delay. This does not include typical rush hour traffic where the truck may be moving very slowly or starting and stopping intermittently. An example of a traffic delay would be when a highway is completely shut down for 15 minutes or more due to an incident and the vehicles cannot move at all.
7.	Extra work that is offered in seniority order on non-scheduled work days does not have an 8-hour guarantee for any 90% employee. The employee may choose to either (1) get paid actual hours worked for the day. or (2) ask for four (4) hours of work. If the employee asks for at least four (4) hours of work, then the Company shall provide at least four (4) hours provided that (a) the work is available, and (b) the employee is qualified to perform the work.
8.	The Company shall continue its practice of 2-hour show up pay; however, the parties agree the employee shall first be afforded his or her right under Article 5 to displace less senior employees pro
- 105 -
vided work is available. If no work is available and the employee was not informed of the run being cut (or other lack of work) until he or she arrived at the service center, then the 2-hour show up pay shall apply.
