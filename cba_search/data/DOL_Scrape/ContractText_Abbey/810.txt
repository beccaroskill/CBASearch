Step 1 The parties shall attempt to resolve grievances informally prior to putting them in writing. The Union Steward shall be present at Step 1. Notwithstanding this, the grievance must be signed by the grievant and presented to the Employer in writing within the time period set forth above. The Grievance shall state the contract provision(s) alleged to have been violated and the specifics of the alleged violation. The
33
Local 615 SEIU
Employer shall answer the Grievance, in writing, within ten (10) calendar days.
Step 2 If the Grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the Grievance must be presented in writing to the Employer within ten (10) calendar days after the Employer’s response to the grievance at Step 1 or the date on which the response was due, whichever is earlier. The Employer may hold a meeting on the grievance within ten (10) calendar days after receiving it. The Employer shall answer the grievance, in writing, within ten (10) calendar days after a meeting was held or after receipt of the grievance if no meeting was held.

Step 4 a. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 3, it must be referred to arbitration by the Union within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Employer’s response or date on which that decision was due, whichever is earlier. A demand for arbitration must be served in writing by the Union simultaneously on the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and the Employer within this period as a condition for processing the demand, and must specify the specific contract Article(s) and paragraph(s) allegedly violated. If the Union and the Employer mutually agree, the grievance may be referred to arbitration at the Labor Connection rather than the AAA.
b. If the Employer or the Union raises an issue of procedural arbitrability, the Arbitrator, subsequent to his/her selection and at least two weeks prior to any scheduled hearing, shall determine whether a separate hearing shall be scheduled for the Arbitrator to consider the issue of arbitrability only, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing. The reason(s) why the grievance is allegedly not arbitrable will be stated in the Employer’s Step 3 written answer. In the case of an Employer grievance, the Union’s arbitrability challenge must be stated at the discussion between the Union and the Employer referenced in paragraph 37.6. If an
35
Local 615 SEIU
issue of arbitrability arises at Step 4 for the first time, the party raising the issue must notify the other party in writing within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the demand for arbitration, and the Arbitrator shall determine whether or not to schedule a separate hearing as described above. Arbitrability issues raised in contravention of this procedure shall be deemed waived and under no circumstances may an arbitrability issue be raised for the first time at a hearing scheduled to decide a case on the merits.
Any hearing on arbitrability shall be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association’s rules on expedited arbitration. If the Arbitrator determines that the grievance is not arbitrable, the grievance shall be denied and it shall not be processed any further and no cancellation fees shall be incurred by either party. If the Arbitrator determines that the grievance is arbitrable, then a hearing shall be held for the Arbitrator to consider the merits of the grievance.
The Arbitrator shall have the authority only to settle disputes arising under this Agreement concerning the interpretation and application of specific contract Article(s) and paragraph(s) allegedly violated and involving the facts of the particular grievance presented to him or her. The Arbitrator cannot amend, alter or modify the Agreement. The Arbitrator shall have no power to engage in any form of interest arbitration unless mutually agreed in writing. Only one (1) grievance may be submitted to and decided during a particular arbitration, unless mutually agreed in writing. The Arbitrator must render his or her
36
Local 615 SEIU
decision within thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing or the submission of briefs, whichever is later. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the grievant, the Employer and the Union. The cost of the arbitration assessed by the AAA and the fees of the Arbitrator shall be borne by the party against whom judgment is found.
For purposes of this Paragraph 3: (1) Step 1 grievances shall be presented to the designated immediate supervisor; (2) Step 2 grievances shall be presented to the appropriate site manager or designated supervisor; and (3) Step 3 and Step 4 grievances shall be presented to the Labor Relations, Human Resource Department or the Principal Officer of the Employer, or his/her designee.
37.4	Should a dispute arise between the Employer and the Union that both parties mutually agree to expedite the arbitration process, said dispute may be referred directly to expedited arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA), or if the Union and the Employer mutually agree to the Labor Relations Connection rather than the AAA. Union referrals to expedited arbitration under this provision may only be made by the President or his/her designee. Employer referrals to expedited arbitration under this Article may be made by the designated representative of the Employer to the Union.
37.5	Failure of an employee or the Union to meet any time deadline at any step of this Grievance Procedure shall constitute a waiver of the grievance and no further action may be taken on it. Time is of the essence, but any time limits in this Article 37 - Grievance Procedure can be mutually waived in writing. If the Employer misses a response deadline set forth in this agreement, the Grievance shall automatically move to the next Step, provided that the Union has otherwise complied with this Article.
37
Local 615 SEIU
37.6	A grievance concerning the interpretation or application of the Agreement initiated by the Employer shall be discussed with the Union and may thereafter be submitted to arbitration by the Employer within thirty (30) days after the Employer knew or should have known of the grievance. The demand for arbitration shall be in writing and a copy shall be sent to the Union. The Employer shall not be required to adhere to the procedure in this paragraph or Article in the event of a violation of Article 30 - Strikes and Lockouts. Similarly, the Union President may initiate a grievance concerning the interpretation or application of the Agreement in circumstances where an employee or group of employees, as contemplated in paragraph 37.1, cannot raise it.

Article 41 Immigration
41.1	Recognizing that questions involving an employee’s immigration/work status or personal information may arise during the course of his/her employment, and that errors in an employee’s documentation may be due to mistake or circumstances beyond an employee’s control, the Employer agrees to the following procedure:
1.	In the event an issue or inquiry arises involving the immigration status or employment eligibility of a non-probationary employee, the Employer shall promptly notify the employee in writing. The letter shall contain a concise statement of the issue and reference an employee’s rights under this Article.
2.	If permissible under applicable law and/or regulations, the affected bargaining unit member shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to remedy the identified problem or secure acceptable documentation demonstrating that the identified problem is in the process of review or correction before adverse action is taken. Any lawful changes in the employee’s documentation or lawful correction in his/her social security number shall not be considered new employment unless there is a break in service. If the bargaining unit member does not remedy the issue or provide valid documentation, as referenced above within thirty (30) calendar days, the bargaining unit member may be discharged and the Employer shall have no further obligation to hold a bargaining unit member’s position. An employee who does remedy the issue, provides valid documentation and is rehired by the Employer within six (6) months of their discharge will not lose their seniority.

3.	If the bargaining unit member obtains the valid documentation as referenced in sub-paragraph 2 above, when necessary, he/she will, consistent with the operational needs of the Employer, be permitted reasonable unpaid time off to attend relevant proceedings or visit pertinent agencies, for the purposes of correcting the identified problem, provided the Employer is given adequate notice of planned absences and verification of the appointments, hearings or other proceedings for which the time off is requested.
41.2	Upon request the Employer agrees to meet with the Union and discuss the employee’s issue/problem. When practicable, and permissible under applicable law and/or regulations, this meeting will take place before the Employer initiates any adverse employment action.
Article 42
Scope of Contract
42.1	This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between Employer and the Union arrived at as the result of collective bargaining negotiations. Except as provided in Article 29 - No Lowering of Standards, all prior or contemporaneous verbal or written agreements, understandings, or past practices, whether known or unknown, asserted or unasserted, between the Employer and the Union or the employees shall terminate upon execution of this Agreement.
42.2	The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations that resulted in this Agreement, each has had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Therefore, for the life of this Agreement, the Employer and the Union
43
Local 615 SEW
voluntarily and unqualifiedly waive the right and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, even though such subjects or matters may not have been in the knowledge or contemplation of either or both parties at the time this Agreement was signed.

After notice is given, the Employer will request the medical certification described above and provide the employee with the necessary paperwork. Employees requesting leave are required to furnish the Employer with the requested medical certification within fifteen (15) calendar days. No employee should depart on a foreseeable FMLA leave without having submitted the required medical certification.

Additionally, employees returning from FMLA leave may be asked to provide a “fitness-for-duty” report before returning to work.
Article 44
Work Schedules, Changes in Assignments and Work Loads
44.1	In the event that the Employer plans to make a major change in the work schedule, change in the assignments or work load of employees who work in a commercial office building which results in a substantial reduction in the number of hours worked in the building or a reduction in the number of positions in the building, the Employer agrees to give written notice to the Union and meet with the Union to review and discuss the reasons for the changes in advance of implementing such changes. In the event that the Employer and the Union cannot meet within a reasonable time and in advance of the changes, the meeting shall be scheduled as soon as practicable. The Employer will consider in good faith any suggestions the Union has on other ways to achieve the objective of the planned changes.
44.2	Major changes in work schedules, assignments and workload shall include changes in the cleaning specifications of commercial office buildings that are 100,000 square feet or larger or in two (2) adjacent buildings which together are 100,000 square feet or larger and changes in the methods of operations which results in a reduction in force or hours of work. Major changes shall not include reductions due to vacancies if the reduction is proportional to the reduction in the space to be cleaned, minor productivity adjustments, transfers, individual reassignments and changes in buildings that are less than 100,000 square feet.
46
Local 615 SEIU
44.3	The Employer will explain the changes to the employees in a meeting prior to the implementation at which a union representative may be present if the Union so desires.
44.4	Any reduction in the total hours worked in a building will be reduced by the layoff or transfer of the least senior affected employees except for reasons beyond the control of the Employer such as a reduction in the total number of hours which is less than a full or part-time employee or conditions prescribed by the building owner/agent, A laid off or transferred employee shall be offered the opportunity to return if the number of hours cut is restored pursuant to the Seniority provisions of this Agreement.
44,5	The provisions of this Article shall in no way diminish, mitigate, or otherwise affect those rights as enumerated in Article 25 ™ Management Rights.
Article 45
Security Screening
45.1	In acknowledgement of the heightened security concerns common to the commercial real estate industry, the Employer and the Union agree to cooperate in complying with any and all security measures implemented by the Employer’s customers.
45.2	All employees shall be subject to security background checks at any time based on a customer requirement. An employee shall cooperate with an Employer as necessary for obtaining security background checks. Any employee who refuses to cooperate shall be subject to termination. Employees who fail such security background check shall be subject to termination.
47
Local 615 SEIU
45.3	To this end, the Union agrees that current employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, execute a release authorizing the Employer or an authorized agent of the Employer to conduct an investigation into the following:
a. Credit history, criminal history, verification of previous residence(s), employment verification(s), school references(s) and any lawful inquiries into immigration status.
The aforementioned sample release is annexed to this Agreement as Appendix
45,4	The Employer shall notify the Union of any and all customer requirements for such security background checks and shall apply such requirements equally to all its employees working in the customer’s building(s).
45.5	If the results of information gathered during such a security background check are such that they would cause the Employer to remove a bargaining unit member from or not allow them access to a customer’s building(s) that member shall be informed of the results of the background check and given the opportunity to challenge the accuracy of that information.
45.6	The Employer will treat any and all information collected as a result of security screening or background checks as private information and utilize a secure storage procedure with access limited to the appropriate human resources personnel. The Employer further warrants that this information if retained will be kept in a manner to insure its privacy.
45.7	For the purpose of this provision, just cause to terminate an employee who has failed a security background check exists only if it is established that one or more of the findings of the background security check is directly related to his/her job functions or responsibilities, or that the continuation of employment would
48
Local 615 SEW
involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public or constitute a violation of any applicable governmental rule or regulation. If the customer determines that the employee has failed a security background check, but the Employer lacks cause for termination under this provision, then the Employer shall transfer the employee to another location at the same rate of pay and comparable hours.
Article 46

Massachusetts Service Employees’ Pension Fund
The current schedule of payments requires that Pension Fund contributions be remitted no later than the twentieth (20th) day of the month following the month during which the hours were worked and for which the contributions are due. Contributions for hours worked during January are due in the Fund office no later than February 20th. Contributions for hours worked during February are due in the Fund office no later than March 20th, etc.
Contributions due on the 20th day of the month will be considered delinquent if not received in the Fund office by the close of business on the 25th day of the month (or the first business day thereafter if the 25th is not a business day). Delinquent contributions will be subject to the following interest or late fees:
1.	Interest at the prime rate as set by the Bank of America plus 3%, or
2.	$100.00 per day, whichever is greater.
Effective April 1, 2007, late fees assessed hereunder will be capped at 50% of the contributions due for each month(s) in which the Employer is late. Interest on delinquent contributions where applicable will be assessed retroactive to the due date (the 20 day of the month) and will be payable for each and every day thereafter until the delinquency is paid. Late fees of $100.00 per day where applicable will be assessed retroactive to the delinquency date. Interest and/or late fees must accompany the payment of the delinquent contributions.
Employers who desire to appeal the imposition of late fees under the Delinquency Procedure may do so by submitting a written statement to the Administrator. The Administrator will then submit the written appeal to the trustees for adjudication.
64
Local 615 SEIU
The following delinquency procedures will be in effect January 1, 2003:
1.	The Trustees will notify Employers in writing of the non-receipt of contributions past due on the 20th day of the month. Notice will be sent by the Administrator through U.S. Mail or other means. This written notice is not a prerequisite to becoming delinquent and failure to receive said notice shall not be a defense to delinquency.
2.	The Trustees will attempt to phone past due Employers on the last working day before their unpaid contribution become delinquent. This telephone notice is not a prerequisite to becoming delinquent and failure to receive said notice shall not be a defense to delinquency.
3.	The Fund Administrator shall review all delinquencies as soon as possible after the close of business on the day on which unpaid contributions become delinquent. At that time, the Administrator will decide what legal action shall be instituted to compel payment of delinquent contributions. The Union’s rights under it its collective bargaining agreement shall be independent from the rights of the Trustees. The Union may exercise any and all rights it has under its collective bargaining agreement without prior approval of the Trustees or the Delinquency Subcommittee.
4.	The Trustees intend to institute legal proceedings to collect delinquent contributions. In any such proceedings, the Trustees will not be limited to the interest and/or late fees described herein. On the contrary, the Trustees will request the Court to grant the broadest available penalties and remedies, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees.
This statement of policy and procedure is effective January 1, 2003 and is subject to revision by the Board of Trustees of the Fund.

Appendix “E”
Recognition Procedure for the State of New Hampshire
The Maintenance Contractors of New England, Inc. (MCNE) hereby agrees to grant the Union voluntary recognition for its janitorial operations in certain areas of New Hampshire referred to as zones and listed below based on a showing of majority support once the Union can demonstrate within the zone that 60% of the commercial contracted cleaning market for buildings over 50,000 square feet are serviced by signatories to the Agreement with the Union and the Maintenance Contractors of New England or by contractors who have agreed to a card check recognition based on a showing of majority support.
Once the Union has reached agreement concerning voluntary recognition with cleaning contractors who service 60% of the commercial contracted cleaning market over 50,000 square feet, the Employer will grant voluntary recognition to the Union for its locations after the Union presents a majority showing of interest through a card check demonstrating that 50% plus one of the employees have signed authorization cards. At all times the Employer shall remain neutral and the Union shall refrain from negative references to the Employer. The Employer shall notify the appropriate supervisors of the purpose and spirit of this Article.
When the Union demonstrates that it has agreement concerning voluntary recognition from cleaning contractors which represent 60% of the contracted janitorial market herein defined the Employer agrees to remain neutral on the issue of unionization during the recognition process and to give Union representative access to its employees either at the site or through a listing of employees which contain home addresses whichever is more practicable. Both parties shall cooperate in determining the appropriate access but in no case shall the Employer deny access to the Union. Upon notice to the Employer from the Union that it intends to organize a unit under this provision the Employer agrees to provide the Union within ten (10) calendar days all work locations covered by this Agreement in those jurisdictions along with the names of the employees, their work location and hours of work.
Upon a showing of authorization cards signed by 50% plus one of the employees of that unit, the Employer agrees to recognize SEIU Local 615 as the lawful representative of these employees.
70
Local 615 SEIU
Upon showing of the Union that it has achieved recognition for 60% of the designated contracted janitorial market the MCNE agrees to meet and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for these employees working in that zone only.
The Employer agrees to the following zones for the purpose of recognition under this agreement:
“	Zone 1:	Office Buildings	over	50,000	square feet in Portsmouth
H	Zone 2:	Office Buildings	over	50,000	square feet in Manchester
■	Zone 3:	Office Buildings	over	50,000	square feet in Nashua
H	Zone 4:	Office Buildings	over	50,000	square feet in Merrimac
The Employer further agrees to grant recognition under these same terms for work performed on college campuses on a campus by campus basis.
The parties to this Agreement also agree to meet and negotiate neutrality card check procedures consistent with the principles of this Agreement for all other New Hampshire client sectors and markets upon request of either party.

Maintenance Trades
July 18, 2007
Mr. Peter Rider
Secretary Treasurer
Local 615, SEIU
26 West Street
Boston, Massachusetts
Regarding: Maintenance Trades
Dear Mr. Rider:
I am writing to confirm our discussions during negotiations for a new Collective Bargaining Agreement to replace the Master Agreement that expires on August 31, 2007. Local 615 SEIU (“Union”) has agreed to remove the classification of maintenance tradesmen from Article 3 -Recognition of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In consideration, the members of the Maintenance Contractors of New England, Inc. (“Association”), have agreed to a voluntary recognition procedure which will apply to maintenance trades personnel who are not represented by another labor organization.
The members of the Association agree to grant voluntary recognition to the Union subject to a third party card check and mutual agreement upon the appropriate unit for employees who perform a maintenance trades function.
The members of the Association will not oppose the Union’s effort to organize the Employers’ non-union maintenance trades employees.
The members of the Association will provide access to the job locations of the Employers’ maintenance trades employees and information concerning employees’ home addresses, work shifts and dates of hire if access to the location is not practicable.
In the event that the Union attains a majority status in an appropriate unit, as evidenced through a card check, the Employer agrees to meet and negotiate a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
I trust that this accurately reflects our understanding in the negotiations concerning this issue.
Very Truly Yours.

Composite Health Insurance Rate
September 4, 2007
Mr. Rocio Saenz President
Local 615, SEIU 26 West Street Boston, Massachusetts
Regarding: Composite Health Insurance Rate and Full-Time Work
Dear Ms. Saenz:
During the negotiations for a successor Master Agreement the Association and the Union discussed the application of a composite health insurance rate which would provide family coverage for employees and a schedule to convert buildings in the Central Business District and the Metropolitan Boston area in excess of 450,000 to full-time work schedules in a listed Appendix to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. During the course of negotiations it was discussed what would happen in the event that an owner/agent wanted to have its cleaning contractors either provide family coverage or convert to a full-time work schedule.
This letter will confirm that if an owner/agent of a commercial office building outside of the Metropolitan Boston area and less than 450,000 square feet communicates in writing that it elects to have its contractor either provide family coverage through a composite rate or a full-time conversion schedule, the contractor agrees to comply with such request. The client’s written communication shall be a signed authorization which shall be specific as to the site location which will be affected and the intent with respect to health insurance, full-time work or both.
I trust that this letter reflects our understanding on this issue.
Very Truly Yours,
James B. Canavan
Chairman
