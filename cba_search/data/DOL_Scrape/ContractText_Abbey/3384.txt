AGREEMENT BETWEEN Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, a body corporate and politic, hereinafter called “District,” and Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 192 (A.F.L.-C.I.O.) representing all employees in the bargaining unit as certified by the State Conciliation Service, who are now or may hereafter become members of Local 192, hereinafter called “Union.”
WITNESSETH:
The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the working understanding between the District and its employees through their duly accredited and certificated representative, affecting hours of labor, wages and basic working conditions, and to establish a means of settling any and all grievances, disputes and controversies arising between the District and its employees.
PART I - GENERAL PROVISIONS
The General Provisions of Part I of this Labor Agreement shall apply to all employees covered herein; however, specific language in a subsequent Part of this Agreement shall take precedent over these General Provisions.
SECTION 1.0
RECOGNITION OF AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION
1.01 The Amalgamated Transit Union is hereby recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative of all of the employees set forth in Sections 37.0 - 67.0 - 68.0 -
1
69.0 - 78.0 - 79.0 - 98.0 and all Clerical Employees as defined in Certification of California State Conciliation Service dated February 3, 1966, as shown in Part IV, Section 91.0.
1.0	2 The District shall recognize the duly elected representatives of the Union.
1.0	3 The President/Business Agent, Vice President and Assistant Business Agents, or any employee duly appointed by the President/Business Agent, in writing, shall have the authority in all presentations to handle any grievance or dispute and resolve any issues in accordance with the current Collective Bargaining Agreement.
SECTION 2.0
UNION SECURITY
2.01 All employees coming within the scope of this Agreement, within thirty (30) working days after the date of employment, shall become and remain members of the Union during the period of this Agreement as a condition of their employment and will be on probation for ninety (90) working days to demonstrate ability to properly carry out their duties.
2.02 In the event a new employee fails to apply for membership in the Union within thirty (30) working days after his/her employment or fails to maintain his/her membership in the Union as required by Paragraph 2.01 of this Agreement, the Union may give the District written notice of this fact and within two (2) days after receipt of said notice the District shall terminate the employment of said employee.
2
2.03 The District agrees to make payroll deductions according to the terms and conditions of the authorization to deduct membership fees, dues, Employees’ Benevolent Association, Committee on Political Education (C.O.P.E.) and Credit Union amounts. The Union retains the right to delete any part of the following from this paragraph: “authorization to deduct membership fees, dues, Employees’ Benevolent Association, C.O.P.E. and Credit Union.” The Union will hold the District harmless from any claims on account of any such deductions.
(a) All employees shall have the option of having h/er pay transferred by direct deposit to the financial institution of h/er choice. Employees may select up to three different financial institutions for their deposits. Employees who elect to use direct deposit may have to change their payday to a day other than Friday. However, direct deposits shall be made weekly.
2.04 The District shall inform each new employee at the time of his/her employment of the existence of this Agreement and furnish him/her with the name and address of the Union and refer him/her to the Union where a copy of said Contract may be obtained.
(a) Effective July 1,2000, initial training of all ATU positions shall include 1 full day at the Union.
2.05 All employees shall continue to be covered by Social Security, Worker’s Compensation, State Disability and Unemployment Compensation.
2.06 The Union representative, as outlined in Paragraph 1.03, shall be permitted by the District to transact any Union business on the premises of the District but
3
at no time delay the scheduled work assignment of the employee.
2.07 The District will not participate in any “workfare” program wherein welfare recipients work in ATU classifications for their welfare payment.
If ordered by outside forces, under the risk of losing funding, the District may screen and hire such recipients into ATU classifications at the regular rates of pay.
SECTION 3.0
DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
3.01 No employee will be disciplined, discharged, nor will adverse entries be made in his/her personnel record except for just and sufficient cause.
3.02 The District agrees that it will notify the employee, in writing, within ten (10) days from the date of knowledge of the occurrence forming the basis for the contemplated discipline or discharge, of its intention to render discipline. No employee will be disciplined or discharged unless a copy of the precise and complete charge against the employee is furnished him/her within ten (10) days of the date of knowledge of the occurrence. A copy of this notice will be sent to the Union.
3.03 Either the employee or the Union shall have the right to request a hearing on the charges within ten (10) days of receipt of the charges. Failure to request a hearing within a period of ten (10) days after receipt of the charges will be a forfeiture of the right to a hearing. The hearing shall be held within ten (10) days of the date the request for a hearing is received by
4
the District. An employee who has been or may be about to be suspended, disciplined or discharged shall be entitled to a fair and impartial hearing by a designated official of the District and may be represented by accredited officers of the Union. A written decision of such a hearing shall be rendered as promptly as possible, but in no event later than seven (7) days after the completion of the hearing, and copies furnished to the Union and the employee. Discipline, if any, will be implemented within twenty (20) working days of the issuance of the written decision.
3.04 In the event of a suspension or discharge, the District shall make a recording of the hearing and shall, upon request of the Union, provide a written transcript of the recording within fifteen (15) days after the date of the request. The transcript or recording cannot be introduced as evidence or otherwise used at Final Arbitration, except for purposes of impeachment.
3.05 At any hearing, the employee and his/her representative will be allowed to question all witnesses. Hearsay evidence shall not be accepted as a basis for discipline or adverse entry in the employee’s record. The District shall produce a spotter as a witness when the spotter’s report or observations are offered for acceptance as a basis for discipline or adverse entry in the employee’s record.
(a) Hearings will be held at locations which are mutually agreed to. Agreement will not be withheld for arbitrary reasons. Either party may request a change of location. If additional time is required for the employee to get to the agreed to location, the District will pay for travel time. In addition, if an employee must be relieved earlier than otherwise necessary because of
5
a change in location, the District will pay the difference between the earlier relief and the normal relief.
3.0	6 In the event the decision at the first level hearing is not satisfactory to the employee or the Union, the matter may be appealed to two-party arbitration within ten (10) days after receipt of the written decision; provided, however, for good and sufficient cause the time limitation may be extended.
3.0	7 At least three (3) days prior to the two-party arbitration, the District shall furnish to the Union or employee, upon request, copies of all documents intended to be introduced by the District at the two-party arbitration, and the names and addresses of all witnesses except spotters intended to be called. None of the above language in this paragraph shall be construed as a waiver of an individual’s constitutional rights.
3.0	8 Employees other than the grievant required by the District to appear at the hearings at any level will be paid either run or shift pay for the day.
3.0	9 Adverse notations on matters other than preventable accidents on an employee’s record more than one (1) year old as of the date of the infraction under investigation will not be taken into consideration or be admissible as evidence. Adverse notations regarding preventable accidents on an employee’s record more than eighteen (18) months old as of the date of the accident under investigation will not be taken into consideration or be admissible as evidence.
3.10	Any adverse entry in an employee’s personnel record will be subject to the provisions of this Section and shall be regarded as discipline.
6
3.11	Any disciplinary action resulting in suspension or discharge shall be reported by telephone to the Union within 48 hours and confirmed by letter within three (3) working days.
3.12	No employee may be suspended or discharged or removed from service prior to the decision of the representative of the General Manager, except for one (1) or more of the following reasons:
(a)	Intoxication, use of alcoholic beverages, restricted dangerous drugs or marijuana and its derivatives or narcotics while on duty.
(b)	Dishonesty
(c)	Insubordination
(d)	Serious accident
(e)	Criminal behavior likely to have a serious impact upon the business of the District.
3.13	The time limitations set forth in Paragraphs 3.02 through 3.11 may be extended, in writing, by mutual agreement. The failure of either party to adhere to the time limitations set forth above shall cause that party to forfeit his/her case. In computing the time limits, Saturdays, Sundays and holidays shall be excluded.
SECTION 4.0
GRIEVANCES
4.01 A grievance is defined as any controversy between the District and the Union arising out of or by virtue of this Labor Agreement. A grievance must be filed within fifty (50) days from the date of knowledge by the Union or the District.
7
4.02 If a grievance is alleged by the District, it shall be presented in writing to the Union President/Business Agent or his/her representative. If a grievance is alleged by the Union, it shall first be presented in writing by the Union to the superintendent of the division or clerical department manager affected. If a satisfactory adjustment cannot be made of a Union grievance, or if the grievance affects more than one division, the same shall be presented to the General Manager or his/her representative.
4.03 The written grievance shall contain a precise statement of the facts giving rise to the grievance, the contract provisions alleged to have been violated, the precise issue(s) to be arbitrated, and the remedy sought. Any issue not part of the written grievance shall not be considered.
4.04 After submission of a grievance as set forth above, the parties shall promptly meet, and in any event within ten (10) days from the receipt thereof, unless the time is extended by mutual written agreement, and endeavor to adjust the grievance.
4.05 At the completion of the grievance hearing, a written decision of such hearing shall be rendered as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten (10) days, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, and copies furnished to the Union and the employee. If neither the employee nor the Union receives such written decision within said ten (10) days, the District shall forfeit the case.
4.06 Employees not at fault required to attend investigations, grievance meetings or hearings will be reimbursed for time lost. Any employee ultimately found to be entitled to reinstatement shall be reimbursed for all time lost.
8
SECTION 5.0
ARBITRATIONS
5.01 Any grievance, dispute or controversy, which cannot be amicably adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.0 or Section 4.0 of this Agreement, may be submitted to a board of arbitration upon compliance with the following condition:
(a) The parties desiring arbitration shall give written notice thereof within fifteen (15) days after the completion of the grievance procedure set forth in Section 3.0 or Section 4.0.
5.02 Upon written notice by either party prior to the selection of a neutral arbitrator, more than one (1) grievance, dispute or controversy shall be submitted before the same arbitration.
5.03 For good cause, upon the motion of either party or the neutral arbitrator, an important grievance, dispute or controversy may be severed from the other matters so as not to be heard at the same arbitration session. The neutral arbitrator shall determine whether good cause has been shown.
5.04 Within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of a desire for two-party arbitration, one (1) arbitrator shall be selected by the District and one (1) by the Union, and in the event of the failure of either party to appoint its arbitrator within said ten-day period, the party so failing shall forfeit its case. The two (2) arbitrators so selected shall then meet and attempt to settle or decide any issue or grievance submitted for arbitration during a period of five (5) days of the date
9
of their appointment. At such meeting the Union may, at its option, require the attendance of the griev-ant involved. If they arrive at a settlement or decision during that time and reduce it to writing, it shall be final and binding on all parties. If they are unable to arrive at a settlement or decision, a third arbitrator shall then be selected by the District and the Union.
5.05 Expedited arbitrations will be used in all suspension cases involving five (5) days or less and in any other case the parties stipulate to do so. Provided, however, that expedited arbitration shall not be used in any case which the parties realize in advance will involve an issue of contract interpretation.
5.06 The following procedures shall apply in all expedited arbitrations:
(a)	Neither party may be represented by an attorney.

SECTION 6.0
ATTENDANCE POLICY
6.01(a) It is recognized by the parties that a significant number of AC Transit employees have good attendance records. It is further recognized that the economic well-being of the District is dependent on employees maintaining good attendance records by coming to work on time and on a regular basis. The intent of this program is to recognize those employees with good attendance records and, consistent with this policy, not to discipline them. Those employees who are guilty of excessive or unacceptable absenteeism, consistent with this policy, will be counseled and, if their attendance does not improve, will be subject to progressive discipline up to, and including discharge.
(b) Excessive absenteeism is not based solely on the number of times an employee is absent. For example, an employee may not be guilty of excessive absenteeism even if he/she is off from work many days if there are legitimate reasons for his/her absences, consistent with this policy. Similarly, an employee may be guilty of excessive absenteeism if he/she is simply
14
taking time off without legitimate reason, consistent with this policy. Whether an employee is guilty of excessive or unacceptable absences depends upon all the facts of each particular case.
6.02(a) Except as set forth in subsection (b) of this paragraph, an “absence” is a failure to be at work, or to remain at work as scheduled, for any single workday or for any single consecutive series of work days or any portion of any single workday or days. An “absence” also includes each “failure to report as assigned” which occurs when an employee:
(1)	Fails to report in person as assigned before his/her starting/report time. (For all employees, other than Bus Drivers and Dispatchers, two (2) instances of tardiness of 6 minutes or less shall be considered a single absence, deemed to have occurred for purposes of any rolling twelve-month period upon the second instance of such tardiness.)
(2)	Fails to make relief at the designated time and place.
(3)	Fails to notify the District at least 1/2 hour prior to his/her starting/report time of his/her unavailability for work (an employee shall not receive an absence for failure to report in person for an assignment if the employee has received an absence for failing to report unavailability for the assignment under this paragraph).
(b) The term “absence” shall not include any of the following:
(1)	Absence due to job-related injuries or job-related illnesses substantiated by a medical doctor within 24
15
hours of return to work;
(2)	Absences from work resulting from vacation, holidays, military leave, bereavement leave, authorized leaves of absence (including “personal excused”), excused on a holiday either by own request or District request, union business, suspensions imposed by the District, or jury duty;
(3)	Any failure to report as assigned or failure to be at work (if reported within twenty-four hours after the start of the employee’s shift or work assignment), or any failure to remain at work (if reported to the employee’s supervisor prior to leaving work), that is due to a documented catastrophic event, occurring to the employee, or to his/her spouse, dependent minor child, parent, or previously designated domestic partner. (Vacation may be used in connection with catastrophic events as outlined in Paragraph 17.24).
(4)	Any failure to report as assigned, failure to be at work, or failure to remain at work, which is excused by a supervisor pursuant to Paragraph 6.03(a) - (c) of this section.
(5)	In the event of a serious illness or injury to the employee verified by a medical or dental practitioner, or a verified continuing civil court matter (including hearings and conferences required by a court, but not including meetings with the employee’s attorney), requiring the employee to be away from work during a future period of time, or a serious illness or injury to the employee’s spouse, dependent minor child, or previously designated domestic partner, verified by a medical or dental practitioner, requiring the employee to be away from work during a future period of time,
16
the employee, the Union and the District shall agree to a plan that will reasonably allow the employee to be away from work over a specified period of time. In developing such plans, the needs of the employee and the District shall be considered. Such days missed from work shall not be considered an “absence”.
(6)	FLEXTIME
No employee will be required to work an alternative schedule or flextime.
Based on the particular operational considerations of each department/division, the parties agree that on an individual basis, with the approval of the employee, the department manager, and the union; flextime may be arranged for employees at the employee’s option.
(A)“Regular Flextime” is defined as follows: An employee has a regularly scheduled appointment at the beginning or end of his/her shift and would like to flex his/her hours. A plan will be developed to accommodate the appointment. Regular flextime will not affect the employee’s eligibility for the attendance incentive(s). The employee shall make a good faith effort to schedule appointments as close to the beginning or end of his/her shift as possible.
(B) “Window Flextime” is defined as follows:
Employee arrives at work within a specific prearranged window, ie: between 7 am and 9 am. Arrival windows must not be longer than 3 hours from the employee’s regularly scheduled start time. Employee works for the number of hours his/her shift requires.
Employees who elect to work under the “Window
17
Flextime” system shall not be eligible for the incentives in this section.
Employees may also request alternative workweeks. Any employee may present his/her supervisor with a plan. If the Employee, the Union, and the District agree, an alternate schedule may be implemented. Alternative work hours shall not affect an employee’s eligibility for the incentives listed in this section.
(7)	TIME OFF FOR APPOINTMENTS: Employees may use up to eight hours sick leave per quarter in hour increments for verified personal appointments with no adverse consequences under the attendance policy. The employee must request time off no later than noon on the day prior to the appointment. At the time of the request, the District may require written verification upon the employee’s return.
(8)	MISS-OUTS: Employees who miss-out and subsequently work that day, shall not be charged with an absence under the attendance policy. Nor will a “working miss” count against the employee for purposes of the attendance incentive. Decisions as to whether the employee will be allowed to work are to be made by the Superintendent or his/her designee.
(9)	TARDY: An operator who is three (3) minutes or less late picking up his/her run at the division or reporting to the Training Center will not be charged with a miss-out (absence). A “tardy” will be recorded, but will not be used against the operator for purposes of this section. It will in no way be used as a negative mark on the operator’s record.
If the operator has a second tardy during a rolling 12 months, s/he will then be charged with (1) miss-out (absence). The first tardy will come off in a twelve
18
month rolling period.
An operator, whose run is still available, will work that run. If the operator’s own run is not available, the operator with the tardy will go to the end of the point list. If the operator who has the tardy chooses not to work, s/he will be given an absence under this section. If the District decides not to use the operator, no absence will be charged, but it will count as one tardy.
(10)	Absences which are covered under the Family Medical Leave Act.
6.03(a) Any employee who has an absence, and who believes that the absence was due to unusual or extraordinary circumstances beyond his/her control, or who believes that there were other extenuating circumstances for the absence, may within five (5) working days of the absence discuss all reasons for the absence with his/her supervisor, present all available documentation, and request that the absence be excused.
(b)	In deciding whether to excuse the absence, the supervisor shall review the circumstances presented by the employee in light of the purposes of this Attendance Policy which are to prevent excessive absenteeism but not to discipline employees who regularly come to work. The supervisor shall act fairly and impartially in deciding whether to excuse an absence.
(c)	Any absence which is excused by a supervisor shall not be considered as an absence for any purpose except the attendance incentive provided for in Paragraph 6.04(c).
(d)	A full-time employee with at least 24 days accrued
19
on the sick book as of the date of his/her return to work from a bonafide illness will not be charged with an absence under this policy.
(e)	A Peak Hour driver with at least 8 days of his/her sick leave accrued as of the date of his/her return to work from a bonafide illness will not be charged with an absence under this policy.
6.04(a) Any employee who has absences as of December 14, 2000, shall have those absences reduced by two (2) (the oldest and the newest) on a one time basis, only upon the signing of this agreement.
(b) Any employee who has no absences in any rolling six-month period shall have his/her two (2) most recent absences permanently excused. Any absences permanently excused pursuant to this paragraph shall not be used against the employee for any purpose except the attendance incentive provided for in Paragraph 6.04(c).
(c)(1) Any employee who has no days of absence in any consecutive rolling three month period from the last absence or qualification for a quarterly incentive, whichever is the greater period of time, shall receive two hundred dollars ($200) for each such consecutive three-month period. Said payment shall be paid to the employee in a separate check no later than the last payroll period in the month after the qualifying month for the $200 incentive.
(2)	In addition, any employee who has no days of absence in any consecutive rolling twelve (12) month period from the last absence or qualification for the
20
annual incentive, whichever is the greater period of time, shall, in addition to the quarterly payments listed in subparagraph (1) above, receive two hundred dollars ($200). Said payment shall be paid to the employee in a separate check no later than the last payroll period in the month following completion of the twelve months.
(3)	For purposes of determining whether an employee shall qualify for any of the incentives listed above, the term “absence” shall be as defined in Paragraph 6.02, except that for this paragraph (c) only, the term “absence” shall also include (i) any time off for job related injuries or job related illnesses (except days on which an employee takes a portion of the day off for industrial injury treatment/therapy, or participates in the modified duty program, or is assaulted), (ii) any time off in connection with discipline imposed by the District (except for discipline which has been removed by agreement of the District and the Union or overturned by an arbitrator), (iii) any absence from work exempted from being an occurrence as a result of the Alcohol/Substance Abuse Policy; and (iv) authorized leave of absence (including “personal excused”). Nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as a waiver of any rights that an employee may have under any existing or future federal or state law or regulation.
6.05(a) It is recognized by the parties that some absences are to be expected. Accordingly, the first six (6) absences within a rolling twelve-month period will be treated as “unreported absences” and will not subject an employee to discipline. The absences will, however, be recorded for future reference and possible dis-
21
cipline under this section.
6.05(b) Any employee who has five (5) absences in any rolling twelve-month or less period, shall receive counseling by a Supervisor. A Union representative shall be present at all counseling sessions. The counseling is not intended to be punitive; rather it shall be for the purpose of discussing the absences and their cause; determining if the employee is experiencing some type of difficulty for which assistance might prove helpful; providing the employee with a copy of the Attendance Policy which the employee shall acknowledge receipt of in writing; and advising the employee as to the consequences of future absences. If the District does not make a reasonable effort to notify and counsel the employee within ten (10) working days of his/her 5th absence, the employee’s last absence shall be permanently excused and shall not be used against the employee for any purpose except the attendance incentive provided for in Paragraph 6.04(c).
6.06(a) If an employee has seven (7) or more absences in any rolling twelve-month period, he/she shall receive the following discipline:
Seventh (7th) absence—oral warning and counseling. Eighth (8th) absence—written warning and counseling. Ninth (9th) absence—suspension of five (5) workdays, and counseling.
Tenth (10th) absence—discharge.
(b)	Nothing contained in this section shall, in appropriate cases, prevent the District from assessing progressive discipline, up to and including discharge, to any employee who engages in a pattern of absenteeism
22
even if the employee has not reached the levels of absence set forth in subsection (a) of this paragraph. Whether such a pattern exists depends upon the particular facts of each case.
(c)	Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, any absence for three (3) consecutive working days without notifying the District of the reasons for said absence shall be deemed sufficient cause for discharge.
6.07(a) Any discipline implemented by the District under this Attendance Policy shall be in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 3.02 of the Labor Agreement.
(b)	In the case of a suspension or discharge instituted pursuant to Paragraph 6.06 above, the District shall issue a notice of intent to suspend or discharge, which shall not, if appealed, be implemented until upheld or modified by the arbitration procedure provided below. Suspensions shall thereafter be implemented within twenty (20) working days; discharges shall thereafter be implemented immediately.
(c)	If an employee or the Union wishes to appeal any discipline imposed under this Section, it may do so under the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d) through (f) below.
(d)	The employee may appeal an oral warning, written reprimand or suspension by filing with the District within the five (5) working days of receipt of notice of the discipline an appeal, which shall briefly set forth, in writing, the reasons for challenging the discipline. Similarly, the employee or the Union may initiate appeal of an intent to discharge by filing with the District within ten (10) days of receipt of notice an appeal, which shall briefly set forth, in writing, the reasons for challenging the intent to discharge. If no
23
appeal is filed, the discipline or discharge shall stand. The employee bears the burden of documenting all material facts constituting a claimed excuse or justification. Such documentation must be submitted to the District and to the Union as soon as available.
(e)	Each week a representative of the Union and a representative of the District will meet to review such appeals informally. Any appeals resolved shall be final and binding but without precedential effect for any case not involving the employee concerned. The District shall notify the employee, in writing, within five (5) working days of the result of the informal review.
(f)	Any discipline which is not resolved by informal review may be submitted to expedited arbitration pursuant to Paragraphs 5.05-5.06 of the Labor Agreement.

(2)	Those who previously elected $4,000 coverage shall have $2,000 coverage paid for by the District. The other $2,000 coverage will have to be paid for by the pensioner.
(3)	Those who retired on or after February 1, 1978, the District will pay the premium for $2,000 life insurance coverage. The District will permit any pensioner to purchase an additional $10,000 coverage under the District’s Group Life Insurance Policy.
21.08 Retiree Medical
(a)	Retirees who opt to maintain coverage through AC Transit shall be allowed to choose a medical plan which includes a prescription benefit. In addition, the plan will cover hearing aids and durable medical equipment.
(b)	The District shall provide vision care for the retiree only, the retiree may purchase coverage for his/her spouse.
The District shall subsidize retiree dental with a cash payment of $20.00 per month per retiree.
21.09 Medical Trust
The Union and the District will establish and jointly ad
58
minister a trust fund intended for use by retirees for postretirement medical. In (1997) the District will contribute $1,000,000 to the trust. Each year thereafter the District will contribute $.10 per hour per employee for all hours worked.
Effective January 1, 2001, the parties, through the ATU/AC Transit post-retirement Trust, will pay $150 of the medical premium for current and future retirees between 55 and 65 who are not Medicare eligible.
Both parties have a duty to protect the ATU/AC Transit Trust. Moreover, the parties wish to provide full retiree medical for the retiree and spouse in the future. Upon signing, the parties agree to immediately begin discussions on ways to provide full medical for the retiree and spouse within the current funding levels.

59
retirees according to length of time retired.
21.13	RETIREMENT EDUCATION
The parties understand that the AC Transit pension plan is the centerpiece of a veteran employee’s assurance of security after retirement. By contrast, new employees may enter service with the District with only a slight interest in retirement. Notwithstanding the level of interest, both groups of employees benefit from regular and ongoing education about the District’s pension plan, and how to put together a plan for a high quality retirement. The Union and the District will jointly develop (in concert with the Retirement Department) a retirement education program, keyed on the two most critical times in the worker’s career.
First, during initial training, workers will receive information regarding the existence of the plan and generally what benefits are available. During the first ten years, employees will receive periodic written information and updates on the plan.
Just prior to the ten-year vesting point, employees will receive an eight-hour session to include detailed financial counseling. Subjects such as types of deferred compensation, sick leave accrual roll-overs, flexible benefit plans, help in estimating how much money will be needed during retirement, and assistance in setting up options that the employee may select will be covered.

When such transfer is made as a result of change in operation or at the request of the District, the employee will be trained/qualified and compensated at his/her regular rate of pay at straight time for the learning period.
40.18	The District will determine the number of Extra Board bus drivers to be allotted to each of the divisions and may transfer such Extra Board bus drivers from one division to another as necessity arises on a seniority basis.

The District shall hold the line sign-up within fifteen (15) calendar days of the request. A bus driver may not request a line sign-up for changes necessitated by Sundays, holidays or special events.
(a) If no protest is made by the bus driver affected, a line sign-up will not be required.
41.02 If a run is abolished between division sign- ups, the bus driver so affected shall be detailed to work a group of trippers selected from the extra list. In such event, the bus driver so affected will continue to receive at a minimum, pay for his/her original signed-on run until a new division sign-up becomes effective.

SECTION 42.0
EXTRA BOARD
42.01 The Extra Board shall consist of a day and night list. The names of all Extra Board bus drivers who work same shall have their names in alphabetical order permanently and the work shall rotate around all a.m. point positions. Extra work shall be so rotated that no Extra Board bus driver will lose his/her position on the list regardless of whether he/she obtains work when serving point. In detailing bus drivers for work on the first day of a new sign-up, point positions shall be at the top of the alphabetical list. From that day forth, until the sign-up period is ended, these "point positions" shall be the focal point in starting each day’s Extra Board assignments. The first point position on the day Extra Board will follow the last point position assigned on the day before and move a minimum of five (5) places per day on a Monday through Friday basis.
(a) A bus driver on point may, at his/her option, turn down a run that exceeds thirteen (13) hours spread time. If the driver turns down a run which is over
85
thirteen hours spread, the run will be offered to each point person in order. A point person must accept the run if it is within his/her thirteen hour (13) spread. The last person on point must accept the run. If the run exceeds thirteen hours spread for the last available point person, he/she may elect to be relieved within the 13 hours. Such relief must be made within (13) thirteen hours of such assignment.
42.02 All work on the Extra Board shall be filled first by the Extra Board bus drivers and then bus drivers working their day off shall be assigned only work not filled by the Extra Board bus drivers. Monday’s detail will start the rotation from the previous Friday’s list. Weekday nights, Saturday and Sunday Extra Boards shall move one place per day. The work will be assigned to the first Extra Board bus driver marked up and so on down the list in the following order:
(a)	Point Time
(b)	Straight Charters (7 hours or more)
(c)	Regular Runs
(d)	Trippers (Charters under 7 hours)
42.03 All of the above to be in in-time sequence except for charters.
42.04 In any division with a day and night extra list, extra work shall be rotated in accordance with this Section.
42.05 Notwithstanding the above provisions for Extra Board assignments, new bus drivers may be detailed to work a group of trippers selected from the Extra Board list for a specific period not to exceed thirty (30) days after completing the initial training period. The detailed
86
group of trippers shall be changed from week to week during the thirty-day period to give experience on several routes. Whenever the District wants to assign a group of trippers to new bus drivers for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days, those assignments shall be shown separately on the detail sheet.
42.06 Should it become necessary for a division (due to their work load) to need Saturday and Sunday or Sunday and Monday as days off, those days off will be offered to the top seniority bus drivers on the Extra Board who have weekdays off so that they may be given the opportunity to take them if they so desire.
42.07 Should it become necessary for a division (due to their work load) to need weekdays as days off, those days off will be offered to the top seniority bus drivers on the Extra Board who have weekends off. If the required positions are still not filled, those days off will be assigned to bus drivers on the Extra Board in inverse order of seniority. Selection will begin with the first bus driver at the bottom of the Extra Board list with weekends off.
(a) DEFINITION OF WEEKENDS
Friday and Saturday
Saturday and Sunday
Sunday and Monday
42.08 All point positions during any point assignment shall be separated by time to indicate rotation of work assignments.
87
42.09 Consistent with the requirements of the service and to the extent practicable, the District will endeavor to post the detail sheet by 1:30 p.m. of the day prior to the assignment, in the event that it is known by those preparing the posting that such trippers and runs are open at that time. When an owl assignment is vacant prior to the day of the assignment, it is to be worked by a day-off person if any (in order not to violate the state law that a bus driver has to be off 8 hours). If the District does not use the day-off person and the owl is on the Extra Board for the second day, it shall be rotated to another Extra Board bus driver that has 8 hours off. If there is no Extra Board bus driver with 8 hours off, the first bus driver may be assigned the owl assignment again.
42.10 Extra Board bus drivers shall show preference as to the day or night list according to their seniority and days off, consistent with the requirements of the service and to the extent practicable to do so. A day Extra Board bus driver working on one of his/her regular assigned workdays after 8:30 p.m. shall receive payment at time and one-half for work performed after 8:30 p.m.
42.11 Day Extra Board operators shall not be scheduled to start work later than 12:00 noon. Night Extra Board operators shall not be scheduled to start work earlier than 12:00 noon. The only exception shall be to avoid cancellation in service. A Night Extra Board bus driver working one of his/her regularly assigned work days, shall receive payment of time and one half for all work performed before 12:00noon. All work that is out after 8:00 p.m. is designated as night work.
42.12 Point operators should not be used to cover service in
88
foreign divisions except to prevent cancellation of service. When deciding which point person to send to another division, dispatchers will first ask for volunteers in seniority order. If there are no volunteers, the lowest seniority point person will be sent to the foreign division. Such assignment will not affect the rotation of the board on the following day. Operators shall be guaranteed a ride back from the foreign division.
(a) Extra Board bus drivers who are sent to a foreign division, will be paid an additional one hour pay at straight time, plus travel time to and from the foreign division.
SECTION 43.0

Neither of these pieces of work shall exceed 2 hours of platform time or 12 hours and 15 minutes spread time. This will allow these Shop Stewards to be available during the day to handle grievances and other employee related problems that may arise during the course of the day.

90
46.04 When it is known that any owl run will be temporarily open for a period of five (5) or more days, such owl run shall be posted for bid immediately to the Extra Board on a seniority basis for three (3) days, to go into effect the fourth day. Should there be no Extra Board bus driver bidding, it shall be detailed in inverse order of seniority, and the bus driver getting the detail shall hold same for the duration of the vacancy.
SECTION 47.0
RUNS
47.01 Bus drivers who work regular scheduled runs shall not be required to run extra trips or do extra work except in case of emergency where special events, blockades, fires or acts of God require extra service.

(a) To the greatest extent practicable, runs will be designated as the line on which the majority of the work is done.
47.07 Run Exchange. The purpose of the Run Exchange program is to give bus drivers flexibility in their work week to take care of personal needs by allowing them to request a run exchange without having to request excused time off or a casual vacation day. It is understood that a run exchange is optional with operators to supplement time off, not supplant it, e.g., an operator may decide not to exchange runs and may request excused time off which may or may not be granted depending on the needs of the District.
Procedure: The operator wishing to exchange a run is responsible for finding the exchange and making certain it is approved. Each operator must know the run he/she is exchanging and must have had eight hours rest between exchanged runs. Section 65.01 - "Voluntary Exchange" applies and there will be no pay for short rest. Pay follows the run.
1.	The operator wishing to exchange runs will find another operator with whom to exchange.
92
a.	The trade must be for a full day.
b.	The operators trading runs must be at the same division.
c.	No exchanging days off.
2.	The operator initiating the exchange must complete the Request to Exchange Runs and turn it into the authorized Superintendent or designee no later than 11:00 am on the day prior to the day to of the exchange.
3.	The request will be reviewed by the Superintendent or designee who will approve or deny the request. Each operator wishing to exchange runs must check to see whether the run exchange is approved. It is the responsibility of each operator to show up on time for his/her run. Failure to do so will be a miss subject to the provisions of Section 6.0 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
SECTION 48.0
SPOT TIME
48.01 **On all runs consuming less than 30 minutes running time one-way, the District agrees to allow no less than a five-minute spot on at least one (1) trip during a two-hour working period.

(a)	On all runs consuming over 30 minutes one-way, a minimum of 12 minutes shall be allowed at the completion of each one-way trip.
(b)	The District shall implement this section starting
93
with the March, June and September 2001, sign-ups.
48.03 Sufficient running time will be allowed and not taken from the bus driver’s layover, but since spot or layover time is both for the convenience of the bus driver and the District to insure on-time operation of the service, it is intended that bus drivers should start each trip at the time scheduled. Consideration will be given to a special case requiring additional time, but it is further agreed that an occasional short layover of less than 4 minutes will be permitted in case of equipment which has just left division headquarters, or if necessary when changing headways, making necessary turnbacks or operating changes.
SECTION 49.0
SANITARY FACILITIES TO BE FURNISHED BY THE DISTRICT
49.01 Suitable sanitary facilities shall be provided and an opportunity afforded for use of same. These facilities shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition by the District.

Notice of any change of facilities shall be made promptly, and the Union will be notified before such change is made.
49.02 Based on research jointly reviewed during the 1997 negotiations, the parties recognize that Operators’ health well-being, and stress levels would be positively impacted through improving consistent availability of clean restrooms. The parties acknowledge increasing the availability of clean sanitary facilities will improve the working environment for operators. Therefore, no later than December 1, 1997, the District and the Union will jointly develop a plan for specific locations,
94
cleaning schedules and an implementation budget for all designated facilities. Paddles will show the location of the restrooms at the ends of each line. The District will implement the jointly developed restroom plan no later than January 1, 1998.

SECTION 67.0
PEAK HOUR BUS DRIVER
All Full Time Workforce: Effective with the June 2000, sign-up, all bus drivers shall be full time bus drivers. The parties understand that some current part time drivers wish to remain part time. As a result, those employees will be allowed to remain part time. Their new title will be "Peak Hour Operators".
Upon ratification of this agreement, all part time operators will be asked to opt for either full time or part time work. Once a driver opts to remain part time, he/she relinquishes his/her seniority to go full time. Bus driver vacancies will be considered full time vacancies and will be filled first by existing part time operators by seniority then by new employees. Part time drivers who elect to remain Peak Hour drivers and who later decide to enter the full time driver ranks must compete with outside applicants for future driver openings. Peak Hour drivers shall become part of the Pension Plan.
As peak operators attrit from the unit, those positions will not be filled, and the remaining work will be included on the full time driver sign-up immediately following the attrition of the part time operator.
67.0	1 Wage rates for peak hour bus drivers shall be the same as those applicable to full time bus drivers.
67.0	2 For purposes of time computation and longevity, the following formula will apply:
104
(a)	1040 work hours equals six (6) months.
(b)	2080 work hours equals one (1) year.
67.03 When scheduled to work, peak hour bus drivers shall be guaranteed a minimum of 2 hours per day at straight time.
67.04 Peak hour bus drivers will be limited to a maximum of 30 platform hours per week and 6 platform hours maximum per day.
67.05 One hundred 100% percent of peak hour assignments shall be a single straight piece of work.
67.06 Peak Hour bus drivers will not be scheduled to work on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays, except that when the service which constitutes their regular assignment continues to operate on the holiday, they shall work that holiday.
67.07 Benefits:
(a)	Peak Hour operators shall be covered by Sections 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 15.0, 16.0, 22.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, 27.0, 28.0, 29.0, 30.0, 31.0, 32.0, 33.0, 34.0, of Part I, and Section 35.0, 36.0, 37.0, 38.0, 39.0, 41.0, 43.0, 48.0, 49.0, 50.0, 51.0, 52.0, 53.0, 54.0, 55.0, 56.0, 57.0, 58.0, 65.0, 68.0 of Part II.
(b)	The District shall pay 100% of the least expensive medical premium available to District employees for each Peak Hour operator with 6 months or more seniority. The Part time operator may opt to pay for dependent coverage with pre- tax dollars. The employee may also opt to choose a more costly medical plan but must pay the difference between that plan
105
and the least expensive plan with pre-tax dollars. The benefit level shall be the same as is offered to all other employees. In addition, Peak Hour bus drivers with eighteen (18) months or more seniority with the District may elect to participate in one of the District’s H.M.O. medical plans for himself/herself and eligible dependents. The District will pay one-half the premium paid for full-time employees, and the part-time bus driver will pay the remainder with pre-tax dollars by payroll deduction.
(c)	Peak Hour Operators shall accrue sick leave at the rate of one day per quarter under the criteria set forth in Section 13.0. Sick leave accrual shall not be affected by conversion to full time status.
(d)	Peak Hour bus drivers with eighteen (18) months or more seniority with the District will receive holiday pay in the amount of 4 hours at their applicable rate for the following holidays: New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day and Christmas Day. Part-time bus drivers who work on such holidays shall receive such holiday pay plus their normal pay for hours worked without premium pay.
67.08 Peak Hour bus drivers with thirty-six (36) months seniority with the District will receive five (5) days vacation paid at the rate of 4 hours per day at their applicable rate. Paragraph 17.03 will be used to determine credit toward vacation. Peak Hour bus drivers will be entitled to vacation credits under this section on a pro-rata basis if they apply for and become full-time before completing thirty-six months of service.

106
(a)	There will be a separate seniority list for Peak Hour bus drivers, and selection of assignments by Peak Hour bus drivers shall be made in order of seniority.

(b)	Any employee listed on the roster maintained pursuant to paragraph (a) above who receives notice of layoff shall, in addition to any other contractual layoff rights, have the right to immediately become a journey level mechanic if he/she passes all eight (8) parts of the Apprenticeship Program. If the rostered employee becomes a journey level mechanic, he/she shall receive the applicable pay for that classification. If, however, the rostered employee does not qualify as a journey level mechanic, he/she shall be slotted into the Apprenticeship Program according to the number of parts he/she passes. If the employee is slotted into the Apprenticeship Program and participates diligently, he/she shall be red-lined at the rate of pay he/she was receiving in his/her former classification (e.g., Painter, Body Mechanic, etc.) and shall remain at that rate of pay until he/she moves into a level of the Apprenticeship Program which has a higher rate of pay.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SIDELETTER
TRANSPORTATION SIGN-UPS
A trial division sign up will be conducted at Division Four (East Oakland) Transportation three weeks in advance of the normal division sign-up in March or December.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING IMPROVED SERVICE &SIGN-UP
The parties recognize that service is improved when passengers can expect the same driver on a run, over time. Moreover, improved employee morale, decreased stress levels, lower accident rates result from the same runs being posted at the sign-up. When drivers are able to remain on the same line from sign-up to sign-up, service is improved and both customer and employee satisfaction are attained.
Consistent with the parties commitment to the joint problem-solving process, we agree that the planning process should include appropriate stakeholders. The Service Bank concept in the 1997 Agreement was a first attempt to open up this process.
The following specific strategies will be implemented to simultaneously achieve three goals;
(a)	runs remaining the same from sign-up to sign-up from September through June, b) maintaining appropriate efficiency in the runcut, c) including stakeholders in service changes.
(b)	A workshop designed to define the organization’s vision for future service and service changes. Workshop to include appropriate stakeholders.
(c)	Determine the level of flexibility of the new computer software program. Resolve issues concerning parameters in runcuts - so that the parties know specifically what can be done without disturbing the entire run structure.
(d)	Establish what amount of service change should
165
trigger a runcut, or agree on the conditions that would trigger a runcut, ie; the magnitude of proposed service changes or cost of proposed service change..
(e)	Define stakeholders - who needs to be included and when - in the process of planning new service or changing existing service.
166

The District will continue to pay $.10 per hour for all hours worked by employees in ATU classifications into the ATU/AC Transit Retirement Medical Trust.
169
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RETIREMENT HOUSING
The parties agree to make use of the AFL-CIO building fund to obtain the resources to build or acquire housing for AC Transit retirees. During the term of the agreement a study will be done to determine all sources of funding for the project.
The parties agree to explore a ten (10) year design, build and occupy schedule.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SUFFICIENT RUNNING TIME
Because Section 48.0 of the current collective bargaining agreement sets forth the requirement for "sufficient running time," the parties want to comply with that provision.
Recovery and running times were developed in 1953 and since that time traffic signals, use of lifts, construction, and other changing conditions have made the time inadequate on many lines. The scheduling department routinely adds 10% to recover times because of the inadequate running times.
The parties are committed to high quality service and therefore agree to work jointly to identify running time concerns and solutions. As solutions are found they will be proposed to the General Manager for review and resolution.
170
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CHILDCARE TRUST
The District shall contribute $.03 cents per hour per employee for all hours worked by employees in ATU classifications. The purpose of this contribution is to assist ATU members with their childcare needs.
The Childcare Committee shall be responsible for working out the details on how to implement childcare programs.
The Trustees of the Medical Trust shall determine how the childcare portion will be added to the Trust.
171
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SCHOOL BUS MONITORS
The parties agree to continue the current school bus monitoring program at the Richmond schools. Further, the parties intend to continue to try to implement the program with the Oakland schools.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING IMPROVE SPOT TIME
No later than March of 2001, the parties agree to research and determine whether improvements should be made on spot time on lines consuming less than 30 minutes one-way, runs consuming between 30 and 59 minutes, interlined runs and one-way loops.
One-way loops are defined as runs that do not have a rest spot at the end of the line such as the 53 line, or the 1, 2, 3, lines. Interlined runs are runs that have been combined into one run. Since these types of runs may not need spot time at one end of the line - the spot time requirements may be different - depending on the line.
172
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REDUCTION OF VANDALISM
The District and Union are committed to providing high quality transit service in the East Bay. The parties recognize that vandalism on buses (1) impacts the quality of the service provided to our riders; (2) puts unnecessary pressure on bus operators; and (3) places a drain on the District’s financial resources.
The parties agree to implement strategies, as noted below, to begin to reduce vandalism during the term of this agreement.
(d) Establish an outside monitor program to provide an official presence on targeted school service runs to assist in deterring vandalism.
Operators and Mechanics will provide feedback that will be incorporated into a vandalism tracking/system indicator program.
173
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING PROVIDE CUSTOMERS AND COMMUNITY FLEXIBLE SERVICE
The District and the Union are committed to exploring those options that will provide customers and the community flexible service alternatives, in addition to the fixed-route service currently provided.
During the 1997 negotiations, the parties explored a number of ways to improve bus service and concluded that in addition to traditional, fixed-route service, there are a variety of gybrid services that could accommodate a specific community need and result in savings.
The geographical areas of service initially considered for the various types of general public flexible service are Southern Alameda County, and heavy-demand para-transit areas of the District.
The Parties will explore a range of alternatives that include but are not limited to: route and/or point deviation, shuttle, subscription service, and service designed to carry passengers who participate in welfare to work, school to work, and worker displacement programs.
The Parties will explore, develop and implement the most creative options that will provide a model of general public flexible service and/or enhance current fixed route service.
174
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
CONTINUING PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCESS
The District and ATU agree that during the term of this collective bargaining agreement that ongoing discussions and development of processes will be necessary in order to fully implement the intent and spirit of this document.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CALIBRATE THE EFFECT OF EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION ON SERVICE
Based on research during the 1997 negotiations, the parties agree that front-line workers and passengers should be the center of concern for the organization. The new paradigm requires a radical shift in the way the District measures success. The new ideas require innovative measurement techniques. These techniques calibrate the impact of employee satisfaction, and customer loyalty on service delivery and assess the corresponding impact on growth and improved service. In fact, the lifetime value of a loyal customer can be astronomical, especially when a positive awareness of AC Transit and the fully Unionized workers is added to the economics of customer retention and repeated consistent use of the system.
The parties agree that during the term of this agreement we will put "hard" values on "soft" measures. We will attempt to create "apostles" - passengers so satisfied that they convert the uninitiated to the service; and avoid creating "terrorists" - customers so unhappy that they speak out against a poorly delivered service at every opportunity.
Satisfaction indicators will be developed jointly and overlaid upon current service delivery.
175
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING INTERNAL REVIEW AND RESPONSE
The parties agree that in order to foster trust and respond to the concerns of union members regarding disrespectful or undignified treatment by supervisors, and internal review and response system is necessary.
The Internal Review and Response Group (IRRG) will meet monthly to discuss any memos submitted, or issues raised by ATU members regarding situations in which managers were disrespectful or undignified
The Union appointees to the IRRG will meet to review and evaluate the facts around the complaint and determine whether the complaint should be handled in this process or in some other manner. The IRRG is not intended to circumvent the grievance procedure.
Subsequent to the union review and evaluation process, issues will be presented to IRRG appointees of the General Manager. The combined group will attempt to resolve issues, using a joint problem solving process.
Responses will include, but will not be limited to:
Training for involved parties
Union review
District review
Joint problem solving
Documentation
In all cases, a written response will be sent to all involved.
176
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ADA TRAINING &CIVIL RIGHTS
Effective upon the signing of this Agreement, driver training on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) shall include a full day of one-on-one interaction with people from the disabled community. Training shall include tie down on all types of buses, sensitivity, and civil rights of disabled people.
177
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING UNION PARTICIPATION IN HIRING
The parties recognize that hiring the highest caliber workforce in the positions represented by the Union will serve the District well currently and into the next century.
The Parties agree that the Union’s participation in the hiring process for ATU positions (consistent with all applicable laws and regulations), could facilitate the hiring of the most qualified applicants.
During the term of this agreement, interview panels for the selection of new hirees for ATU positions will consist of three (3) parties: (1) a Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent; (2) a driver or other representative of the class being hired; and (3) a Human Resources representative.
178
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING DRIVERS’ COMMITTEE
Purpose

180
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RE SERVICE LEVELS
The parties recognize that the primary function of the District is to provide reliable and comprehensive bus service to meet the transportation needs of the public in Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
In order to maintain service at its present level and to expand service to meet the public’s transportation needs, the parties agree to the following:
1.	Should the District consider service reductions in the future, the District shall immediately notify the Union and discuss with the Union the nature, extent, reasons for, and impact upon the public and the employees, of any such service reductions. The District will work jointly with the Union to insure that all alternatives are considered prior to any service reductions. The intent of the parties is to work together to avoid adversely affecting the workforce.
2.	This MOU is not intended to violate the collective bargaining agreement or the parties’ collective bargaining rights and obligations.
181
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RETIREE MENTOR
Recognizing the wealth of experience of the veteran employee; and understanding that the District and Union may experience a loss of such experience with an improved retirement system, the parties agree to establish the Retiree Mentor Program.
The purpose of the program is to allow retired employees to return to the District for an agreed upon period during which the retiree would mentor new employees through the initial stages of their employment with the District.
Retiree mentors shall not replace or otherwise take the place of any current employee. Nor shall the retiree mentor take the place of a new hire into any future open job.
Retiree mentors hold "consultant" status.
182
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOINT EFFORTS FOR FUNDING
The parties realize that the long term financial health of the District is a concern to both the Union and the District. Therefore, the parties agree, where appropriate, to continue to explore joint efforts to obtain new funding (ballot measures, joint legislative efforts, etc.). Nothing in this agreement is intended to supplant or change the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
As a means of providing a setting to explore new funding possibilities, the parties shall establish a Joint Efforts for Funding Council (JEFFC) that shall meet no less than once a quarter.
JEFFC shall have core participants from the Union and the District.
A record shall be maintained that includes the agenda, a brief outline of the issues discussed, the outcome and the work items generated for each participant.
183
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TRAINING PROGRAMS
We agree that if new systems aimed at optimizing negotiated improvements are to work, training must be the hub of the systems. AC Transit and ATU, Local 192, commit to creating a learning organization. To the extent possible, the parties will explore funding for training through joint applications for state and federal funding from vocational education programs and other untapped resources.
The unavailability of outside funding will not eliminate the obligation to train while implementing the following newly negotiated contract provisions. The areas of SKILL LEVEL TRAINING WILL INCLUDE:
1.	New technology training and upgrading of skills for Maintenance Clerks, Schedule Analysts, Senior Schedule Analysts, and other general office clericals. The training for Schedule and Senior Analysts will include upgrading skills in scheduling software.
2.	Continued skills upgrade within the Apprenticeship program.
3.	Enhancing the skills of new part-time operators through modifying training programs to include early morning, late night, and heavy line runs with emphasis on pulling into and out of coach stops.
4.	Enhancing the skills of operators converting from part-time to full-time through modifying training programs to include early morning, late night, and heavy line runs with emphasis on pulling into and out of coach stops.
184
5.	Establish a new training program for operators who are about to complete ten years of service to include accident reduction strategies, awareness of the AC and regional transit systems, and provide strategies for anti-burnout interventions.
6.	Provide conflict resolution training for Shop Stewards and Division Superintendents
7.	Provide customer service training for Customer Service Clerks, SF Ticket Sellers, PBX Operators and other general office clerical employees who regularly interface with the public.
8.	Provide leadership development for employees who are interested in improving their effectiveness in their current assignments.
9.	Provide training for employees interested in career development.
The parties agree to jointly pursue outside training funding for the following programs
A "school to work" vocation program for high school students to develop skills such as political awareness of public transit issues, collective, labor movement and related bills to prepare them for careers as public transit operators, mechanics, and other ATU classifications.
Post -Journey Level training.
The District agrees to include in the Short Range Transit Plan the existing obligation to train apprentices and to establish goals for training that are on par in priority with operational goals.
