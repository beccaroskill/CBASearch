DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
in this collective bargaining agreement, which is presently utilized and employed at each of the separate employers. All facilities are represented in this agreement.
The purpose of this Agreement is to promote harmonious relations between the Employer and its Bargaining Unit Employees; to secure efficient operations; to establish standards of wages, hours and other working conditions for Bargaining Unit Employees within the collective bargaining unit; to ensure that the Employer earns a sufficient return to enable it to employ the Bargaining Unit Employees and other employees; provide the seniors it cares for the quality of life and living environment that they deserve; and, better enable the Employer and the Bargaining Unit Employees to accomplish our Mission Statement: To Enhance the Life of Every Person We Serve.
COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP
In an effort to promote an effective partnership relationship, the Parties agree that they will treat their respective representatives with dignity and respect, and that employees, supervisors and other members of management will all treat each other with dignity and respect.
Neither the Employer nor the Union will publish newsletter articles or distribute other public communications that are disparaging of the other Party without first having made an effort to resolve the issue with the other Party. Such disparagement would include information relating to specific individuals of the Employer or the Union, issues that would be readily addressed when called to the attention of upper management of the Employer or the Union, and are overall contrary to the spirit of cooperation and partnership as represented by this Agreement. It is also an expectation that this spirit of cooperation will exist in all inter-personal communication.
This article is not intended to restrict the ability of the Employer or Union to communicate with Bargaining Unit Employees or union members related to business differences or disagreements between the Employer and Union.
Therefore, the Parties hereunto agree as follows
9
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION

The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all Bargaining Unit Employees, excluding supervisors, managers, department supervisors, and confidential employees, even if that person is currently the only person in the department, the Staffing Coordinator, the Bookkeeper, RNs, Charge Nurse. Additions to the Bargaining Unit of new employee groups and/or Employer facilities will be governed by the Neutrality and Voluntary Recognition Process, Appendix D, agreed to by the Parties as well as applicable laws and regulations.
1.2	New Employee Notice. When the Employer hires a new Bargaining Unit Employee, it shall advise that employee in writing, that there is an Agreement with the Union.

ARTICLE 2	- UNION SECURITY
2.1	Union Security. Not later than the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of employment, or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, every employee subject to the terms of this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, become and remain a member of the Union, paying the periodic dues uniformly required, or in the alternative shall, as a condition of employment, pay a fee in the amount equal to the periodic dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
2.2	Formal Separation from Bargaining Unit. The condition of employment specified above shall not apply during periods of formal separation from the bargaining unit by any such employee but shall reapply to such employee on the thirty-first (31st) day following their return to the bargaining unit. For purposes of this Paragraph, the term “formal separation” shall include transfers out of the bargaining unit, removal from the payroll of the Employer and leaves of absence of more than one (1) month duration.
2.3	Union Member List. The Union shall provide the Employer with a list of bargaining unit employees who have provided a written, electronic or recorded oral request to have monthly Union dues and/or agency fees, plus any additional voluntary Union deductions, deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the Union (“Union Member List”). Such Union Member List shall similarly identify any membership cancellations or other changes in employee dues, fees or other deductions. If the Union Member List is submitted to the Employer electronically by at least ten (10) calendar days before Employer’s next pay date, then the Employer
10
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
shall process such deductions or changes no later than such pay date; otherwise, Employer shall process such deductions or changes no later than the next following pay date. Any written applications for Union membership, authorizations for Union dues, authorizations for payment of agency fees and/or other Union-related deductions or dues cancellations which the Employer receives shall be forwarded to the Union. The Union will maintain the written, electronic, and recorded oral authorization records and will provide copies to the Employer upon request.
2.4	Deduction Authorization. The ability of a bargaining unit employee to revoke their written, electronic or recorded oral dues deduction authorization shall be determined by the terms and conditions of such specific dues deduction authorization. Union shall notify Employer thirty (30) days prior to implementing any material change in such deduction authorization(s) and provide Employer with new blank written deduction authorizations, as necessary.
2.5	Deductions Collection. The deductions collected from all employees for any pay dates in a calendar month, together with an itemized statement, shall be remitted to the Union’s Salem headquarters no later than the tenth of the following month. An electronic itemized statement showing all new hires shall be sent to the Union no later than ten (10) calendar days following each pay date. This information will be provided in electronic format. This statement shall include the following information for every bargaining unit employee if readily available:
1)	Name of employee
2)	Job classification
3)	Employee Identification Number
4)	Date of birth
5)	Gross pay for the pay period
6)	Regular / Base pay for the pay period
7)	Hire date
8)	Work phone number and email address

DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
13)	Amount of dues deducted from regular / base pay
14)	Amount of other deducted from regular / base pay
15)	Regular hours worked
The above statement will include any bargaining unit employees for whom no amounts were deducted and the reason for the lack of deduction (i.e., termination, transfer out of bargaining unit, leave of absence, deceased, new hire, etc.).
2.6	Condition of Employment. Upon written notice to the Employer from the Union that an employee has failed to maintain Union membership in good standing (which shall mean payment of dues and fees uniformly required of all members) and has failed to pay appropriate agency fees as described above, the Employer and the Union shall meet with the employee to determine a reasonable resolution. If no resolution is reached, the Employer will, not later than thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from Union, terminate said employee.
2.7	Indemnity. The Union will indemnify and hold harmless the Employer with respect to any asserted claim or obligation or cost of defending against any such claim or obligation of any person arising out of the Employer deducting and remitting Union dues, fees, or any other contributions to Union, or for Employer taking any action for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Article. The Union will have no monetary claim against the Employer by reason of failure to perform under this Article.
ARTICLE 3	- NO DISCRIMINATION
3.1	No Discrimination. No employee or applicant for employment covered by this Agreement shall be discriminated against because of membership in the Union or activities on behalf of the Union. Neither the Employer nor the Union shall unlawfully discriminate for or against any employee or applicant covered by this Agreement on account of race, color, religious creed, national origin, citizenship status, lawful political affiliation, veteran status, disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status or any other protected class.
3.2	Languages. In order to operate safely, efficiently and consistently with the rights of facility residents,
English shall be used in resident care areas and common areas typically occupied by residents and family members, unless the resident or family members are conversant in a foreign language and wish to
12
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
communicate with staff in that language. For instructional purposes in resident care areas, languages other than English may be used with consideration for facility residents and family members. The rule to communicate in English does not apply to employee break rooms, casually exchanged greetings, or casual conversations between employees except when such conversations occur in resident care areas or other common areas where residents converge.
3.3	Immigration. The Union and the Employer have a mutual interest in retaining qualified and trained employees. Accordingly, to the extent not addressed by this Agreement, at the request of the Union, the Employer will meet and discuss issues related to compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act and any other current or future legislation, government rules or policies related to immigrants, which impact bargaining unit employees.
3.4	Non-discrimination. No employee covered by this Agreement shall suffer any loss of seniority, compensation, or benefits solely due to any changes in the employee’s name or social security number, provided that the new social security number is valid, and the employee is authorized to work in the United States. The Employer shall not take action against an employee solely because the employee is subject to an immigration proceeding where the employee is otherwise permitted to work.
3.5	Workplace Immigration Enforcement. The Employer shall notify a representative of the Union as soon as practical if the Employer receives a “no-match” letter from the Social Security Administration (“SSA”), if it is contacted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS, formerly the INS), regarding the immigration status of an employee covered by this Agreement, or if a search and/or arrest warrant, administrative warrant, subpoena, or other request for documentation is presented. The Union agrees that it shall keep confidential any information it obtains pursuant to this provision, and that it will use any such information solely to represent and/or assist the affected employee(s) with regard to the DHS matter. Recognizing the intent of the Article, the Employer will comply with legal authorities, including agents of the DHS only as it deems necessary and appropriate.
The Employer shall permit inspection of I-9 forms by DHS or DOL only after a minimum of (3) three days written notice, or other such period of time as provided by law or where such inspection is otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Section. The Employer also shall permit inspection of I-9 forms where a
13
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
DHS search and/or arrest warrant, administrative warrant, subpoena, or other legal process signed by a federal judge or magistrate specially names employees or requires the production of I-9 forms. The Employer shall not provide documents other than the I-9 forms to DHS for inspection or reveal to the DHS the names, addresses or immigration status of any employees in the absence of a valid DHS administrative subpoena, a search warrant, or subpoena signed by a federal judge or magistrate, or where otherwise required by law, or it is otherwise deemed by the employer to be appropriate under the circumstances. To the extent legally possible, the Employer shall offer a private setting for questioning of employees by DHS.
3.6	Reverification of Status. No employee employed continuously on or before November 6, 1986, shall be required to document immigration status. The Employer shall not require or demand proof of immigration statues, except as may be required by 8 USC 1324a (1)(B) and listed on the back of the I-9 form, or as otherwise required by law.
In the event of a sale of a business or its assets, the employer shall offer to transfer the I-9 forms of its employees to the new employer or, at the employer’s option, to jointly maintain the I-9 forms of its employees with the successor employer for the period of three (3) years, after which the successor employee shall maintain said forms. The Employer shall not take adverse employment action against an employee based solely on the results of a computer verification of immigration or work authorization status.
3.7	Social Security Discrepancies. In the event that the employer receives notice from the SSA that one or more of the employee names and Social Security numbers (“SSN”) that the employer reported on the Wage and Tax Statements (Forms W-2) for the previous tax year do not agree with the SSA’s records, the employer will provide a copy of the notice to the employee and the Union upon receipt.
The Employee will be provided with an opportunity to address and correct the issue within 60 days or as otherwise allowed by applicable laws and regulations. The employer agrees that within the 60 day timeline, the employer:
a)	will not take any adverse action against any employee listed on the notice, including firing, laying off, suspending, retaliating, or discriminating against any such employee, solely as a result of the receipt of a no match letter or other discrepancy and
14
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
b)	will not require employees listed on the notice to bring in a copy of their Social Security card for the employer’s review, complete a new I-9 form, or provide new or additional proof of work authorization or immigration status solely as a result of the receipt of a no-match letter, unless otherwise required to avoid risk of prosecution, and
c)	will not contact the SSA or any other government agency, solely as a result of a no-match from the SSA.
In the event the discrepancy is not resolved within the 60 days, the Employer may take any necessary action, including termination of employment, to correct the issue and avoid risk or liability to the employer. Such action will not be subject to the contractual grievance procedure.
3.8	Seniority and Leave of Absences for Immigration Related Issues. Upon request, employees shall be released for up to five (5) unpaid working days per year during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in order to attend to DHS proceedings and any other related matters for the employee and the employee’s immediate family (parent, spouse, and/or dependent child). The Employer may request verification of such leave.
The Employer shall not discipline, discharge, or discriminate against any employee because of national origin or immigration status, or because the employee is subject to immigration or deportation proceedings, except as required to comply with the law. An employee subject to immigration or deportation proceedings shall not be discharged solely because of pending immigration or deportation proceedings, so long as the employee is authorized to work in the United States.
In the event that an employee has a problem with their right to work in the United States, after completing their introductory or probationary period, the Employer shall notify the Union in writing, and upon the Union’s request, agrees to meet with the Union to discuss the nature of the problem to see if a resolution can be reached. Whenever possible, this meeting shall take place before any action by the Employer is taken.
In the event that an employee does not provide adequate proof that the employee is authorized to work in the U.S. following their probationary or introductory period, and their employment is terminated for this
15
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
reason, the Employer agrees to immediately reinstate the employee to the former position if available, upon the employee providing proper work authorization within 12 months from the date of termination.
If the employee needs additional time, the Employer will rehire the employee into the next available opening in the employee’s former classification, as a new hire without seniority, upon the employee providing proper work authorization within a maximum of 12 additional months. The Parties agree that such employees would be subject to a probationary period in this event.
The provisions in Article 8 on pro-rated vacations for terminated employees shall not apply to employees covered by this section.
3.9	Limited-English Proficient Workers. English is the language of the workplace. The Employer recognizes the right of employees to use the language of their choice when speaking amongst themselves during work hours provided that such conversations are conducted in a manner that is respectful of residents, patients, families, and other employees and is consistent with quality care.
Upon request of the employee, the Employer will allow the presence of another member of its staff, where such staff is available, to act as an interpreter for employees not fluent in English during any investigation interview that may lead to discipline or discharge. Where the Employer is unable to so provide an interpreter, the Union may provide an interpreter.
3.10	Change of Status/Immigration. On the day an employee becomes a U.S. citizen, the Employer will compensate the employee with a one (1) time paid personal day off, in recognition of the employee’s citizenship.

This includes, but is not limited to, the right to hire, transfer, promote, reclassify, layoff, reduce hours, set and administer work performance and disciplinary standards, establish new policies, implement new technology, staff facilities in accordance with state law and the CBA and discharge employees, subject to the conditions as set forth in this CBA.
16
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
The foregoing statements of rights of Management and of the Employer functions are all-inclusive and shall not be construed in any way to exclude other functions not specifically enumerated, except when such rights are specifically abridged or modified by this Agreement.
4.2	Impact Bargaining. The Employer will provide the Union with advance notice of planned changes, where such changes may impact bargaining unit employee wages or hours. The Union reserves the right under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to bargain over the impacts to bargaining unit employees of the proposed change. To expedite the impact bargaining process, the Parties agree to the following principles:
1.	Impact bargaining is limited to mandatory subjects, as defined by the NLRA, such as wage rates.
2.	Impact bargaining may only be initiated by SEIU Local 503 or the Avamere President of the Nursing Home Division (or the President’s representative). Individual Union or Employer staff cannot unilaterally request impact bargaining.
3.	Impact bargaining shall not continue past fifteen (15) calendar days from the first meeting, except by mutual agreement of the Parties.
4.	The Parties are required to bargain in good faith. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days from the start of impact bargaining, then the Employer may unilaterally implement the proposed change. ‘Good faith’ bargaining is defined by the NLRA, which requires the Parties to share information, meet to discuss the issue and work towards common sense solutions.
5.	In the extremely unlikely event that either the Union or the Employer engages in ‘bad faith’ bargaining, then either Party may raise the issue with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). This process is defined in law by the NLRA and the policies of the NLRB.
4.3	No Waiver. The Employer’s failure to exercise any function or responsibility hereby reserved to it, or its exercising any function or right in a particular way, shall not be deemed a waiver of its responsibility to exercise such function or responsibility, nor preclude the Employer from exercising the same in some way not in conflict with this Agreement.
4.4	Employer Handbook. The terms and conditions of employment set forth in the prevailing Employer’s Employee Handbook shall govern the employment of employees covered by this Agreement when such Handbook’s policies do not directly conflict with any express provision of this Agreement. It is understood that
17
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
the Agreement’s provisions shall govern in the event of any conflict. Following ratification of this Agreement, the Employer will provide the Union with a copy of any subsequent change to the Employee Handbook and the Union shall have the right to grieve any such change that directly conflicts with an express provision of this Agreement. The Employer shall continue to update the Union with changes to the Employee Handbook. The Union reserves the right to grieve any new policies, which in the Union’s view, conflicts with the CBA. The Union must file a grievance within 30 days of the Union receiving written or electronic notice of the changes.
4.5	Supervision and Work Assignments. Employees shall work as directed by supervisory personnel. The Employer reserves the right to establish the number of employees and the work methods necessary to perform any activity, in compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement and State and Federal law.

5.1	Professional Courtesy and Behavior. The Employer and the Union agree to encourage everyone, regardless of position or profession, to perform in an efficient, courteous, and dignified manner when such individuals interact with fellow employees, facility residents, and visitors. The Employer and the Union agree that all facility employees, managers, and Union representatives will treat each other with dignity, respect, and courtesy. For the purpose of typical labor relations (such as disciplines, the grievance process, LMCs etc.) neither Party shall circulate, or cause to be circulated, any charge or report that is designed to bring another Party into public disrepute or otherwise adversely affecting the integrity, credibility or reputation of such Party. This clause does not require the Union or the Employer to monitor social media posts of bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit staff.
5.2	Bullying. The Employer and the Union agree that behaviors that harm, intimidate or coerce vulnerable individuals can contribute to a hostile work environment. Examples of such behavior include, but are not limited to:

18
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
The Parties agree that such behaviors cannot be allowed in the workplace. The Parties further acknowledge that routine efforts to manage employee performance, conduct performance reviews and administer Corrective Action (Disciplinary Action) do not constitute prohibited behaviors. Neither the Employer’s rights nor the Union’s rights in this CBA or under law shall be abridged by this contract provision.
5.3	Union Representatives Access. The Union will furnish the name of the Union representatives to the Employer. Union representatives shall have access to the facility for the purposes of conferring with the Employer, Union Stewards, and/or bargaining unit members, and for the purpose of administering this Agreement. The Union shall provide 24 hours advanced notice of access via email to the facility Administrator prior to entry to the building. The Administrator may deny access in an emailed response, in the event Union representatives do not provide advanced written notice more than 24 hours prior to entry or under extreme circumstances such as state survey, or contagious illness in the facility. If the Administrator does not provide a written response, the Union representative will not be prohibited from accessing the facility. If the facility visit is in relation to filing of an employee’s grievance or the investigation of a potential grievance, the Union representative shall have immediate access to the Employer’s premises. Upon entering the facility, the Union representative shall notify the Administrator, or his/her designee, of the representative’s presence in the facility.

2.	Allow the Union to furnish a binder to be kept in the break room for the purpose of storing materials such as membership forms, copies of the contract, Union contact information, and other Union materials.
3.	Additionally, as space permits, allow the Union to furnish a secure deposit box and/or a shelf, installed by the Employer on the wall of the break room for the purpose of keeping internal Union information including, but not limited to, Union election nomination forms and ballots, grievance forms, membership surveys, etc.

The Union Stewards’ performance of Union work shall not interfere with the operation of the facility nor the performance of an employees’ job duties. A Union Steward shall receive their base rate of pay for time spent processing grievances and representing Bargaining Unit Employees in meetings with the Employer during Stewards’ scheduled hours of employment. A Union Steward shall also receive their base rate of pay for time spent representing Bargaining Unit employees in all meetings where the Employer requested that the Steward process a grievance or represent a Bargaining Unit Employee outside of the Stewards’ scheduled hours of employment. In no case shall the Employer be required to pay more than one (1) Steward at a time for such work. A Union Steward may communicate with Union Representatives while on work time, in private if requested, not to exceed ten (10) minutes per shift. Such communication shall not interfere with resident care. If Bargaining Unit Employees request time off to attend Steward training, the Employer will make every reasonable effort to approve such requests in consideration of operational needs. Bargaining Unit Employees requesting time off to attend Steward training will make every reasonable effort to comply with Employer’s policy for requesting time off.
5.6	New Union Member Orientation. Each month, the Employer will provide the Union Stewards in each facility with the names of all employees newly hired into bargaining unit job classifications. The Employer shall provide thirty (30) minutes of paid time for both a Union Steward and the new employees to conduct a New Union Employee Orientation (NUEO). The NUEO shall occur is an Employer-provided room. If Union access is restricted on the day of the orientation (as during viral outbreaks or state surveys), then the Employer shall make the Union Steward and new employees available to meet virtually. The Union is responsible for setting up virtual services, such as a virtual conference line meeting. Such Union Orientations will be mandatory for all Bargaining Unit Employees within their first month of hire.
5.7	Daily Stipend for Joint Lobby Days. The Employer will designate two (2) days per calendar year to grant leave time for employees participating in lobby days approved by the Labor-Management Coalition for Quality Care or Avamere. The Union and the Employer may, upon mutual agreement, establish additional days. The Employer will make every reasonable effort to release employees, as designated by the Union for lobby days, considering operational needs. Additionally, the Employer agrees to pay up to two (2) bargaining
20
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
unit employees per facility a fifty dollar ($50) daily stipend when such employee(s) incurs lost wages for time spent in conjunction with such approved lobby days. The stipend will be paid in the qualified employee’s regular paycheck subject to all payroll rules. The Employer can alternatively select more than two (2) employees per facility if operational needs allow and the total number of employees participating companywide does not exceed the overall total of up to two (2) employees per facility. The Union will identify and select the employees eligible for the stipend within the framework above and verify such employee’s lobby day participation at the approved event.
5.8	Volunteer Union Activities. For employee activity under this Article, including collective bargaining with the Employer, that does not fall under paid time, employees will be able to utilize earned paid time off.

The employee’s supervisor will review the employee’s performance in an effort to identify the skills and behaviors to be improved so that the employee can successfully continue employment beyond the probationary period. The supervisor will confer with the relevant employee Preceptor and/or trainer for input into the probationary employee’s performance assessment.

ARTICLE 7	- TEMPORARY BARGAINING UNIT EMPLOYEES
7.1	Temporary Bargaining Unit Employees. Temporary Bargaining Unit Employees may be hired where the Employer reasonably perceives at the time of the hiring that the work will be of a temporary nature, to meet minimum staffing levels, to replace Bargaining Unit Employees on vacation or leave of absence, to avoid the use of an external employment agency or to address an emergent staffing need within a facility. In the event that the Employer employs temporary Bargaining Unit Employees to address staffing needs, the Employer will immediately notify the Union.
7.2	Length of Service. Temporary Bargaining Unit Employees may be hired for up to four hundred and eighty (480) hours or twelve (12) weeks, whichever is less. Any Temporary Bargaining Unit Employee working consistently at any single facility for four hundred and eighty (480) hours or twelve (12) weeks will become a regular Bargaining Unit Employee. The Union should be notified when temporary Bargaining Unit Employees are hired. If a temporary Bargaining Unit Employee is hired to replace an employee on leave of absence, the four hundred and eighty (480) hours or 12 weeks may be extended for the length of the approved leave of absence. Non-paid volunteers and non-paid interns earning school credits shall not be considered Bargaining Unit Employees, temporary or otherwise, and are not subject to this Agreement.
7.3	Union Representation. Temporary Bargaining Unit Employees shall not be covered by any of the terms of this Agreement and shall be treated for all purposes as outside of the Bargaining Unit and as unrepresented Bargaining Unit Employees. If a temporary employee is hired into a permanent position, their seniority shall be retroactive to their date of hire as a temporary employee.
7.4	Permanent Bargaining Unit Employee Return Rights. If a permanent Bargaining Unit Employee fills a temporary position, the employee will continue to be covered by the terms of this agreement. The employee may return to the prior position when the temporary position ends if the prior position is available.

2.	The union may request a meeting for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating said Layoff and discussion of the procedures to be followed. Any such meeting shall be held within fifteen (15) days of the notice of Layoff.
3.	Probationary and temporary Bargaining Unit Employees within the affected job classification shall be laid off first without regard to their individual periods of employment. Non-probationary Bargaining Unit Employees shall be laid off next in reverse order of their seniority.

If there are no volunteers, and the Employer is going to cancel a full shift or reduce hours, it will cancel shifts or reduce hours in rotating seniority order, starting the rotation with the least senior employee working the shift and progressing to the most senior employee on that shift. If a Bargaining Unit Employee will lose fifteen (15) hours in a calendar month, the Employer agrees to meet and confer with the Union regarding the impact of continuing reduced hours.
4.	A Reduction in Hours shall not be considered a Layoff as defined in Section 8.3, Layoff.
5.	Bargaining Unit Employees who volunteer to reduce their hours or who have had their hours reduced

1.	The Employer may fill extra shifts that become known to the Employer by posting a list of open shifts with space for Bargaining Unit Employees to sign up for those shifts. If more than one Bargaining Unit Employee signs up for the same shift, then that shift will be assigned to the competing Bargaining Unit Employee in rotating Seniority order.
2.	If a Bargaining Unit Employee is at work and the extra shift is within the Employee’s classification, the Employee will be asked.
3.	Bargaining Unit Employee volunteers will be asked beginning with the most senior qualified employee, including those that may not currently be at work, but are available and qualified to perform the work.
4.	If the Bargaining Unit Employee works all regular scheduled shifts for the pay period, they will receive an “extra voluntary shift premium” of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50) added to their base rate of pay for all actual hours worked from one (1) hour up to eight (8) hours during the extra shift(s) for that pay period.

6.	If the Employer is unable to fill open shifts after the above steps have been followed, a Bargaining Unit Employee may be required to work an additional four (4) hours and no more than four (4) hours. This will be done in rotating seniority order beginning with the least Senior Bargaining Unit Employee on shift, then moving through Bargaining Unit Employees on shift, then moving to Bargaining Unit Employees off-shift (also in reverse Seniority order) and will also be considered an extra premium shift. Bargaining Unit Employees that are required to work shall receive the extra shift premium of five dollars and fifty cents ($5.50) per hour added to their base rate of pay for actual hours worked up to four (4) hours. In determining required shifts, Management will consider issues of hardship; including, but not limited to childcare needs, school schedules, etc. Bargaining Unit Employees who are required to work extra hours as outlined in this section will be notified of the required extra hours no less than two (2) hours before the end of their scheduled shift, except in extreme circumstances. Bargaining Unit Employees, who are working as a result of volunteering to cover an open shift or mandated to cover an open shift (or hours), may not be required to work to cover further open shifts (or hours) in the pay period.

ARTICLE 18	- EMPLOYEE RIGHTS AND JUST CAUSE CORRECTIVE ACTION
18.1	The Right to Organize. Avamere employees have the right to participate in or decline to participate in union activities as defined by applicable law. Neither the Union nor the Employer will coerce, intimidate, discriminate or retaliate against any Employee for participation or declination to participate in union activities. If Either the Union or the Employer believes an employee, the Union or the Employer to be in breach of this Article, then senior Union and Employer representatives shall meet to discuss the issue and possible resolutions, before discipline is issued to any employee.
18.2	Just Cause. The Employer shall have the right to engage in Corrective Actions, which may include discharge (also referred to as termination) or discipline, with any Bargaining Unit Employee, when the Employer has found just cause for Corrective Action. Corrective Action shall be issued with the intent to improve the performance of the employee, to reduce or eliminate disruptive and inappropriate conduct to support the employee’s success and/or improve the work environment. Corrective Action cannot be issued in a discriminatory or retaliatory nature. The grounds for Corrective Action, including discharge from employment, are set forth in the Employer’s Employee Handbook and Policies. Those grounds listed are examples only and are not an exclusive list. The Union and Employer acknowledge the Employer’s right to have Corrective Action policies in its Employee Handbook so long as the Employer follows the principles of just cause. Offenses warranting immediate discharge shall include but not be limited to a single serious action or inaction that is misconduct towards a resident, or repeated action or inaction that is abuse or neglect. To decide if an action or inaction is serious, the Employer shall consider the following factors (no one factor is determinative, but all factors should be considered when deciding if the action or inaction was serious):
•	Was there physical or psychological injury to the resident?
•	Were immediate remedial steps taken by the Bargaining Unit Employee?
•	Was there recognition and contrition on behalf of the Bargaining Unit Employee?
•	Do the Bargaining Unit Employee’s actions show disregard for the resident?
•	Did failure to follow the care plan cause injury to the resident?
•	Was it reasonable to expect the Bargaining Unit Employee to know what should have been done?
A government finding of abuse or neglect is not required for a conclusion that the Bargaining Unit Employee’s action or inaction is defined as such. Notwithstanding any other language in this Agreement, any Bargaining Unit Employee terminated and who is later found responsible for abusing, neglecting or mistreating a resident in a final administrative action that is not under appeal or in a court of law shall be deemed to have been
41
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
terminated with just cause. Further, any Bargaining Unit Employee terminated because the Employer is legally required to do so shall be deemed to have been terminated for just cause.
18.3	Resident Information. Where a Bargaining Unit Employee Grievance involves direct resident information, the Employer’s failure to produce the affected resident as a witness in and of itself is not grounds to overturn a discharge, suspension or other Corrective Action issued for misconduct towards a resident, provided the Employer has other means of establishing evidence against the Employee.
18.4	Corrective Action Process. If a supervisor has reason to issue Corrective Action to a Bargaining Unit Employee, the supervisor shall make a reasonable effort to impose such Corrective Action in a timely manner that will not unduly embarrass the employee before other bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees, the residents, family members or the public. All employees are entitled to be treated with respect and dignity at all times. If any conversation may lead to Corrective Action, the employee shall be informed of such and shall be given the opportunity to have Union representation present during such conversation. Such conversation shall include the supervisor’s explanation of why the Bargaining Unit Employee is being investigated or issued Corrective Action. The supervisor may also elect to have a witness present during the conversation. In a situation involving suspension of a Bargaining Unit Employee, the supervisor will provide explanation to the Bargaining Unit Employee for why the suspension is being given before the suspension begins. If a suspension is given for the purpose of investigation and such investigation is unable to substantiate the allegation(s) then the Bargaining Unit Employee will be paid for the time spent on suspension. The Bargaining Unit Employee will receive that pay on the pay period following the suspension.
18.5	Principles of Progressive Discipline. Except for offenses so serious as to warrant immediate termination, the Employer will apply the principles of progressive discipline when issuing Corrective Action. The principles of progressive discipline shall be used except when the nature of the problem requires more serious immediate Corrective Action.
The Union acknowledges that the Employer has the legal right to issue documented verbal coaching and counseling. Coaching and counseling is not considered formal progressive discipline, but an opportunity for the Employer to educate bargaining-unit employees (including, but not limited to) policies, procedures and performance. As such, the Union is prohibited from filing a grievance for documented coaching and
42
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
counseling. The Employer shall automatically deny grievances filed against documented coaching and
counseling. Progressive discipline includes the following steps:
Corrective Action Steps
Step 1	Documented Written Warning
Step 2	Documented Written Warning #2
Step 3	Final Written Warning
Step 4	Termination of Employment
18.6	Discharge and Suspension Notification. The Employer will notify the Union in writing of any suspension or involuntary termination of employment of a Bargaining Unit Employee within forty-eight (48) hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the time of suspension or termination.
18.7	Grievances. Grievances about termination of employment will start at Step 2 of the grievance process.
18.8	Corrective Action in the Personnel File. All records of Corrective Action will be retained in the employee’s personnel file. Corrective Actions will be valid and active for a period of at least twelve (12) months, unless concluded earlier at the sole discretion of the employee’s immediate supervisor. A record of Corrective Action related to resident care shall be active for twenty-four (24) months after it was issued, except that if a Bargaining Unit Employee receives a related discipline during the twenty-four (24) month period, the original Corrective Action will active until twenty-four (24) months have elapsed during which the Bargaining Unit Employee received no related Corrective Actions. This provision shall not apply to Corrective Action issued for resident abuse, resident neglect, sexual or racial harassment, medication errors, or other behavior that violates state or federal law which will have no expiration date.
ARTICLE 19-	PERSONNEL RECORDS
19.1	Personnel Files. Personnel files are the Employer’s property. A Bargaining Unit Employee shall be permitted to examine all materials in their personnel file within three (3) working days of making such a request. The records may be reviewed in the presence of an Employer representative. The Bargaining Unit Employee may request in writing and will receive a copy of the personnel files within five (5) working days, upon written request. “Working days” shall mean non-weekend/holiday days.

DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
shall be placed in a Bargaining Unit Employee's personnel file unless the employee has had an opportunity to review, sign and receive a copy. Signing a Corrective Action form constitute acknowledgement of the document but does not necessarily represent agreement with the Corrective Action. Refusal to sign a Corrective Action does not invalidate the Corrective Action. An Employee has the right to attach a written statement to the Corrective Action expressing the employee’s own views. Such a statement will be included with the Corrective Action in the employee’s personnel file.
ARTICLE 20	- GRIEVANCE & ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
20.1	Intent. It is the desire of the Parties to resolve issues and conflicts informally and at the lowest level whenever possible. Employees have a right to Union Representation for any dispute arising out of the application of this Agreement. At every level of the grievance process the Employer will inform the employee of this right prior to meeting with the employee. The employee is responsible for obtaining a Union representation to attend any investigatory, disciplinary and grievance meetings. To the extent possible in a timely manner, the Employer shall honor the employee’s choice of representative.
20.2	Optional Informal Discussion. An employee is encouraged to discuss a workplace concern with their Department Head. The Open-Door Concept is for an employee and a Department Head to discuss workplace concerns together. The Open-Door Concept is an informal way of resolving problems early, preserving working relationships and promoting a productive work environment for all employees. To facilitate open communication and promptly resolve problems, employees are encouraged to bring any work-related questions or concerns to the attention of the Employer. The Employer welcomes such discussions because it allows the Employer to maintain a productive and harmonious atmosphere. Employees will not be subject to any adverse employment actions for raising good-faith concerns in a professional manner. Although any member of management may be contacted to discuss a problem or concern, the Employer recommends that employees try to resolve the situation first with their immediate supervisor, as that person is generally in the best position to evaluate the situation and provide an appropriate solution. If an employee is not satisfied with the supervisor’s decision, or the employee is uncomfortable discussing the issue with the immediate supervisor, the employee may go to the person that the immediate supervisor reports to. Concerns may be voiced verbally. The Employer will have fifteen (15) calendar days to provide a response for any issue raised through the Open-Door policy.
44
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
20.3	Grievance Defined. A grievance shall be defined as a claimed violation of a specific provision or provisions of this Agreement that is not expressly excluded from the grievance and arbitration procedure. Under this procedure, both the Union and the Employer have an ability to present a grievance to the other, although the below procedure is written from the perspective of the Union submitting a grievance to the Employer. An employee may be assisted or represented by a representative of the Union at any step in the grievance procedure.
20.4	Grievance Time Limits. A grievance must be filed in writing within thirty (30) calendar days of the event giving rise to the concern or the date the event became known or should have become known to the employee. Time limits set forth in the following may only be extended by mutual written agreement between the Employer and the Union. Grievances regarding employee compensation shall be deemed to have occurred at the time payment is made, or at the time when the payment was due but not made if that is the contention. Grievances over an employee’s eligibility for a benefit shall be deemed to have occurred at the time when such employee benefit eligibility decision was made by Employer. Failure of the Employer to comply with the time limits set forth in the grievance procedure shall allow the employee or Union to advance the grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure within the time frames specified herein. Time limits are important. Failure of an employee or the Union to file a grievance or a written grievance as defined in this Section in a timely basis, or to timely advance such a grievance, in accordance with the time limits set forth in the grievance procedure, will constitute a formal withdrawal of the grievance by the employee and the Union.
20.5	Step I - Grievance Presented in Writing to Administrator. Within thirty (30) calendar days after the employee knew or reasonably should have known of the cause of any grievance, an employee having a grievance, with the assistance of a Union representative, shall present a grievance in writing to the administrator. The written grievance shall contain all of the following pertinent information:
1.	the specific Article(s) of this Agreement alleged to have been violated;
2.	a brief factual description of how the specific language of the identified Section(s) has been violated;
3.	the date of each alleged violation of the identified Section(s);
4.	the remedy requested; and,
5.	the names of the grievant(s) and union representatives presenting the grievance.
The Union representative and the administrator shall arrange a mutually agreeable date to meet within fifteen (15) calendar days from the Administrator’s receipt of the grievance for the purpose of reviewing and, where
45
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
possible, attempting to settle the matter. The Administrator shall provide a written response to the written grievance within fifteen (15) calendar days following the grievance meeting. The written response will be provided to the employee and the union representative.
If the Union has requested information from the Employer to which it is legally entitled and the Employer has not provided a response to the information request at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the scheduled Step 1 grievance meeting, the Union shall have the option of postponing the hearing to a mutually agreeable date.
20.6 Step 2 - Grievance Appeal. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute at a Step 1, the Union may appeal the grievance to Step 2. The Union has fifteen (15) calendar days from receipt of the Step 1 response or lack of response to notify the Employer’s Director of Human Resources in writing (such as email) of the Union’s appeal of the grievance to a step 2.
Upon receipt of the written Step 2 grievance appeal, the Director of Human Resources shall coordinate a Step 2 grievance meeting. The Director of Human Resources, the Employer’s Designated Leadership representative and the Union shall meet within fifteen (15) calendar days to conduct the Step 2 grievance meeting. The Director of Human Resources and/or Designated Leader will provide a written response to the Union representative, within fifteen (15) calendar days following the date of such meeting.
If the Union has requested information from the Employer to which it is legally entitled and the Employer has not provided a response to the information request at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to the scheduled Step 2 grievance meeting, the Union shall have the option of postponing the hearing to a mutually agreeable date.
20.6 Optional Mediation. If a grievance is not resolved at Step 2, either Party may request, in writing, within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Step 2 response or lack of response, that the matter be referred to mediation. The mediation process shall not interfere with the scheduling of an arbitration. The requesting Party shall request a panel from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (hereinafter called the “FMCS”) or other mediation group agreed to by the Parties. The mediator shall be selected by alternate striking from the list until one name remains. The mediator shall have no authority to bind either Party to an
46
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
agreement.
20.	8 Step V - Arbitration. If a grievance is not resolved at step 2 and the Parties have not entered into Mediation, the Union may appeal the issue to arbitration by providing written notice to the Employer’s Director of Human Resources within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of receipt of the Employer’s response, or lack thereof, to the step 2 grievance. No alleged violation of the Agreement or claim for relief shall be submitted to arbitration unless it has been raised in a timely fashion, filed and submitted in accordance with the procedure identified in the preceding sections. After the union has notified the Employer of an appeal to arbitration, the Union will initiate the Arbitrator Selection Process.
1.	Arbitrator Selection Process. If the Employer and the Union have not mutually established a permanent panel of arbitrators, upon the timely submission of a demand for arbitration the moving Party must request a list within thirty (30) calendar days from the FMCS and notify the other Party of having done so. The FMCS shall provide the Parties with a list of nine (9) arbitrators, of which at least five (5) must have earned a Juris Doctor degree from the graduate program of a law school accredited by the American Bar Association. Within seven (7) calendar days after receiving the list, the Parties shall select the arbitrator by alternately striking names from the list. The last remaining name shall be the arbitrator. The Party proceeding first in the striking of names procedure shall be determined by coin toss.
2.	Arbitration Timelines. Once an arbitrator has been properly selected, an arbitration date must be set within sixty (60) calendar days of such selection, or at the earliest date upon all Parties are available. The Union and the Employer may, with mutual agreement, make procedural changes to the arbitration process given unique circumstances of individual cases. Prior to the arbitration hearing date, the Employer and the Union will develop a stipulation of facts and use affidavits and other time saving methods whenever possible. The arbitrator shall conduct the hearing in whatever manner will most expeditiously permit full presentation of the evidence and arguments of the Parties. Any arbitrator accepting an assignment under this Article agrees to issue an award within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the hearing or sixty (60) calendar days, if post-hearing briefs are submitted.
3.	Arbitrator Award and Cost. Any dispute as to arbitrability may be submitted and determined by the
47
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
arbitrator. The Arbitrator’s determination shall be final and binding. All decisions of the Arbitrator shall be limited to the terms and provisions of this Agreement and in no event may the terms and provisions of this Agreement be altered, amended, or modified by the Arbitrator. Unless otherwise provided in this Article, all costs, fees, and expenses of the Arbitration, including the cost of the Arbitrator, court reporter, hearing transcript (if requested by either Party or the arbitrator), and any hearing room, shall be borne by the Party whose position is not sustained by the Arbitrator. If, in the opinion of the Arbitrator, neither Party’s position is clearly sustained by the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator shall assess the foregoing costs to each Party on an equal basis. In all arbitrations, each Party shall pay its own attorney’s fees and the cost of the presentation of its respective case, including the cost of any expert witnesses.
4.	Grievance/Arbitration Timelines. Except as otherwise indicated, the time periods and limits provided herein shall be calculated as of the date of actual receipt. All notifications under this Article shall be sent via e-mail or certified mail or be delivered by in-hand service. Such time periods may be extended only by mutual written agreement of the Employer and the Union. In the absence of such agreement, the time limits shall be mandatory.
5.	The failure of the aggrieved employee(s) or Union to properly present a grievance in writing initially, to process a grievance in any of the steps in the grievance procedure thereafter and/or to submit the grievance to arbitration in accordance with the express time limits provided herein shall automatically constitute a waiver of the grievance and bar all further action thereon.
6.	The failure of the Employer to submit a response in any of the steps of the grievance procedure or to meet with the Union Representative within such time periods, shall not constitute acquiescence thereto or result in the sustaining of the grievance. The failure to so respond or meet shall be deemed a denial of the grievance as of the expiration date of the applicable adjustment period. Should the Union desire to pursue the grievance further, it may, within fifteen (15) calendar days of such expiration date, submit the grievance to the next step of the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure.
7.	Email communications shall be deemed to satisfy requirements that items be “in writing.” Email communications shall be deemed “submitted” or “delivered” as of the date-stamp on the recipient’s email. Parties are responsible for verification of the accuracy of email addresses when using email for
48
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
communications required to be in writing.
8.	The Parties agree that the arbitrator shall accept a written statement signed by a resident or patient in lieu of their sworn testimony. Both Parties shall have equal access to such written statements. The Parties agree that neither shall call a resident or patient as a witness and the arbitrator shall not consider the failure of the resident to appear as prejudicial.

This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire Agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior agreements, oral and written, and expresses all the obligations of, or restrictions imposed on, the respective Parties during its term. All individual agreements, both oral and written, which may exist between the Employer and any employee in the bargaining unit, shall terminate upon the execution of this Agreement. The Parties agree that this Agreement is the sole agreement concerning wages and benefits of covered employees.

Whenever exercising such discretion, Employer will notify Union in advance.
29.2	Matters Covered. All matters not covered in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been raised and properly disposed of. This Agreement contains the full and complete agreement between the Parties. The failure of either Party to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or any rights granted by law shall not be deemed a waiver of any provision or right, nor a waiver of the Party’s authority to exercise such right in some way not in conflict with the Agreement.
29.3	Amendment. This Agreement can be modified or amended only by written consent of all Parties. The waiver, in any instance, or any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof shall not constitute a waiver of such term or condition or any breach thereof in any other instance.

No employee shall suffer any reduction in individual hourly wage rate, total amount of paid time off, nor health insurance benefits, because of coverage under this Agreement unless such reduction is expressly addressed by this Agreement or by a written Amendment executed by the Parties herein. If the State of Oregon minimum wage rate increases, any employee being paid the minimum wage shall have their compensation increased accordingly. Individuals compensated more than the minimum wage will receive no adjustment to their compensation solely because of such minimum wage rate increase(s).

It is understood that the provisions of this Agreement relating to wages, hours and conditions of work are intended to establish minimum terms for the employment of employees subject to this Agreement. The Employer is free to establish terms above the minimums contained in the Agreement, at

APPENDIX D:	NEUTRALITY AND VOLUNTARY RECOGNITION PROCESS AGREEMENT
It is the intent of Avamere (the Employer) to take a positive approach to the unionization of its non-supervisory employees. To this end, the Parties agree to adopt the following procedure for determining employee representation issues in Oregon, entitled the Employee Free Choice Procedure (EFCP). Accordingly, the Employer and the Service Employees International Union Local 503 (the Union) hereby make the following promises and agreements:
1.	The Employer and Union recognize that national labor law guarantees employees the right to choose whether or not to be represented by a labor organization to act as their exclusive bargaining representative for purposes of collective bargaining, as well as the right to refrain from engaging in any or all such activities.
2.	The Employer agrees that it will not take any action or make any statement that, directly or indirectly, states or implies any opposition to its employees becoming members of the Union, and that it will not discriminate, interfere with, restrain, or coerce these employees regarding membership in the Union or participation in activities on behalf of the Union.
3.	The Employer agrees not to discipline, discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee due to the fact that such employee joined or engaged in lawful activity in support of SEIU or the Employee Free Choice Procedure. The Union will not coerce or threaten Avamere employees in an effort to obtain authorization cards.
4.	SEIU shall not engage in disparaging campaigns, strikes or other economic action, including picketing, leafleting, sticker or button campaigns in conjunction with its organizing efforts under this procedure so long as the Employer complies with its obligations under this agreement.
5.	The Employee Free Choice Process shall begin when the Union notifies to the Employer of its intent to organize employees. The bargaining units that the union may attempt to organize are listed in Exhibit A. The Parties may modify Exhibit A by mutual agreement. The group of employees who comprise the bargaining unit shall include all eligible employees. Charge nurses, supervisory, and confidential employees shall be excluded. Within 14 calendar days of notification, the Parties shall meet to discuss any concerns
66
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
and define the scope of the bargaining unit.
6.	The Employer will grant the Union reasonable access to its premises and its employees, provided there is no interference with the conduct of the Employer's business or with the performance of work by the employees during their working hours. Such access shall include the right to post notices on Employer bulletin boards and in employee mailboxes. In addition, at the Parties' discretion, there may be a joint meeting with employees, representatives of the Union, and the Employer at which the Employer will inform employees that it has no objection to employees exercising their right to join or not join a union and there will be no punishment or retaliation against employees who choose to do so. SEIU will also meet with employees during non-work time in non-worksite areas to discuss unionization.
7.	Upon the Union's request, the Employer will provide the Union with a list of names, dates of hire, addresses, home and cellular telephone numbers (if available), email address (if available), classifications and work locations of employees employed in its present or future facilities within classifications that the Union seeks to represent. The Employer will notify employees of the union’s request for information and will honor any individual employee’s request to be excluded from the lists provided to the union. All information provided to the Union shall be used only for purpose of the Employee Free Choice Procedure.
8.	The Union may solicit authorization cards from employees, at SEIU’s expense, through various methods, including meetings and visits to the employees; provided that no such solicitations shall take place during working time and Union representatives shall not approach employees while they are on duty when those employees are performing job related functions. The Union will not coerce or threaten any employee in an effort to obtain authorization cards.
9.	The Employer agrees to voluntarily recognize the Union upon a showing of majority status, defined as 51%, in the designated unit. Proof of majority status shall be based on signed authorization cards or petitions verified, by a mutually agreeable third Party. Such third Party also will be empowered to resolve any disputes that may arise concerning the signed cards.
10.	The Parties will make a good faith effort to bargain contracts in all affected facilities in an efficient and peaceful manner. In the event that a dispute arises concerning contract bargaining, the Parties agree to
67
DocuSign Envelope ID: BD7CC918-CE3B-4009-B289-795D520589D7
arrange a meeting between the CEO of the Employer and the Executive Director of SEIU to attempt to resolve problems in a manner that will avoid contract terminations, unilateral contract implementations, or strikes.
11.	If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement on a first contract for a newly organized worksite/unit after 150 calendar days, then the Union may engage in lawful protected public activity, such as informational pickets, excluding a strike. The 150 calendar day period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Parties.
12.	The Employer agrees that the above provisions shall be made equally applicable to any entities under its direction or control, and to all successors or assigns. The Employer further agrees to take all steps necessary to ensure such applicability and to enforce such terms against any such entity, successor or assign in the event of default.
13.	In the event that the Employer or the Union fails to comply with any of the obligations set forth above, the Parties agree to submit the matter for expedited; binding resolution by an impartial arbitrator selected pursuant the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The Arbitrator shall have authority to enter an award for full remedial relief including attorneys' fees and arbitration costs.
As of May 1st, 2021, the Parties agree that the following worksites will be eligible to participate in the Neutrality and Voluntary Recognition Process as defined in Appendix D:
•	Keizer Campus Operations, LLC.

APPENDIX F:	Letter of Agreement - Interest Based Bargaining & Contract Finalization
The Parties recognize the unprecedented amount of time, energy, and work that both Parties invested in 2021 successor contract negotiations. The Parties reached agreements on broad principles via consensus through a modified Interest Based Bargaining (IBB) process and individual workgroups. To this end, the Parties have until July 1st, 2021 to incorporate the agreements made through IBB into the actual contract language. The timeline may be extended by mutual agreement. The broad principles that were agreed to via IBB are listed below. While this list is meant to be comprehensive, it is likely that there are additional agreements that the Parties made but were not captured in the IBB bargaining notes (especially workgroups). Neither Party is restricted to bringing up items through this process that either side believes there is agreement on:
IBB Potential Solutions List

-	On-call minimum work obligations, (i.e., at least two shifts per month).
-	If an on-call person does not work for 90 calendar days, on-call folks are terminated per Avamere policy.
-	Standardization of terminology (i.e., the term per diem should be eliminated. On-call is sufficient).
•	Mandation and call-outs tracking and reports.
•	Limitations on repeated mandation for the same bargaining unit employee.
•	CMA staffing ratio, a housekeeping ratio based upon a number of factors, admissions count towards CNA staffing ratios,
