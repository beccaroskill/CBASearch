hazards therein. He shall also be in charge of any decontamination of personnel, their tools, materials or equipment. The Radiation Monitor(s) shall make reports to the supervising electrician on the job for safety and coordination purposes.
SUBSTANCE ABUSE
SECTION 13.4 The dangers and costs that alcohol and other chemical abuses can create in the electrical contracting industry in terms of safety and productivity are significant. The parties to this Agreement resolve to combat chemical abuse in any form and agree that, to be effective, programs to eliminate substance abuse and impairment should contain a strong rehabilitation component. The local parties recognize that the implementation of a drug and alcohol policy and program must be subject to all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Such polices and programs must also be administered in accordance with acceptable scientific principles, and must incorporate procedural safeguards to ensure fairness in application and protection of legitimate interests of privacy and confidentiality. To provide a drug-free workforce for the Electrical Construction Industry, each IBEW Local Union and NECA chapter shall implement an area-wide Substance Abuse Testing Policy. The policy shall include minimum standards as required by the IBEW and NECA. Should any of the required minimum standards fail to comply with federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations, they shall be modified by the Local Union and Chapter to meet the requirements of those laws and regulations.
SEPARABILITY CLAUSE
SECTION 13.5 Should any provision of this Agreement be declared illegal by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provisions shall immediately become null and void, leaving the remainder of the Agreement in full force and effect and the parties shall, thereupon, seek to negotiate substitute provisions which are in conformity with the applicable laws.
CONTINUING EDUCATION
SECTION 13.7 Eight (8) hours of continuing education, in the electrical industry, will be required of all Journeyman Wireman each year. Any course or program covering safety, code, CPR, first aid technical training, management or foreman training, or industry relations training offered by the Local Union, NECA, the JATC, LMCC, or any contractor or outside source approved by the Chapter or the Local Union will qualify. This program will be developed under the guidance of the Mobius Action Group responsible for education and training, and will follow all guidelines of Title 29, part 785, section 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to mandatory continuing education.
SPECIAL SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS
SECTION 13.8 In order to qualify for dispatch, an applicant must be in compliance with the Orange County NECA - IBEW Substance Free Workforce Program and in compliance with the California Electrician Certification statute.
It is understood that QSP (Quality Safety Person) training is considered a “special skill” for referral purposes.
CODE OF EXCELLENCE
SECTION 13.9 The parties to this agreement recognize that to meet the needs of our customers, both employer and employee must meet the highest levels of performance, professionalism, and productivity. The Code of Excellence has proven to be a vital element in meeting the customers’ expectations. Therefore each IBEW local union and NECA chapter shall implement a Code of Excellence Program. The program shall include minimum standards as required by the IBEW and NECA.
