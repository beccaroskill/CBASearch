delinquency, then the Union may strike the Employer, in addition the Union shall not dispatch workmen to that Employer, and the Union shall notify all prime contractors employing the identified delinquent Employer. If the Employer makes satisfactory arrangements with the Administrator to satisfy the debt, which arrangement may include the posting of a bond or other security, the making of weekly contributions, or any combination of the above, then the Administrator may advise the Union that work persons may be dispatched to the Employer. If the Employer contests the amount of contributions due and owing, the Employer may request an audit by the trust auditors, which would proceed as soon as possible. If the Employer is found to be delinquent then the Employer shall pay the total cost of the audit. The Employer will cooperate fully in the audit and during the audit no work persons shall be dispatched to the job.
Section 13.	Dues Check-off
The Employers agree to deduct from the wages of each employee a percentage of the employee’s gross weekly earnings as approved by the Alaska Regional Council of Carpenters, provided the employee has executed a written assignment calling for such deduction. If an Employer transfers an employee to a subsidiary and/or sister company, or if an employee is transferred by the Employer, it is agreed that for purposes of Union dues and/or assessments, the employee need not execute a new written assignment calling for such deduction. Consequently, the deductions will continue without interruption and will be forwarded to the Union by the Employer who is then paying the employee. Such deductions shall be transmitted to the Union monthly on a day determined by the Trust. The Union shall supply appropriate transmittal forms to each Employer.
The above deductions shall be made by the Employers so long as such payments are deemed in compliance with applicable law, and the Union agrees to indemnify the Employer for any litigation costs, expenses, or liabilities which an Employer may incur from compliance with this provision.
Section 14.	Davis-Bacon Projects
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in the event an individual Employer bids on a public project being awarded by a federal, state, borough, city or other public entity which is to be performed at a predetermined and/or prevailing wage rate established pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act (Public Law 74-403 (8/30/35) as amended 3/23/41 and 7/2/64) 40 USC 276A-276A7 as amended) or established pursuant to the provisions of Title 36 Alaska Statutes, or any other prevailing wage, the published hourly wage and fringe rate (if any) set forth in said public award shall apply for the period determined under the aforementioned laws.

ARTICLE TWENTY DIVING SECTION
Section 1.	Territory
This Agreement shall cover the work more specifically defined herein as within diving classifications and located within the area of the jurisdiction of the Piledrivers, Bridge, Dock Builders and Divers Local Union No. 2520. This area shall include the entire State of Alaska, including all offshore waters and waters of the Continental shelf seaward of the boundaries of the State of Alaska. It will also include all inland waters, rivers, and lakes, natural and/or man-made, within the boundaries of the State of Alaska.
It is understood further that by the above listing, the jurisdiction of the Union over diving work is not thereby limited to that area. The Union claims jurisdiction over diving in certain areas beyond that covered by this Agreement i.e., oceanographic and/or research vessels, seismographic and/or other vessels either temporarily or permanently based and operated out of ports in the State of Alaska, engaged in petroleum research, offshore mining, fisheries research, and all other types of oceanographic and marine research and/or experimental work requiring the use of divers. This also pertains to any sort of bell diving using deck decompression chambers with submersible diving chambers.
Section 2.	Work Claimed
The following work is claimed by the Union: submarine diving in all its branches and phases, such as the salvaging of all ships, vessels and barges, etc.; the underwater repair, removing, dismantling, demolition, burning and welding in all marine salvage operations; all underwater construction and reconstruction, and the salvage of and removing of underwater structures; underwater inspections and repairs of hulls, docks, bridges, and dams, underwater pipelines, sewage and water systems, underwater suction and discharge lines such as those used at chemical plants, pulp mills, and desalination plants; inspecting, surveying, removing, rescuing and recovering of all objects below water surface; all underwater work necessary on offshore oil platforms, permanent or temporary, including all floating drill rigs and jack-up platforms; all underwater well completions; all underwater work on pipelines and hookups including petroleum, gas, water and sewage systems; the laying of underwater power or communication cables; marine mining and dredging operations using divers in any phase of their work seeking minerals and/or precious metals, etc.; all petroleum, fisheries, oceanographic, research and experimental work where the use of divers is necessary; all underwater demolition and blasting work requiring the use of divers; the operation of remotely operated vehicles, single atmosphere diving suits, one atmosphere bells and self-propelled manned submersibles.

Section 3.	Diving Crews
a.	A diving crew shall consist of not less than three workers, Diver. Tender and Assistant Tender, when working at a depth of 30 feet or less and in water where there is no strong current. When working in strong currents or at a depth greater than 30 feet the Diving crew shall consist of not less than four workers, Diver, Tender and Standby Diver and Tender.
The Diver shall be considered as working in a strong current if at any time during the dive, the current prevents the Diver from moving freely or forces the Diver to hang on, or tie himself to any object to complete the work. The Diver in charge and Employer shall man the job with such additional divers and tenders and equipment as may be required to assure the safety of the working diver.
If the job is of such nature, an Assistant Tender shall be employed when deemed necessary by the Employer, the Diver and Union Representative. Workers from other crafts will not aid the diving crew in place of an Assistant Tender. The use of an Assistant Tender may be omitted, when it is mutually agreed between the Employer, Union, and the Diver involved. The Standby Diver shall be completely dressed in prior to dive but may take off helmet and weigh belt only.
When working on structures, pipelines or exploratory rigs in Cook Inlet, the diving crew shall consist of no less than six workers, two divers, two tenders and two assistant tenders. Work on vessels and docks in Cook Inlet may be an exception, with a four person crew being allowed upon mutual agreement of the Diver and Employer.
b.	Assistant Tenders: When Assistant Tenders are with divers and tenders, they must at all times be with the Diver and Tender when the Diver is in the water, dressing, undressing, or decompressing; during which time, they shall be under the sole direction of the Diver and their Tender.
c.	An exception to paragraph (b): When divers are engaged in construction or maintenance work where there is a crew of Piledrivers Riggers working, the Assistant Tenders may, at the discretion of the Employer, be taken from the regular Piledriver rigging crew and assigned to the divers and tenders for a period of time that divers are on the job. However, the person assigned in this case as Assistant Tender must meet the approval of the divers and must be taken only from the Piledrivers Rigging Crew, and be qualified as Assistant Tenders. When Piledriver riggers are taken from a rigging crew to act as Assistant Tenders, it is understood and agreed that they are relieved of their duties with the rigging crew until such time as the divers have completed their required work.
During this time, Assistant Tenders will not operate air tuggers or perform any rigging or other work that takes them away from their immediate duties of

No worker shall return to a straight time pay basis under these circumstances until they have had eight (8) consecutive hours off.
b.	A Tender shall not tend more than one Diver simultaneously, except in emergency.
c.	The Diver's Tender must remain on the job during the entire decompression period.
d.	No member of a diving crew shall be permitted to receive compensation on a piece work basis.
