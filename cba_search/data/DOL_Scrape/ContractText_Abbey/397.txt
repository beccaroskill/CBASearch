Article 12

Work in excess of the hours of the changed tour shall not be used to modify the employee's then scheduled week.
13.7.2	An employee’s formally scheduled work hours may be changed on personal request with approval of the supervisor. Approval will be contingent upon consideration of work load, requirements of telephone service, requirements of law and the provisions of this Agreement.

It is presumed that an employee will automatically be considered qualified if they previously held the job unless a substantial technological change has occurred. This process may only be utilized in accordance with Section 17.4.5 from the employee’s layoff date. If the employee refuses to return to work when offered a job through the self-nomination process, the employee shall be terminated and the Company is under no obligation to offer any other position.

17.5.4	No termination allowance shall be due to an employee in any case where termination is the result of (a) voluntary or involuntary retirement on pension or (b) death, or (c) termination for transfer between companies, or (d) resignation or quit by the employee, or (e) dismissed for cause, or (f) as a result of any sale or other disposition by the Company of the exchange at which the employee is working or at which he/she is assigned to work out of, when the employee concerned is continued in the employment of the Company or of the new management of the exchange.
17.5.5	No termination allowance shall be due any eligible employee who fails or refuses to accept transfer within the same exchange area, or to any other area within the Company without good cause demonstrated.

28.4.3	If an employee is changed to another job on a lower wage schedule, the employee's rate is to be adjusted to the rate on the lower wage schedule that is the same as or immediately below the employee's current rate.

return to his/her former classification, the employee may do so provided an appropriate vacancy exists. If the employee is able to return to the former classification within six months of being reclassified, the employee will be placed in the former job at the same wage step from which the employee left, maintaining the original progression date. If more than six months have elapsed since reclassification, the employee will be eligible to return through normal Self-Nom procedure and, if awarded the job, will be given wage credit in accordance with Company policy.

Upon adoption of a proper schedule by mutual agreement, affected employees' rates of pay will be revised upwards or downwards as required at a time and in a manner mutually agreed upon.

BUSINESS ATTIRE
Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and Communications Workers of America (hereinafter “CWA” or “Union”) recognize the necessity to enhance and promote a professional businesslike image in the highly competitive telecommunications workplace. Therefore, standard business attire may be required of employees who perform installation and repair work, including customer premise work, associated with Fiber to the Premise (FTTP).
Other employees in job classifications with face-to-face customer contact may be offered to participate in this program on a voluntary basis at any time. Additional employees in job classifications who may be required to wear Business Attire under this program may be included by mutual agreement.
The Business Attire Program includes the following features:
•	An annual allowance toward the purchase of Business Attire for the employee of up to $240 the first year and up to $180 per year thereafter.
•	An approved catalog (hard copy or on-line) will be made available for the purchase of Business Attire.
•	Purchases in excess of the allowances identified above will be borne by the employee.
•	Additional Business Attire items may be purchased from the catalog at the employee’s expense.

•	Baseball-style Verizon caps or other approved head wear must be worn if employees desire to wear a hat at work (except for required hard hats).

68
costs of any changes are not borne by the employee. These modifications could include, but are not limited to, change from annual stipend to company provided or rental, vendors and catalog options. The provisions of the MOA have been entered into in good faith and it is not the Company’s intent to arbitrarily modify or eliminate any features of the plan during the term of this agreement. The Company will discuss any modifications to this Program or change of vendor with the Union prior to implementation. These discussions will be designed to provide the rationale and receive input from the union of the modifications being contemplated.
•	It is further expected that all employees will exercise good judgment and common sense in projecting the proper professional image appropriate for their assignment and be neat, clean and well groomed.
This Memorandum of Agreement will become effective January 30, 2005. The Company may terminate this MOA with 30 days notice to the Union should it decide to no longer require business attire to be worn by employees assigned to FTTP.

3.	ELIGIBILITY

4.	INCENTIVE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE
The Compensation Plan is a combination base wage plus compensation, with compensation paid on individual monthly sales results.
A.	Minimum Quality Attainment
A minimum attainment level on the quality objective must be met before compensation payout occurs on any of the objectives.
B.	Compensation Payout
Compensation is based on:
•	Points Per Call
•	Gross Sales
74
Efficiency - Average Handling Time (AHT)
Compensation payouts are based on actual attainment on each objective at the end of each month.
The monthly objectives are assigned by management. Specific percentage attainment payout for each measure/category is determined by management.
Note: Minimum attainment level on the quality objective must be met before the employee is eligible for compensation.
C.	Frequency of Payments
Compensation is to be paid on a monthly basis. Compensation payments earned during a month will be paid within two (2) months following the month in which the compensations were earned.
5.	PROGRAM TRACKING
Results will be accumulated from the first day worked in the year to the last day worked in the year.
Additions and deletions of products and services will be handled in accordance with current Customer Sales procedures/policies. Reasonable advance notice will be provided to employees whenever additions or deletions of products or services are made. The Company reserves the right to establish and revise the procedures/policies in accordance with business needs.
The Company agrees to meet with the Union at periodic intervals (6 months or longer) to review and provide a status report on the Plan(s). It is understood that these meetings are not intended to be negotiation sessions, but rather information sharing sessions to provide a better understanding of how this new approach to compensation is working.
6.	ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
Management will have the sole and exclusive responsibility to establish and administer the Plan and reserves the exclusive right to adjust the product/service mix and/or associated objectives as required to ensure equitable treatment of all parties.
The Plan will be administered by an Administrative Committee comprised of representatives of Consumer Sales, Human Resources and Business Analysis. In addition, the Administrative Committee is empowered to interpret the Plan, to approve objectives, to approve awards and to interpret rules and regulations within the provisions of the Plan.
75
A.	New Participants
In the event that an individual becomes a participant in the Plan during the year, the employee will be eligible for all associated compensation earned.
B.	Modification
Consumer Sales may at any time modify, in whole or in part, the provisions of the Plan. Consumer Sales may at any time modify plan components, weightings, objectives, product line categories, qualifiers and thresholds as business needs may dictate. Any modification shall not affect sales compensation already earned under this Plan.
The annual/monthly payout associated with the Goal Attainment Percentage in the attached Payout Schedule will remain in effect for the duration of the contract.
C.	Retirement, Disability or Death
In the event that a participant retires, becomes disabled or dies during the Plan year, the participant or the designated beneficiary(ies) will receive an award earned up to the effective date of retirement, disability or death. Payment will be made to the individual or the participant’s designated beneficiary(ies) when awards are paid to other Plan participants.
D.	Statement of Acceptance
Each Plan participant will indicate acceptance of the conditions for participation by signing the ‘Statement of Acceptance’.

F.	Transfers/Promotions
In the event that a Plan participant is transferred or promoted to another position during the Plan year, the participant will be eligible to receive compensation based upon sales performance up to the date of such transfer or promotion. Such compensation shall be computed and paid when paid to other Plan participants.
76
G.	Windfalls
A windfall is an unusual situation resulting in a change of volume of sales from that anticipated by management in setting objectives and incentives. Management will review all incentive results that are more than 200% of objective prior to payment. Management may approve or adjust the payment based on the circumstances of reaching more than 200% of objective. The adjustment would in no way result in payment of less than 100% of objective. Management reserves the right to adjust any portion of the Plan to bring the compensation in line with what it determines to be reasonable objective attainment.
H.	Benefits
Generally speaking, compensation payments are typically included in the calculations of many Company benefits. Appendix A outlines those specific benefits which include or exclude compensation earnings.
I.	Grievance/Arbitration
The Incentive Compensation Plan shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
J.	Time Away From Work
The methodology for up-front objective adjustments include the following:
(1)	Calculate time away from job.
Available hours less:
•	Holidays
•	Personal/Floating Holidays
•	Training hours per employee
•	Vacation
•	Other time away from job
Other objective adjustments (which are not done up front) include the following:
(2)	Objective is adjusted and available dollars are adjusted for:
•	Sickness - five consecutive days or more
•	FMLA - five consecutive days or more
77
•	Union Business Unpaid - five (5) days or more in the entire month
•	Part-time - no minimum time off-line requirement

•	Other Company directed business (i.e. team leader/relief supervisor, in-house trainer, on-loan assignment) - minimum off line requirement determined by management
•	Vacation days - day by day
NOTE: For calculating the equivalent of five days, Union Business Paid and Union Business Unpaid can be combined.
K.	Suspension/Termination of Plan
The suspension or termination of this Incentive Compensation Plan must be by mutual agreement of the parties.
L.	Compensation - Adjustments
In the event an employee or the company believes an overpayment/underpayment has occurred, a Company representative and the employee or his/her union representative agree to meet to review relevant facts. If it is determined that an overpayment/underpayment has occurred, the Company will appropriately adjust future compensation payouts to address the situation. However, the Company will not require the employee to pay back any overpayment from his/her base salary. If the employee moves to a position that is not covered by a Consumer Sales incentive Plan, or is separated from the Company, he or she will not be liable for any repayment.
NOTE: If an employee’s sales compensation is paid based on inaccurate or fraudulent sales results, the employee will be required to repay the entire unearned compensation amount regardless of whether or not the employee is still a participant in a Consumer Sales Incentive Plan.

Wherever practical and consistent with the needs of the business, contingent employees shall be used in lieu of contractors for a designed period of time not to exceed twelve consecutive months with the following stipulations:

2.	A Contingent Employee will be treated as a regular employee for the time that he/she is reinstated. Upon completion of the work assignment, the Contingent employee will be returned to lay-off status. The use of Contingent employment supersedes the application of Article 17.1, 17.2 and 17.3.
3.	An employee reinstated on a Contingent basis will not be eligible for Per Diem under Article 15 by virtue of this Contingent Employment Agreement. If a Contingent Employee is subsequently assigned to work temporarily at a location more than ten miles from the "contingent" reporting center, per diem will apply.
4.	Offers of Contingent employment will be made to individuals eligible for recall. Offers for reinstatement to Contingent employment will be made in order of seniority to the extent the individuals can do the work.

81
8.

This Memorandum of Agreement shall be effective January 30, 2005 and shall remain in effect for the duration of the primary agreement unless terminated by not less than sixty days written notice served by either party upon the other.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE (FMLA)
1.	Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and the Communications Workers of America agree to the provisions concerning Family and Medical Leaves of Absence, as set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement.
2.	The purpose of the leave shall be as follows:
(a)	for the birth and care of a newborn child of the employee, or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care.
(b)	to care for a spouse, biological or adoptive parent, or person who has acted in the role as parent with day-to-day responsibility, or child (biological, adopted, foster or stepchild or legal ward or child for whom the employee has day-to-day parental responsibility) who has a "serious health condition".
(c)	for a serious health condition of the employee which makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee. As with any absence for a serious health condition, the Company may require an employee to provide a "fitness for duty" certification to return to work after such leave.
3.	The total period of this leave will be up to twelve (12) work weeks within a twelve (12) month period. Any leave of absence provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), whether paid or without pay, that is qualified under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall run concurrently with the Family and Medical Leave of Absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).
4.	Employees who have completed at least twelve (12) months of accredited service at the beginning of the leave and worked at least 1,250 hours during such period may be eligible for leave.
5.	The FMLA excludes employees where there are less than fifty (50) employees within seventy-five (75) miles of the employee's work site. The Company will attempt to accommodate requests for FMLA leave for employees at remote locations, however, such requests may be denied based on business necessity.
6.	Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for reasons
88
specified in paragraphs 2.b and 2.c if determined to be "medically necessary" as defined in the Departments of Labor Regulations 29 CFR Part 825. It may not be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule basis for reasons specified in paragraph 2.a unless approved by the Company.
7.	If an employee is granted intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the Company may require such employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative, equivalent position that better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position.
8.	The Company may elect to replace any employees on leave with temporary employees or contract workers for the duration of the leave without affecting or being affected by any provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
9.	Employees shall be required to present, to the satisfaction of the Company's
Human Resources Department, documentation concerning the basis for the requested leave of absence.
10.	Employees shall provide the Company with at least thirty (30) days advance notice of intent to take leave when foreseeable.
11.	In cases where both spouses are employed by the Company, and both spouses are eligible for FMLA leave, they will be permitted to take a total of twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month period for any one qualifying circumstance (birth of a child or to care for a child after birth; placement of a child in foster care or for adoption or to care for the child after placement; or to care for a parent with a serious health condition). Where the husband and wife both use a portion of the total 12 week FMLA leave entitlement for one qualifying circumstance, the husband and wife would each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she took individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a different purpose.
12.	While on FMLA leave, eligible employees are entitled to maintain company-paid life basic insurance, medical and dental benefits to the extent provided to active employees.
13.	Upon return to work, employees granted FMLA leave shall receive accredited service for the period of the leave. There is no break in service for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate in pension plans and other types of benefits and seniority.
14.	Subject to Item 15 below, at the end of the approved leave (or each segment of the leave, as applicable), employees shall be guaranteed reinstatement to the same or equivalent job.
Reinstatement is subject to any contractual provisions of the Collective Bargaining 15. Agreement which cover adjustments to the workforce that may have occurred during the leave of affected employees.
89
16.	Employees who wish to change their projected return date, may request the change, in advance, and the Company will endeavor to accommodate such requests.
17.	Employees, while on leave, shall be considered to have terminated employment if they accept employment with another employer, engage in business for profit, and/or apply for unemployment insurance benefits.
18.	The provisions of this Memorandum of Agreement are not subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement except for the application for reinstatement by employees on leave.
19.	All terms herein shall be defined as set forth in the Department of Labor Regulations, 29 CFR 825.
20.	The Company has the right to act in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and to comply with the regulations provided by the Department of Labor.
21.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective January 30, 2005 and shall expire on
February 13, 2010. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on February 13, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

1.	Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) will make the GTE Hourly Savings Plan (HSP) available to regular full or part-time hourly employees of the Company who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.	The Company reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, by action of the Board of Directors, to modify or amend in whole or part, any or all of the provisions of the HSP, but no such amendment or modification shall have the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of members, retired members, former members or their beneficiaries or of diverting any part of the Trust Fund to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of members, former members, or their beneficiaries and the payment of reasonable HSP administration expenses.
3.	The Company reserves the right, by action of the Board of Directors, to terminate or partially terminate the HSP at any time. Upon termination or partial termination of the HSP or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions under the HSP, the member accounts of the members affected by the termination, partial termination, or complete discontinuance of contributions as the case may be shall be nonforfeitable.
4.	The HSP may be merged into or consolidated with another plan, and its assets or liabilities may be transferred to another plan; provided, however, that no such merger, consolidation, or transfer shall be consummated unless each member and beneficiary under the HSP would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer, if the transferee plan then terminated, that is equal to or greater than the benefit he/she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer, if the HSP had then terminated.
5.	The Company and the Union agree that every provision heretofore contained in this Agreement is contingent upon the Company’s receipt of a favorable determination that the HSP, as amended, continues to be qualified under Section 401 (a) et. Seq., of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event any recession in the HSP is necessary to obtain or maintain a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service, the Company will make the revisions, adhering as closely as possible to the level of benefits contained in the HSP.
101
6.	In the event any portion of this Agreement is determined by a court or government agency to be in violation of existing law or is voided by a change in existing laws, the Company retains the unilateral right to make whatever modifications it deems necessary and appropriate to comply with the law, including the right to rescind the Agreement, if it deems no such modification is feasible. The Company shall have no obligation to bargain or negotiate with the Union in the event that this Agreement is modified or eliminated or in the event the Company does not implement any or all of the provisions of this Agreement because it does not receive Internal Revenue Service approval, any or all of these plans are deemed not qualified, or because of a change in existing laws.
7.	The HSP will be administered solely in accordance with its provisions and no matter concerning the HSP or any difference arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement but rather shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the HSP and the interpretation of the HSP Committee.
8.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on January 30, 2005, and shall expire on February 13, 2010. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement, including the HSP, shall also terminate on February 13, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

INCOME SECURITY PLAN (ISP)
1.	Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and Communications Workers of America recognize the need for technological change in the business and hereby enter into this Memorandum of Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement). In order to lessen the economic impact upon regular employees who become surplus due to technological change, the Company and the Union agree to establish the INCOME SECURITY PLAN (the Plan). "Technological change" shall be defined as a change in plant or equipment, or a change in a method of operation, diminishing the total number of regular employees required to supply the same services to the Company or its subscribers. "Technological change" shall not include layoffs or force realignments caused by business conditions, variations in subscribers' requirements, or temporary or seasonal interruptions of work.
When technological change brings about any of the following conditions, the Plan shall apply:
A.	A need to layoff and/or force realign employees in any job title:
B.	Reassignment of regular employees to permanent headquarters fifty (50) miles or more from the employee’s permanent headquarters.
2.	During the term of this Agreement, if the Company notifies the Union in writing that a technological change has created or will create a surplus in any job title in any work group and/or work location, regular employees meeting the following qualifications shall be eligible for Plan participation:
A.	Accredited service of one year or more;
B.	No comparable assignment available within fifty (50) miles of the former permanent headquarters and/or refusal of reassignment to a new permanent headquarters fifty (50) miles or more from the former permanent headquarters.
However the Company reserves the right to apply this Plan to any surplus in force, whether or not it is brought about by technological change, that the
105
Company deems appropriate. All elections shall be voluntary and acceptance by the Company will be in order of seniority.

NATIONAL SALES INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
1.	OVERVIEW
The National Sales Incentive Compensation Plan (hereinafter referred to as The Plan) described below has been developed as the standard Incentive Compensation Plan for Verizon North Inc.

2.	PLAN OBJECTIVES
A.	Increase sales of products and services.
B.	Increase small business quality results to the small business market.
C.	Reward and incent employees performing at 75% of their objectives.
D.	Increase total compensation above current levels for those employees performing above target.
3.	ELIGIBILITY
The Plan is designed solely for Business Customer Representatives within National Sales.
4.	INCENTIVE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE
The Compensation Plan is a combination base wage plus compensation, with compensation paid on individual monthly sales.
A.	Compensation Payout
Compensation will be based on the achievement of individual and/or team plan objectives.
Example:
Revenue on products/services - Quality Results
NOTE: Management determines Weighting for the components.
B.	Minimum Quota Attainment Qualifier
Compensation payouts may be limited where management establishes a need for a minimum quota attainment level in one or more product/service(s) category(ies).
Example:
130
Compensation on total revenue attainment will be capped at 110% unless 100% of monthly quota is achieved in all assigned product categories.
C.	Frequency of Payments
Compensation is to be paid on a monthly basis. Compensation payments earned during a month will be paid within two (2) months following the month in which the compensation was earned.
5.	PROGRAM TRACKING
Results will be accumulated from the first day worked in the year to the last day worked in the year.
Additions and deletions of products and services will be handled in accordance with current National Sales procedures/policies. Reasonable advance notice will be provided to employees whenever additions or deletions of products or services are made. The Company reserves the right to establish and revise the procedures/policies in accordance with business needs.
The Company agrees to meet with the Union at periodic intervals (6 months or longer) to review and provide a status report on the Plan(s). It is understood that these meetings are not intended to be negotiation sessions, but rather information sharing sessions to provide a better understanding of how this new approach to compensation is working.
6.	ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS
Management will have the sole and exclusive responsibility to establish and administer the Plan and reserves the exclusive right to adjust the product/service mix and/or associated objectives as required to ensure equitable treatment of all parties.
The Plan will be administered by an Administrative Committee comprised of representatives of National Sales, Human Resources and Business Analysis. In addition, the Administrative Committee is empowered to interpret the Plan, to approve objectives, to approve awards and to interpret rules and regulations within the provisions of the Plan.
A.	New Participants
In the event that an individual becomes a participant in the Plan during the year, the employee will be eligible for all associated compensation earned.
131
B.	Modification
National Sales may at any time modify, in whole or in part, the provisions of the Plan. National Sales may at any time modify plan components, weightings, objectives, product line categories, qualifiers and thresholds as business needs may dictate. Any modification shall not affect sales compensation already earned under this Plan.
The annual/monthly payout associated with the Goal Attainment Percentage in the attached Payout Schedule will remain in effect for the duration of the contract.
C.	Retirement, Disability or Death
In the event that a participant retires, becomes disabled or dies during the Plan year, the participant or the designated beneficiary(ies) will receive an award earned up to the effective date of retirement, disability or death. Payment will be made to the individual or the participant’s designated beneficiary(ies) when awards are paid to other Plan participants.
D.	Statement of Acceptance
Each Plan participant will indicate acceptance of the conditions for participation by signing the “Statement of Acceptance”.
E.	Termination of Employment
In the event that a Plan participant’s employment terminates prior to the scheduled payout of awards, the Company will pay all awards earned by the participant. Such awards shall be computed and paid when awards are paid to other Plan participants.
F.	Transfers/Promotions
In the event that a Plan participant is transferred or promoted to another position during the Plan year, the participant will be eligible to receive compensation based upon sales performance up to the date of such transfer or promotion. Such compensation shall be computed and paid when paid to other Plan participants.
G.	Windfalls
A windfall is an unusual situation resulting in a change of volume of sales from that anticipated by management in setting objectives and incentives. Management will review all incentive results that are more than 200% of objective prior to payment. Management may approve or adjust the payment based on the circumstances of reaching more than 200% of objective. The adjustment would in no way result in payment of less than 100% of objective. Management reserves the right to
132
adjust any portion of the Plan to bring the compensation in line with what it determines to be reasonable objective attainment.
H.	Benefits
Generally speaking, compensation payments are typically included in the calculations of many Company benefits. Appendix A outlines those specific benefits which include or exclude compensation earnings.
I.	Grievance/Arbitration
The Incentive Compensation Plan shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
J.	Time Away From Work
The methodology for up-front objective adjustments include the following:
(1)	Calculate time away from job.
Available hours less:
•	Holidays
•	Personal/Floating Holidays
•	Training hours per employee
•	Vacation
•	Other time away from job
Other objective adjustments (which are not done up front) include the following:
(2)	Objective is adjusted and available dollars are adjusted for:
•	Sickness - five consecutive days or more
•	FMLA - five consecutive days or more
•	Union Business Unpaid - five (5) days or more in the entire month
•	Part-time - no minimum time off-line requirement
•	New Hire
(3)	Objective is adjusted and available dollars are not adjusted for:
•	Training - five consecutive days or more
•	Military Leave - five consecutive days or more
•	Jury Duty - five consecutive days or more
•	Union Business Paid - day by day
•	Other Company directed business (i.e. team leader/relief
133
supervisor, in-house trainer, on-loan assignment) -minimum off line requirement determined by management
Vacation days - day by day
NOTE: For calculating the equivalent of five days, Union Business Paid and Union Business Unpaid can be combined.
K.	Suspension/Termination of Plan
The suspension or termination of this Incentive Compensation Plan must be by mutual agreement of the parties.
Compensation - Adjustments
In the event an employee or the company believes an overpayment/ underpayment has occurred, a Company representative and the employee or his/her union representative agree to meet to review relevant facts. If it is determined that an overpayment/underpayment has occurred, the Company will appropriately adjust future sales compensation payouts to address the situation. However, the Company will not require the employee to pay back any overpayment from his/her base salary. If the employee moves to a position that is not covered by a National Sales Incentive Plan, or is separated from the Company, he or she will not be liable for any repayment.
NOTE: If an employee’s sales compensation is paid based on inaccurate or fraudulent sales results, the employee will be required to repay the entire unearned compensation amount regardless of whether or not the employee is still a participant in a National Sales Incentive Plan.

PENSION PLAN SURVIVOR BENEFITS
1.	Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and Communications Workers of America agree to modify the Plan for Hourly Employees’ Pensions. Such modifications will be effective January 1, 2006 and are subject to applicable law.
2.	The existing pre-retirement survivor pension benefit provisions of the Pension Plan shall be amended to provide a pre-retirement survivor pension benefit for an employee who dies, either during active service or prior to commencing a pension benefit, at a time when he or she is unmarried and has accrued at least five years of vesting service.
3.	An unmarried employee may, at any time prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying, designate any living person as the designated beneficiary for the pre-retirement survivor benefit. The employee may likewise revise the beneficiary designation at any one or more times prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying. A valid beneficiary designation must be on file for the pre-retirement survivor benefit to be paid.
4.	For married employees, the spouse will automatically be considered the beneficiary. However, subject to the requirements regarding non-spouse beneficiaries and with spousal consent, a married employee may name a beneficiary other than the spouse. A single individual must be named as beneficiary; an estate or trust may not be named, nor may multiple individuals.
5.	Subject to the provisions of the Plan, regarding when the benefit is payable, the
pre-retirement survivor pension may be distributed as a 65% survivor annuity, or the lump sum equivalent, based upon the beneficiary’s election. However, if the beneficiary is not the participant’s spouse and is more than 25 years younger than the participant, the survivor benefit will be the 50% survivor annuity or the lump sum equivalent.
6.	If a vested employee terminates employment on or after the effective date, the
named survivor will be eligible for the survivor pension payable on the date the employee would have reached the age 65. An actuarially reduced benefit may be payable before age 65 if the vested employee would have been eligible for an earlier commencement.
138
7.	In addition, the Pension Plan shall be amended to allow an employee, at the time of commencing a pension benefit, to designate any living person as the beneficiary for any of the forms of joint and survivor annuity offered under the Pension Plan or any of the term-certain forms of benefits. In the case of an employee who is married at the time of commencing a pension, the employee may not designate any beneficiary other than the spouse without complying with the spousal consent rules of the Plan.
8.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on January 30, 2005 and shall expire
on February 13, 2010. The parties specifically agree that all the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also expire on February 13, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement, unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

The adjustment would in no way result in payment of less than 100% of quota objective. Management reserves the right to adjust any portion of the Plan to bring the compensation in line with what it determines to be reasonable quota objective attainment.
H.	Benefits
Generally speaking, commission payments are typically included in the calculations of many Company benefits. Appendix A outlines those specific benefits which include or exclude commission earnings.
I.	Grievance/Arbitration
The provisions of the Sales Incentive Plan are not subject to the grievance/arbitration provisions of the current Labor Agreement; however, any dispute as to whether an employee is paid in accordance with the terms of the plan will be subject to the grievance (and arbitration) procedure(s).
J.	Establishing Selling Hours
Selling Hours are defined to include all time assigned on the sales floor, including time in the teller/cashier area. Selling Hours are required for equitable application of individual quota objectives.
Activities such as the following will not count towards Selling Hours: formal training, off-site meetings, union business and/or company functions in excess of one hour.
Hours not worked due to jury duty, military time or vacation time that has been approved ten (10) days in advance of the posting of the current schedule will not count towards Selling Hours.
K.	Time Away From Work Adjustments
For any time away from work, such as FMLA or absent sick (excused or unexcused) in excess of three (3) consecutive scheduled days, beginning with the fourth day and subsequent days, the Supervisor will adjust the selling hours. If this adjustment results in an increase/decrease in selling hours for other RSC in the PhoneMart, their individual quota objectives will be adjusted accordingly.
L.	Suspension/Termination of Plan
The suspension or termination of this Incentive Compensation Plan must be by mutual agreement of the parties.
150
M.	Compensation - Adjustments
Plan quota objectives which carry Year to Date (YTD) quota objectives may sometimes result in overpayments. In this situation the Company will adjust future sales compensation payouts, including carry-over from one plan-year to another, to offset any overpayment. However, the Company will not require the employee to pay back any overpayment from his/her base salary. If the employee moves to a position that is not covered by a Retail Sales Incentive Plan or is separated from the Company, he or she will not be liable for any repayment.
NOTE: If an employee’s sales compensation is paid based on inaccurate or fraudulent sales results, the employee will be required to repay the entire unearned compensation amount regardless of whether or not the employee is still a participant in a Retail Sales Incentive Plan.
N.	Split Sales Credit
Any questions regarding distribution of sales credit between two or more Plan participants shall be referred to the Retail Sales Supervisor and/or Regional Sales Manager. Total payout may not exceed the amount that normally would have been paid.
7.	TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT COMPENSATION
When an RSC is temporarily assigned to manage a store, the RSC’s basic wage will be compensated in accordance with the provision of the local Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Based on a store’s total performance, the following payout will be administered:
Commission schedule for a Retail Sales temporary Store Management assignment:

TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD
1.	Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and Communications Workers of America agree to continue a Team Performance Award, which will provide participating employees the opportunity to earn compensation based upon collective/team performance results.
2.	ELIGIBILITY
All full-time and part-time regular hourly employees are eligible to receive an award if they are on a TPA Team for 30 calendar days or more. Employees on other Incentive plans are not eligible, i.e., National Sales, Retail, LiveSource.
3.	AWARDS
Awards are based on performance toward objectives over the period of a calendar year. An award amount is determined for the applicable calendar year, a percentage of which may be earned by eligible employees depending on team performance during that calendar year. The payout ranges from 0% to 120% of an established target.
The range of the Team Performance Award payout is as follows:
Each annual target award is 4% payable in April of the following year. The range is 0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
Employees transferring between or changing teams for any reason during the year will receive an award based upon the team in which they reside at the end of the year (December 31). Awards will not be prorated based on time spent with each team.
An employee who resigns, is laid off, terminated, dies or retires during the calendar year is eligible for a prorated Team Performance Award if all other eligibility requirements have been met.*
In case of Termination for Cause the individual situation will be reviewed to determine if the individual is eligible for an award.*
Employees on approved military leave of absence who have one year or more service will be given full wage credit up to three months toward the Team Performance Award. Employees on any other unpaid leave will have cumulative leave time excluded from award computation.
4.	TIME OFF FOR UNION ACTIVITIES: Excused time off for union activity will be counted as time worked when computing Team Performance Awards.
5.	BENEFITS TREATMENT
Team Performance Award payments are recognized in the calculation of Pension
157
Plan benefits, Group Life Insurance, and the Hourly Savings Plan. Such payments will be applicable in the year payment is received. This is in accordance with Verizon benefit plan definitions.
All other benefits are paid in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement and are based on rates shown in the hourly wage schedules.
6.	TAXES, PERSONAL ALLOTMENT
Deductions for federal, state, and local tax liabilities will be made in accordance with lump sum distribution tax laws. Personal allotments such as savings bonds and United Way contributions will not be made.
Applicable union dues will be deducted from Team Performance Awards in accordance with standard payroll procedures. Dues will not be deducted from retirees orfrom employees promoted from hourly positions to management.
7.	OVERTIME
The Team Performance Award payouts are for hours worked and must be included in overtime payments.
The overtime payment will be calculated as follows:
The Team Performance Award payout divided by the total hours worked equals the award hourly rate. This rate is then multiplied times .5 x number of overtime hours in the same calendar year for which the Team Performance Award was paid. The result of this calculation is the award overtime payment due the employee.
EXAMPLE:
Team Performance Award	$500
divided by Total Hours Worker	1,880
equals Award Hourly Rate	$0.2659
times Overtime Rate (1/2)	.50
equals Hourly Overtime Rate of Pay	$0.1329
times Total Overtime Hours	100
equals Award Overtime Payment	$13.29
The overtime incentive payment is not included in benefit plan calculations.
A Team Performance Award overtime payment will be included in the award payout.
8.	OBJECTIVES/MEASURES
158
All hourly employees will normally be assigned to teams based on their functional area of responsibility. Teams may consist of a few employees or many.
Each team will be given a set of objectives linked to, but not limited to, one or more of these performance areas:
•	Quality/Value of Services Delivered
•	Productivity
•	Expense Budget
•	Revenue
Teams that satisfy a minimum level of performance will receive an incentive payment. If that minimum level of performance is exceeded, the incentive payment will be larger. Each member of a team will receive the same percentage of target award that the team achieved. An example would be as follows:
Level of Performance
Below minimum Minimum to Target Target
Over Target to Maximum
Percentage of Target Award
0%
10 - 99%
100%
101 - 120%
9.	The Company reserves the right to establish objectives and determine performance
results. The objectives, the performance results, or any part of the Team Performance Award program shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
10.	Prior to the announcement of objectives and performance targets for the applicable
year, Company representatives will meet with Union representatives to review the rationale for such objectives and targets.
11.	MODIFICATION OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD
Verizon may at any time modify, in part or in whole, the Team Performance Award
Plan. Any modification shall not affect awards already earned under this plan.
12.	TERMINATION OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE AWARD PLAN
The suspension or termination must be by mutual agreement of the parties.

And
COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA
VOLUNTARY LAYOFF LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and Communications Workers of America agree to the provisions concerning a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement.
1.	The purpose of a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence shall be to provide an alternative method of temporarily adjusting the size of the work force for up to four (4) months in a calendar year. The Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence would be in lieu of the layoff provisions as provided for in Article 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.	The total period of a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence will not exceed four (4)
months. Voluntary Layoff Leaves of Absence will be offered by seeking volunteers from the affected classification and affected status and reporting location. This will be done at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date. The decision to offer Voluntary Layoff Leaves of Absence, the time frame or duration of the leave, the number of Voluntary Layoff Leaves of Absence authorized, and the location and the classification/status affected will be at the sole discretion of Management.
3.	If the number of volunteers is not sufficient, Management will then layoff the
excess remaining employees in accordance with Article 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If more employees volunteer than needed Management will allow the most senior of the volunteers to take the Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence.
4.	While on a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence, eligible employees shall continue
to receive Company paid life insurance, medical/dental insurance and telephone concession benefits to the extent provided to active employees.
5.	Employees granted a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence prior to year end will be
required to take all unused or remaining vacation (or bank if eligible) and personal holiday time prior to the end of the calendar year in which the leave is to begin. In addition, the employees will be required to use all vacation time (or bank if eligible) scheduled during the month(s) for the calendar year in which the Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence ends.
6.	All Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absences are without pay and are subject to
approval by Management. Application of unemployment compensation will not be contested by the Company.

7.	This agreement shall in no way limit Management from utilizing other Company employees to perform work assignments of the nature performed previously by an employee who may be on a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence.
8.	Upon return to work, employees granted a Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence shall receive accredited service and seniority for the period of the Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence.
9.	At the end of the approved Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence, employees will be guaranteed reinstatement to a job within their previous classification and reporting location.
10.	Employees are required to return to work on the agreed upon date. Failure to return on the expected return date, for other than a personal compelling reason as determined by Management, will result in termination of employment. Should an employee be unable to return to work due to personal illness or injury and that illness or injury would be covered by the Company’s sickness disability benefits, the employee may apply for sickness disability benefits for the remainder of the time that would normally be covered by sickness disability benefits.
11.	Reinstatement is subject to any contractual provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement which covers adjustments to the work force that may have occurred during the Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence of affected employees.
12.	As a condition of Voluntary Layoff Leave of Absence, employees are required to maintain their membership in good standing in the Union or alternatively arrange to pay to the Union a service fee equal to the amount of membership dues uniformly required for all members of the same status.
This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on January 30, 2005, and shall expire on February 13, 2010. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on February 13, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

WORKPLACE PERFORMANCE MONITORING/RECORDING
Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and Communications Workers of America recognize the need to balance the legitimate business needs for the highest quality of customer service with employee concerns for workplace privacy.
The parties agree that the primary intent of monitoring/recording of calls is to ensure quality customer service and for the assessment of employee developmental needs.
The parties agree to the following Performance Monitoring/Recording Guidelines:
1.	Employees will receive written advance notice that, in general, customer contacts will be subject to performance monitoring/recording. Employees may not necessarily be given any advanced notice that any particular contact may be monitored/recorded.
2.	Employees will be advised that the intent of performance monitoring/recording is to ensure the quality of service provided to customers and to assess employee developmental needs.
3.	Specific performance monitoring/recording guidelines will be established -(e.g., a usual minimum and maximum number of monitoring/recording sessions within a stated timeframe; an exception may be necessary to properly take into account developmental needs.) Employees will be informed of such guidelines.
4.	Information related to an employee’s performance, obtained as a result of performance monitoring/recording will be used for coaching, counseling and training purposes, and will be kept strictly confidential.
5.	Performance monitoring/recording results will be averaged to ensure that an employee is not adversely impacted by the evaluation of a single call, except as stated in Paragraph 7, below.
6.	The results of performance monitoring/recording will be shared as soon as possible with the employee for developmental purposes with emphasis on re-enforcing the positive and observations that could be improved. The results of the observation will be shared with the employee in the manner it
173
was obtained (e.g., recorded audio, checklist, etc.)
7.	While the primary intent of performance monitoring/recording is to ensure
quality customer service and for the assessment of employee developmental needs, there may be situations which require immediate corrective/disciplinary action. Examples of such situations include, but are not limited to:
A.	Revealing any customer, company or employee information to an
unauthorized person, which is a breach of confidentiality and a violation of the Company’s Secrecy of Communications policy and Standards of Business Conduct.
B.	Falsification of records.
C.	Inappropriate personal conversations or rudeness or use of profanity
with a customer.
D.	Placing unauthorized personal call(s) from the employee’s work
position.
E.	Intentional or malicious misuse of telephone facilities - e.g.,
inappropriately disconnecting a customer, leaving a position unattended, or routing calls into a “black hole”.
8.	The Union retains all contractual rights to challenge any disciplinary action taken by management as a result of monitoring/recording.
9.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on January 30, 2005, and shall expire on February 13, 2010. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on February 13, 2010, and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

HOURLY SAVINGS PLAN (HSP)
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter "CWA" or "the Union"), and Verizon Communications companies, which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies” or "the Companies" or “the Company”), have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as follows:
1.	The Company and the Union will make the Hourly Savings Plan (HSP) available to regular full or part-time hourly employees of the Company who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.	The Company reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, by action of the Board of Directors, to modify or amend in whole or part, any or all of the provisions of the HSP, but no such amendment or modification shall have the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of members, retired members, former members or their beneficiaries or of diverting any part of the Trust Fund to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of members, former members, or their beneficiaries and the payment of reasonable HSP administration expenses.
3.	The Company reserves the right, by action of the Board of Directors, to terminate or partially terminate the HSP at any time. Upon termination or partial termination of the HSP or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions under the HSP, the member accounts of the members affected by the termination, partial termination, or complete discontinuance of contributions as the case may be shall be nonforfeitable.
4.	The HSP may be merged into or consolidated with another plan, and its assets or liabilities may be transferred to another plan; provided, however, that no such merger, consolidation, or transfer shall be consummated unless each member and beneficiary under the HSP would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer, if the transferee plan then terminated, that is equal to or greater than the benefit he/she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer, if the HSP had then terminated.
5.	The Company and the Union agree that every provision heretofore contained in this Agreement is contingent upon the Company’s receipt of a favorable
181
determination that the HSP, as amended, continues to be qualified under Section 401 (a) et. seq., of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event any recession in the HSP is necessary to obtain or maintain a favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service, the Company will make the revisions, adhering as closely as possible to the level of benefits contained in the HSP.
6.	In the event any portion of this Agreement is determined by a court or government agency to be in violation of existing law or is voided by a change in existing laws, the Company retains the unilateral right to make whatever modifications it deems necessary and appropriate to comply with the law, including the right to rescind the Agreement, if it deems no such modification is feasible. The Company shall have no obligation to bargain or negotiate with the Union in the event that this Agreement is modified or eliminated or in the event the Company does not implement any or all of the provisions of this Agreement because it does not receive Internal Revenue Service approval, any or all of these plans are deemed not qualified, or because of a change in existing laws.
7.	The HSP will be administered solely in accordance with its provisions and no matter concerning the HSP or any difference arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement but rather shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the HSP and the interpretation of the HSP Committee.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

And

NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
WHEREAS the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO (hereafter "CWA" or "the Union"), and Verizon Communications companies, which were subsidiaries of the former GTE Corporation (hereafter the “Verizon/GTE Companies” or "the Companies" or “the Company”), have collective bargaining relationships throughout the United States;
NOW THEREFORE THE VERIZON/GTE COMPANIES AND CWA agree as follows:
This Agreement between Company and the Union covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing; access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sales and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Verizon’s business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union’s goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) and Verizon Select Services Inc. This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies” (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) and Verizon Select Services Inc. as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual
184
decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Verizon Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-union nor will the Union be anti-management.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a union
to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a “third party” or “outsider”.
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be in accordance with this Agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
185
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3.	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit.
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock”. The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
5.	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities; and
186
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
6.	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called “Consent Election.” This process will work as follows:
(1)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use “Consent Election”.
(2)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The “show of interest” cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this Agreement.
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union’s show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this Agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union’s show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.
187
7.
Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the CWA for access, Verizon Labor Relations Staff, in conjunction with local management and CWA representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the CWA representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and the CWA that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and the CWA are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and the CWA commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
8.	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate CWA representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and the CWA that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this Agreement. Either Verizon or the CWA can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days’ written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
188
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Verizon and CWA believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and the CWA agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by Verizon and CWA.
9.	Acquisitions and Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry. Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The
189
employees in those entities may be non-represented, represented in whole or in the part of the CWA, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization.

Dear Ms Roberts:
As a result of 2005 negotiations between Verizon North Inc. (North Central Market Area) and the Communications Workers of America, and in furtherance of the positive working relationship between the parties, the Company and the Union agree that, when the Company declares a service emergency, the Company will notify the CWA Local president(s) in the impacted area(s) of such declaration.
The Company and the Union further agree to establish a committee on overtime within each of the North Central Market Area Divisions (Illinois/Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio/Michigan). These overtime committees will include Company representatives as determined by Labor Relations, and Union representatives as determined by CWA leadership.
The overtime committees will be charged with engaging in open dialogue to review issues and concerns regarding the administration of associate overtime within the applicable Division of the North Central Market Area. These discussions may include possible measures that may alleviate the need for overtime assignment anomalies and ways to improve and expedite communication between management and employees/Union leadership regarding overtime requirements.
The overtime committees will identify members and hold initial meetings no later than July 30, 2005, and will meet at either parties request on a quarterly basis thereafter. The committees will submit the status of committee meetings at the Division-level Verizon/CWA common interest forums.
It is the intent of the Company and Union that these committees will use their time and effort to engage in full and open communication, involvement, adaptability, integrity, trust and respect in
200
this effort, realizing that all of us here are responsible not only for today’s workforce, but also for ensuring the legacy of a viable and competitive future Verizon workforce.
