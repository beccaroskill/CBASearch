AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT, effective the 7th day of March, 2019, by and between KNAPPEN MILLING COMPANY of Augusta, Michigan, hereinafter referred to as the "Company" and Local 3-G of the BAKERY, CONFECTIONERY, TOBACCO WORKERS AND GRAIN MILLERS INTERNATIONAL UNION, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as the "Union",
W I T N E S S E T H:
ARTICLE I	- PURPOSE AND INTENT
The general purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the wages, hours and working conditions which shall prevail for the duration of this Agreement and to promote orderly and peaceful labor relations for the mutual interest of the Company, its employees and the Union. Recognizing that the success of the Company and the job security of the employees depend upon the Company's ability to economically produce and sell quality products, the Company and the Union, for and in consideration of the mutual promises, stipulations and conditions hereinafter specified agree to abide by the terms and provisions set forth herein for the duration of this Agreement.
ARTICLE II	- RECOGNITION
Section 1:	The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for all of its production and maintenance employees at its 110 South Water Street, Augusta, Michigan, location including truck drivers and warehouse employees but excluding all office clerical employees, professional employees, laboratory technicians, and guards and supervisors as defined in the Labor-Management Relations Act.
Section 2:	The Union recognizes that except as specifically limited or abrogated by the terms and provisions of this Agreement, all rights to manage, direct and supervise the operations of the Company and the employees are vested solely and exclusively in the Company.
Section 3:	This Article applies to all employees in the bargaining unit. The bargaining unit is described in Article II, Section 1. All employees in the bargaining unit are “bargaining unit members.”
(a)	Local 3-G of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, AFL-CIO (“Union”) represents all employees in the bargaining unit.
(b)	Every employee in the bargaining unit can freely choose to become a member of the Union or to not become a member of the Union. Joining the Union and/or
1
paying dues are not conditions of employment for any employee. An employee cannot, and will not, be terminated solely because he/she chooses to not join the Union or pay dues.
(c)	An employee who voluntarily elects to become a Union member may be required by the Union to pay dues. The amounts and regularity of those dues payments will be decided by the Union. Any employee choosing to become a Union member will be required to sign a payroll deduction authorization form, acceptable to the Company, authorizing the Company to deduct Union dues from the employee’s paychecks.
(d)	The Union shall provide the Company with an invoice specifying how much must be deducted from the wages of each such employee who has submitted a signed/written payroll deduction authorization form. The Company will thereafter make the appropriate dues deductions from each such employee’s first monthly pay period/paycheck. Remittances will be made by check or electronic transfer to the Union at an address which the Union will provide to the Company.
(e)	The Company will use its best efforts to make deductions in the manner set forth but has no responsibility for any errors other than to correct such errors. In the event of overpayment, the Union agrees to refund such monies within twenty (20) calendar days upon presentation of evidence of error or mistake.
(f)	A dues deduction authorization form may be revoked by the employee by written notice signed by the employee and received by the Company. A revocation shall become effective seven days after the revocation notice is received in the Company’s Payroll Office.
(g)	Neither the Company nor the Union will discriminate against any employee because the employee chooses to become, or not to become, a member of the Union or chooses to pay, or not to pay, any dues or fees to the Union.
(h)	The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless against any and all claims, suits and/or other forms of liability that may arise out of or by reason of the Company complying with the provisions of this Section.
Section 4:	The Company and the Union agree that for the duration of this Agreement, neither shall discriminate against any employee because of race, color, religion, age, sex, disability, marital status, height, weight, veteran status or national origin nor shall the Company or its agents nor the Union, its agents or members discriminate against any employee because an employee exercises his/her rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the Labor-Management Relations Act.
2
Section 5:	The Union agrees that, except as specifically provided by the terms and provisions of this Agreement, employees shall not be permitted to engage in Union activity on Company time.
Section 6:	The Company and the Union recognize their obligations to cooperate in seeking a reasonable accommodation for those employees who have a disability that limits their ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs.
ARTICLE III- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1: A grievance shall be defined as any dispute regarding the meaning, interpretation or application of the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
Section 2: An employee who believes s/he has a grievance must submit his/her complaint orally to his/her supervisor within three (3) regularly scheduled working days after the occurrence of the event upon which the grievance is based. If the employee had no knowledge thereof within said three (3) regularly scheduled working days after the occurrence of the event then the grievance must be presented orally to the supervisor within three (3) regularly scheduled working days after conditions were such that s/he or the Union should have had knowledge thereof. The supervisor shall give the aggrieved employee an answer within twenty-four (24) hours (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) after the complaint has been submitted to him/her. The employee and his/her steward may be present when s/he submits his/her complaint orally to his/her supervisor. In the event the grievance is not settled in this manner, the following procedure shall apply:
FIRST STEP: To be processed under the grievance procedure, a grievance must be reduced to writing, state the facts upon which it is based, when they occurred, must be signed by the employee or the Union representative who is filing the grievance and must be presented to the employee's supervisor within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after the occurrence of the event upon which it is based. If neither the employee nor the Union had knowledge thereof within said five (5) regularly scheduled working days after the occurrence of the event then the grievance must be presented within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after conditions were such that the employee or the Union should have had knowledge thereof. The Company shall give a written answer to the aggrieved employee and his/her steward within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after receipt of the written grievance. If the answer is mutually satisfactory, the employee's steward shall so indicate on the grievance form and sign it with two (2) copies of the grievance thus settled retained by the Union and one (1) copy by the supervisor.
3
SECOND STEP: If the grievance is not settled in the First Step, it shall be appealed to the Union and the Management's grievance committees provided such appeal is made within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after receipt of the First Step answer by the employee and/or union steward. These committees shall meet to consider the grievance within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after such appeal has been made. Grievances discussed at this meeting must be answered not later than five (5) regularly scheduled working days from the date of the meeting. If a grievance is settled at this step, the answer will be signed by the chairperson of Management's committee and the members of the Union's committee.
THIRD STEP: If the grievance has not been settled in the Second Step, it shall be appealed to a meeting of representatives of the International Union and representatives of the Company provided such appeal is taken within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after receipt by the Union of Management's Second Step answer. Such meeting must be held as soon after such appeal has been taken as can be arranged by the Company and International Union Representative and must be answered in writing within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after such meeting, unless such time limit has been extended by agreement of the Company and the Union.
FOURTH STEP: If, at this point, the grievance has not been satisfactorily settled, the Union shall have the right to make demand for arbitration upon the Company provided such demand is made within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by the Union of Management's Third Step answer. If such demand has not been made within said thirty (30) calendar day period, it shall be considered as being withdrawn by the Union. If such timely demand is made, the Company and the Union shall jointly request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to supply a list of names of seven (7) qualified arbitrators. The Company and the Union will endeavor to select from such list a mutually satisfactory arbitrator. If none of the named arbitrators are mutually acceptable, the Company and the Union will request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to supply another list of seven (7) qualified arbitrators. From this second list each party shall alternately strike the name of one arbitrator until only one remains on the list. This remaining one shall be the arbitrator. The right to strike the first name shall be determined by flipping a coin. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, change or modify any provisions of this Agreement but shall be limited solely to the interpretation and application of the specific provisions contained herein. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the authority of an arbitrator in his/her judgment, to sustain, reverse or modify any alleged unjust discharge or disciplinary lay-off that may reach this stage of the grievance procedure. The decision of the arbitrator shall be
4
final and binding upon the parties hereto. The expenses and fees of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Company and the Union.
Section 3:	The Company shall notify the president of the Union in writing of the names of employees who are laid off for lack of work (when the lay-off is anticipated to last more than three (3) work days), who are recalled to work after such lay-off, who are laid off for disciplinary reasons, or who are discharged for cause. For the purpose of the time limits specified in Section 2 of this Article and Section 1 of Article IV, delivery of such written notice to the President of the Union, or in his/her absence, to any member of the Union's grievance committee, shall constitute knowledge of such action and the time limits shall date from such delivery. The Union shall have the right to file grievances regarding alleged improper action on the part of the Company with respect to the matters listed in this Section.
Section 4:	The Union committee members shall be paid their straight time hourly rate of pay for any time lost from their regularly scheduled work while attending grievance meetings.
(a) The Union steward shall be permitted to investigate and/or process grievances as provided in the First Step of the grievance procedure and shall be paid for the time necessarily spent in so doing during his/her regularly scheduled working hours his/her regular straight time hourly rate. It is understood that the steward is expected to perform the work for which he/she is employed by the Company and will not abuse the privilege conferred by this Section. If a steward is required to leave his/her work for these purposes such steward shall first obtain permission from his/her supervisor. It is understood that on occasion the steward may not be able to be spared from his/her job for these reasons immediately. In such case the steward shall be permitted to leave his/her job for these purposes as soon as s/he can be spared.
Section 5:	The Union's grievance committee shall consist of not more than two (2) members, both of whom shall be employees who shall have completed their probationary period. The Company shall be promptly informed in writing as to the membership of the Union's grievance committee and any changes therein.
Section 6:	Wherever the words "regularly scheduled working days" are used in this Article III, they shall be defined as those days which are scheduled between Monday and Friday, both inclusive, excluding holidays recognized under this Agreement.
ARTICLE IV	- DISCHARGE CASES
Section 1:	The Company agrees that an employee shall not be immediately discharged from and after the date of this Agreement, but that in all instances in which the Company may conclude
5
that an employee's conduct may justify suspension or discharge, such employee shall first be suspended. In all cases of suspension where the employee is at work at the time of the suspension, the Chairperson of the Union's Grievance Committee or, in his/her absence, any member of the Union's Grievance Committee shall be called and the reasons for suspension shall be explained in the employee's presence. Such initial suspension shall be for not more than five (5) regularly scheduled working days, and if the suspension is converted into a discharge, such discharge shall not be made until the end of said five (5) day period. During this period of initial suspension, the employee may, if he/she believes s/he has been unjustly dealt with, request a hearing and a statement of the offense before the Union and the Company grievance committees. The affected employee shall have the right to be present at such hearing. At such hearing, the facts concerning the case shall be made available to both parties. After such hearing or if no such hearing is requested, the Company shall decide, dependent upon the facts of the case, whether the suspension without pay already given is considered sufficient, should be extended, should be converted into a discharge or that no discipline should have been given. If the involved employee or the Union believes that the ultimate action taken under this Section was improper, either may file a grievance with regard thereto at the Third Step of the grievance procedure within three (3) regularly scheduled working days after the Chairperson of the Union's Grievance Committee (or in his/her absence, any member of the Union's Grievance Committee) receives a written notice of such action from the Company.
Section 2:	In the event it should be decided under the grievance procedure that the employee was unjustly discharged, the Company shall reinstate such employee and pay full compensation, partial or no compensation as may be decided under the grievance procedure for the time lost from work by the employee.
ARTICLE V	- STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS
Section 1:	The International and Local Union agree that during the life of this Agreement they will not authorize, condone or engage in a work stoppage, slowdown or strike. The Company agrees that during the same period there will be no lockouts.
Section 2:	Employees who instigate, aid or engage in a work stoppage, intentional slowdown or strike may be disciplined or discharged in the sole discretion of the Company. However, the question as to whether the action engaged in by such employees is such as is proscribed by this Section may be submitted to the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE VI	- SENIORITY
Section 1: Plant-wide seniority shall be defined as an employee's length of continuous service with the Company since his/her last hiring date. "Last hiring date" shall mean the date upon
6
which an employee was hired since which s/he has not quit, retired or been discharged. An employee's seniority shall terminate:
(a)	If s/he quits, retires or is discharged.
(b)	If, when s/he has been recalled to work following a layoff, s/he refuses or fails to return to work within five (5) regularly scheduled working days after a written notice by certified mail of such recall is sent to his/her last address on record with the Company. A copy of such recall notice shall simultaneously be given to the President of the Union (or in his/her absence, to one of the Union stewards). In the event the employee being recalled does not respond, due to not having received the recall notice, the Union (through its president or steward) shall be allowed forty-eight (48) hours within which to see that the employee does respond.
(c)	If s/he is absent for two (2) consecutive scheduled working days without notifying the Company during such two (2) day period of a justifiable reason for such absence, unless it was impossible within such period to give such notice.
(d)	If s/he fails to return to work immediately upon the expiration of a leave of absence without receiving an extension thereof unless it was impossible to do so.
(e)	When s/he has been laid off for lack of work for a continuous period equal to the amount of seniority s/he had acquired as of the start of such layoff or for a continuous period of eighteen (18) months, whichever is the lesser.
Section 2: All new employees shall be probationary employees until they have worked forty-five (45) days for the Company except in the case of the Bulk Operator and Alternate Bulk Operator, such period shall be sixty (60) regularly scheduled working days and, in the case of the Trick Miller, Alternate Miller and Maintenance classifications, such period shall be ninety (90) regularly scheduled working days for the Company. The purpose of the probationary period is to provide an opportunity for supervision to determine whether the employee has the ability and other attributes which will qualify him/her for regular employee status. During the probationary period, the employee shall have no seniority status and may be laid off or terminated in the sole discretion of the Company without regard to his/her relative length of service. At the conclusion of his/her probationary period the employee's name shall be added to the seniority list as of his/her last hiring date.
(a)	Temporary and part-time employees shall acquire no seniority and shall not participate in any of the fringe benefits provided for under this labor agreement.
7
(b)	A temporary employee shall be defined as one who is hired only for summer work, peak business periods or for temporary periods required because of unusual conditions but not for in excess of one hundred twenty (120) days at any one time except that a temporary employee may fill, on a ‘one to one’ basis, a position vacated by an employee off work for an extended period of time due to an illness, injury or other leave of absence but not for in excess of eighteen (18) months. The union will be notified of the employee off work and the temporary employee replacing that employee. Temporary employees will not be hired and assigned in such a manner that they fill, on a year-round basis, a permanent vacancy which could otherwise be filled by a permanent, regular, full-time employee.
(i)	If the job occupied by a full-time, temporary employee turns into a permanent full-time position with the Company, and the temporary employee is awarded the position, without a break in service, the seniority date of the employee will be the date on which the employee began as a full time, temporary employee. That date will be utilized as the employee's date of hire for purposes of the right to receive benefits and for the commencement of his/her probationary period. If the former temporary employee is awarded the position after a break in service of any length, his/her date of hire shall be the date on which s/he became a regular, full time employee.
(ii)	If a full-time, temporary employee is hired by the Company in any position other than that in which he or she was employed as a temporary employee, the seniority date of the employee will be the date on which the employee became a regular full-time employee of the Company and will not include credit for any time worked as a temporary employee.
(c) A part-time employee shall be defined as one whose period of employment may continue but who works twenty-five (25) hours or less per week. It is understood that the work of part-time employees will be restricted to janitorial services in the office and the plant, yards and grounds maintenance and the loading and unloading of trucks and that two (2) or more part-time employees shall not be hired for the purpose of displacing a regular full-time employee.
Section 3: The Company will maintain an up-to-date seniority list, one copy of which shall be posted on the bulletin board and another given to the president of the Union. Such posted list shall be revised as names are added and/or deleted. An up-to-date seniority list shall be posted and a copy thereof given to the president of the Union within thirty (30) calendar days after a change has been made thereon. The names of all employees who have completed their
8
probationary periods shall be listed on the seniority list in order of the dates upon which they were hired as employees, starting with the senior employee at the top of the list. The first day worked by an employee shall be considered as the date upon which s/he was hired. If two (2) or more employees are hired on the same day, their names shall appear on the seniority list alphabetically by the first letter or letters of their last name. If two (2) or more employees have the same last name, the same procedure shall be followed with respect to their first names.
Section 4: When it is necessary to reduce the number of employees in a department, the employee scheduled for lay off shall be the employee with the least plant-wide seniority in said department provided always the remaining employees in said department have the then present ability to perform the remaining duties and responsibilities. The employee so removed from the department can then exercise his/her plant-wide seniority to replace the least senior employee on a plant-wide basis provided always that that employee has the then present ability to replace such least-senior employee. If the employee removed from a department cannot perform the duties of the least-senior employee on a plant-wide basis, then s/he shall exercise his/her plant-wide seniority on an ascending order of the seniority list. If s/he replaces an employee by such process, that employee may replace the least senior employee on a plant-wide basis on an ascending order.
(a)	If, during a period of layoff, a permanent vacancy exists in a job classification which is not filled after being posted for bidding, the laid off employee with the most plant-wide seniority who has the then present ability with only simple instructions to satisfactorily perform the required work shall be recalled to fill such vacancy. If there is no laid off employee who has such present ability, then employees, in line with their seniority, will be offered recall with training as provided for in Section 6 of this Article.
(b)	If, during a period of layoff, a temporary vacancy exists in other than the laid off employee's own department, the laid off employee with the most plant-wide seniority who has the present ability with only simple instructions to satisfactorily perform the required work shall be offered the opportunity to fill such temporary vacancy. When work is again available in such employee's own department s/he must return thereto. It is understood that for temporary vacancies which are not to exceed five (5) regularly scheduled working days, the Company may elect to cover the same as provided in Section 11 of this Article.
Section 5: When it becomes necessary to fill a new, permanent job classification or a permanent vacancy in an existing job classification, a notice of such opening or vacancy shall be posted on the plant bulletin boards for a period of three (3) regularly scheduled working days during which time employees interested in being considered for such opening or vacancy may so indicate by signing such posting. The opening or vacancy shall be filled on the basis of seniority and ability in the following manner:
9
(a) If the vacancy is such as requires an employee with the then present skills and ability to satisfactorily perform the job requirements (skilled tradesmen or trick miller) and no employee signing such posting possesses the then present skills and ability to do so, the Company shall have the right to hire new employees with the appropriate skills and qualifications for such job classification.
(1) When a permanent vacancy occurs in the Trick Miller classification, all current Trick Millers and Alternate Millers shall be given the first opportunity to bid for the vacancy and all other mill employees except for Utility Persons will be given the second opportunity to bid for the vacancy.
(b) If, under subsection (a) above, the Company is unable to hire a new employee with the appropriate skills and qualifications for such job classification, or if it is not required that the opening or vacancy be filled by an employee with the then present skills and ability, then such opening or vacancy shall be posted for a period of three (3) regularly scheduled working days indicating thereon that the provisions of Section 6 of this Article shall apply to the successful bidder and the opening or vacancy shall be awarded to the bidding employee with the most plant-wide seniority who can readily learn to perform the requirements of the job classification. It is the Company's intention that an employee thus awarded the job shall be transferred thereto promptly. However, it is understood that when a chain of bidding results from an initial bid such transfer may be delayed until after the identity of all successful bidders in such chain of bids is ascertained.
Section 6: Whenever an employee is awarded a job through the bidding procedure as provided in Section 5, s/he shall have a fair trial period of not to exceed fifteen (15) regularly scheduled working days [except, in the case of the Bulk Operator, Alternate Bulk Operator and Alternate Shift Packer such period shall not exceed sixty (60) regularly scheduled working days and, in the case of Trick Miller and/or Alternate Miller and Maintenance classifications, such period shall not exceed ninety (90) regularly scheduled working days in which to demonstrate that s/he has the aptitude for and will be able to readily learn to perform the job requirements to the extent that s/he is entitled to remain in such job classification. This Section shall not be construed to mean that an employee who obviously will be unable to perform the job requirements in an acceptable manner will be given such a trial period, nor that any employee who demonstrates during such trial period that s/he does not have the aptitude for or will not be able to readily learn to perform the job requirements in an acceptable manner will be allowed to remain on such job for the full time above specified.
(a)	If an employee who has been awarded a job as above provided fails to satisfactorily complete the trial period or disqualifies himself/herself on such job
10
within fourteen (14) days of starting the new job, s/he shall be returned to the job classification from which s/he bid and the next less senior employee who has the ability to readily learn to perform the requirements of the job classification who had signed for such posted vacancy shall be awarded the job and shall be subject to the provisions set forth in this Section.
(b)	If an employee fails to satisfactorily complete the trial period or disqualifies himself/herself during such trial period on two (2) successive occasions within a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, s/he shall not be permitted to again bid during the six (6) months period following the second set back. For the purpose of this subsection self-disqualification shall be deemed to be the same as failure to satisfactorily complete a trial period.
Section 7:	In order to hold the classifications of Trick Miller or Alternate Miller an employee must have successfully completed the International Association of Operative Millers correspondence courses in Flour Milling within three (3) years of his/her hire date, or the date the employee was awarded the job. Additionally, employees must have successfully completed the short course in milling at Kansas State University within five (5) years of the date the employee was awarded the job. If the employee fails to successfully complete the courses within these time limits s/he may be removed from the position and permanently disqualified from both positions. Such employees may exercise their bumping rights in accordance with Article VI, Section 4.
(a) The Company will pay Trick Millers and Alternate Millers who have successfully completed the International Association of Operative Millers correspondence course in flour milling and the Kansas State University short course the following incremental increases in their base rate of pay:
(i)	A one and one-quarter percent (1 1/4%) increase upon the successful completion of each of the eight (8) units of the IAOM correspondence course; and
(ii)	A three percent (3%) increase upon the successful completion of the Kansas State University short course.
(iii)	A two percent (2%) increase upon completion of five (5) years continuous experience as a miller or alternate miller and completion of the IAOM correspondence courses and Kansas State University short course.
Section 8:	In order to hold the classification of Maintenance Person, an employee must have successfully completed the training specified in the Maintenance Training Program within the time provisions so specified. If the employee fails to successfully complete the courses within the time provisions specified in the Maintenance Training Program, s/he may be removed from
11
the position and permanently disqualified from the position. Such employee may exercise his/her bumping rights in accordance with Article VI, Section 4.
(a)	Employees who hold the Maintenance Person classification shall receive the following pay increases based upon their successful completion of the Company’s training program:
(i)	4% at completion of 250 credit hours within 2 ^ year maximum
time limit.
(ii)	An additional 4% at completion of 500 credit hours within 2 ^ years maximum time period following the completion of 250 credit hours.
(iii)	An additional 4% at completion of 750 credit hours within 2 ^ years maximum time period following the completion of 500 credit hours.
(iv)	An additional 6% at completion of the Maintenance Mechanic Program within 2 ^ years maximum time period following the completion of 750 credit hours.
(b)	The time limits begin at the completion of the employee’s probationary period for the maintenance position as outlined in Article VI, Section 2 and Section 6.
Section 9:	Any employee classified as, or who successfully bids into, the positions of Elevator Operator, Bulk Operator, Trick Miller, Alternate Miller, Alternate Bulk Operator, Shift Packer or Alternate Shift Packer, must possess or obtain within ninety (90) days of being awarded a job in one of the above classifications, certification as a Commercial Pesticide Applicator (with commodity endorsement) and Warehouse Persons must possess or obtain certification as a Commercial Pesticide Applicator (with right of way endorsement) and must possess or obtain a chauffeur’s license in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by an agency or department of the State of Michigan or federal government. The ninety (90) day period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Union and management.

Section 1:	An employee who has completed his/her probationary period may be granted a leave of absence without pay for personal reasons for a period of not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days without loss of seniority, provided in the judgment of the Company, s/he can be spared from his/her work and provided s/he obtained advance written permission from the Company. In the event of a compelling need, the Company may extend such leave of absence without loss of seniority for a reasonable amount of time. Leaves of absence will not be given for the purpose of enabling any employee to work for another employer and any employee who works for another employer during a leave of absence without having received advance written permission from the Union and the Company to so work shall be discharged. A leave of absence will only be granted under this Section after an employee has exhausted his/her vacation days.

14
necessity therefor and provided further that s/he supplies the Company with a certificate from a medical doctor of the necessity for such absence and for the continuation of such absence when the same is requested by the Company. In the event the employee demonstrates that because of such disability s/he is unable to regularly and/or safely perform the job requirements of a job classification s/he shall be given such leave of absence as of the date his/her inability to do so has been demonstrated to the Company. The Union will be notified of any such leaves of absence. It is understood and agreed that the Company may require certification from the employee's medical doctor certifying to the employee's physical fitness to return to work following such leave of absence.
Section 3:	Leaves of absence shall be granted, without loss of seniority, to regular employees who are active in the National Guard or a branch of the Armed Forces Reserves of the United States for the purpose of fulfilling their annual field training obligations and when called out due to temporary civil disturbances.

Immediate family shall be defined as an employee's current spouse, children, stepchildren, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother or sister. The definition of immediate family is also to include step-parent; however, the provisions of this section are to be restricted to one father and one mother, whether a biological parent or step-parent. The three (3) days above referred to shall end not later than the day of the funeral and to be eligible for such pay the employee must notify the Company as soon as possible of the necessity for such absence, must attend the funeral and, if requested by the Company, must present proof of death.
(a)	Regular employees, who at the time have completed their probationary period, shall be allowed one day off without pay to attend the funeral of a grandparent. For purposes of this Subsection (a), grandparent is defined as the mother or father
15
of the employee's mother or father. The employee must attend the funeral and, if requested by the Company, must present proof of death.
(b)	Regular employees, who at the time have completed their probationary period, shall be allowed one day off with pay to attend the funeral of a brother-in-law or sister-in-law as those relationships are defined in Black's Law Dictionary.

Section 6:	When daily overtime is to be worked, the Company will endeavor to give the employee involved reasonable advance notice, if possible. The opportunity to work the same shall be offered to the employees within the department where the work is available who have the job classification associated with the work to be performed and who are working the shift that immediately precedes or follows the time when the overtime is to be performed. Otherwise, the work shall be offered on a seniority basis to employees within the department where the work is available who have the then present ability to satisfactorily perform the same. Finally, the work shall be offered on a seniority basis to employees in the plant who have the then present ability to satisfactorily perform the same. Senior employees with such present ability may waive the opportunity to work a daily overtime assignment provided a less senior employee with the then present ability is available to work it.
17
Section 7:	When it becomes necessary to assign weekend overtime, the opportunity to work the same shall be first offered to the employees within the affected department who have the then-present ability to perform the work on a plant-wide seniority basis. Senior employees with such present ability may waive the opportunity to work such weekend overtime provided a less senior employee within the department with the then-present ability is available to work it.
(a)	When weekend overtime is to be worked, the Company will endeavor to give the employee involved reasonable advance notice, if possible. If the Company notifies employees by posting a bulletin board notice at or before 1:30 p.m. on the preceding Thursday that weekend overtime is scheduled, the Company shall have the right to require such employees to work the overtime.
(b)	Whenever possible, the Alternate Miller will fill in for an employee in the milling department who is sick or on vacation unless the Alternate Miller already has worked eight (8) hours in that day.
(c)	When the mill is operating and weekend overtime is required, the mill employees will work their current shift.

Section 9:	In the case where an employee has made a commitment to overtime work and then is unable to meet such commitment and thereby causes the Company to get a replacement, s/he shall automatically lose his/her next opportunity to perform overtime work unless so assigned by the Company. An employee shall be excused from his/her commitment to overtime work, and shall not lose his/her next opportunity to perform overtime, if his/her inability to perform such overtime work results from the utilization of funeral leave, leave for jury duty, or leave for national guard or reserve duty.
Section 10:	Regular full-time employees who have the then-present ability to perform the work will be offered available overtime on a plant-wide seniority basis before temporary employees are given the opportunity for overtime subject to the following conditions:
18
(a)	Harvest time temporaries will be entitled to overtime during the regular work week and during the hours that the elevator is open to receive wheat on the weekends. Regular full-time employees, however, will be given priority for overtime opportunities on each day of the weekend when the elevator is not receiving wheat.

Regular full-time employees will be given priority for all overtime opportunities, both weekend and weekday, over non-harvest time temporary employees.
(b)	Overtime opportunities will be given to regular full-time employees based upon their plant-wide seniority, provided they have the then-present ability to perform the available work.
(c)	Regular full-time employees will be paid, for purposes of calculating overtime, the base rate of pay set forth in the contract for the job actually worked rather than for the classification they hold on a permanent basis.
(d)	The Company will designate the work available for overtime. The employee will not select the overtime work s/he wishes to perform.
ARTICLE IX - WAGES
Section 1:	The job classifications and hourly rates of pay therefor are set forth in Appendix A and by this reference made a part hereof.
(a) When, during the life of this Agreement, the management establishes a new job classification, a copy of the job description of the new job classification and the rate of pay that has been set therefor shall be given to the chairman of the Union's committee. If the Union questions the adequacy of the rate set for such new job on the basis of its relationship with the rates of pay and job content of other jobs then in existence in the operations, the Union's committee shall have the right to negotiate with management with respect to such rate. If no mutually satisfactory agreement with respect thereto has been arrived at within ten (10) regularly scheduled working days after the Union receives the above referred-to job description and notice of rate, the matter may be referred to the grievance procedure starting at the Second Step thereof and may be appealed through arbitration. In the event the resulting rate exceeds that set by management at the outset, the new rate of pay shall be retroactive to the date the new job was established or, if new equipment is involved, retroactive to the date the equipment was cleared for productive operations.
19
Section 2:	It is understood and agreed that in return for wages, fringes and working conditions specified in this labor Agreement, employees shall be required to render a fair day's work for the Company.

Section 8:	It is understood and agreed that there shall be no duplication or pyramiding of overtime or any other premium payments under this Agreement.

20
such employee is put to work, s/he shall be guaranteed a minimum of four (4) hours of work or four (4) hours of straight time pay in lieu thereof. This reporting pay provision shall not apply when failure to have work available for such reporting employee is due to causes beyond the control of the Company, is due to a civil disturbance, threat or rumor thereof, nor shall it apply if the employee has been advised in advance that there would be no work, was not reasonably available to receive such notice, has no telephone, or when offered work for such four (4) hour period refused to perform the same.
Section 10:	An employee who is called in to perform work at a time other than that for which s/he had previously been scheduled shall be guaranteed a minimum of three (3) hours of work or in the absence thereof a minimum of three (3) hours of straight time pay at his/her classification rate. If the employee works more than three (3) hours when called in to perform work at a time other than that for which s/he had previously been scheduled, the employee shall receive an additional one (1) hour of straight time pay at his/her classification rate. This provision does not apply to employees who were previously scheduled to come in to perform a specific task, who were scheduled to start work prior to their regular starting time or who may be retained after their regular quitting time nor shall it apply to employees who are called in for periods of less than three (3) hours prior to the start of their shift but who continue to work their regular shift thereafter.
Section 11:	When an employee bids, bumps or is temporarily transferred under the terms of this Agreement, the following provisions shall apply with respect to the applicable rate of pay:
(a)	When, through the bidding procedure, an employee is awarded a job for which the hourly rate of pay is higher than the rate s/he was receiving at the time of bidding, such employee shall, for the fair trial period (as stated in Article VI, Section 6), continue to receive his/her present rate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the employee successfully bids from a lower paid position to the positions of Trick Miller, Alternate Miller, Bulk Operator or Maintenance, the employee' s rate of pay shall remain at his/her previous level for sixty (60) regularly scheduled working days. At the end of said period, the employee shall be advanced to the hourly rate applicable to the job for which s/he bid. If, in the supervisor's judgment the employee is fully qualified to satisfactorily perform all phases of such job prior to the end of such period, such employee will be advanced to the hourly rate applicable to the job as of that time.
(b)	When an employee bumps into or through the bidding procedure an employee is awarded a job for which the hourly rate of pay is less than the hourly rate for the job from which s/he bumps, such employee shall thereupon receive the hourly rate of pay applicable to the job onto which s/he thus bids or bumps.
21
(c)	When an employee is temporarily transferred for the convenience of the Company as provided for in Section 11 of Article VI, such employee shall receive the rate of pay s/he was receiving on his/her own job or the rate applicable to the job classification to which s/he is so transferred, whichever is the greater.
Section 12:	Payday shall be on or about Thursday noon for the week ending on the preceding Sunday, except when because a holiday occurs on any of the first three days in the week, the paychecks cannot be available by that time, in which event payday will be on or about Friday noon.
Section 13: The Company agrees for the life of this Agreement, to maintain the level of group insurance benefits currently in place subject to the provisions of this section. The Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits shall be nineteen thousand ($19,000) dollars. The Group Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment and Health coverage will cease upon an employee's retirement. The Sick and Accident weekly benefit shall be fixed at the sum of $310.00, but the benefit level may not exceed 66 2/3% of the employee's basic compensation received from the Company. The Company agrees to pay the entire cost of the Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Sickness and Accident insurance during the term of this Agreement. Each employee shall make a monthly contribution to the Company for his/her health and hospitalization and dental insurance coverage as set forth below in this section. The sum contributed will be deducted in equal amounts from the employee's first four weekly paychecks of each month. The amount of the monthly contribution will be determined using a “pooling method” as outlined below.
In order to determine the employee’s share of the premiums, a pool will be created by multiplying the total number of employee participants in the Health and Hospitalization and Dental plans (Participants) by $850.00. The amount in the pool will be recalculated on January 1 of each year by multiplying the number of employee participants at that date by $850.00. If the dollar value of the pool exceeds the actual cost of the Health and Hospitalization and Dental insurance, an employee’s monthly contribution will remain at $50 for Single coverage, $90 for Two-Person coverage and $110 for Family coverage. If the dollar value of the pool is less than the actual cost of the Health and Hospitalization and Dental insurance (a ‘deficit’), the monthly contribution amount for a Single, Two-Person or Family will increase by an amount calculated using the ratio of the ‘deficit’ to the actual cost of the Health and Hospitalization and Dental insurance multiplied by the then current monthly premium for the level of insurance in which the employee participates for such coverage. An employee’s monthly contribution will be capped at and shall not exceed 15% of the then current monthly premium for the level of insurance in which the employee participates for such coverage.
An employee who opts out of the Health and Hospitalization and Dental plans completely will receive an amount equal to 20% of the monthly premium for the level of coverage for which s/he is eligible at that time. The amount will be placed in the Company’s Section 125 cafeteria plan.
22
The employee can designate the money to be placed in his/her 401(k) plan or used for reimbursement of qualified medical expenses.
(a)	For those employees who are laid off due to lack of work or on prolonged leaves of absence, the Company will pay its share of the premium for the above coverage through the month following the month in which the start of such layoff or leave of absence began. The Employee's contribution may be deducted from any check issued to the employee by the Company. In order for such employees to continue coverage beyond such time, they must make arrangements for the payment of the total premium or subscription rate for succeeding months, in which event coverage will be available to them to the extent permitted by the respective policies and/or certificates. If an employee fails to pay his/her premium within thirty (30) days of the date it is due, the insurance will be canceled.
(b)	For an employee who has seniority of four (4) years or more who is on a leave of absence necessitated by his/her own illness or injury the Company will pay its share of the premium for the above coverage for the duration of such leave or for eighteen (18) consecutive months from the start of such leave, whichever is the lesser. The employee's contribution may be deducted from any check issued to the employee by the Company. For those employees with less than four (4) years seniority, the Company will pay its share of said premiums only through the month following the month in which the start of such leave of absence began. If an employee fails to pay his/her share of the premium within thirty (30) days of the date it is due, the insurance will be canceled.
(c)	With respect to new hires and the rehire of persons having no seniority, after the completion of forty-five (45) work days of regular, full time employment, the Company shall be required to pay the cost of individual employee medical insurance coverage, dental insurance, Sick and Accident, Life Insurance and Accidental Death and Dismemberment coverage as provided in this Agreement. It shall be the employee's responsibility to pay the cost of spousal and dependent coverage for the first six (6) months upon completing his/her probationary period. At the end of the six (6) month period, the Company shall be required to provide the same insurance coverage as is afforded other employees. This Section shall not affect any of the provisions of Article IX, Section 13. The benefits and benefit levels are provided subject to the employee's individual ability to meet the qualifications for coverage established by the insurance carriers themselves. It is the intention of the Company only to make the coverage available, and pay the premiums negotiated in this contract for that coverage. The Company cannot guarantee that each and every employee will qualify for the coverage.
23
(d)	The Company shall have the right to change insurance carriers and coverage during the term of this Agreement in its discretion, after prior notice and consultation with the Union, and provided that the coverage does not materially change the coverage currently provided.
Section 14: The present 401(k) plan for regular, full-time employees who have completed their probationary period shall continue in effect for the duration of this Agreement. The Company will contribute fifty-five cents (550) per compensated hour (not to exceed 40 hours per week) into each employee’s 401(k) account.
Section 15: The present 401(k) plan for hourly rated employees shall continue in effect for the duration of this agreement. The Company will contribute a 50% match up to an employee’s contribution of 500 per hour (maximum employer contribution of 250 per hour).
Section 16: After completion of twenty-six (26) weeks of continuous, permanent full-time employment, an employee is entitled to share in the bonus program. Semi-annual bonus payments will be made on the paydays preceding Memorial Day and Thanksgiving Day. The bonus payments will be a percentage of an employee's gross earnings for a six (6) month period from the last bonus qualification date. The bonus paid in May will be based upon the employee's gross earnings for the preceding November through the final pay day in April. The bonus paid in November will be based upon the employee's gross earnings for the preceding May through the final pay day in October.
(a)	An employee who completes more than twenty-six (26) weeks of continuous fulltime employment and is employed on the bonus qualification date, (i.e. final pay day in April or October), is entitled to share in the bonus program based on his/her plant-wide seniority, measured on the bonus qualification date, according to the following schedule:

However, if this cannot be done, arrangements will be made for a date as near to that requested as is possible. If the employee selects a day other than his/her actual birthday for the holiday, the double time provision for work performed on a holiday shall not apply to work performed on his/her actual birthday.
(2)	An employee may take a birthday holiday off with pay prior to the date of his/her actual birthday subject to the following conditions:
(i)	If the employee quits, is discharged or is laid off after having taken the birthday holiday in advance of his/her actual birthday, the Company may deduct from his/her last paycheck an amount equal to the pay s/he received for the birthday holiday.

(iv)	The advance birthday holiday may be taken only if, in the opinion of the Company, production requirements permit.
(b)	In each year that Christmas falls on a Thursday, the following Friday shall be a paid holiday.
(c)	Employees shall be entitled to one (1) paid personal day off during each contract year, provided that at least one (1) week advance notice is given to the Employer and the employee has completed his/her probationary period.

(b)	In any event, such physical examination shall not be used to deny the return of an employee to work because of a physical disability or condition existing prior to the absence which did not impair the employee's ability to satisfactorily perform his/her job assignments, unless during the period of absence such pre-existing condition was aggravated so as to render him/her less able to satisfactorily perform, his/her job assignments.
Section 7:	Employees who, because of illness or injury become physically disabled to the point where they are unable to satisfactorily perform the job duties of their classification may be permanently transferred to a job in their department occupied by an employee with less plantwide seniority which they have the then present ability to satisfactorily perform with only simple instructions.

Section 9: The Company shall have the right to designate lead persons in those areas, at such times and for such duration as it deems necessary.

APPENDIX “B” KNAPPEN MILLING CO.
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM AND POLICY
(1)	Knappen Milling Co. (the “Company”) and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers, Local 3-G (the “Union”) recognize that the presence and influence of drugs and alcohol in the workplace is inconsistent with employee safety and the efficient operation of the factory.
(2)	Company policy prohibits the presence of illegal drugs on Company premises and prohibits employees from selling, using, possessing, working or attempting to work after using or ingesting illegal drugs or alcohol as well as unauthorized selling, transferring, purchasing or abusing prescription or other legal drugs (hereinafter, the term “drug(s)” shall include illegal, prescription, and legal drugs).
(3)	Company policy prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages in the workplace and the consumption of alcoholic beverages in association with the workplace.
(4)	When an employee is found violating this policy, or when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is violating this policy, the employee may be disciplined up to and including discharge, subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
(5)	“Reasonable Suspicion” is the observance of abnormal or unusual on-duty behavior of an individual employee which:
(a)	is observed on-duty by a supervisor trained to recognize the symptoms of drug abuse, impairment or intoxication, and confirmed by another observer (which observations shall be documented by the supervisor); and
(b)	is the type of behavior which is recognized and accepted symptom of intoxication or impairment caused by controlled substances or alcohol or addiction to or dependence upon said controlled substances.
(c)	is not reasonably explained as resulting from causes other than the use of controlled substances (such as, but not by way of limitation, fatigue, lack of sleep, side effect of prescription or over-the-counter medications, reaction to noxious fumes or smoke, etc.)
(d)	is observed to have engaged in conduct which the Company reasonably believes to be in violation of this policy.
40
(e)	is involved in a personal injury accident while working involving off site medical care or treatment.
(6)	As an alternative to discipline for violating this policy, the Company, at its discretion, may do one or more of the following:
(a)	counsel the employee,
(b)	require the employee to submit a urine specimen to test for the presence of drugs, or
(c)	require the employee to submit a breath sample to test for the presence of alcohol.
“Counsel” shall mean the opportunity to meet with the Factory Manager and the Union Committee.
(7)	The collection of urine samples for drug tests will be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the collection clinic designated by the Company.
(8)	The Company wishes to protect the dignity of the employee. Employees who attempt to, or actually provide adulterated or false samples, or who attempt to or actually circumvent the testing process will be terminated.
(9)	Breath and urine specimens shall be drawn or collected at the laboratory, hospital or medical facility at which the specimen is to be tested or prepared for testing.
(10)	The testing shall be done by a NIDA certified laboratory.
(11)	Employees asked to provide samples for drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy will be required to cooperate and to sign a consent form (see Attachment 1) as a condition of continued employment. Objections may be raised by the employee or the Union, but will be subject to the “comply now and grieve later” doctrine.
(12)	The Company will direct that split samples be taken with the confirming test to be a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). If the first test and confirmation test on the first sample are positive and the employee elects to have the second sample tested, the Company will pay for the cost of the second test. If the employee elects to have the split sample tested, the Company will advise the laboratory selected by the employee of the Union.
(13)	The Company will determine if the employee asked to take a drug or alcohol test should be permitted to work during the time between providing the sample and the receipt of the
41
test results. If the employee has been directed by the Company not to work during this time, but to remain on an unpaid leave of absence and the reason is solely because of the pendency of the drug or alcohol test and the test results prove to be negative, the employee will be compensated as though he or she had not been suspended.
(14)	The Company will advise the Union if it becomes aware of a change in laboratories in which the testing is done or if it becomes aware of a change in laboratory procedures including any changes in the laboratory’s certification. The purpose of this is to permit the Union to understand the procedures. The failure of the Company to advise the Union of these changes will not invalidate an otherwise properly conducted drug or alcohol test.
(15)	In the event an employee tests positive for drugs or at a blood alcohol level of .05% or more, or the employee admits violating this policy after being asked to submit to a drug or alcohol test, the employee must sign a “Last Chance Agreement.” (see Attachment 2). If the employee refuses to sign the Last Chance Agreement, the employee will be terminated.
(a)	The Last Chance Agreement requires an employee to participate in a Company and Union approved employee assistance program (EAP) as a condition of continued employment.

PURPOSE
To define discrimination, harassment and retaliation, and to outline the complaint procedure for employees who feel they have been subjected to harassment, discrimination or retaliation. Although disputes regarding the meaning, interpretation or application of this policy are not subject to the grievance procedure in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Union is not precluded from filing a grievance in the event that one of its members is subjected to discipline as a result of a violation of this policy.
SCOPE
This policy applies to any supervisor, agent, or employee of the Company.
POLICY
In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at Knappen Milling Company will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities.

Knappen will reasonably accommodate religious beliefs of qualified applicants and employees unless providing such an accommodation creates an undue hardship for the Company.
Knappen is committed to complying with all applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and the Michigan Persons with Disabilities Civil Rights Act (“PWDCRA”). The Company will not discriminate against any qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment because the employee suffers from a disability as defined by law. A reasonable accommodation will be provided to a qualified individual, as defined by the ADA and PWDCRA, who has made the Company aware of the disability and requested the accommodation in writing, provided that such accommodation does not constitute an undue hardship. Employees with a disability who believe a reasonable accommodation is needed to perform the essential functions of their job should contact Human Resources immediately.
46
DEFINITION

COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
Any employee who believes he or she has been subjected to conduct prohibited by this policy should file a written complaint on the form attached to this policy IMMEDIATELY after the incident(s) occur. If the alleged act was committed by someone other than the employee’s immediate supervisor, and that supervisor did not participate in and was unaware of the conduct, the employee should register the complaint initially with his or her immediate supervisor. If the employee is dissatisfied with the resolution by the supervisor, if the supervisor was involved in the conduct, or if the alleged harassment/discrimination continues to occur after notifying the supervisor, the employee should contact Human Resources. If the complaint is against Human Resources or the alleged harassment/discrimination continues to occur after notifying Human Resources, the employee should present his or her complaint to the Senior Vice President.
All complaints must be filed using the attached complaint form. A copy of the complaint must be filed with the Human Resources or Senior Vice President even if resolved with a supervisor. The complaint must state the facts, events and circumstances that initiated filing this complaint.

discrimination and your response must also be included in your complaint.

Any employee who has been found, after appropriate investigation by the Company, to have harassed or discriminated another employee in violation of these policies will be subject to appropriate discipline up to and including immediate discharge.
To the extent possible, all complaints will be kept confidential. However, it is the primary goal of the Company to investigate and resolve all harassment and discrimination complaints. As part of the investigation, it is possible that it will be necessary to reveal certain details and information. It is also possible that the information gathered during an investigation will be subject to subsequent legal or administrative proceedings which will require disclosure of the contents and results of the investigation.
NON-RETALIATION
