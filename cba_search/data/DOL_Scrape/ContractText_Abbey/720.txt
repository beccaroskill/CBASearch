CORPORATION and LOCAL 153, OFFICE AND PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES
INTERNATIONAL UNION, AFL-CIO ("Local 153") (hereinafter termed the "Union"):
WITNESSETH:
The parties hereto mutually covenant and agree as follows:
I.	recognition
The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE*’) and Securities Industry Automation Corporation (“SIAC") (collectively referred to as "the Employers") recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining agent with respect to wages, hours and conditions of employment of the employees in SI AC and the Operations/Clerical employees of the NYSE, excluding:
All Officers, Directors, Associate Directors and Assistant Directors; all Managers and Assistant Managers; ail Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors; ail Reviewers; Merchandising Representatives; Assistant Controllers; Accountants and Internal Auditors; Finance Specialists; Systems, Methods and Operations Coordinators; Records Administrators; Purchasing Agents; Economists; all Executive Assistants; Special Assistants; and Administrative Assistants; all Investigators; all Listing, Institutional and Exchange Representatives; Brokerage Cost Specialists and Segregation Specialists; all Office Inspectors; ail Examiners; Training Specialists; all Analysts, Communication Engineers; Computer Engineers; programmers and Programming Coordinators; Account Coordinators; Senior Console Operators; al) Guards, Security Officers and Watchpersons; Chief and Assistant Chief Engineers; Construction Supervisors; ail Superintendents and Assistant Superintendents; Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs of Inspection; Chief Carpenter; Chief Cleaner and Assistant Chief Cleaner; Chief Starters; Assistant Chief Starters; Chief Annunciator Mechanics; Chief and Assistant Chief Electricians; Chief Electrician; Chief Elevator Mechanics; Chief Mechanics; Chief Painters; Head Porters; Assistant Head Porters; Chief Librarian; S.E.C. Librarian; Research Assistants; Research Associates; Arbitration Directors;
Committee Reporters; Chief Gallery Receptionists; all Editors, Assistant Editors and Writers; Chief and Assistant Chief Operators; Head Tape Utility Persons, all Cashiers, Lawyers; Secretary for the Market Surveillance Special Counsel; all employees employed in the Office of the Chairman, the Office of the Genera) Counsel and Human Resources Division; all other executive, supervisory, and professional employees; all confidential secretaries and stenographers; all part-time employees; all employees on a trial or probationary basis as provided in Paragraph 3 of this Agreement; all employees employed on a stated temporary basis.
The fact the jobs listed above have been excluded from the unit does not preclude the Union from seeking to have them added to the unit through NLRB certification or by mutual agreement; it being understood that means proscribed by Paragraph 14 of this contract will not be employed to obtain such recognition.
The above employees of the Employers, other than those employees excluded, are
hereinafter termed "Employees."
The Employers will not permanently transfer all the work in a job classification to supervision nor will they permanently transfer a substantia! portion (20% cumulatively or more) of work in a job classification to supervision.
Persons whose services may from time to time be contracted for by the Employers from outside organizations are not employees of the Employers and such persons are not covered by any of the terms of this Agreement even though they may perform the same services in a department of NYSE or SIAC as those performed by Employees covered by this Agreement.
This Agreement is not intended to cover or otherwise apply to enterprises such as various regional stock exchanges and related or unrelated clearing corporations which NYSE and/or SIAC may acquire and/or operate. This Agreement does not preclude the Union from seeking recognition as representative of the employees working in such "acquired", "merged"
2
and/or "operated" enterprise through NLRB certification or by mutual agreement; it being understood that means proscribed by Paragraph 14 of this Agreement will not be employed to obtain such recognition.
Employees, in any enterprise acquired, merged, or operated by NYSE and/or SIAC, who thereafter by the terms of this Agreement or "accretion" as that term is defined in the NLRA are represented by the Union, will retain their previous enterprise seniority as it relates to benefits eligibility (except in the case of Pension), but for all other purposes, seniority will be computed from the date of the acquisition, merger, or operation.
Temporary employees will not be obtained by the Employers for the purpose of causing the dismissal of any member of the bargaining unit. Nothing in this Paragraph, however, shall be deemed to restrict the employment of temporary employees for any other reason. Si AC will use its best efforts to limit the use of temporaries.
2.	SENIORITY, ETC.
In promoting Employees to job classifications covered by this contract, NYSE or SIAC will follow seniority where, in good faith, it concludes that all other factors such as efficiency and special needs of the department and the Employee's ability, fitness and employment records are equal. In the NYSE Floor Operations' classifications and in all classifications at SIAC, employees so promoted shall be on a trial or probationary basis for a period of 30 days of actual work. During this trial or probationary period, the Employer may return the employee to his or her former position or the employee may return to his or her former position at the pay and benefit level of the former position. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 11, the same policy shall apply to dismissals or demotions occasioned by reduction in
the number of Employees in any job classification in any department or section, but not to discharge for cause, nor (o the retirement of any Employee on his Normal Retirement Date. The provisions of this Paragraph shall have no application to promotions made to supervisory, executive or professional positions.
Subject to any limitations established by this Agreement, NYSE and SIAC shall be free to hire, promote, demote or transfer any Employee. When a vacancy is to be filled in the bargaining unit, including all entry level vacancies at SIAC, and except for any positions on the Trading floors of the NYSE or entry level positions in NYSE, notice will be posted throughout the respective organization for five days so that employees will be able to express their interest in filling it. The Employer involved will notify the Business Representative with a copy of all job postings on the day of posting. NYSE and SIAC shall be free to suspend, or discharge, any employee who does not perform the duties assigned to him/her in a manner satisfactory to it and/or suspend or discharge any employee for any other just and sufficient cause. Any employee interviewed during the course of an investigation which may lead to discipline, suspension or discharge of said employee will be informed of his/her right to be represented by a Shop Steward and, if requested by said employee, the employer will make a Shop Steward available al the interview.
For the purposes of computing seniority in connection with a promotion or demotion in any department or section from one job classification to another job classification the seniority of the Employees in such job classification in such department or section (to the extent that seniority is taken into consideration in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph 2) shall be based on the length of service of such Employees in the particular job classification within such department or section, except that, in the case of the stock reserve
4
squad, the service of the members of such squad in other differential pay job classifications in the Department of Floor Operations since August 27, 1945 (the date the stock reserve squad was created in its present form) shall be counted.
For the purpose of determining seniority in connection with a dismissal of an Employee occasioned by a reduction in the number of Employees in any job classification in any department or section or occasioned by the elimination of any job classification or classifications in any department or section, the seniority of the Employees who are in such job classification in such department or section (to the extent that seniority is taken into consideration in accordance with the provisions of this Paragraph 2) shall be based on the length of combined consecutive service of such Employees with their respective Empluycis (NYSE or SIAC).
In computing seniority for any purpose, no credit shall be given for any prior period or periods of employment, except that (he seniority of an Employee who is rehired within six months of the termination ofhis/her prior employment shall be calculated from the date of his/her re-employment and there shall be added thereto the seniority standing to his/her credit on the date of the termination ofhis/her last prior employment.
Except as provided in the preceding sub-paragraph of this Paragraph 2, in computing for any purpose seniority of Employees of the Real Estate Department of NYSE or of Employees of the Communications Department of NYSE (now a part of SIAC), the service of such Employees as Employees of the NYSE Building Company or as Employees of the New York Quotation Company shall be counted.
Job classifications within each department or section as referred to in this Agreement mean the individual positions listed in Paragraph 4 of this Agreement, provided,
5
however, that for the purpose of dismissals occasioned by reduction in the number of Employees in any job classification in the Department of Floor Operations, all Senior Floor Employees shall be deemed to be in the same job classification.
Any Employees transferred among the Employers will retain seniority for benefits.
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement are subject to the provisions of the so-called "Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act" and other applicable Jaws, and rules and regulations thereunder whether now or hereafter enacted or amended, relating to the obligations of Employers and the rights of Employees.
3.	TRIAL period
Effective April 30, 2002, persons engaged by NYSE or SIAC shall be on a trial or probationary basis for a period of ninety (90) days of actual work and none of the provisions of this Agreement shall apply to such Employees during such ninety day period of actual work. If retained after such ninety (90) day period of actual work, such persons shall be considered as Employees covered by the provisions of this Agreement, with a period of service retroactive to the date of their employment. At the NYSE, Employees will be eligible for health and life insurance coverage on the first day of the month following the end of the trial period at the NYSE.

Subject only to the limitation that the total regularly scheduled working hours a week without overtime pay for any classification of Employees shall not be established at more than 37J6 hours a week, nor the working hours a day without over-time pay at more than 7'/i hours a day'the Employer involved shall have the right at any time, or from time to time, to change the arriving time, leaving time, lunch time, working hours per day and/or week and the working days in a week of any one or more Employees or classification of Employees, to the extent that the Employer involved deems such change necessary or advisable because of the shortening, lengthening or changing of the trading days or hours of NYSE or for any other reason whatsoever. The Employer involved shall promptly notify the Union of any change in the total regularly scheduled working hours a week of any entire classification of Employees. When practicable, two calendar weeks' notice will be given to the Union before scheduled arriving times, leaving times or lunch times are changed by a Department Head.
Subject to the mandatory overtime limitation provisions set forth in the succeeding sub-paragraph, NYSE or SIAC may require any Employee to work overtime. The supervisor directing such overtime shall first make an attempt to fill the overtime requirement by seeking qualified volunteers from the Employees In the classification required to do the work in the affected section. Employees required to work overtime shall receive overtime pay for work performed in any calendar week in excess of the total working hours from time to time established in accordance with this Paragraph, except that no overtime pay shall be received by an Employee in the Department of Floor Operations for less than one-half hour's work beyond
28
the normal leaving time on any given day unless more than 37J4 hours are worked by such Employee in such calendar week.11

mandatory overtime beyond 10 hours during week days and 8 hours on Saturday or Sunday.

15	In the event that trading hours at NYSE are expanded, the overtime pay bar that applies to floor overtime of
under 30 minutes daily will be lifted; it being understood Chat such expansion of trading would most probably cause NYSE w exercise its right to extend the floor workweek beyond 33-3/4 hours in which case employees shall be paid additional straight time pay up to 37-1/2 hours per week. The hourly rate for the additional straight time shall be computed by dividing the weekly salary by 33-3/4 hours.

For the purpose of such computation, the Employee shall be allowed a credit equal to his or her norma! working hours for time when he or she was on sick leave approved and paid for in full by the Employer involved.
The regular hourly rate for any Employee shall be his or her regular weekly salary divided by the total working hours from time to time established in accordance with this Paragraph.
The rate of overtime pay for any Employee shall be that Employee’s regular hourly rate for all work performed in excess of his or her normal weekly working hours from time to time established in accordance with this Paragraph but not in excess of 37'/? hours, and at the rate of overtime pay for work performed in a calendar week in excess of 3716 hours shall be one and one-half times that Employee's regular hourly rate, except that if such overtime work of an Employee whose total working hours a week is less than 37 7; hours is in performance of other than the usual duties of such Employee or is in SIAC or in an office department or section, then the rate of overtime pay shall be such rale as may be mutually agreed upon between the
30
employee and the Employer involved provided* however, that, in any case, the rate of overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 3 7 id hours in any week shall be one and one-half times the rate paid for 37’/? hours.
If an Employee is required to work more than twelve consecutive hours the rate of overtime pay for those hours in excess oftweive consecutive hours shall be two times that employee's regular hourly rate, except that no overtime pay will be paid unless the hours worked by the Employee in that week exceeds his/her then normal scheduled work hours.

54
Step 1. The Union Representative for the particular department or section may at any time within five full business days after the occurrence of the incident or event giving rise to the grievance take the grievance up with the immediate supervisor or manager to whom the Employee concerned reports, it being understood that the Employee may be present at this meeting. If the grievance is not settled within two full business days after it is taken up with such supervisor or manager, then,

Steps 1 and 2 shall not apply to grievances brought by an Employer and such grievances shall be filed in writing by an officer of the Employer involved with an officer of the Union.

The Employer involved shall promptly on the receipt of such statement of grievance, or promptly on the submission by it of a grievance to the Union, appoint a representative or representatives to meet with a designated official of the Union, together with the Chief Steward for the affected Employer and the Union representative for the particular department or section. The Employer shall submit a written answer of the third step grievance meeting to the Union. If such grievance cannot be satisfactorily adjusted within four full business days after its submission in writing to the other party, pursuant to this Step 3, then, unless the grievance is not arbitrable under the terms of this Agreement,

Either party may within four full business days after the conclusion of Step 3, but in any event within thirty full business days after the occurrence of the incident or event giving rise io the grievance request in writing of the other party that the grievance be submitted to arbitration, provided, however, that if either party asserts that the dispute or difference is not properly a "grievance" as defined in the first sentence of this Paragraph 17, then the question of whether or not such dispute or grievance is properly arbitrable under this contract shall be first determined, either by agreement between the parties or by arbitration before a single impartial arbitrator. In such arbitration the fact that the grievance has been dealt with under the contract grievance machinery, shall not be considered by the arbitrator in determining whether or not the grievance is arbitrable under the contract. The arbitrator shall issue a separate award with respect to arbitrability and his/her award shall precede consideration by him/her of the merits of the dispute. If the arbitrator finds the dispute arbitrable he/she may after issuing an award to that effect proceed to hear and determine the merits of the grievance. The arbitrator shall be selected by the parties pursuant to the rules and regulations of the American Arbitration Association. Upon the submission of a grievance to arbitration, the arbitrator shall give the parties an
56
opportunity to be heard and io offer evidence with respect to such dispute. After such hearing, the arbitrator shall as promptly as possible, but in any event, within 20 days after the close of such hearing, decide the aforesaid grievance. Such decision shall be final and conclusive upon the parties thereto, all of which agree to abide by such decision.

Except that either of the first two steps of the grievance machinery may be bypassed by the Union, unless objected to by the Employer involved, the failure of the party asserting a grievance to follow this grievance machinery, to file a statement of the grievance, to hold a meeting of representatives, or to request the submission of such grievance to arbitration within the times specified above, shall, unless consented to in writing by the other party, be deemed an abandonment of the grievance. It is the intent of this provision that all grievances shall be taken up and disposed of promptly and that, unless taken up and followed up promptly, shall be considered abandoned by the party asserting such grievance.
