Section 2,	Work and Duties Covered,
a.	General, It will be the continued policy of the Company that the work and job duties, which have customarily been performed by the bargaining unit members, will continue to be performed by them as in the past. It is agreed that these work and job duties shall include the receiving and storing of beets at the plants and yard areas, the processing of beets into sugar and by-products, the storage and shipping of sugar and by-products, the normal repair, maintenance and improvements to the factories which include the plant and yard areas and the duties previously performed in the Agricultural Department except in those cases where the members of the bargaining unit lack the skill or the Company lacks the necessary equipment to carry out such repair, maintenance, and improvement work safely, economically and efficiently within the time available.

The Union will notify the Company within five (5) days after receiving such notice if they disagree over whether the work should be contracted, in which event, the matter will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure, but the work of the contractor may proceed. In deciding a grievance based upon a disputed contract or upon a failure notice, the arbitrator shall be free to award pay to members of the bargaining unit who have been deprived of the opportunity to perform the work.
Section 4,	Employment of Outside Skills. In the event situations arise wherein it is necessary to employ temporarily especially skilled labor, such as, but not exclusively, bricklayers for relining of lime kilns, it is agreed that such work is recognized as out of the ordinary sugar workers’ routine, and such work and the employees performing it are exempt from this Agreement.

APPENDIX “A”
MICHIGAN SUGAR COMPANY
DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING PROGRAM AND POLICY
August 1998
(1)	Michigan Sugar Company (the “Company”) and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers, Locals 259-G, 260-G, 261-G and 262-G (the “Union”) recognize that the presence and influence of drugs and alcohol in the workplace is inconsistent with employee safety and the efficient operation of the factory.
(2)	Company policy prohibits the presence of illegal drugs on Company premises and prohibits employees from selling, using, possessing, working or attempting to work under the influence of illegal drugs or alcohol as well as unauthorized selling, transferring, purchasing or abusing prescription or other legal drugs (hereinafter, the term “drug(s)” shall include illegal, prescription, and legal drugs).
(3)	Company policy prohibits the possession of alcoholic beverages in the workplace and the consumption of alcoholic beverages in association with the workplace.
(4)	When an employee is found violating this policy, or when there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is violating this policy, the employee may be disciplined up to and including discharge, subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure.
(5)	“Reasonable Suspicion” is the observance of abnormal or unusual on-duty behavior of an individual employee which:
(a)	is observed on-duty by a supervisor trained to recognize the symptoms of drug abuse, impairment or intoxication, and confirmed by another observer (which observations shall be documented by the supervisor); and
(b)	is the type of behavior which is a recognized and accepted symptom of intoxication or impairment caused by controlled substances or alcohol or addiction to or dependence upon said controlled substances.
(c)	is not reasonably explained as resulting from causes other than the
72
use of controlled substances (such as, but not by way of limitation, fatigue, lack of sleep, side effect of prescription or over-the-counter medications, reaction to noxious fumes or smoke, etc.)
Reports of drug use or abnormal behavior which are not confirmed by another observer shall not constitute reasonable suspicion.
(6)	As an alternative to discipline for violating this policy, the Company, at its discretion, may do one or more of the following:
(a)	counsel the employee,
(b)	require the employee to submit a urine specimen to test for the presence of drugs, or
(c)	require the employee to submit a breath sample to test for the presence of alcohol.
- “Counsel” shall mean the opportunity to meet with the Factory Manager and the Union Committee.
(7)	The collection of urine samples for drug tests will be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the collection clinic designated by the Company.
(8)	The Company wishes to protect the dignity of the employee. Employees who attempt to, or actually provide adulterated or false samples, or who attempt to or actually circumvent the testing process will be terminated.
(9)	Breath and urine specimens shall be drawn or collected at the laboratory, hospital or medical facility at which the specimen is to be tested or prepared for testing. If requested by the employee, a Union representative, if available, may be allowed to accompany the employee, without a loss of time, to the testing facility. The employee shall not be observed when the urine specimen is given.
(10)	The testing shall be done by a laboratory certified by the State of Michigan as a medical and forensic laboratory which complies with
, the Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs and the Standards for Certification of Laboratories, Engaged in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies issued by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
73
(11)	Employees asked to provide samples for drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy will be required to cooperate and to sign a consent form (see Attachment 1) as a condition of continued employment. Objections may be raised by the employee or the Union, but will be subject to the “comply now and grieve later” doctrine.
(12)	The Company will direct that split samples be taken with the confirming test to be a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). If the first test and confirmation test on the first sample are positive and the employee elects to have the second sample tested, the Company will pay for the cost of the second test. If the employee elects to have the split sample tested, the Company will advise the laboratory selected by the employee or the Union.
(13)	The Company will determine if the employee asked to take a drug or alcohol test should be permitted to work during the time between providing the sample and the receipt of the test results. If the employee has been directed by the Company not to work during this time, but to remain on an unpaid leave of absence and the reason is solely because of the pendency of the drug or alcohol test and the test results prove to be negative, the employee will be compensated as though he or she had not been suspended.
(14)	The Company will advise the Union if it becomes aware of a change in laboratories in which the testing is done or if it becomes aware of a change in laboratory procedures including any changes in the laboratory’s certification. The purpose of this is to permit the Union to understand the procedures. The failure of the Company to advise the Union of these changes will not invalidate an otherwise properly conducted drug or alcohol test.
(15)	In the event an employee tests positive for drugs or at a blood alcohol level of .08% or more, or the employee admits violating this policy after being asked to submit to a drug or alcohol test, the employee must sign a “Last Chance Agreement.” (see Attachment 2). If the employee refuses to sign the Last Chance Agreement, the employee will be terminated.
(a) The Last Chance Agreement requires an employee to participate in a Company and Union approved employee assistance program (EAP)
74
as a condition of continued employment. If the employee does not follow the directions of the rehabilitation professionals, attend all counseling sessions and/or treatment programs, then the employee will be terminated.
(b)Upon completing the EAP referral, the Company reserves the right to require the employee to submit to periodic drug or alcohol, or drug and alcohol testing, without advanced notice, for a period of one year (the “Follow Up Test”) but not to exceed 15 tests. An employee who tests positive in a Follow Up Test will be terminated without recourse, except as to the validity of the test. An employee who refuses to comply with a request to submit to a Follow Up Test will be terminated without recourse.
(16)	Illegal drugs are those drugs defined as illegal under federal, state, or local laws.
(17)	Before any drug test is given, the employee may note the use of any prescription or non-prescription medications. The laboratory procedures will report the significant presence of all prescription and nonprescription drugs.
(18)	An employee may request a written copy of the drug and/or alcohol test results.
(19)	The Company and the Union will strive to maintain the confidentiality of employee drug-related problems.
