ARTICLE VIII ~ OVERTIME
Section 1.	-Carryover, Misapplication
The provisions of this Article are intended only to provide the basis for the calculation and payment for overtime and shall not be construed as a guarantee that there will be any overtime per day or per week. Since overtime payments are a penalty against the Company, all overtime work will be kept to an absolute minimum. Overtime, when required, will be distributed as equitably as practical within Plant A, P lant B, Plant C, and the Complex Group, considering the availability of the employees and the nature of the work.
Maintenance Department overtime availability lists will be compiled daily for Plant "A", Plant "B", and Plant "C", and the Complex Group. Complex Group employees assigned to a plant will indicate their overtime availability in that plant and will be considered a part of that plants manning for all over ime administration. Employees will declare their availability no later than 12:00 Noon each day by completing an overtime availability sign-up list indicating availability for either overtime, callout or both. For callout overtime, availability can be for either assigned work area, assigned Plant, or both. On daily carryover jobs the lowest ava ilable man, or men if more than one work group (classification(s) is required, will continue on the job if the employee has declared availability anywhere in the Lake Charles Complex. Replacement or supplementary manning will be a ccomplished by using the low available man (or men) in the affected plant (A, B, C, and the Complex Group). On carryover jobs starting two (2) or more hours before shift change, employees assigned to the job must be on the job the two (2) or more hours prior to shift change to qualify for the carryover overtime. On weekend carryover the le w available man, or men if more than one (1) work group is required, will continue on the job and replacement or supplementary manning will be accomplished by using the low available man, or men in the affected plant Weekend carryover will only be used where continuity is required. Continuity is defined as the need for knowledge of the job status, and the work sequence to effectively perform the duties. Availability when declared for scheduled overtime on regularly
5
scheduled days off will be for a consecutive twenty-four (24) hour period beginning at 11:00 p.m, and ending at 11:00 p.m. on the following calendar day. Scheduled overtime work will be manned by using the low available man in the affected plant. If this is not possible, the low available man in the unaffected plant will be assigned. If this is not possible, the low man in the affected plant must work the assignment.
For callout overtime only, work will be manned in the same order as scheduled overtime, except the low available person(s) in the specific work area of the overtime assignment will be used prior to moving to an unaffected plant.
Overtime Misapplication Penalty
After it is determined that an error was made in an overtime assignment when using the overtime list, the following will apply:
Upon request of the aggrieved employee, the Company will offer him the opportunity to work the equivalent daily hold-over or Saturday overtime during the following fourteen (14) calendar days, provided he gives the Company twenty-four (24) hours notice of the time he elects to work. Such opportunity to work will not be provided at a premium rate greater or less than was applicable to the missed time.
Section 2.	~Overtime.
Overtime or penalty pay shall be paid at time and one-half (1-1/2) the regular rate for all hours worked over eight (8) in a work day, all hours worked outside an employee's scheduled shift or in excess of forty (40) in a work week, whichever results in greater pay for the employee. Scheduled shift refers to an employee's assigned shift on the day affected. In no case will overtime or penalty pay be pyramided.
Section 3.	-Over Twelve Hours.
Overtime rates shall be computed at time and one-half (1-1/2) the employee's straight-time hourly rate for all overtime except overtime worked in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours. Time worked in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours shall be computed at twice (2) the employee's straight-time hourly rate. Whenever two (2) or more premium rates are applicable, only one (1), the highest, shall be paid.
Section 4.	-Explanation of Overtime Procedure
Maintenance Employees: (Existing Rotational Overtime Procedure)
It is understood by both parties that the implementation of the above procedure will be done by using the most recent overtime list available. The overtime list is constructed by listing the names of employees by work groups (classifications) and designating the low man by means of a floating pointer in each work group. The pointer begins at the top of the list and then moves down the list at the rate of one name per workday. When the pointer reaches the bottom of the list, the pointer restarts at the top of the list.
(1)	Two separate overtime availability lists are printed each day. The “Overtime List’ is used for regular scheduled overtime starting at 3:30. p.m. Monday through Friday and for any scheduled overtime from 11:00 p.m, (start of new day) to 11:00 p.m. Saturday, Sunday, and holidays. Holidays are treated the same as weekends. The “Callout List’ is used for all non-scheduled overtime. In lieu of polling, the “Callout List also is used for scheduled overtime which falls into the following periods.'
(a)	between 3:30 p.m. Monday-Thursday to 7:00 a.m. Tuesday-Friday,
(b)	between 3:30 p.m. Friday to 11:00 p.m. Friday, and
(c)	between 11:00 p.m. Sunday to 7:00 a.m. Monday.
(2)	For holdover and scheduled overtime, the daily starting position for each plant will be indicated by a pointer. A supervisor will enter the list at the appropriate affected plant pointer to begin assigning overtime. He will assign the overtime beginning with the name indicated by the pointer and then proceed down the list based on plant availability. After reaching the end of the particular craft/job group listing, the supervisor will “loop” to the top of the list and continue manning jobs based on plant availability.
For callout overtime only, the daily starting position for each plant will be indicated by the affected plant pointer. The overtime job will be manned by beginning with the name indicated by the pointer and proceeding down the list based on the plant availability. After reaching the end of the particular skill/job group listing, the supervisor will “loop” to the top of the list and continue manning the job based on the plant availability. If unable to complete the manning of the job, the supervisor will return to the affected plant pointer and proceed down the list using the work area’s availability for the overtime job being manned.
6
(3)	Once all affected plant availability has been used, the supervisor will go to the pointer of the unaffected plant with the least average total overtime compiled during the previous two-month period. From that position down the list, he will use each of the other plant’s availability in the order of least average total overtime compiled during the previous two-month period. Each plant’s availability will be exhausted before moving on to the next plant.
(4)	After all complex-wide availability for a particular skill/iob group has been exhausted, and additional workers are required, the supervisor will return to the affected plant pointer. From this position down, if he is assigning scheduled overtime, he will begin forcing in the affected plant
If a supervisor is manning callout overtime, he will call ten (10) people in the group and offer overtime. If additional workers are still reguired, he will return again to the affected plant’s pointer and force in order down the list.
Qut-of-plant forcing follows the same pattern as Paragraph 3.
Workers in skill/iob groups where callout response is a problem will pe assigned pagers to be worn on weekends (Thursday PM through Monday AM) and holidays (PM before through AM following!. The number of pagers will be determined by taking 8% of the skill/iob group and rounding down. Callout response will be considered a problem if there are three (3) instances during the previous twelve (12) weeks requiring more than ten (10) calls per craftsman needed to man a job. A classification will be removed from the requirement to carry pagers if there is only one instance during the previous six (6) months requiring more than ten (10) calls per craftsman needed to man a job.
For callouts in skill/iob groups assigned pacers the callout sequence in Paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 will be broken after ten (10) calls are made without obtaining the necessar/ manning from the group for the job. The workers with pagers will be contacted in the following order to report to work:
Starting at the pointer of the affected plant proceed down the list :o page the workers in the affected plant.
Go to the pointer of the unaffected plant with the least average total overtime compiled during the previous two month period and proceed down the list to pace the workers in that plant. Proceed to each of the other unaffected plants in the order of least average total c vertime compiled in the previous two months contacting the workers with pacers to report to work.
If an employee with a pacer has responded to a callout that day io to the next worker with a pager.
If all the employees with pagers have responded to a callout that day, the callout process will resume at the point it was broken. If the callout process enters the force mode, pacers will be used to force employees when the callout order reaches their name. Employees covered in Appendix E are excluded from the provision reguiring pager assignments.
(5)	Any workers in a particular skill/job that are off the overtime availability lists will be maintained in a separate “OFF-LIST” identical to the way the “ON-LIST” order is maintained. Separate pointers will rotate through the “OFF-LIST” names to indicate a starting position for forcing by plant sshould all “ON-LIST” personnel be exhausted.
(6)	At 7:00 a.m. every day, each plant pointer will move one position, "he position change is a change in name within each plant for its respective pointer. The pointer will move seven times each week.
(7)	Plant transfers, work group changes, or shift swaps involving plant transfers will change the projected movement of the respective plant pointer. Vacations and absentees will not affect pointer movement.
(8)	In skill/job groups where there exist seven (7) people for a plant, or multiples of seven (7), an extra person (“Eighth Man”) will be inserted for that plant at the top of the skill/job group. This is to prevent a person from being a low man on the same day each week, every other week, etThe “Eighth Man” is determined every Monday and remains on the list seven (7) days.
(9)	Consistent with the previous manning procedure, the Friday “Overtime List” will be used to man scheduled overtime for Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday. This means the low man Friday is low for Saturday and Sunday scheduling also. Holidays are treated the same as weekends.
For weekend or holiday call-out, a separate “Callout List” will be usod for each day (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), and the respective plant pointers will continue their normzil movement cycle through the weekend.
7
(10)	Positions on the list will be rearranged every two months, and all pointers will be reset to the top of the list. The order of the list will be as follows:
February & March ....................Hire date month & day
April & May..........................Hire date month & day (reverse order)
June & July .........................Badge number
August & September...................Badge number (reverse order)
October & November...................Alphabetical
December & January...................Alphabetical (reverse order)
(11)	The system will continue to maintain the availability lists with all pertinent mark-offs (absent, vacation, etc.) and codes
(12)	Manning of temporary maintenance shifts with overtime will be accomplished by the supervisor projecting the pointer position to the position of the day the shift begins. For purposes of assignments, all day shifts will be manned as though the day shift will begin at 7:00 a.m.
(13)	Each Monday (or the first working day of the week when holidays are on Monday) a bulletin board posting of the overtime list will be made showing the current Monday pointer positions and the current plant order.
(14)	A single pointer will be used for the Rigger group.
(15)	A separate pointer for the Analyzer Repair Group will be maintained within the instrument group.
It is further understood that only "qualified" employees shall be worked on overtime assignments, examples below:
Examples:
Outside Machinists will not be assigned to Inside Machinists1 overtime work where employee has not the experience to operate the necessary machines.
Powerhouse or high-voltage jobs will not be assigned to Electricians where lack of experience on the specific job could cause loss of life or limb.
Employees will not be assigned to climbing jobs where the employee cannot work from heights.
Employees will not be assigned to work in areas where the plant physician does not approve.
Obvious physical impairment at the time.
These examples are not intended to be all inclusive nor will the Company deny employee overtime opportunity without justifiable reasons.
Production and Power Department Shift Workers:
It is understood that it is impossible to distribute overtime equally among shift workers and the Agreement does not require it; consequently, production and power shift workers* overtime hours will not be recorded. It is only fair, however, that supervision be as methodical as possible in distributing overtime. The following is a summary of procedures which should be followed in covering vacant shifts or securing extra help when required:
(1)	Extra qualified people in the area - without overtime.
(2)	Hold and call on that job.
(3)	Call in the off man on that job. (Where there are two off men, the man who will be called first is the man who did not work overtime last).
(4)	Call in the next off man on that job where two are available.
(5)	Hold and call any qualified operator in the unit This includes lead operators where they have a single unit responsibility.
(6)	Hold and call any qualified person in that control room (could be more than one unit).
(7)	Any qualified person that can be located in that control room (could be more than one unit).
(8)	Any qualified person that can be located.
The normal contact will be the individual.
The Unit is generally defined as a specific operation, such as electrolyzer area, caustic area, Powerhouse "A", EDC, Per/Tri, furnace area, dryer area, etc.

When an employee works unscheduled overtime and needs transports lion, the employee will be provided transportation home.
Section 7,-Lunches.
Employees who work overtime may request pay in lieu of an overtime lunch and receive Six Dollars ($6.00) for each lunch due, to be paid at the end of each month. Lunches received may be eaten on Company time for the period necessary to eat.

Section 8.	-Overtime Record Posting.
The Company will post a record monthly in appropriate departments showing the cumulative number of overtime hours worked or made available to employees in those departments during the current year. All overtime hours recorded will be equalized to zero at the beginning of each year. The cumulative year end hours will be used to establish the order employees will be listed on the overtime list at the beginning of the succeeding calendar year.
After an employee has been off from work for a minimum period of four weeks, he will be equalized on the overtime list of the group with which he normally works. This equalization will be made by taking the number of hours worked by this group during his absence and dividing the number or people in the group into the total number of hours worked. This figure will be added to the man’s total number of hours.
Employees may request in writing to be removed from the overtime list. Removals will be granted in the following order (1) Medical reasons approved by the Company Physicjar; (2) Hardship cases acceptable to Management; and (3) Any other reasons by department seniority.
The total number of employees off the overtime list in any work group (classification) in the Lake Charles Complex will not exceed 20%. Except in emergencies these employees virtll not be asked to work overtime unless all normal overtime procedures have been exhausted.

Employees called in for emergency work will not be given additional work of a routine nature to fill out their time but may be used on other needed work. If an employee is called out ahead of his regular schedule and works up to within two (2) hours before clocking in time of his regular shift, he has the option to remain on the job through his next regular shift.
If call out or schedule out overtime is cancelled, rescheduled or lasts less than two and three-quarter (2-3/4) hours, it will be handled in the following manner:
Maintenance:
a.	When scheduled out overtime is cancelled and supervision does not attempt to contact the employee to cancel the overtime, the employee will be sent home and paid four (4) hours of straight time “report in” pay unless another job exists in the plant that would require a call out and the employee is qualified to perform the job, then the employee will be placed on that job.

Company service and/or seniority credit is limited to regular employees and is computed in years, months, and days from the date of the beginning of their last employment at the Company's Lake Charles Complex.
Section 2.	-Seniority Credit Definitions.
a.	Plant Seniority.
Plant Seniority is the length of continuous employment on a permanent basis from date of last hire (See Article X, Section 7) provided he satisfactorily completes his probationary period.
b.	Department Seniority.
The seniority of an employee entering a department from the Service Pool shall begin on the day he accepts the position provided he satisfactorily completes both his probationary and trial periods. When a job posting involves multiple openings, all employees accepting the openings will have the same Department Seniority date.
Where two (2) or more employees are tied on Department Seniority, Plant Seniority will be used as the tiebreaker.
c.	Group (Promotion) Seniority.
Group (Promotion) Seniority is a seniority order in a classification within a progression line. For Service Mechanics, Group (Promotion) Seniority is within skill groups, i.e., Service Mechanic (Machinist), Service Mechanic (Carpenter), etc. For Operations, Group (Promotion) Seniority is the seniority order within a classification. Group (Promotion) Seniority is the seniority used for promotions within a progression line. Where two (2) or more employees are tied on Group Seniority, Department Seniority will first be used as the tie-breaker, then Plant Seniority will be used as the tie-breaker.
d.	Reduction Seniority.
Reduction Seniority is the order in which employees are demoted, bumped back or laid off from each classification within a progression line of Tier “A”.

An employee, who returns to the Service Pool
12
and later goes back to his original department without being permanent in another department, picks up his Department Seniority less the time he was out of the department. (See Section 4, Paragraph g).
Group (Promotion) Seniority is adjusted, up or down, if an employee fe Is a break-in, trial period, or is reduced.
Reduction Seniority is continuous as long as an employee is in a classification within a progression system. It is lost when an employee leaves any progression line.

If an employee in a progression line fails a break-in/trial period and laler passes a trial period, his Department and Group (Promotion) Seniority does not prevail on the higher job o^er those employees promoted ahead of him on the higher job, except for vacation selection. Upon failing a break-in or trial period, excluding the entrylevel job, an employee will return to his former classification, take up a position in Group (Promotion) Seniority below the incumbent employees, including employees on trial period in that classification. For Tier “A" employees they will be considered as promotable for the administration of the 50% rule. Should an employee fail a second break-in/trial period in a classification, he is eliminated from any further consideration for promotion and returns to his former classification as permanently non -promotable.
If an employee in a progression line refuses to promote, he will be considered non-promotable for the administration of the 50% rule for thirty (30) days.

Starting the first full week of January of 2004 and every eve n year thereafter, the employee will be assigned and may remain on the “E" assignment and other day jobs for as many two- (2) year periods as he wishes, seniority and satisfactory performance permitting. Selection tor the E-Day Assignment and other day jobs will be made September l”of the previous year.

It is understood that the employee must have at least six months more Plant Seniority than the one to be displaced.
Recall of laid off employees with recall rights will be as follows:
Maintenance Service Mechanics or apprentices by Group (Promotion) Seniority.
All other jobs within a progression line by Plant Seniority.
An employee laid off and still under recall rights will replace an employee in the Service Pool if he has more plant seniority than that employee and was reduced from that Pool.
The date an employee physically returns to active employment from layoff status will be considered his/her date of return. However, should an employee report for his/her physical as scheduled when notified of his/her recall from layoff status, and the individual is determined to be temporarily medically unable to return to work at that time by the Company Physician, the individual will then be considered as having returned to active employment on the date they would have been scheduled to return.

If the grievance is presented by his Department Union Representative, the grieving employee, unless he shall have been previously discharged or otherwise terminated, must be present when his grievance is presented. The Union will keep the Company advised in writing of the name of the Union representative in each department.
Second Step. If the grievance is not satisfactorily adjusted in the First Step and the employee wishes to appeal, the grievance shall be reduced to writing on a grievance form furnished by the Company, signed by the employee and his Department Union Representative and shall be presented to the employee's General Foreman by the grieving employee and/or the Union Representative for his department with a copy sent to the Manager of Labor Relations. The Department Superintendent will render a decision in writing within five (5) days after receipt of such grievance.
Third Step. If a grievance is not satisfactorily settled in the Second Step, such grievance signed by the Chairman of the Plant Union Committee may be presented by the Chairman to the Chairman of the Company Committee. If a settlement is not affected prior to the time of the meeting, the Plant Union Committee may take the matter up for handling at the regular monthly meeting with representatives of the Company. The Company representatives will meet with the Plant Union Committee on the second Thursday of each month for the proper handling of grievances under the Settlement of Grievances Procedure and for the discussion of other items of mutual concern. The date of the meeting can be changed by mutual consent The Union Committee will meet at twelve noon to prepare an agenda for the meeting with Company representatives at 1:00 p.m.
Section 3-Time Limit.
If the employee or Union Representative declines or fails to file an appeal in any of the above steps of the Settlement of Grievances Procedure within ten (10) days after receipt of the Company's answer, the dispute will be considered closed on the basis of the decision last made.
Section 4.	-Company Grievance.
Any grievance filed against the Union by the Company will be entered at Step Three of the Settlement of Grievances Procedure. Discharge and suspension cases may be submitted at the third step of the procedure.
Section 5.	~Work Requirement and Union Chairman Schedule.
It is understood and agreed that all employees, including those functioning in one or more Union offices, have productive work to perform and will not leave their jobs during work hours to attend to Union matters except for instances provided for in this section. A regular employee will lose none of his regular pay as a result of time spent in presenting his grievance in accordance with the procedure provided for above in Step One of Section 2. A Department Union Representative (Steward) will represent only those employees within the plant or the Complex Group in which he works unless there is no steward in that group within the plant and may leave his work assignment for the purpose of discussing a grievance with his Foreman, an affected employee, his Union Committeeman, or his Department Superintendent at a mutually convenient time and for time so spent during normal working hours, he shall be paid. In situations where it is more appropriate for the Committeeman to leave his work assignment for similar purpose, he will be allowed to do so at a mutually convenient time.
The Union Chairman will be scheduled to work Monday through Thursday from 7:00 a.m. -11:00 a.m. The Chairman will be excused from work Monday through Thursday from 11:30 a.m. -3:30 p.m. and on Friday from 7:00 a.m, - 3.30 p.m. to conduct Union business in the Lake Charles Complex as required. The Chairman will perform regular duties when Union business is not needed. The Union will advise the Company in writing of the name of the Union Chairman. In addition, as many as nine (9) employees, including the Union Chairman, serving on the Union Committee in its monthly scheduled meeting with the Company will lose none of their regular pay by reason for such meeting. The Union will keep the Company advised in writing of the nine (9) employees who should thus be compensated.
