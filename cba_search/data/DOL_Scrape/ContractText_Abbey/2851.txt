Nothing in this Management Rights provision shall be construed to restrict or limit ! any management authority. The City has no duty to bargain over its decisions or the effects of such decisions except as provided by this Contract.
1 -	6. Except as specifically limited herein, the City shall have the exclusive right to manage
r the operations, control the premises, direct the working forces, and maintain efficiency of i operation. Specifically, the City's exclusive management rights include, but are not limited to, the sole right to hire, discipline and discharge for just cause, lay off, and promote; to }	promulgate and enforce reasonable employment rules and regulations; to reorganize,
1	discontinue or enlarge any department or division; to transfer employees; including the
।	assignment and allocation of work within departments or to other departments; to introduce

7. The City shall have the right to privatize or subcontract services, provided that thirty (30) calendar days prior to any privatization or subcontracting the City shall meet and confer with the Union and the City will disclose the nature and costs of the proposed contract. Where the City's primary objective is to achieve financial economy, improved operating efficiency, and/or , better quality of service, the Union shall have ten (10) working days to make an offer of a competitive alternative. If that alternative yields financial savings, improved operating efficiency, and/or better quality of service genuinely equivalent to or greater than those the City I : can achieve through privatization or subcontracting, the City will accept the Union's alternative.
=	8. In the event the Union cannot successfully compete with the subcontractor, prior to any
layoff, the City would submit the names of the affected employees to the subcontractor for his/her consideration. If the employee is not employed, he shall be subject to layoff.
14
9.	In addition, unless otherwise restricted by an express term of this Contract, all rights are vexclusively reserved by the City.

UNION RIGHTS
10.	It shall not be a violation of this Contract and it shall not be a cause for discharge or disciplinary action if any employee refuses to enter upon any property involved in a primary labor dispute, refuses to go through or work behind any lawful primary picket line, or refuses to do work normally done by primary striking members of another union, except that the City shall not be required to pay the wages of any such employees. Provided, that in no case shall any employee refuse to do any work, regardless of the existence of a lawful primary labor dispute, if, in the City's judgement, such refusal would be detrimental to the public health or safety unless the City cannot reasonably provide for the personal safety of the employees.
11.	Any alleged violation of City rights or of Union rights is subject to immediate review by
the Union and the City at the Step Three (3) level of the Grievance Procedure.
NO STRIKE
12.	The Union shall not, directly or indirectly, call, sanction, encourage, finance, and/or assist in any way, nor shall any employee instigate or participate, directly or indirectly, in any strike. For purposes of this paragraph, "strike” means concerted action in failing to report to duty, willful absence from one's position, stoppage of work, slowdown or abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful, and proper performance of the duties of employment for the purpose of inducing, influencing, or coercing a change in wages, hours, terms, and conditions of employment for the duration of this Contract or any extension thereof.
13.	Violation of this paragraph may constitute an unfair labor practice as determined and remediable by the State Employment Relations Board (S.E.R.B.) (hereinafter the "Board"). In the event an unfair labor practice is determined by the Board, the City will not subsequently impose discipline except as recommended by the Board.
LIMITED RIGHT TO STRIKE

17.	Both the City and Union recognize their respective responsibilities under federal and state civil rights laws, fair employment practice acts, and other similar constitutional and statutory requirements. Therefore, both the City and the Union hereby reaffirm their commitments, legal and moral, not to discriminate in any manner relating to employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, handicap/disability or age.
18.

19.	It is agreed that all employees have a right to a workplace free of verbal and/or physical harassment. If when filing a grievance alleging a violation of this provision, an employee states that he is unable to function in the worksite from which the complaint arose, the City shall conduct a preliminary investigation for the purpose of establishing that a reasonable basis for the employee's concern exists. If such a basis is established, the City may reassign either the grievant or the individual against which the grievance is directed until such a time as the complaint is fully investigated, there is a finding, and corrective action, if required, is implemented.
20.	All of the employees of the City within the bargaining unit shall receive equitable treatment and share in any and all benefits provided herein.
21.	The City recognizes the right of all employees and all applicants for employment to be free to join the Union and to participate in lawful concerted Union activities.

CITY DRUG TESTING POLICY
When there is reasonable cause to believe that an individual employee is using illegal drugs or alcohol at work or is under the influence of drugs or alcohol at work, such employee will be directed to report to a City designated physician or medical clinic, on City time and expense, for a fitness for duty examination. This will involve appropriate testing, including possible urine or blood tests or breathalyzer exam as determined by the appropriate medical personnel.
All employees who are required to be randomly tested under law (e.g., Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations regarding employees required to have a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) who drives vehicles in excess of 26,000 pounds), and all employees in safety
87
sensitive positions shall be subject to random drug/alcohol testing. Such testing shall be conducted in accordance with the DOT proceduces. Both random examinations and resonable suspicion examinations are conducted for the purpose of determining the presence of illegal drugs or alcohol in the employee tested. An employee who is directed to submit to such examinations shall report to a City-designated physician or medical clinic, on City time and at City expense. The City’s Labor Relations Manager, or his designee, shall approve all drug/alcohol testing. This testing will include possible urine, blood, or breathalyser exams as determined by the appropriate medical personnel. An employee who refuses to submit to drug/alcohol testing under the provisions herein shall immediately be charged with insubordination and will be suspended pending discharge. An employee who fails a drug or alcohol test for the second time during his/her employment with the City shall be discharged immediately by the City.
An employee may be referred for such fitness for duty screening if at least one (1) supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that the employee is then under the influence of alcohol or a controlled chemical substance. The circumstances supporting an allegation warranting reasonable suspicion testing shall be reduced to writing, signed by the referring supervisor and copies provided to the employee and the Union prior to testing. The demand for a urine, blood or breath specimen shall be made based only upon specific/objective facts, and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts in light of experience, that the employee is then under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In addition, employees may be referred for mandatory urine, blood or breath, for drug and/or alcohol screening under the following circumstances:
[a]	A disciplinary probation for employees who have violated the City's drug and alcohol rules, or
[b]	For employees returning from leaves of absence if they have given management a reason to suspect possible illegal drug and/or alcohol abuse. Possible reasons to suspect substance abuse include, but are not limited to, a history of excessive absenteeism not related to a specific illness, documented evidence of deteriorating job performance or of aberrant behavior in the six (6) months immediately preceding the leave of absence or documented involvement with drugs off the job.
An employee shall be entitled to have a Union representative present before testing is administered.
As concerns urine samples for drug testing, employees to be tested will undergo an initial screening (EMIT) test. For any positive results, a confirmatory test employing the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test will be used. The City will insure that there
88
is a continuous chain of custody of any sample taken from an employee. Specimen collection '.will occur in a medical setting. The testing procedures should not demean, embarrass, or cause physical discomfort employees. Altering or switching a specimen sample for a drug/alcohol test, or otherwise refusing to follow the established testing procedure and/or guidelines, shall be grounds for immediate suspension pending discharge.
The results of a drug or alcohol screening test will be kept strictly confidential. An employee who tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol will have the opportunity to review the test results and, if desired, a reasonable opportunity to rebut the results. Copies of test results shall be given to the City and to the individual tested. Where urine or blood samples have been taken, two samples will be preserved for a reasonable period of time and tested employees will have the opportunity to take one these samples to a reputable physician, or laboratory of their choosing for a re-testing.
Employees who may be drug or alcohol dependent are encouraged to voluntarily seek professional assistance through a reputable treatment program. The City's E.A.P. (Employee Assistance Program) can provide counseling and referral. All records of an employee seeking medical rehabilitation for a drug or alcohol problem, either through E.A.P. or otherwise, will be kept strictly confidential. Voluntary assistance should be sought before dependence affects job performance so as to endanger fellow employees, the public, or otherwise adversely impact on the employee's ability to perform his or her job duties.
Participating in the E.A.P. program does not supplant the normal discipline and grievance procedure. An employee subjected to disciplinary charges which include substance abuse on the job will be given access to the drug or alcohol screening results, the ability to privately test the blood urine or other samples at an independent lab and the opportunity to rebut any allegation of chemical abuse. Any charging letter issued to an employee which includes allegations of substance abuse on the job shall list the basis upon which it was determined that there was reasonable cause to believe the employee was using drugs or was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
An employee shall be deemed to have positive screens for drugs or alcohol must be given medical clearance by a qualified physician acceptable to the City before returning to work.
An employee shall be deemed to have failed an alcohol test if:
[ 1 ] The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths (10/100) of one-percent (1%) or more by weight of alcohol in his blood;
89
[2]	The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths (10/100) of one (l)gram or more by weight of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of his breath;
[3]	The person has a concentration of fourteen-hundredths (14/100) of one (1) gram or more by weight of alcohol per one hundred (100) milliliters of his urine.
The City is not responsible for any legal obligations and costs for claims based on the Union's duty of fair representation.
