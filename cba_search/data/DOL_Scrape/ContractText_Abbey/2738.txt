PREAMBLE
Whereas, the Executive Branch of the State of Maine (hereinafter referred to as "State" or "employer") and the Maine State Employees Association, Service Employees International Union, Local 1989 (hereinafter referred to as "MSEA-SEIU") desire to establish a constructive, cooperative and harmonious relationship; to avoid any interruption or interference with the operations of the employer; to promote effective service and quality of work life towards the accomplishment of the missions of the State; and to establish an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences;
Therefore, this Agreement by and between the parties is entered into as of October 13, 2003.
1
ARTICLE 1.	UNION RECOGNITION
Pursuant to the Maine Labor Relations Board certification dated January 5, 1978, the State recognizes the Maine State Employees Association (MSEA-SEIU) as the sole and exclusive representative for the purpose of representation and negotiations with respect to wages, hours of work and other conditions of employment for all employees included in the Operations, Maintenance and Support Services Bargaining Unit.
In the event of a dispute between the parties as to future inclusions or exclusions from the unit resulting from the establishment of new or changed classifications or titles, either party to this Agreement may apply to the Maine Labor Relations Board for resolution of the dispute.
Employees who are employed on a seasonal basis, i.e., for regularly recurring seasonal periods of three (3) months or more, shall be covered by the provisions of this Agreement upon the completion of six (6) months employment, subject to any special provisions relating to their employment. In order to qualify, such six (6) months must be worked in not more than three (3) consecutive years and only time in pay status during such seasons shall count. Employment time of persons outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment to a seasonal position, and employment time of persons holding a seasonal intermittent position shall not count towards the completion of such six (6) months.
Part-time employees will be covered by the provisions of this Agreement after completion of six (6) months of service except for the provision for dismissal for just cause. The just cause provision for dismissal shall apply after completion of 1,040 compensated hours exclusive of overtime hours. All benefits provided to part-time employees shall be prorated to the extent required by State law.
Temporary, seasonal and on-call employees, excluded by law from the bargaining unit, include project employees, seasonal employees not covered by the preceding paragraphs, persons from outside State service who are on acting capacity assignment, and intermittent employees. Project employees are employees appointed to a project position which is restricted to a planned work program to be completed within a specified period of time and which is not regularly recurring. Intermittent employees are employees who are appointed for a period of time on a sporadic basis and who work not more than one thousand forty (1,040) hours in any consecutive twelve (12) month period beginning with the date of hire or anniversary of date of hire.
Any employee designated as intermittent, who works in excess of the limits set out above and who works more than 1,040 regularly scheduled hours during the period since appointment as an intermittent employee without a break in service due to resignation or dismissal shall be covered by the terms of this Agreement. The sporadic periods such an employee is not in pay status because of the sporadic nature of the position shall not be considered to be a break in service. Where a legislative position count permits, such employee shall be placed in a
2
permanent or limited period full-time or part-time position as appropriate, provided that he or she is eligible for appointment. If necessary, the employee may reopen the appropriate register to establish eligibility.
Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as removing any rights or benefits of temporary, intermittent, project or seasonal employees provided under Title 5, MRSA, Sections 553-A and 559, Public Law 667, 1978, or any other provision of law or rule.
ARTICLE 2.	ACCESS TO EMPLOYEES
MSEA-SEIU shall have access to employees covered by this Agreement to carry out its legal responsibilities as a bargaining agent as provided for in this Article.
MSEA-SEIU's representatives will be granted reasonable access to employees during employees' working hours for the purpose of investigating and processing grievances and for the purposes of administering this Agreement. Such access will be subject to the representative providing the appropriate State representative with advanced notice of the visit. Such access will not disrupt State operations or violate agency security procedures. If access needs to be temporarily delayed for special reasons, those reasons shall be explained to the MSEA-SEIU representative.
Any MSEA-SEIU representative may have access to employees in this unit for the purpose of explaining MSEA-SEIU programs and benefits during employees' non-working time, e.g., breaks, lunch periods and after hours, provided such access does not interfere with State operations. Such access shall be to non-work areas.
ARTICLE 3.	ACTING CAPACITY
1.	Temporary Assignments
When an employee is assigned temporarily by his/her appointing authority to a job for which he/she is qualified in a higher pay grade for a period of five (5) days or his/her regular workweek, whichever is less, the employee shall be paid retroactively from the initial date of the temporary transfer for the duration of the temporary assignment. The employee shall be paid as if he/she had been promoted during such assignment. In no event may an employee acquire any status in a higher classification as a result of his/her temporary assignment. Acting capacity assignments shall not be made on an arbitrary or capricious basis. Employees shall not be rotated in acting capacity in an arbitrary or capricious manner in order to avoid payment of acting capacity pay.
3
This Article shall not be used in lieu of the proper processing of any request for reclassification or reallocation of a position pursuant to the Personnel Rules and the Reclassifications Article, or the filling of a vacancy pursuant to the Personnel Rules and the Seniority Article.
2.	Seasonal Employees - Off Season Assignments
A seasonal employee who accepts a temporary or acting capacity assignment during his or her off season shall be eligible to accrue vacation, sick leave, and holiday benefits upon appointment to the temporary or acting capacity assignment. Vacation, sick leave, or holiday benefits accrued in an employee’s regular seasonal position shall not overlap into benefits accrued in the temporary or acting capacity assignment for the same period of time. Full-time seasonal employees shall accrue no more than eight (8) hours of sick leave in any one month, pro-rated for part-time employees.
ARTICLE 4.	APPROVAL OF LEGISLATURE
The parties hereto agree to jointly support any legislative action necessary for implementation of any provision of this Agreement. If the Legislature rejects any provision submitted to it, the entire Agreement shall be returned to the parties for further bargaining.
ARTICLE 5.	BEREAVEMENT LEAVE
Each employee covered by this Agreement shall be allowed up to five (5) days leave with pay, for absence resulting from the death of a spouse or significant other living in the same household with the employee, child, stepchild, parent or stepparent and up to three (3) days of leave with full pay for absences resulting from the death of other members of the employee's immediate family, as defined below.
"Other members of the immediate family" shall mean the parents of the spouse, guardian, brothers, stepbrothers, sisters, stepsisters, wards, grandparents and grandchildren of the employee.
“Significant other” means that a relationship exists between two people, neither of whom is married, that is intended to remain indefinitely and where there is joint responsibility for each other’s common welfare, there are significant shared financial obligations, and there is a shared primary residence. This relationship must have existed for at least two (2) continuous years before benefits under this Article may be provided.
ARTICLE 6.	BULLETIN BOARDS
4
The State shall continue to provide present bulletin board space for the use of MSEA-SEIU at each work location where bulletin boards are presently provided for the purpose of posting bulletins, notices and other materials in conformance with this Article. The posting of any MSEA-SEIU materials shall be restricted to such bulletin board space only except that, in each work location where bulletin board space is not provided for MSEA-SEIU, the State shall designate an appropriate alternative space where such materials may be posted.
In no instance may MSEA-SEIU post any material which is profane, obscene or defamatory to the State, its representatives or any individual, or which constitutes campaign material between competing employee organizations if it is determined that the posting of such material would violate any obligation of the State for neutrality. MSEA-SEIU is solely responsible for the accuracy and ethical standards of any material posted pursuant to this Article. The State retains the right to remove any materials in violation of this Article.
All posted MSEA-SEIU materials shall be signed by an authorized representative of the Association or stamped with an official MSEA-SEIU logo.
ARTICLE 7.	CHILD CARE
A.	Full-time employees employed as of March 1 who meet all of the following criteria shall be eligible for a lump sum payment each year. Eligible employees may apply for this payment between March 1 and April 15 of each year. Payment shall be made within thirty (30) days of receipt of the completed application. Any application received after April 15 will be considered on a case by case basis and shall not be arbitrarily rejected.
1.	Employed full time during the entire previous calendar year;
2.	Full-time State employees employed for more than six (6) months but less than twelve (12) months of the previous calendar year are eligible for this program on a prorated basis;
3.	Part-time and seasonal employees covered by this Agreement who have completed one thousand forty (1,040) hours of regularly scheduled work in any calendar year in which they qualify on a prorated basis; and
4.	Had a minimum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) employment-related child care expenses for the previous calendar year.
B.	Employees must submit a copy of their Form 1040 and a copy of their receipt for child care expenses for the previous calendar year to be eligible for reimbursement.
C.	Employees with an adjusted gross family income of less than $26,000 for the previous calendar year shall be eligible for reimbursement not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Employees with an adjusted gross family income of less than $31,000 but more than $26,000 for the previous calendar year shall be eligible for reimbursement not to exceed seven hundred

dollars ($700.00). Employees with an adjusted gross family income of less than $36,000 but more than $31,000 for the previous calendar year shall be eligible for reimbursement not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).
ARTICLE 8.	CHILDBEARING AND ADOPTION LEAVE
Childbirth or adoption leave shall be granted to an employee without salary for a period not to exceed one (1) year inclusive of any period of disability covered under the Sick Leave Article. Employees shall have the option of using accumulated compensating time and annual leave during such period. Employees shall be allowed to retain insurance benefits during such leave. Except during any period covered by the use of compensating time or annual leave, retention of insurance benefits shall be at the employee's expense.
ARTICLE 9.	COMPENSATING TIME
Compensating time earned by an employee may be accumulated up to two hundred forty (240) hours. Except where operational needs require otherwise, employees shall be entitled to use compensating time at times of their choice.
Employees who have more than two hundred forty (240) hours upon the signing of this agreement, will be paid for any hours beyond two hundred forty (240).
ARTICLE 10.	COMPENSATION
A.	Salary Schedule Progression
Employees shall progress from step to step in salaiy grade on the basis of satisfactory job performance based upon established standards of performance.
Seasonal employee's initial anniversaiy date shall be established after being in pay status for two thousand eighty (2,080) hours. Such date shall then be used for annual performance evaluation and step progression consideration.
When an employee's anniversary date falls on any day from the first day of a pay week through Wednesday of the pay week, the employee's merit increase shall be effective as of the first day of the pay week within which the anniversary date falls. Otherwise, the merit increase shall be effective on the first day of the next pay week.
Grievances arising from the denial of merit increases shall not be arbitrable under this Agreement but shall be processed pursuant to the Agency Merit Increase Appeal Procedures developed under the 1978-1980 Agreement between the parties. In agencies where such appeal procedures do not fit, the parties shall 6
establish additional procedures in the manner established by the predecessor Agreement. A decision of an Agency Appeals Board shall be final and binding, subject to appeal to the Director of Human Resources on the following grounds only: that the decision of the Agency Appeals Board was based upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, or that the decision of the Agency Appeals Board was based upon erroneous application of performance standards.
B.	Call Out
Any employee who is eligible for overtime who is called out for work outside of and not continuous with his/her regular hours will be paid a minimum of four (4) hours of the employee's regular rate of pay or hours actually worked at the appropriate rate, whichever is greater. This section shall not apply to an employee who is called in four (4) hours or less prior to the start of his/her workday or shift and who continues to work that day or shift or to an employee held over at the end of their regular workday.
Notwithstanding this provision, employees in agencies which have been compensated for call out on a higher basis as of January 1, 1997 shall continue to be compensated on the higher basis.
C.	Overtime
1.	Excepting employees designated as non-standard and Ferry Service employees compensated for overtime on a sliding scale basis, full-time employees in pay ranges 01 through 21 shall be paid one and one-half (1 Vz] times the hourly rate of pay after actually working eight (8) hours in any day, or after their regular scheduled hours if greater, or forty (40) hours of actual work in any workweek.
The above provisions shall apply to full-time employees working alternative compressed workweeks but shall not include other alternative work schedules such as flextime schedules, etc., or part-time employees who shall be eligible for overtime after forty (40) hours of actual work in any week. In lieu of premium pay employees may, upon mutual agreement, take compensating time at the rate of one and one-half (P/2) hours of compensating time for each hour of overtime worked.
2.	Employees in pay ranges 21 and above who, on September 3, 1984 were receiving some form of overtime compensation, shall continue to do so until they vacate their present positions. Notwithstanding, the foregoing, the State's policy with respect to special exceptions which have been made or which are made in the future under that policy, will continue.
3.	Employees in pay ranges 22 and above who do not receive any form of overtime compensation shall receive two (2) personal leave days per year with pay, as of January 1 of each year. Employees who first become eligible for personal leave days under this Article on or after July 1 of a calendar year shall receive only one (1) day for the year, instead of two (2). Except where operational
7
needs require otherwise, these employees shall be entitled to take these personal leave days at times of their choice. These personal leave days shall not be carried forward or accrued from year to year unless the employee is denied his/her personal leave day because of operational needs.
4.	Time during which an employee is excused from work with pay under the Holidays Article, shall be considered as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime.
5.	There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of compensation by reason of overtime or holiday or other premium pay provision of this Agreement. It is understood, however, that with this limitation, the method of payment which gives the greatest amount will be followed.
6.	The State shall furnish a list of hourly rates of overtime pay for Ferry Service employees. These lists shall be posted at Ferry Service Terminals, employee housing and crew areas on the Ferry.
D.	Shift Differentials
A shift differential of twenty-five cents ($.25) per hour shall be paid for shifts starting between 2:00 p.m. and 9:59 p.m. for employees regularly assigned to such shifts. A shift differential of thirty-five cents ($.35) per hour shall be paid for shifts starting between 10:00 p.m. and 3:00 a.m. for employees regularly assigned to such shifts. The differential provided herein shall be part of base pay for overtime pay and other purposes. Employees at the Maine State Prison who are regularly assigned to the 5:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. shift are to be paid a shift differential of thirty-five ($.35) cents per hour. Employees of mental health and correctional facilities shall be eligible for the second shift differential when their shift begins between 12:00 noon and 4:59 p.m.
8
E.	Double Shift Premium
An employee required to work two (2) shifts in a twenty-four (24) hour period will be paid an additional four dollars ($4.00) for the week. This provision does not apply to employees who voluntarily work such shifts for their own convenience. The State retains the right to establish schedules which minimize the payment of the premiums provided under this provision.
F.	Divers' Stipend
All qualified employees assigned to SCUBA diving activities shall, when actually diving in the water, including training activities, be compensated at the rate of ten dollars ($10.00) an hour in addition to their regular hourly rate of pay. Employees shall be compensated for a minimum of one (1) hour of such work regardless of the length of the diving assignment.
G.	Longevity
1.	Employees with fifteen (15) years but less than twenty (20) years of continuous State service shall receive longevity pay of thirty cents ($.30) per hour to the base. Employees who become eligible after that date shall receive the longevity pay of thirty cents ($.30) per hour to the base upon eligibility.
2.	Employees with twenty (20) years of continuous State service shall receive longevity pay of a total of forty cents ($.40) per hour to the base. Employees who become eligible after that date shall receive the longevity pay of a total of forty cents ($.40) per hour to the base upon eligibility.
3.	Continuous State service is defined as continuous employment, including all authorized leaves of absences since the last date or hire into a status-granting position.
H.	Weekend Differential
Employees assigned to State institutions other than Maine State Prison shall be eligible for a weekend differential of fifty cents ($.50) per hour to the base for shifts beginning between 10:00 p.m. Friday and 9:59 p.m. Sunday. Employees at the Maine State Prison shall be eligible for a weekend differential of fifty cents ($.50) per hour to the base for shifts beginning between 8:30 p.m. Friday and 8:29 p.m. Sunday.
I.	Direct Care Stipend
Employees in positions in classifications listed in Appendix A who have direct responsibility for care, treatment and security of persons residing in
9
State institutions of the Departments of Behavioral and Developmental Services, and Corrections shall receive thirty cents (30<t) per hour to the base.
ARTICLE 11.	COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS
1.	This article applies to complaints or allegations made externally and not from normal supervisory activities.
2.	A department head shall be responsible for ensuring that all allegations of misconduct or other complaints against an employee on which any action is to be taken or a record is to be made shall be investigated. The investigator shall be allowed to interview the complainant prior to notifying the employee.
3.	Probable cause determination; minor discipline only. In the course of determining whether probable cause exists to conduct an investigation, in cases that could result only in minor discipline (a verbal or written reprimand), an investigator (or other designated management representative) may conduct an informal interview with the employee(s) about whom a complaint has been made. The purpose of the interview is to assist in the determination of probable cause for an investigation under this article.
a.	Any interview of an employee under this section shall be voluntary. Prior to being interviewed with respect to a determination of probable cause, the employee shall be informed in writing of the nature of the allegation and the purpose of the interview, and be afforded a reasonable opportunity to contact and consult privately with a union steward or other union representative.
b.	The interview shall be conducted at a reasonable time and, when practicable, on the department’s premises when the employee is on duty. A union representative may participate in the interview.
c.	The interview shall be limited to questions that are directly, narrowly, and specifically related to the allegation(s). The employee shall not be subjected to any offensive language nor be threatened with transfer, dismissal or other disciplinary action. Confidentiality of the interview shall be maintained.
d.	The employee may terminate the interview at any time.
e.	Upon completion or termination of the interview, the remaining sections set forth in this article shall be followed.
f.	An interview of an employee under this section is not required in order to proceed under sections 4 or 5 below.
4.	No probable cause. If after preliminary investigation no probable cause is found, the investigation shall terminate and the employee shall be informed in writing that a complaint was made against him or her but was unfounded.
10
5.	Notice of probable cause. When an investigator believes that probable cause has been established, the investigator shall inform in writing the employee under investigation and his or her supervisor of the nature of the investigation.
6.	Investigatory interview. When the employee under investigation is to be interviewed concerning the alleged conduct which could result in discharge or other discipline, the employee and his or her representative shall be notified in writing, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the interview. In the event of an emergency, such reasonable notice as the circumstances permit shall be given. The notice shall state that an official investigation is being conducted and shall state the subject matter of the investigatory interview.
a.	Prior to being interviewed pursuant to this section, the employee shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity and facilities to contact and consult privately with his or her union representative or union attorney.
b.	Any interview of an employee under this section shall be conducted at a reasonable time, at a suitable location and, when practicable, on the department’s premises when the employee is on duty. The union representative or union attorney may participate in the interview.
c.	The interview shall be limited to questions that are directly, narrowly, and specifically related to the employee’s job performance as it relates to the allegation(s) or complaints.

2.	Procedure
2.1	Step 1:	Within fifteen (15) workdays after the act or omission
which gives rise to the grievance or an employee becomes aware or should have reasonably become aware that he/she has a grievance, the employee and/or his/her representative shall present the grievance orally to his/her immediate supervisor.

2.2	Step 2:	If the grievance is not resolved within ten (10) workdays
of submission at Step 1, within ten (10) workdays thereafter the employee and/or his/her representative may present the grievance in writing, stating the nature of the grievance and the remedial action requested as follows:
(a)	Major Departments and Agencies, (i) In departments or agencies organized into bureaus, divisions or institutions, the grievance shall be submitted to the bureau, division or institution head, as designated by the department or agency head, who shall provide the employee and/or his/her representative with his/her decision in writing within ten (10) workdays of submission, (ii) If the grievance is not thereby resolved, within ten (10) workdays after the receipt of the bureau, division or institutional head's written decision it shall be submitted to the department head. The department head or his/her representative may meet with the employee and/or his/her representative and shall provide the employee and/or his/her representative with his/her decision in writing within ten (10) workdays of submission or, if a hearing is held, within fifteen (15) workdays of submission.

(10)	workdays after receipt of the written decision of the department or agency head the employee and/or his/her representative may appeal to the State Director of Employee Relations by filing with him/her a written notice of appeal, together with copies of the written grievance and the Step 2 decision. The Director of Employee Relations or his/her representative may meet with the employee and/or his/her representative and shall provide the employee
24
and/or his/her representative with a written decision within fifteen (15) workdays of receipt of the appeal; or, if a meeting is held, within ten (10) workdays after the conclusion of such meeting.

The request for arbitration along with a request for a list of arbitrators must be received by AAA within six (6) weeks of the Bureau of Employee Relations' receipt of the request for arbitration, in order for the AAA administration fees to be shared equally by the parties. If such request is not received by AAA by the expiration of the six (6) weeks but is filed within twelve (12) weeks, MSEA-SEIU shall pay the entire AAA administration fee. If a request has not been received by AAA within twelve (12) weeks of the Bureau of Employee Relations' receipt of the request for arbitration, MSEA-SEIU will be deemed to have waived its right to appeal the Step 3 decision to arbitration.

Once a determination is made that such a dispute is arbitrable, the arbitrator shall then proceed to determine the merits of the dispute.
25
(e)	In grievances involving discharge of an employee and/or discipline which has led to a discharge, the arbitration hearing shall be held within four (4) months of the Step 3 decision. Subsequent hearing dates, if necessaiy, shall be held at the earliest date(s) offered by the assigned arbitrator and which is mutually acceptable to the parties. The parties agree that in the event of a conflict in the scheduling of grievance arbitrations, grievances involving discharge and/or discipline which has led to a discharge shall have priority over all other pending grievance arbitration matters between the parties.

No classified employee may displace any unclassified employee. No unclassified employee may displace any classified employee except to the classification in the other service that was the last previously held.
The State and MSEA-SEIU shall negotiate to establish appropriate organizational units and unit divisions. Either party may request a review of an organizational unit or unit division on a departmental basis. In the event that the parties are unable to agree to appropriate organizational units and unit divisions either party may submit the dispute at any time thereafter for a binding determination to a qualified arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties or selected through the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the rules and procedures of that Association.
No employee other than a permanent employee, including permanent seasonal employees, shall be used to perform work in a class in the unit division while a permanent employee who is qualified to do the work is on layoff unless the laid off employee refuses the work.
C.	Notice of Layoff/Reassignment/Displacement
Employees to be affected by pending layoff, reassignment, or displacement shall be given written notice as soon as practicable but at least five (5) workdays before the effective date of the layoff/reassignment, or displacement. Employees affected by layoff/reassignment/displacement shall be required to reply in writing within three (3) workdays of notice of layoff as to their decisions on layoff and displacement rights. Employees subject to actual layoff and not displacing other employees shall be entitled to notice of at least ten (10) workdays before layoff. Copies of any notices from the State to employees under this provision shall be given simultaneously to MSEA-SEIU.
D.	Recalls
A recall register shall be established for each class by organizational unit or unit division, as appropriate, from which any employee has been laid off,
42
transferred or demoted in lieu of layoff. An employee who is notified of layoff will be placed on the recall register, immediately upon receipt of written notice to the Bureau of Human Resources from the employee in the manner prescribed by the Bureau, for the class from which he or she was laid off and, when applicable, his or her last previously held classification. Any vacancy occurring in that class, or the class last previously held shall be offered first to the employee on the recall register. Recalls to work shall be made as follows:
(1)	To the most senior employee in the unit division who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position;
(2)	To the most senior employee in the organizational unit who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position;
(3)	To the most senior employee statewide who possesses the minimum qualifications to perform the duties of the position.
Employees who refuse recall to the same classification, or to the last previously held classification, for a unit division, organizational unit, or on a statewide basis, from which he or she was laid off or to which they have recall rights shall be removed from the appropriate recall register.
E.	Other Vacancies
An employee laid off or about to be laid off may open any employment register for which he/ she is eligible for the purpose of establishing qualifications for any State position.
The placement on class registers and certification procedures for employees on layoff shall be treated as promotional in all cases, regardless of the pay grade of the class for which the employee is applying.
F.	Filling of Non-Competitive Vacancies
In the event of a vacancy in a non-competitive position after application of the recall provisions in this Article, such vacancy shall be filled from among eligible employees on the basis of ability and qualifications to perform the duties of the position. Where qualifications and ability are substantially equal, seniority will be the governing factor in final selection.
Vacancies shall be filled as follows:
1.	from employees within the agency who bid for transfer or voluntary demotion;
2.	from employees within the agency who bid for promotion;
3.	from employees within State service who bid for transfer or voluntary demotion;
4.	from employees within State service who bid for promotion; and
5.	from applicants outside State government.
Where such selection involves a bona fide need for special skills and/or special qualifications for a particular position and those special skills and/or
43
special qualifications do not exist among the applicants from within the agency or State service, the above preference for selection shall not preclude the agency from outside selection.
Notwithstanding the above, it is understood there should be no conflict with affirmative action principles, and where there is an affirmative action plan in place, such plan shall be controlling.
All job vacancies shall be posted in the applicable department, agency, organizational unit or unit division for ten (10) workdays. Notice of vacancies shall include the full particulars of the positions, including a job description, job location, pay rate, required qualifications and requirements for applying. Any employee wishing to be considered for an applicable promotion shall file a written, dated application with his/her appointing authority or designee within the posting period. Job posting notices shall indicate the name and title of the person to whom applications should be submitted. Seasonal and part-time employees shall have the right to apply for full-time vacancies and shall be given consideration in accordance with their abilities, qualifications, and seniority.
Employees promoted under the provisions of this Article will be in a probationary status for a period of six (6) months from the effective date of the promotion. Such probationary period may be extended for just cause for an additional six (6) months. During such period the employee may be removed from the position promoted to for failure to fulfill the duties of the position. In such case he/she shall be returned to his/her former position if the employee so desires. An employee filling positions created by the promotion shall be likewise entitled to return to his/her former position.
G.	Filling of Competitive Vacancies
Current procedures for filling of vacancies in the competitive service shall be continued during the term of this Agreement.
The following principles, however, shall be followed in the filling of competitive vacancies:
(a)	Notice of all vacancies in competitive jobs shall be posted in the applicable department, agency, organizational unit or unit division for at least ten (10) workdays.
(b)	All employees certified to an appointing authority shall be offered the opportunity of an interview.
(c)	Each certified employee shall be notified by the appointing authority of his/her selection or non-selection.
(d)	Length of service representing satisfactory service to the State is important for any position and will be given appropriate consideration by the appointing authority along with the qualifications for the position.
The State certification procedures shall provide for concurrent certification of eligible employees instead of serial certification for the duration of this Agreement. Employees accepting a job offer must do so within five (5) business
44
days from that job offer. An employee shall be entitled to refuse four (4) appointments from a register before being removed from the register.
Employees in a department or agency who are in the same classification or on a register for that classification who bid for transfer into a vacancy in the department or agency shall be offered the opportunity to interview for such vacancy.
Upon promotion an employee shall be entitled to return to his/her former position voluntarily within thirty (30) days of promotion; otherwise voluntary demotion rules will apply. An employee at any time during the probationary period or any extension thereof failing to attain permanent status in a promotional position shall be entitled to return to his/her former position. Any employee filling a vacancy created by a promotion shall be likewise entitled to return to his/her former position when a promoted employee returns to his/her former position in accordance with the above provisions.
H.	Promotions and Appointments
Unclassified employees who promote to an unclassified position in a higher pay range shall have their rate of pay adjusted to the lowest rate in the new range which is at least five percent (5%) higher than the rate in the class from which promoted.
Classified employees who promote to a classified position in a higher pay range shall have their rate of pay adjusted to the lowest rate in the new range which is at least five percent (5%) higher than the rate in the class from which promoted.
Unclassified employees who accept an initial appointment in a higher pay range in the classification service shall have their rate of pay adjusted to the lowest rate in the new range which is at least five percent (5%) higher than the rate in the position that the employee left.
Classified employees who accept a position in the unclassified service in a higher pay range shall have their rate of pay adjusted to the lowest rate in the new pay range which is at least five percent (5%) higher than the rate of the class from which the employee left.
I.	Permanent Seasonal Employees
The provisions of this Article shall apply to seasonal employees covered by this Agreement but in a separate seniority, layoff, reassignment, displacement and recall track, for their respective seasons. Permanent employees laid off from their permanent position shall be entitled to return to previously held permanent seasonal positions. For purposes of this Article, when a seasonal employee moves from the seasonal track to the year-round track, seniority calculations shall be converted to reflect actual time worked in the seasonal position. Seniority credits for the purpose of this conversion shall be calculated in weekly
45
increments. Any time worked within a given week shall be recognized as a full week.
J.	Part-Time Employees
Separate track seniority systems for layoff, reassignment, displacement and recall purposes shall be implemented for full-time and part-time employees. Fulltime employees will only be given options in full-time positions. Part-time employees will only be given options in part-time positions.
Full-time positions shall be defined as any position regularly scheduled for forty (40) or more hours per week.
If an employee is the least senior employee in his or her classification and unit division, he or she shall be given the options prescribed in section B of this Article in the other track, provided the employee has previously held that classification in the other track with the agency.
For purposes of this Article, when a part-time employee moves from the part-time track to the full-time track, seniority calculations shall be converted to reflect actual time worked in the part-time position. Seniority credits for the purpose of this conversion shall be calculated according to the employees scheduled workweek. Any time worked within a given week shall be recognized as a scheduled workweek.
Recall rights shall be limited to the track from which the employee is initially laid off, displaced, reassigned or demoted in lieu of layoff.
K.	Positions Outside Bargaining Unit
An employee in the bargaining unit as of the effective date of this Agreement in a position in a class covered by this Agreement but who becomes excluded pursuant to Section 979-A(6)(C) of the State Employees Labor Relations Act and an employee who by way of a promotion through a normal career ladder is in a classified position excluded from the bargaining unit pursuant to Section 979-A(6)(B) or Section 979-A(6)(D) of the State Employees Labor Relations Act and any other employee promoted through a normal career ladder to a position outside of the bargaining unit shall have the same layoff, seniority, displacement, recall and other rights under this Article for return to a position in the bargaining unit as a covered employee would have if the exercise of those rights is occasioned by a layoff.
Employees covered by previous MSEA-SEIU Agreements in any status described above shall continue to have such rights for return to a position in the bargaining unit as described above.
Otherwise, employees excluded from bargaining units pursuant to the State Employees Labor Relations Act shall have no rights under this Article within the bargaining unit.
46
L.	Laid Off Employees in State Housing
Full-time year-round employees who live in State housing and are laid off shall have at least sixty (60) days to vacate the State housing.
M.	Health Insurance Coverage for Laid off Employees
The State agrees to provide laid off employees with group health insurance at the employee's expense for one (1) year provided that the employee is unemployed. Premiums are to be paid directly to the insurance carrier. Failure to make payments would result in cancellation of insurance with no conversion privileges.
N.	Short-Term Seasonal Positions
Short-term seasonal position vacancies of fifteen (15) weeks or less duration shall not require posting as a method of filling the vacancy.
ARTICLE 57.	SEVERABILITY
In the event that any Article, section or portion of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by final decision of a tribunal of competent jurisdiction, or shall have the effect of a loss to the State of funds or property or services made available through federal law, then such specific Article, section or portion specified in such decision or which is in such conflict or having such effect, shall be of no force and effect. Upon the issuance of such decision, if either party requests, the parties shall negotiate a substitute for such specific Article, section or portion thereof, provided that the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. The parties agree to use their best efforts to contest any such loss of federal funds which may be threatened.
ARTICLE 58.	SHIFT ASSIGNMENTS
When an opening occurs in a shift assignment in an appropriate work group at a location, preference shall be given to employees within the classification who possess the training, ability and any required special qualifications to perform the work required, on the basis of seniority. In the event that no employee desires a shift assignment, employees shall be selected in order of inverse seniority.
This provision shall not apply to necessaiy training assignments. This provision shall not in itself alter the practice of rotating shifts where such practice presently exists. No employee who has a regular shift assignment on the effective
47
date of the Agreement shall be involuntarily displaced from such shift assignment as a result of this Article.
ARTICLE 59.	SICK LEAVE
1.	Sick leave credit shall be earned at the rate of one (1) day per calendar month of service. The current practices concerning the earning of sick leave credits shall be continued. Sick leave shall be earned from the employee's date of employment. Sick leave credit shall be earned for any month in which the employee has been in pay status for ten (10) or more workdays or eighty (80) hours. A part-time employee shall earn sick leave in the same proportion as his/her part-time service bears to full-time service. An employee may accumulate unused sick leave up to a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) days. Employees currently with lapsed sick leave credits shall have such lapsed sick leave added to their accumulated sick leave up to the maximum allowable accumulation of one hundred and twenty (120) days. However, the amount of unused sick leave accruals which can be credited towards State service for retirement purposes shall be ninety (90) days. When the maximum limitation has been accumulated, days that would normally thereafter be earned shall lapse but shall be recorded by the appointing authority. Any employee who has such lapsed sick leave to his/her credit may apply to the Director of Human Resources to have the sick leave restored in the event of an extended illness. The Director of Human Resources at his/her discretion may authorize restoration of all or any part of the lapsed sick leave after thorough investigation, including complete medical reports of the illness requiring the continued absence of the employee.
2.	Sick leave may be used for illness, necessary medical or dental care, or other disability of the employee or a member of the employee's immediate family which requires the attention or presence of the employee. Immediate family as used in this Article shall mean the spouse or significant other, the parents of the spouse or significant other, the children of the spouse or significant other, the parents, stepparents, guardian, children, stepchildren, brothers, stepbrothers, sisters, stepsisters, wards, grandparents and grandchildren of the employee. For the purposes of this Article, “significant other” means that a relationship exists between two people, neither of whom is married, that is intended to remain indefinitely and where there is joint responsibility for each other’s common welfare, there are significant shared financial obligations, and they must be living together in a shared primary residence. This relationship must have existed for at least two (2) continuous years before benefits under this Article may be provided.
Employees are encouraged to consult with their agency/department Personnel Officer to determine if they are eligible for benefits available under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act. A medical examination or doctor's certificate may be required on account of use of sick leave for five (5) or more
48
consecutive workdays, or because of repeated absences on days preceding or days following a holiday or weekend. When a medical examination or doctor's certificate is required on account of use of sick leave in excess of five (5) consecutive workdays, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.
3.	Notifications of absence under the provisions of this Article shall be given as soon as possible on the first day of absence or as soon thereafter as circumstances permit.
4.	Upon application of an employee, a leave of absence without pay may be granted by an appointing authority for a period of disability because of sickness or injury. If the appointing authority denies the requested leave, it shall state its reason in writing. The appointing authority may, from time to time, require that the employee submit a certificate from the attending physician or a designated physician. If a certificate from a physician other than the attending physician is required, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.
5.	An employee who is transferred to the jurisdiction of another appointing authority or who accepts employment under the jurisdiction of a new appointing authority without interruption of service to the State shall retain his/her accumulated unused sick leave credits.
6.	A former State employee who is reappointed within four (4) years of his/her separation may have his/her previously accumulated and unused balance of sick leave revived and placed to his/her credit upon approval of the new appointing authority.
7.	Any employee returning from layoff, including seasonal employees covered by this Agreement, shall have the unused sick leave accrued as of the time of layoff restored upon his/her reinstatement.
[Effective upon implementation of the MFASIS Project's Leave Accrual Module]
ARTICLE 59.	SICK LEAVE
1.	Sick leave credit shall be earned at the rate of 3.7 hours per completed two-week pay period of service. The current practices concerning the earning of sick leave credits shall be continued only for those employees regularly scheduled to work in excess of forty (40) hours per week and only for as long as they are so scheduled. Sick leave shall be earned from the employee's date of employment. Sick leave credit shall be earned for any pay period in which the employee has been in pay status for five (5) or more workdays or forty (40) hours. A part-time or intermittent employee shall earn sick leave as follows: a part-time or intermittent employee shall earn .369 hours of sick leave for each eight (8) hours in pay status per two-week pay period. For part-time employees, "hours in
49
pay status" shall be an employee's regularly scheduled hours. An employee may accumulate unused sick leave up to a maximum of nine hundred sixty (960) hours. However, the amount of unused sick leave accruals which can be credited towards State service for retirement purposes shall be seven hundred twenty (720) hours. For part-time or intermittent employees, the maximum accumulation of sick leave and the amount of unused sick leave which can be credited toward State service for retirement purposes shall be a percentage of nine hundred sixty (960) hours and seven hundred twenty (720) hours, respectively, equal to ten percent (10%) for each eight (8) hours in pay status per two-week pay period. When the maximum limitation has been accumulated, days that would normally thereafter be earned shall lapse but shall be recorded by the appointing authority. Any employee who has such lapsed sick leave to his/her credit may apply to the Director of Human Resources to have the sick leave restored in the event of an extended illness. The Director of Human Resources at his/her discretion may authorize restoration of all or any part of the lapsed sick leave after thorough investigation, including complete medical reports of the illness requiring the continued absence of the employee.
2.	Sick leave may be used for illness, necessary medical or dental care, or other disability of the employee or a member of the employee's immediate family which requires the attention or presence of the employee.

For the purposes of this Article, “significant other” means that a relationship exists between two people, neither of whom is married, that is intended to remain indefinitely and where there is joint responsibility for each other’s common welfare, there are significant shared financial obligations, and they must be living together in a shared primary residence. This relationship must have existed for at least two (2) continuous years before benefits under this Article may be provided.

3.	Notifications of absence under the provisions of this Article shall be given as soon as possible on the first day of absence or as soon thereafter as circumstances permit.
50
4.	Upon application of an employee, a leave of absence without pay may be granted by an appointing authority for a period of disability because of sickness or injury. If the appointing authority denies the requested leave, it shall state its reason in writing. The appointing authority may, from time to time, require that the employee submit a certificate from the attending physician or a designated physician. If a certificate from a physician other than the attending physician is required, the State shall pay the difference between the cost of obtaining such certificate and the amount covered by insurance.

In any such circumstance an employee shall call the matter to the attention of his/her supervisor for proper action.
2.	Other than motor vehicles, and except where employees have traditionally supplied their own tools, all employees shall be provided such equipment and tools as are reasonably necessary for their jobs, such as, drafting equipment, potato rakes, flashlights and batteries, and supplies.

51
Technicians are covered by warranty, the warranty shall be used in lieu of State payment to the extent of the warranty coverage.
Any tools which can be said to be unusual, and not regularly used by the employee, but nevertheless required to perform work on certain kinds of vehicles, upon submission of request and approval by the appropriate supervisor, shall be provided to the particular Automotive Mechanic, Heavy Vehicle and Equipment Technician and Field Heavy Vehicle and Equipment Technician. Such tools shall be and remain the property of the State.

ARTICLE 61.	UNION SECURITY
1.	Employees Hired On or After October 13, 2003
This subsection of this Article applies only to individuals who are covered by this Agreement and who begin their employment with the State of Maine on or after October 13, 2003.
A.	Selection of Fee
Any employee who begins employment with the State on or after October 13, 2003 and is covered by this Agreement and is not a member of MSEA-SEIU shall, as a condition of employment, within thirty (30) days after such conditions are met, be required to choose from the options of membership in MSEA-SEIU or payment to MSEA-SEIU of a service fee equal to their pro-rata share of the costs to MSEA-SEIU that are germane to collective bargaining and contract administration as defined by law. Any employee choosing either the option of membership in MSEA-SEIU or the option of payment of the service fee shall be required to (a) sign a written payroll deduction authorization form authorizing deduction from their pay of the membership dues or service fee, or (b) tender the full amount of the service fee to the union, or (c) indicate in writing their religious objection to such fee and make contributions at least equal in amount to the service fee to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee so objecting and the Union, within thirty (30) days after the first six (6) months of the beginning of their employment. Employees choosing (b) or (c) shall make payments within ten (10) days after each payday.
52
B.	Payments and Deductions
It shall be the sole responsibility of MSEA-SEIU to collect its dues or service fees and to verify contributions made in lieu of service fees. No payroll deduction of service fees shall be made from workers’ compensation benefits or for any payroll period in which earnings received are insufficient to cover the amount of the deduction, nor shall such deductions be made from subsequent payrolls to retroactively cover the period in question. Employees shall not be penalized for failing to pay service fees for any such pay period(s).
C.	Calculation of Service Fee
MSEA-SEIU shall determine the amount of the service fee to be charged to non-members, consistent with both applicable law and this Article and shall certify to the State the amount of the service fee. The service fee paid by parttime employees shall bear the same ratio to part-time dues as the fee paid by full time employees bears to the dues amount paid by full time employees.
D.	Notice and Audit
MSEA-SEIU shall calculate the amount of the fee after the close of its annual audit, based on the expenditures incurred during the most recent fiscal year. That calculation shall also be audited to verify that the union's records have actually been audited; have been correctly reproduced from the audit report, and that the union has performed any mathematical adjustments correctly. The fee will be effective on the first payday after the audit is complete and notices are provided to employees. MSEA-SEIU shall prepare a notice, consistent with applicable law, to all employees covered by this Agreement. Such notice shall be updated annually and shall explain the choices and indicate that the sums determined to be the service fee were audited by an independent auditor based on the union's financial records for its most recent fiscal year. The notices shall, at a minimum, identify the major categories of expenses, as reflected in the audit, and identify whether each expense will be included in the service fee, identify the auditor(s), and include the opinion of each audit, including the opinion included in any adjusted audit(s). The State agrees to distribute this notice and dues deduction forms, provided by MSEA-SEIU, to new employees at the time they are hired. MSEA-SEIU shall provide notices required by law to all current bargaining unit employees.
B.	Religious Objectors
In the event that any employee covered hereby is a member of and adheres to a bona fide religion, body or sect, which has historically held conscientious objections to financially support public employee organizations
53
or labor organizations, that employee shall have the right to refuse to make service fee payments; provided, however, that said right to refuse shall continue only so long as the employee makes contributions at least equal in amount to the service fee to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the employee so refusing and the Union. Part-time employees’ contributions to non-religious charitable organizations shall coincide in amount with the payments of those part-time employees paying the service fee. MSEA-SEIU shall not unreasonably deny the choice of such non-religious charitable organization suggested by the employee.
F. Disputes
The amount of the service fee shall be subject to review pursuant to the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees. Pending resolution of any such dispute, the disputed amount of fees shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account. MSEA-SEIU shall pay for any maintenance fees associated with such escrow accounts. The State shall not be liable for any fees, costs, damages, expenses, or any other form of liability involved with regard to such escrow accounts.
Fees, costs, damages, expenses, or other form of liability involved with regard to arbitration shall be borne only by MSEA-SEIU or the objecting employee in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s Rules for Impartial Determination of Union Fees.
In the event a dispute under this Article is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to order the State to pay such service fee on behalf of any employee. If the arbitrator decides that an employee has failed to pay or authorize the payment of the service fee in accordance with this Article, the only remedy shall be the termination of the employment of such employee if the employee refused to pay or authorize payment of the required service fee and the State complied with the adverse employment action procedure described below.
54
G. Failure to Pay Fee
It shall be the sole obligation of MSEA-SEIU to certify to the State the name of each employee who has not paid his or her service fee or who has not made a contribution in lieu of a service fee and who, in the case of employees who are actively challenging the amount of the fee or the procedures implemented pursuant to this article, are not paying the disputed amount into the interest-bearing escrow account established by the union. MSEA-SEIU agrees to cooperate in any State investigation performed due to or in reliance upon each statement.
The Discipline article does not apply to employees who have not complied with this Article. The following procedure shall apply. On the first occasion the State determines, after an opportunity to investigate, that an employee failed to comply with this Article, the State shall provide the employee with notice of a finding of a violation of this Article and afford that employee a 30-day period to comply fully with this Article, paying all arrears due. Should the employee fail to timely correct this deficiency or should the employee be subsequently found by the State as failing to comply with this Article, the employee shall be provided with a notice of proposed dismissal. The employee will be afforded an opportunity to meet with the appointing authority or his/her representative prior to the action proposed. The employee will be entitled to have a Union representative or steward present. At that meeting, the appointing authority or his/her designee will give the employee an explanation of the employer’s evidence against the employee (if that has not already been provided) and offer the employee an opportunity to respond. Any employee who has not timely complied with the obligations of this Article must be dismissed. A dismissal in compliance with this Article may not be challenged through the Grievance Procedure article of this agreement.
2.	Employees Hired Prior to October 13, 2003
This subsection of this Article applies to individuals who are covered by this Agreement and who began their employment with the State of Maine prior to October 13, 2003.
A.	Selection of Fee and Reversion to Subsection 1 of this Article
Employees who have chosen to be excluded both from MSEA-SEIU membership and from the payment of a service fee may continue to choose to be excluded from membership, payment of a service fee, or charitable payment in lieu of a service fee, so long as this choice continues without interruption as of October 13, 2003.
At such time as an employee who is covered by this Agreement and who began employment with the State prior to October 13, 2003 is either a full
55
member of MSEA-SEIU or pays a service fee to MSEA-SEIU on or after October 13, 2003, subsection 1 shall be applicable to that employee.
B.	MSEA-SEIU Representation
MSEA-SEIU shall be entitled to charge any employee who has chosen this exclusion of reasonable fees, including reasonable fees for employee representative services and attorneys’ fees, and costs and expenses, including arbitrators’ fees and expenses, incurred by MSEA-SEIU in enforcing this contract on behalf of that employee. The current schedule of MSEA-SEIU fees is attached to this Agreement for informational purposes.
3.	Change of Status
Any employee may change his/her status with respect to these options during the twenty (20) day period immediately prior to the expiration of this Agreement by giving written notice to the State and to MSEA-SEIU during that period.
Additionally, MSEA-SEIU may, at its discretion and with at least thirty (30) days’ notice to the State, provide a change of status period for employees. During said change of status period any employee may, as with the 20-day period heretofore provided, change their status with respect to the options set out above. Said change of status period shall occur no more than once per calendar year and shall extend for a period of up to thirty (30) days.

The State of Maine, Bureau of Employee Relations and the Department of Transportation (MDOT) and the Maine State Employees Association (MSEA-SEIU), the parties, having established a Labor Management Committee agree as follows:
This agreement pertains to employees within the Bureau of Maintenance and Operations who are assigned to the Operations, Maintenance, and Support Services Bargaining Unit and who operate and maintain vehicles and equipment used for snow/ice plowing and removal operations during the MDOT designated winter season.
Such employees who work overtime in excess of eight (8) hours on either Saturday or Sunday during the MDOT 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 winter seasons and who choose to utilize vacation or compensating time for regular scheduled hours on the following Monday, (subject to operational need), will have such time, up to a maximum of eight (8) hours, counted as time worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay for that week. However, this provision shall not preclude the department from utilizing any existing policies, or establishing new polices or work rules pursuant to Article 69 of the Operations, Maintenance and Support Services agreement, regarding the safety and health of employees during winter operations. Also, the parties may establish a labor/management committee to specifically address issues concerning overtime hours worked by maintenance employees during the winter season.
The parties agree to review the impact of this agreement, including, but not limited to, information regarding the 2002-2003 winter season and the 2003-2004 and the 2004-2005 winter seasons for comparative overtime hours worked and related costs. Meetings for this purpose will begin no later than April 1, 2005 and be completed by April 15, 2005. Recommendations, if any, for extending this agreement beyond the 2004-2005 MDOT winter season shall be given to the parties by May 1, 2005.
Seen and agreed to this 13th day of October 2003.
