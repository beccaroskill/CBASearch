(1)	Advanced Practice Nurses who have been credentialed as Advanced Practice Nurse Prescriber and who are performing this function shall be paid an additional two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per hour for all hours worked effective pay period thirteen (13) in 2001.
(2)	The County agrees to pay for the costs of obtaining state certification and the DEA certificate for Advanced Practice Nurse Prescribers.
2.02 OVERTIME
(1)	Overtime shall be defined as hours worked in excess of 8 per day or 40 per week for all bargaining unit employes. Overtime shall be compensated or liquidated at time and one-half unless otherwise specified in this Contract.
(2)	Employes shall have the option of accumulating compensatory time in lieu of cash. Such compensatory time may be liquidated only with the consent of the department head. Accrued compensatory time may be paid in cash at the employe's discretion, by notification to the payroll department. If accrued compensatory time is not liquidated within 13 pay periods, the unliquidated balance shall be compensated in cash. Compensatory time shall be limited in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.
(3)	Every reasonable effort shall be made to meet overtime needs on a voluntary basis. Such overtime will be offered to the most senior qualified employe on a rotating basis.
(4)	Mandatory overtime shall be assigned on a rotating basis in the inverse order of seniority among employes in the appropriate classification who are qualified to perform the work. Any employe who has voluntarily worked four (4) hours of overtime or more shall be considered as having worked one mandatory overtime shift for rotation purposes. For the purpose of this section, employes on a prorata or half-time status shall receive credit on the mandatory list for all extra 8-hour shifts worked. Employes shall be assigned in rotation from the mandatory list regardless of whether the shift is paid on an overtime or extra shift basis. Extra shifts are those worked in addition to the posted schedule.
(5)	Employes on authorized leave of absence shall not be called for mandatory overtime.
(6)	Employes notified that they must be available for mandatory overtime shall receive standby pay from the time of such notification until either notified to report for work or notified that they are no longer being required to report for work.
(7)	Every reasonable effort will be made to avoid assigning employes to 16 consecutive hours of duty.
(8)	New employes shall be added to the list for mandatory overtime and take their place in the rotation as soon as they are qualified to perform the work.
(9)	Every reasonable effort will be made to replace scheduled employes
6
unable to report for duty with employes of the same classification.
(10)	Mandatory overtime shall be compensated twice the base rate of pay.
(11)	Employes shall not be called from home for mandatory overtime.
2.03 STANDBY PAY
(1)	Employes on standby duty shall receive $1.25 per hour for all hours scheduled. If called in while on standby, the employe shall be paid a minimum of 4 hours' pay at the overtime rate for work in one session and additional pay at the overtime rate for all work in excess of 4 hours in one session.
(2)	For purposes of this section, "standby" shall mean the employe, at the direction of the employer, is required to be available for work upon notice during a specified period of time. Failure of the employe to respond when called shall be cause for forfeiture of standby pay and disciplinary action where the employe is unable to furnish acceptable justification for her failure to respond.
(3)	Standby shall not apply to an employe or group of employes who, as part of their regular duty assignment, are expected, but not required, to be available for work at all times in emergency situations.

2.06 SHIFT SELECTION
(1)	Every effort will be made to grant requests for permanent assignment to PM's and nights where such vacancies exist. Remaining vacancies on the PM and night shift shall be filled by rotating AM staff. Every reasonable effort will be made to:

(2)	The County agrees with the concept of rotating less senior nurses more frequently than nurses with greater seniority, within each calendar month, except at the Sheriff’s Department which shall be a four (4) week period.

3.	Employes regularly scheduled for a Weekend Program must be willing and able to make a
minimum six-month commitment to the program.
4.	Employes in the Weekend Program are limited to one weekend off in each 12 week period. Employes may be granted additional weekends off if the manager determines staffing is sufficient to accommodate the request.
5.	Overtime will be paid for hours worked in excess of 40 per week or in excess of 12 hours worked per day for 12-hour employes and 8 hours worked per day for 8-hour employes. In the event that an employe works a non-Weekend Program shift, regular overtime provisions will
apply.

2.08 CHANGE OF ASSIGNMENT
9
(1)	When an employe is required to work in a department or ward where the employe is not presently assigned, such change of assignment shall be on a rotation basis beginning with the least senior qualified employe on the same shift having completed initial orientation from the area best able to operate with reduced staff before the need is filled in any other manner.
(2)	Such change of assignment shall not extend beyond one month without the employe's approval.	.
(3)	Employes affected by reassignment shall be oriented to the new area.
(4)	When two or more employes are reassigned to another department or ward, the most senior employe shall be returned to the employe's department or ward first, if the employe so requests.
(5)	Both parties understand as a matter of principle that when a nurse is reassigned to another unit, the employe should not be placed in a position in which the employe could not provide safe patient care. If the nurse objects to the assignment, the nurse will verbally inform the appointing authority of the reasons for the objection. If the assignment is not rescinded, the nurse will fulfill the assignment to the best of the nurse's ability. It is understood that the Hospital will assume full responsibility for the assignment.
When reassigned to another unit, a nurse shall receive instruction necessary to carry out the assignment.
Registered Nurses I and II at the Mental Health Complex volunteering to be reassigned shall be paid an additional $2.50 per hour for all hours worked in the reassigned area.

(1)	Employes may be assigned to perform the duties of a position in a higher classification and shall be paid as though promoted to the higher classification under the following conditions:
(a)	Such assignment is made in writing on the Temporary Assignment Form; provided, however, that the omission of such written assignment shall not bar a grievance requesting pay for work in the higher classification.
(b)	Such employe works in the higher classification for not less than 3 consecutively scheduled working days. Paid time off shall not be included in the computation of the 3 consecutive scheduled working days but said days shall not be interrupted thereby, and
10

(d)	If the position is permanently vacant and a certification request has been forwarded to the Department of Human Resources, a temporary assignment may be made and may continue for no more than 90 days after the Director of Human Resources has provided a certified list bf candidates eligible for appointment to the vacancy.
(e)	If the position is temporarily vacant, a temporary assignment may be made for the duration of the temporary vacancy, but shall not exceed one year.
(2)	Employes who accrue compensatory time while on temporary assignment shall liquidate such time at the rate of pay of the classification to which assigned to the time of liquidation.

2.101 CORPORATE TRANSIT PASS PROGRAM
Upon implementation of the Corporate Transit Pass Program by Milwaukee County, Milwaukee County agrees to offer the program to the members of the Federation. The program would be identical to the Milwaukee County Transit System Corporate Pass Program in which the cost of a weekly pass, $10.50 per week is discounted 20% from an annual fee of $525 (for 50 weeks) to $420.
11
The County, as the employer would pay $240, or $20 per month, per employe toward the cost of the pass, while the employe would be charged $180, or $15 per month.
2.11 RETIREMENT SYSTEM
(1)	For employes hired on and after January 1,1982, the provisions of Chapter 201.24, Employe Retirement System, shall be modified as follows:
(a)	Final average salary means the average annual eamable compensation for the 5 consecutive years of service during which the employe's eamable compensation was the highest or, if the employe should have less than 5 years of service, then the employe's average annual eamable compensation during such period of service. Effective December 22,2002 (pay period one of 2003) final average salary means the three highest consecutive years of eamable compensation.
(b)	An employe who meets the requirements for a normal pension shall receive an amount equal to 1-1/2 percent of the employe's final average salary multiplied by the number of years of service.
(c)	All pension service credit earned on and after January 1,2001 shall be credited in an amount equal to 2% of the employee’s final average salary. For each year of service credit earned after January 1,2001, eight (8) years of service credit earned prior to January 1,2001 shall be credited at 2% of the employee’s final average salary. This provision shall not apply to a member of the Employes’ Retirement System who became a member of the system on or after January 1,1982 and as of January 1, 2001 is either eligible for a deferred vested pension benefit or is receiving a pension benefit, unless such member returns to active County employment and is eligible to earn additional pension service credit. Said credit shall be awarded on a daily basis.
(d)	Any employe whose last period of continuous membership began on or after January 1,1982, shall not be eligible for a deferred vested pension if the employe's employment is terminated prior to the employe's completion of 5 years of service.

(3)	In the event of the death of an employe-member in active service prior to age 60 and after completing at least 10 years of service, employe's surviving dependent spouse or child shall receive a
12
survivor pension. This provision shall apply to all employe-members hired on or after February 18,1982. Effective January 1,2001 this shall be at least 5 years of service.
(4)	Retention Incentive Bonus. Members of the System whose membership began prior to January 1,1982, and as of January 1,2001, are either actively employed or on an approved leave of absence, shall have their final average salary increased by a bonus of 7.5% for each year of pension service credit earned after January 1,2001. Said bonus shall be credited on a daily basis and the maximum bonus which can be added to an eligible member’s final average salary shall not exceed 25%. This provision shall not apply to a member of the Employee’s Retirement System who became a member of the System prior to January 1,1982, and as of January 1, 2001 is either eligible for a deferred vested benefit under 201.24 (4.5) or is receiving a pension benefit, unless such member returns to active County employment and is eligible to earn additional pension service credit.
(5)	For all employes who are members of the Employes' Retirement System as of January 1,1971, the County shall contribute a sum equal to 6% of each employe's earnings computed for pension purposes into such account on behalf of each such employe. All such sums contributed, in addition to the contributions previously made by the employe, shall be credited to the employe's individual account and be subject to the provisions of the pension system as it relates to the payment of such sums to such employes upon separation from service. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to employes in the bargaining unit in the following classes who were not members of the Employes' Retirement System on or before the 12th day of December, 1967, or whose date of hire is later than December 23,1967:
Emergency appointment, full time Emergency appointment, part time (6) Overtime worked after January 1,1987 shall not be included in the computation of final average salary.
(7)	A member of the retirement system shall be eligible for an accidental disability pension if the employe's employment is terminated prior to the employe's normal retirement age by reason of total and permanent incapacity for any duty as the natural and proximate result of an accident occurring at some definite time and place while in the actual performance of duty. The last payment shall be made, if disability ceases prior to the employ's normal retirement date, the first day of the month in which the disability ceases.
Disability shall be considered total and permanent if the Medical Board, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated to perform any job that they are reasonably suited for by means of education, training, or experience.
13
Disability must be as a result of such service accident and such incapacity is likely to be permanent. A member shall not be entitled to both accidental disability pension and ordinary disability pension. A member who meets the requirements for an accidental disability pension shall receive an amount computed in the same manner as a normal pension considering the employe's eamable compensation and service prior to retirement but no less than 60% of the employe's final average salary.
(8)	Employes retiring on and after January 1,1991 shall be entitled to pension service credit for military service under Section 201.2411(10) of the employes' Retirement System as amended by the County Board of Supervisors through File #85-583(a), notwithstanding the effective date indicated in the amendment.

(10)	Members who hold positions for which membership in the Employes' Retirement System is optional and opt for such membership, shall have pension service credit earned after January 1,2001 credited at 2%. However, such service credit shall not result in a multiplier increase for service credit earned prior to January 1,2001 nor shall such service credit qualify the member for a retention incentive bonus. A member who is 55 years of age and has 15 years of credited service may elect to receive early reduced retirement benefits. The member would be entitled to a benefit equal to the normal retirement with a lifetime reduction of five (5) percent for each year prior to the normal retirement date.
(11)	SICK ALLOWANCE BALANCE ON RETIREMENT
(a)	Members of the Employees Retirement System, whose membership began prior to September 27, 1995 shall receive full payment of all accrued sick allowance at the time of retirement. Such payment shall be made in a lump sum, and shall not be included in the calculation of the member’s final average salary for pension calculation purposes. If permissible under IRS provisions, such payment shall be placed in a “back drop account” in the Employees Retirement System. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a member who is eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under section 4.5 of201.24 of the Employes’ Retirement System.
(b)	Members of the Employees Retirement System whose membership began on or after September 27,1995 are not eligible for County paid health insurance after retirement, but shall have the full value of their accrued sick allowance at the time of 14
retirement (total hours accrued times the hourly rate at the time of retirement) credited toward the cost of health insurance after retirement. When the amount credited is exhausted, the member or eligible beneficiary may opt to continue their participation in the County Group Health Benefit Program upon payment of the full monthly cost. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a member who is eligible for a deferred retirement benefit under section 4.5 of 201.24 of the Employes’ Retirement System.
(c)	These provisions of the Sick Allowance Balance on Retirement are only available to employes who have completed their last day of work on or after January 1, 2001, and/or who have filed an application for retirement on or after January 1, 2001.
(12)	BACK DROP PENSION BENEFIT
The provisions of this section shall apply to any employee whose application to retire is effective after January 1,2001; but shall not apply to any member of the Employee Retirement System who is eligible for a deferred pension benefit under 201.24(4.5). Upon retirement, an employee may opt for a “back drop” pension benefit as follows:
(a)	An employee may request a monthly pension benefit based on accrued pension service credit and final average salary calculation as of a specific date in the past which shall be referred to as the “back drop date”. The “back drop date” may not be prior to the earliest date that the employee was eligible to retire, and shall not be less than one year prior to the date the employee leaves active County employment. The monthly pension benefit the employee was eligible to receive as of the “back drop date” shall be referred to as the “monthly drop benefit”.
(b)	The total amount of the “monthly drop benefit” payments the employee would have received (plus the annual 2% pension increase) between the “back drop date” and the date the employee is removed from the County payroll due to actual retirement (after exhausting all allowable accrued time balances as documented by an ETCR form excluding sick allowance payments), plus interest earnings compounded on a monthly basis equal to the pension fund rate of return used by the ERS actuary for computing the County’s annual contribution to the system, shall be referred to as the “total drop benefit”.
(c)	If the employee opts for a “back drop” pension benefit:
(1)	The “total drop benefit” shall be paid to the employee with appropriate deductions for state and federal taxes; or if permitted by IRS regulations, the employee may “roll over” the “total drop benefit” to an IRA.
(2)	The member shall begin to receive monthly payments of the “monthly drop
15
benefit” (plus the 2% annual pension increase).
(d)	The standard pension options shall be available to an employee who opts for a “back drop benefit”, and the retention incentives incorporated into the pension benefit effective January 1,2001 shall be included when calculating the “monthly drop benefit”.
(13)	Complete details of the pension plan are described in a separate booklet and in County Ordinances.
2.12	SICK LEAVE
(1)	Employes may be given leave of absence with pay for illness or disability of 3.7 hours for each pay period, or a proportionate credit for employes who regularly work less than 40 hours per week; provided, however, that such credit shall be canceled for each pay period in which the employe is absent without pay for more than 3/8 of the required hours except absences due to disability in line of duty or leave for military service; and further provided that:
(a)	Reasons for the absence and the good faith of the
employe in taking such leave shall be supported by such reasonable evidence as may be required by the appointing authority including a physician's certificate, personal affidavit, or by other
' means; and
(b)	That when the illness or disability of an employe is such as may make it necessary to take leave of absence of more than 3 days, a statement shall be made to the appointing authority in writing from a licensed physician or from an authorized Christian Science practitioner, stating the period of time the employe was unable to work because of illness or disability, including a statement that the employe is free of communicable disease.
(2)	Such leave of absence with pay shall accrue during the first six months of service but shall not be granted until the completion of six months of service, unless injury or disability is incurred in line of duty.
(3)	Employes working less than full time and eligible to accumulate sick leave shall be granted leave of absence with pay for illness or disability on any regularly scheduled day when unable to work due to illness or disability. Illness or disability on scheduled workdays in addition to the employe's regular schedule shall not qualify for paid sick leave.
(4)	In addition to other causes set forth in sec. 17.18(4), C.G.O., sick leave may be taken for the purpose of enabling employes to receive non-emergency medical attention during duty hours, Such leave may be allowed for scheduled appointments for any type of medical or dental care, provided that the employe has given 24 hours or more notice to the supervisor of the date and time of the appointment. This modification in the use of sick leave recognizes the current difficulty encountered in attempting to schedule nonemergency medical treatment during an employe's off duty hours. Because of the nature of the treatment or examination for which sick leave is allowed for these purposes, such absences are predictable. In order to be 16
excused from duty for the type of medical treatment or examination contemplated herein, the practitioner treating the employe shall provide the employe with written notice setting forth the date and time of the employe's appointment, which notice shall be filed with the employe's supervisor.
Excused time charged against sick leave for these purposes shall be limited to a maximum of 3 hours per incident, including travel between the employe's work site and the place of the appointment and shall not be Counted as an incident of illness for the imposition of a doctor's certificate requirement.
(5)	Upon returning to County employment, a former employe shall have their sick leave balance credited with all accrued sick allowance hours that remained at the time the employe left County service. This section shall impact all new hires and all current members of the bargaining unit and shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of 17.18 of the CGO.

If pre-scheduled shifts are cancelled by management, then these hours will be counted toward meeting minimum requirements. Shifts cancelled by the employe will not count towards the requirements. Failure of a pool employe to be available to meet the minimum requirements may be considered a resignation.

(a)	That as to employes in the employ of the employer as of the effective date of this agreement, such deduction shall be made and forwarded to the treasurer of the certified bargaining representative from the biweekly earnings of all bargaining unit employes.
(b)	That such deduction shall be made and forwarded to the treasurer of the certified bargaining representative from the biweekly earnings of new bargaining unit employes in the first full pay period following the employes' date of hire.
(c)	In order to insure that any such deduction represents the proportionate share of each employe in the bargaining unit of the cost of collective bargaining and contract administration, it is agreed as follows:
1.	That prior to the implementation of the agreement, the Federation shall submit to the County a schedule of monthly dues levied by its organization.
2.	Any increase in dues or fair share amounts to be deducted shall be certified by the Federation at least 15 days before the start of the pay period the increased deduction is to be effected.
3.	The Federation agrees that no funds collected from non-members under this fair share agreement will be allocated for, or devoted directly or indirectly to, the advancement of the candidacy of any person for any political office.
4.	The County agrees to honor voluntary contribution deductions for political purposes from bargaining unit employes. Such contributions shall be handled as payroll deductions on a biweekly basis.
56
(2)	In the event during the continuance of its recognition, the Federation, its officers, agents or employes, or any of its members, acting individually or in concert with one another, engage in or encourage any Federation authorized strike or work stoppage against the County, including any of its departments and/or agencies, the deductions and payments of fair share contributions made in accordance with this agreement, including deductions or payments made to the Federation on behalf of employes who have signed and have on file current dues deduction (voluntary checkoff) cards, shall be terminated forthwith by the County.
Thereafter, for a period of one year, measured from the date of the onset of such strike or work stoppage, no deductions whatever shall be made from the earnings of any employe nor shall any payment whatever be made to the treasurer of the Federation on account of dues deduction (voluntary checkoff) or fair share agreement contributions.

(4)	In the event the provisions of this fair share agreement are successfully challenged by any person affected thereby, and it is determined by an administrative body or a court of competent jurisdiction that the deductions made pursuant to the provisions hereof are in any manner in conflict with the rights of the challenging party as those rights are affected by Ch. 63, Wis. Stats., or other provisions of law applicable to public employment, which determination results in an order or judgment against Milwaukee County requiring that it repay to the challenging party and/or to any or all members of the class represented by such challenging party such sums as have been deducted from their earnings in accordance with the provisions hereof, the Federation agrees to indemnify the County in full, including any and all costs of interest which may be a part of such order or judgment, for all sums for which the County has been determined to be liable.

(d)	Nothing contained herein shall in any way limit the authority of the supervisory staff to impose summary suspension where the circumstances warrant such action.

herein.
