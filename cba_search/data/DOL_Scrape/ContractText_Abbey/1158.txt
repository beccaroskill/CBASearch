MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
APPRENTICE WAGE SCHEDULE
It is hereby understood and agreed that this Memorandum of Understanding be incorporated and made a part of the Master Agreement between the Oregon-Columbia Chapter, AGC and the International Union of Operating Engineers Local Union No. 701, entered into on the, FIRST day of June, 2002, FOR THE period June 1, 2002 to May 31, 2007.
It has always been the intent of the parties to allow the full zone wage differential to Operating Engineer Apprentices. The apprentice receives a percentage of Zone “A” base wage plus the full zone differential. Therefore, by way of example, a beginning apprentice working in a Group 4 classification in Zone “II” would receive 80% x Group 4 (Zone I is $26.09) = $20.87 + Zone “II” differential of $1.50 for a total of $22.37. An 80% apprentice receives the Health and Welfare fringe benefit ONLY, full fringe benefits are not paid on apprentices until they have been rated to 85% or higher.
The progressive wage rate to be paid applies to all apprentices regardless of their Major including Technical Engineer and Heavy Duty Repairer is:
Period	Hour Range	Percentage of Journeyman wage	Fringe Benefit	Fringe contribution
				
1st	0-2000	80%	H & W Only	$3.70 per hour
2nd	2001-4000	85%	Full Fringe	Current rate per hour
3 rd	4001-6000	90%	Full Fringe	Current rate per hour
4th	6001-8000	95%	Full Fringe	Current rate per hour
AGC/OE Local #701 - June 1, 2002 to May 31,2007
Schedule A -12 -
Heavy Duty Repairer Standards
The average wage for those journeymen employed by the participating employer in the occupation on January 1, 2002, is $26.09 per hour.
The progressive wage rate to be paid the apprentice is:
Period	Hour Range	Percentage of Journeyman wage	Fringe Benefit	Fringe contribution
		-

3m	3001-4000	90%	Full Fringe	Current rate per hour
4th	4001-6000	95%	Full Fringe	Current rate per hour
The average wage in this occupation will be updated by this Committee at least annually and will be recorded in the minutes of the Committee.
Technical Engineer Standards
The average wage for those journeymen employed by the participating Employer in the occupation on January 1, 2002 is $25.50 per hour.
The progressive wage rate to be paid the apprentice is:
Period	Hour Range	Percentage of Journeyman wage	Fringe Benefit	Fringe contribution

AGC/OE Local #701 - June 1,2002 to May 31, 2007
Schedule A - 15 -
ZONE PAY DIFFERENTIAL
1.	The parties to the Agreement recognize that because of remoteness of area and other reasons, there is a great inequity between the living expenses of an Employee providing for himself and his family in the major metropolitan areas and those of an Employee working in the remote areas within the large geographical area of this Agreement, and therefore, adopt the following provisions for wage scales as identified in the established wage/zone schedule attached.
2.	For the following metropolitan counties: Multnomah; Clackamas; Marion; Yamhill; Washington; Columbia; Clark; and Cowlitz County, Washington with modifications as indicated:
(A)	All jobs or projects located in Multnomah, Clackamas, and Marion counties, West of the western boundary of Mt. Hood National Forest and West of Mile Post 30 on Interstate 84 and West of Mile Post 30 on State Highway 26 and West of Mile Post 30 on Highway 22 and all jobs located in Yamhill County, Washington County and Columbia County and all jobs or projects located in Clark & Cowlitz County, Washington except that portion of Cowlitz County in the Mt. St. Helens “blast ZONE” that begins at Mile Post 29 on Highway 504 shall receive Zone I for all classifications as listed in Schedule A.
(B)	All jobs or projects located in the area outside the Identified Boundary above, but less than 50 MILES from the Portland City Hall shall receive Zone II Pay for all classifications as listed in Schedule A.
(C)	All jobs or projects located MORE THAN 50 MILES from the Portland City Hall, but outside the identified border above, shall receive Zone III Pay for all classifications as listed in Schedule A.
3.	For the following cities: Albany; Bend; Coos Bay; Eugene; Grants Pass; Klamath Falls; Medford; Roseburg;
(A)	All jobs or projects located WITHIN 30 MILES of the respective city hall of the above mentioned cities shall receive Zone I pay for all classifications as listed in Schedule A.
(B)	All jobs or projects located MORE THAN 30 MILES and less than 50 Miles from the respective city hall of the above mentioned cities shall receive Zone II Pay for all classifications as listed in Schedule A.

4.	WAGE ZONE SCHEDULE:
□	ZONE I - BASE RATE
□	ZONE II-BASE RATE PLUS $1.50
□	ZONE III-BASE RATE PLUS $3.00
5.	It is agreed that for the purpose of determining the proper wage scale under
this Agreement:
a.	All job or project locations shall be computed (determined) on the basis of road miles and in the following manner. A mileage measurement will start at the entrance to the respective city hall, facing the project (if possible), and shall proceed by the normal route (shortest time-best road) to the geographical center on highway, railroad, and street construction projects (end of measurement). On all other project contracts, the geographical center where the major portion of the construction work is located, shall be considered the center of the project (end of measurement).
b.	All related jobs or projects (such as a crusher’s location) shall, for the purpose of determining the proper pay zone rates, be considered as a part of the prime job, with the exception of jetties which for the purpose of this Agreement, will have separate locations and may, therefore, have a different pay zone for the quarry and jetty sites.
6.	The Employer agrees to PAY TOLL fees on bridges and ferries provided the Employees shall furnish receipts for same.
7.	The Employer agrees to make every effort to provide suitable parking
facilities on all jobs or projects, excluding building construction in metropolitan areas.
AGC/OE Local #701 - June 1, 2002 to May 31,2007
Schedule A -17 -
8.	Job Site Transportation: Whenever because of remoteness of parking areas, hazardous road conditions, or security restrictions, the Contractor is required to furnish transportation for men within the job site to the place of their work, the project management and union will meet to establish any special conditions surrounding such manhaul operation. When the Contractor furnishes such transportation to the employees without cost to him, the equipment shall include seats and protection from the elements, and definite pickup and discharge points shall be determined. Payment of travel, at his regular rate, on the return trip will be paid to all employees, including discharges and layoffs. If job site negotiations fail, the procedure set forth in this Agreement shall prevail.
9.	It is understood and agreed for purposes of this Agreement that all operations out of a fixed location are considered as one job.
10.	No travel time, transportation reimbursement, or subsistence is payable under this Agreement, except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement {ARTICLE XII, Paragraphs 12.9 and 12.9.1, covering the movement of equipment and deadheading).
