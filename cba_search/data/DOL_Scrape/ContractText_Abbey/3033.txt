RANDOM DRUG TESTING PROGRAM
Section 1
Introduction
A.	Statement of Policy
Law enforcement officers are called upon to make a number of decisions. Among them is sometimes deciding whether or not to use deadly force in the discharge of their duties. They are required to function in environments that are often hostile, hazardous and sometimes corrupt. Few persons are given such sensitive public trust.
Any illegal use of drugs by law enforcement officers would pose a serious threat to public safety. It would negatively affect morale and safety in the workplace, endanger credible testimony, and significantly increase the risk of incurring civil liability.
In the interests of the County of Los Angeles, its citizens, and the members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (hereinafter LASD) and the District Attorney’s Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter Bureau), it shall be the policy of the LASD and Bureau to implement a random drug testing program.
All aspects of this drug testing program shall be on County time and paid consistent with the provisions of this MOU.
61
611DLW
B.	Frequency of Testing
1.	LASD
Sworn members shall be separated into three categories for the purpose of determining the frequency of random drug testing.
The first category shall include all Deputy Sheriff Trainees and probationary Deputy Sheriffs. Members in this category may be tested up to, but not more than, six times in a twelve month period.
The second category shall include all sworn members assigned to Department units having, as a primary responsibility, the operation of aircraft or buses, the interdiction of drugs, the development of information pertinent to the interdiction of drugs, or having substantial contact with drug abuse or drug trafficking subjects. This category includes Narcotics Bureau, Vice Bureau, Special Investigations Bureau, Juvenile Operations Bureau, Headquarters Detective Division, Aero Bureau, Transportation Bureau, Special Enforcement Bureau, Crime Impact Team, North Surveillance and Apprehension Teams (NORSAT), Multi-jurisdictional Criminal Apprehension Detail (MCAD) and Gang Enforcement Team (GET). Members in this category may be tested up to, but not more than, four times in a twelve month period.

69
611 KM
C.	Refusal to Provide Urine Specimen
Members who refuse to be tested when so required will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. Attempts by a member to alter or substitute any specimen will be deemed grounds for disciplinary action. In such instances, Internal Affairs will be requested to conduct an administrative investigation, including another drug test.
Note:	Failure to provide a specimen within a reasonable period of time
(usually not more than three (3) hours) may constitute a refusal to take a drug test.
Section 4.	Specimen Collection
A.	Notification of Selection
Urine specimen collection will be done at an employee's unit of assignment or, if not appropriate, another LASD or Bureau facility, only. Collection personnel shall contact the appropriate Watch Commander or Senior Officer or appropriate Bureau Section Lieutenant or Supervising Investigator present and explain their presence. Then they shall determine the subject's availability.
The Watch Commander/Senior Officer or the Bureau Section Lieutenant/ Supervising Investigator shall assist by arranging for test subject(s) to present himself/herself for testing. The Watch Commander/Senior Officer or the Bureau Section Lieutenant/Supervising Investigator shall also assist by locating and
70
611DLW
securing restroom facilities that best meet the requirements of the collection procedure.
If the test subject is not working (RDO, vacation, off sick, etc.), or is unavailable (Court, in the midst of a critical situation, etc.), the Collection Site Supervisor will test the subject upon return to the work site. Only the Watch Commander or Senior Officer, the Bureau Section Lieutenant or Supervising Investigator originally contacted may be made aware of the identities of any untested personnel. He/she shall assist in determining the point in time when the test subject will return to the work site.
B.	Collection Site Privacy and Security
The actual collection process takes only a few minutes. However, because there must be rigorous controls for privacy, security and chain-of-evidence purposes, choosing the most appropriate restroom is crucial.
The restroom selected as a collection site shall be equipped with a sink to allow test subjects to wash their hands, a toilet, and be equipped with a stall for privacy.
During the specimen collection process, no unauthorized personnel shall be permitted in the restroom. The only authorized personnel are the test subject
71
611 DLW
and th© Collection Site Supervisor of the same sex. Another Collection Site Supervisor shall remain outside the restroom and shall bar entry for the time it takes to collect and package a specimen.
C.	Subject Identification, Advisory Statement and Pre-Test Declaration Form
When the Collection Site Supervisor contacts a test subject, the subject shall be asked to present his/her Sheriff's Department or District Attorney’s photo identification card. If the subject is unable to present proper identification, he/she must be identified by the Watch Commander/Senior Officer or Bureau Section Lieutenant/Supervising Investigator present.
The subject will also be asked to complete a Pre-test Declaration form (Attachment "A"). The form elicits information about recent use of prescription and non-prescription medications, and accidental exposure to controlled substances. The form shall contain the subject's right thumbprint and confidential test number. It is to be placed in a sealed envelope by the subject and given to the Collection Site Supervisor. The form will be destroyed without being reviewed if the test results are negative.
D.	Chain of Custody
Test specimens shall be stored and transported using the same documented chain of custody and standard of care and safety applied to evidence throughout the Department and Bureau. Sealed specimen bottles shall be placed in a
72
611 KM
locked portable container and kept under the direct control of the Collection Site Supervisor until it leaves his or her custody. The Collection Site Supervisor may store the container in the most appropriate, authorized facility evidence locker. All such containers shall be picked up the next business day and transported to the Laboratory. Only Collection Site Supervisors and Laboratory personnel shall possess keys to the portable specimen container.
When a specimen is stored in a facility's evidence locker, all LASD or Bureau evidence handling procedure shall apply, including tagging the container and entering it into the LASD’s Facility Master Property Ledger or the Bureau’s Property Register. All such entries shall be listed as "Lab Container No.," showing the appropriate container number. No other written remarks about container contents or test subject identities shall be made. The Collection Log Sheet and Pre-test Declaration forms shall be locked inside the specimen container and, upon delivery to the Laboratory, both the transporting employee and the Laboratory employee authorized to receive the specimens shall open the container. They shall obtain the Collection Log Sheet and note their identities in the appropriate place on the form. At this point, the Laboratory assumes custody of the specimens, Collection Log Sheets and sealed envelopes containing the Pre-test Declaration forms.
A copy of the test subject Collection Log Sheet shall be retained by the Collection Site Supervisor.
73
611DLW
E.	Collection, Integrity and Identification of Specimen
After a test subject has been properly identified, briefed about the reason for the test and has completed the Pre-test Declaration form, the mechanics of the collection process shall be explained. The Collection Site Supervisor shall require the test subject to remove any unnecessary outer garment (e.g., coats, jackets, etc.) and shall visually check for signs of concealed items that might be used to adulterate or substitute a sample. Personal belongings such as briefcases, purses, and weapons/holsters, etc., must remain with the subjects other outer garments. The subject shall retain control of his/her wallet.
The test subject shall wash and dry his/her hands prior to providing a urine specimen. There shall be no further access to water, soap, any chemical agent, or other materials which would be used to adulterate the specimen until after it has been provided.
The Collection Site Supervisor shall place a toilet bluing agent in the toilet bowl and, if the toilet is so equipped, in the reservoir tank. The purpose of this procedure is to deter the dilution of the specimen.
The test subject shall be required to provide a specimen in a large, wide mouthed, easily carried, plastic non-reusable cup, unobserved and in the privacy of a stall or otherwise partitioned area. Unusual behavior shall be noted by the Collection Site Supervisor on the Collection Log Sheet.
74
611 KM
The test subject will be provided two LASD or Bureau approved specimen bottles (samples A and B). The containers will have affixed to them specially prepared labels showing the test subject's confidential identification number. The subject's right thumb print will be rolled onto the labels by the Collection Site Supervisor. The subject shall then be ordered to provide a urine specimen and to divide it equally between the two bottles in the presence of the Collection Site Supervisor.
A minimum of 50 milliliters (1.7 fluid ounces) must be provided or the specimen will be considered incomplete. If the Collection Site Supervisor determines that there is an insufficient amount of urine (less than 50 milliliters total) in the specimen bottles, additional urine shall be collected. In this instance, the test subject shall remain under the supervision of the Collection Site Supervisor. The subject shall be asked to drink fluids to aid in urination and shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to furnish additional urine. When additional specimens are provided, third and fourth bottles shall be labeled, be affixed with another thumbprint label and be fastened to the original specimen bottles with clear tape Immediately after a specimen collection, the Collection Site Supervisor shall ensure the temperature is between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The Collection Site Supervisor shall also inspect the specimen for signs of adulteration (e.g., contaminants, color, etc.). Unusual findings should be noted in the remarks section of the Collection Log Sheet.
75
611DLW
In the presence of the Collection Site Supervisor the test subject, shall secure lids on the specimen bottles. The Collection Site Supervisor shall then seal the lids with evidence tape. If at the time of collection, there is reason to believe that the specimens have been diluted, adulterated, substituted, or in any way tampered with, the Collection Site Supervisor shall report the matter on the Collection Log Sheet. The Collection Site Supervisor may report those observations in writing to the lab, which may analyze the suspect specimens. The results of those analyses shall be reported in the written laboratory report to the MRO for further action, if any is needed.

APPENDIX B
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE (Sheriff's Department)
Section 1.	Purpose
The purpose of the Grievance Procedure is to provide a just and equitable method for the resolution of grievances.
Section 2.	Definitions
A grievance is any complaint concerning the interpretation or application of this Memorandum or rules or regulations governing personnel practices or working conditions that the departmental management has the ability to remedy.
"Business Days" means calendar days exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.
Section 3.	General Provisions
1.	Employee grievance procedures are not applicable in areas outside the authority of this department such as interpretation of the Los Angeles County Code or in areas where appeal procedures already exist, such as unsatisfactory performance evaluations and certain specified disciplinary actions (discharge or reduction). The employee shall be advised as to whether or not the Department will handle the grievance at the time he/she submits his/her formal appeal.
101
611DLW
2.	If an employee fails to initiate a grievance or to appeal from one level to the next level within the time limits established in this grievance procedure, the grievance shall be considered settled and not subject to further appeal. By mutual agreement of both parties, the various steps and time limits set forth in this grievance procedure may be waived or the grievance may revert to a prior level for reconsideration.
3.	An employee may present his/her grievance on County time, but the use of County time for this purpose shall not be excessive nor shall this privilege be abused in any manner. The Department shall determine what constitutes abuse.
4.	If the aggrieved employee wishes, he/she may be assisted at the first step of the formal grievance procedure or any subsequent step by an authorized representative of a recognized employee organization. The representative of the employee organization must have his/her name on file and be accepted in accordance with the Employee Relations Ordinance of the County of Los Angeles or other such applicable employee Relations law.
It is also the employee's option to choose a fellow employee as his/her representative. The choice of a fellow employee as a representative must be acceptable to the Sheriff or his/her alternate.
5.	If the grievance does not involve a suspension but the aggrieved employee definitely believes that his/her grievance cannot be resolved at any supervisory
102
611DLW
level except the Review Board, he/she may, with the concurrence of the concerned supervisor, waive formal step one.
6.	To waive the first grievance step, the aggrieved employee must obtain the signature of his/her third level supervisor in the signature space on the Form SHAD-465. The aggrieved employee shall also write the word "waived" and sign his/her name in the decision section for step one and forward the form to the Review Board.
7.	Form SH-AD-465 (Grievance Procedure) shall be prepared by the employee for the formal grievance process. The original shall be presented by the employee at the various grievance steps and returned to the employee with the written response.
A copy of the original Form (SH-AD-465), in its entirety, shall be made by the various supervisory levels and sent to Sheriff’s Employee Relations, at the completion of each formal step. A second copy of the original should be retained as the unit commander's record of the grievance discussions. This record will not be included in the employee's personnel file.
8.	ALADS, agrees to encourage an employee who files a formal written grievance, to state clearly and concisely the specific action(s) being grieved, the article(s) violated, and the specific remedy requested.
103
611 DLW
Section 4.	Informal Procedures
Most problems or complaints can be settled if the employee will promptly, informally and amicably discuss them with his/her immediate supervisor. This desired initial discussion, a part of the day-to-day supervision, should ideally precede any use of the formal grievance procedure.
Within ten (10) business days from the occurrence of the matter on which a complaint is based, or within ten (10) business days from his/her knowledge of such occurrence, an employee shall either discuss the complaint with his/her immediate supervisor or file a formal grievance.
NOTE:	In those situations where the nature of the problem involves the immediate
supervisor, the employee may discuss the problem informally with the next level supervisor although he/she should generally advise the immediate supervisor of his/her intention.
If the immediate supervisor either fails to reply within three (3) business days or gives an answer which the employee feels is unsatisfactory, within five (5) business days, the employee may informally discuss the grievance with his/her second level supervisor or proceed with the formal grievance procedure.
If the second level supervisor either fails to reply to the employee within three (3) business days or gives an answer which the employee feels is unsatisfactory, the employee may then initiate the formal grievance procedure at the third level of supervision.
104
611DLW
Section 5.	Formal Procedure
First Step (Third Level Supervisor or Designated Middle Management
Representative)
If the problem has not been resolved within eleven (11) business days of the date of the initial discussion with the first level supervisor (or ten (10) business days from the occurrence or knowledge of the occurrence of a grievable matter if no informal discussion has occurred), the employee may file a formal written grievance with his/her third level supervisor or middle management representative. The Department Grievance Form (SH-AD-465) shall be completed by the employee describing the problem and the remedy he/she believes is merited.
The third level supervisor or middle management representative shall promptly notify Sheriff’s Employee Relations. The third level supervisor or middle management representative shall consider available pertinent information and give his/her decision in writing (original SH-AD-465) to the employee within five (5) business days. The supervisor shall include the reasons for his/her decision and forward a complete copy of SH-AD-465 to Sheriff’s Employee Relations.
If, upon receipt of the decision, the employee takes no further action within ten (10) business days, the grievance will be assumed to have been settled.
if the supervisor has not answered the employee’s complaint within five (5) business days or if the answer is unsatisfactory in the employee’s opinion, the employee may appeal to the next grievance level.
105
611DLW
Second Step (Review Board - Division Chief, Commander and a Maximum of two members selected by the employee)
If the problem has not been resolved, the employee may submit his/her written grievance (Form SH-AD-465) to his/her Division Chief within ten (10) business days of the response, or lack of response, of the third level supervisor.
Upon presentation of the grievance at this level, the employee may exercise his/her option to designate a maximum of two sworn members (of equal or superior rank to the grievant) of the Sheriff's Department who are not parties to the grievance who shall serve on County time to participate as equal voting members of the Review Board. The employee may waive such selection if he/she so desires by writing "waived" in the space provided for employee-selected members on SH-AD-465 and affixing his/her signature.
The Review Board shall consist of the employee's Division Chief (who shall act as Chairman), the Area Commander in the employee's chain of command and a maximum of two additional sworn members of the Sheriff's Department, if so selected by the employee.
The employee's Division Chief will establish the date, time and place for the Review Board meeting and promptly notify the employee. The Review Board shall meet with the employee at the earliest possible date, evaluate the grievance and afterward
106
611DLW
determine a course of action by permitting such Board member to have an equal voice. A majority opinion shall constitute a recommended decision. If a deadlock occurs, the opposing sides shall submit their written opinions to the Sheriff or his designated representative for final disposition.
Supervisors of all levels who have previously dealt with the grievance may be called by the Review Board to appear at the grievance meeting. The grievant may call witnesses who may serve on County time.
The Review Board shall submit its recommended decision or opposing opinions to Sheriff’s Employee Relations within ten (10) business days of the Review Board meeting, unless a longer period of time has been agreed to by the employee.
Sheriff’s Employee Relations shall coordinate the actions of the Review Board, processing the required documents to the Sheriff or his/her designated alternate.
The recommended decision by the Review Board, approved by the Sheriff or his alternate (the Undersheriff or Assistant Sheriff of the concerned division), shall be final, except as provided under Section 6, Arbitration, or appeal procedures provided in the Civil Service Rules.
Written notice of the Sheriff's decision shall be sent to the employee within ten (10) business days of the receipt of the Review Board's recommendation.
107
611 DLW

Step 2. (Middle Management Representative or Review Board)
In the event the grievant is not satisfied with the Step 1 response and elects to seek review at the Step 2 level, the grievant shall, within five ( 5) business days from the receipt of the Step 1 response, forward the originals and one copy each of the Grievance and Grievance Response forms to the Chief of the Bureau of Investigation.

The Chief shall determine whether the grievance should be handled personally or processed by the immediate supervisor.

DEPUTY SHERIFF - GENERALIST
Definition
The classification of Deputy Sheriff is established on an eight-step salary range with two Bonus Levels distinguished above the eighth step. These Bonus Levels are appointive and are not additional Civil Service Classifications. The Bonus pay will be authorized only so long as an individual works a designated Bonus Level job.
Entry Step
The basic entry level pay of a Deputy Sheriff is established at Step 1 and provisions relating to advanced step educational hiring for Deputy Sheriff Trainees will be continued.
Step Anniversary Date
Persons appointed to the classification of Deputy Sheriff (2708) shall retain the step anniversary date established upon appointment to the classification of Deputy Sheriff Trainee (2707).
Salary Step Range
The Deputy Sheriff (2708) classification will be on an eighth-step pay range.
137
611DLW
Effective November 1, 1997, all persons employed in the classifications of Deputy Sheriff shall have their step converted from a six-step salary range to an eight-step salary range as follows:
From Step 1 to Step 3
From Step 2 to Step 4
From Step 3 to Step 5
From Step 4 to Step 6
From Step 5 to Step 7
From Step 6 to Step 8
Criteria for Salary Step 8
The eighth step of the Deputy Sheriff pay scale shall be authorized after completion of one year on the seventh step; completion of Custody and Patrol assignments with competent performance evaluations; and successful completion of Custody and Patrol training programs.
If an individual's performance is less than competent in either assignment or in either training program, the eighth step will not be authorized. The individual will be limited to the seventh step of the salary range. Deputies may transfer to any other assignment where acceptable, but shall not be paid above the seventh step of the salary range. This does not preclude the appointment of these individuals to certain Bonus positions in future assignments.
138
611DLW
Certification Procedures for Step 8
It shall be the responsibility of the Unit Commander to ensure that evaluations are prepared for personnel upon completion of their Custody training and upon completion of their Patrol training.
The standard Performance Evaluation form shall be completed with an indication in the “Other” section that such training has been completed. This evaluation shall be forwarded, by the Unit Commander, to Personnel Administration for placement in the employee’s personnel file. When evaluations indicating competent performance in Custody and Patrol assignments and successful completion of Patrol and Custody training have been received, and upon verification of completion of one year on the seventh step. Personnel Administration shall authorize payment of the eighth step.
Custody Assignment Defined
Custody assignment shall be defined as those jobs within the Custody or Court Services Divisions whose duties encompass the processing, security, and/or transportation of prisoners and any ancillary jobs necessary for the processing, security, care and/or transportation of prisoners.
Patrol Assignment Defined
A patrol assignment shall be defined as those jobs within the Field Operations Regions performed while assigned to a patrol station.
139
611 DLW
DEPUTY SHERIFF IV
Assign ments/Placement
The Classification of Deputy IV will remain a class until it is phased out through attrition. Since Deputy IV’s will continue to be paid the same as Bonus I Deputies, it is incumbent upon the Department to eventually place all Deputy IV's on Bonus positions.
Priority shall be given to Deputy IV's for assignment to Bonus positions as they become vacant through natural attrition. Failure to place Deputy IV's will result in excessive cost and delays in the process of alignment.
This placement of Deputy IV's shall not cause the removal of Deputy personnel currently assigned to Bonus positions. The procedure shall be to fill the position with an available, qualified Deputy IV when the position becomes vacant.
Deputy Sheriff IV - Voluntary Demotion
A Deputy IV who is assigned to a Bonus Level position may voluntarily transfer to a Generalist Non-Bonus position by using the current voluntary reduction process. Since the classification of Deputy IV is being eliminated by attrition, a Deputy IV that voluntarily reduces a rank will not have restoration rights as the item will automatically convert to a Bonus item once the item is vacated.
140
611DLW
Notifications Regarding Movement of Deputy IV’s On or Off Bonus Positions
The Unit Commander shall be responsible for notifying Personnel Administration when a Deputy IV is moved on or off a Bonus Level position. The Unit Commander shall submit a Bonus Pay Authorization form with the name of the Deputy IV and a notation "IV” in the upper right hand corner of the form.
141
611 DLW
DEPUTY SHERIFF - BONUS I POSITIONS
Definition
Specified jobs within the Deputy Sheriff classification shall be designated as Bonus Level I positions and a salary Bonus of 5 % % above the salary step of the employee appointed shall be awarded during his or her assignment to these positions. (Refer to the Bonus Selection Standards Manual for complete lists of all designated Bonus Level positions.)
Current Deputy Sheriff IV's shall not receive this Bonus in addition to their Deputy IV pay. Should they reduce to Deputy Sheriff Generalist, they would become eligible to receive the Bonus pay for this level.
142
611 DLW
DEPUTY SHERIFF - BONUS II POSITIONS
Definition
Specified jobs within the Deputy Sheriff classification shall be designated as Bonus Level II positions with a salary Bonus established to remain commensurate with the yearly negotiated fifth-step Sergeant's salary.
Bonus II - Incremental Bonus Pay Authorization
Bonus of 11% above the salary step of the employee appointed shall be awarded upon initial assignment to these positions.
On the first year anniversary date of assignment, the employee shall receive an additional 5 1/2% Bonus and shall receive a Bonus of no greater than 5 % % each subsequent anniversary date up to but not to exceed the fifth step Sergeant's salary negotiated yearly.
Bonus II Removed in Increments
The increments of removal of the Bonus II pay shall depend upon the subsequent reassignment of the Deputy involved. If the Deputy is reassigned to a Generalist Level job, the Bonus shall be removed as follows: 11% effective upon the first day of removal;
143
611DLW
5 1/2% effective upon the first anniversary of the removal; and 5 1/2% upon the second anniversary of the removal. If at this point the Deputy is receiving the level of pay he/she would otherwise be entitled to as a Generalist, no further reduction is necessary. Otherwise the reduction will continue in increments not to exceed 5 1/2% on each subsequent anniversary date until the Generalist Level pay to which he/she is entitled is reached.
If the Deputy is reassigned to Bonus I Level position, the Bonus II pay shall be removed as follows: 11% effective upon the first day of removal; 5 1/2% effective upon the first anniversary of the removal. If at this point the Deputy is at the level of pay he/she would otherwise be entitled to as a Bonus I Level Deputy, no further reduction in pay is necessary. Otherwise the reduction will continue in increments not to exceed 5 % % on each subsequent removal anniversary date until the Bonus I Level pay to which the Deputy is otherwise entitled is reached.
144
611 DLW
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES
BONUS LEVELS I AND II
NOTIFICATION OF APPLICATION AND VACANCIES IN BONUS POSITIONS
Competition for the assignment to a Bonus position is the dual responsibility of the individual and the Department. Individuals must be motivated to actively seek out a Bonus position for which they are qualified. The Department has the responsibility of notifying its personnel as to what positions are Bonus positions and who should be contacted in order to file an application.
To accomplish this, Personnel Administration shall biannually (each January and July) initiate a Sheriff’s Department broadcast to all personnel which will:
1.	Remind all personnel of the existence of the Bonus Selection Standards Manual.
2.	List all existing Bonus positions.
3.	Give the title of the person and phone number within the individual units who has the necessary information about vacancies and application and selection procedures.
145
611DLW
When there is an anticipated or actual Bonus position vacancy, the Unit, Bureau or Division shall publish a Sheriff’s Department broadcast or unit memo to appropriate units identified on the Notification Matrix (Appendix D).
The Sheriff’s Department broadcast will contain the following information:
1.	Shall articulate the minimum qualifications for the position.
2.	Shall include a description of what materials must be submitted for
consideration and selection criteria if applicable.
3.	Shall identify the deadline for submission of applications for consideration (must be at least 10 business days from date of message).
4.	Shall state that a Selection Board shall screen each application received prior to deadline and that only those employees who meet all of the minimum qualifications will be invited to participate in the selection process.
5.	Shall state that all appointments to Bonus vacancies will be made only from the list established by the Selection Board.
6.	Shall state whether the Selection Board's List will either be Specific (used to fill current vacancies) or Active (used to fill all vacancies that occur during the life of the list).
7.	Shall specify the expiration date of the Active List if that option is selected.
146
611 DLW
Unit Level Notification
The Unit message will contain the following information:
1.	Shall articulate the minimum qualifications for the position.
2.	Shall include a description of what materials must be submitted for
consideration and selection criteria if applicable.
3.	Shall identify the deadline for submission of applications for consideration (must be at least 10 business days from date of message).
4.	Shall state that a Selection Board shall screen each application received prior to deadline and that only those employees who meet all of the minimum qualifications will be invited to participate in the selection process.
5.	Shall state that all appointments to Bonus vacancies will be made only from the list established by the Selection Board, except for previously qualified FTO's who need not participate in the Selection Board's process for consideration.
6.	Shall state whether the Selection Board's list will either be Specific (used to fill current vacancies) or Active (used to fill all vacancies that occur during the life of the list).
7.	Shall specify the expiration date of the Active List if that option is selected.
147
611DLW
Unit(s) anticipating opening(s) for Bonus position(s) shall post a notification at the bulletin board and brief unit personnel (if briefing is conducted at each unit).
The posting shall include the minimum selection standards for the position as well as the selection criteria. Whenever possible, Unit Commanders will allow on-duty applicants to participate in any required interviews, skill demonstration, or other facet of the selection process that would require a personal appearance by the applicant.
Selection - Process and Authorization
The selection of Non-Bonus personnel for placement into a Bonus position will be done in the following manner:
1,	When there is an anticipated or actual Bonus position vacancy, the Unit, Bureau or Division will convene a "Selection Board", consisting of a minimum of three Lieutenants. When a minimum of three Lieutenants is not possible, Sergeant (s) may be added to whatever number of Lieutenants are available to reach the minimum of three. This Board will rule on whether or not a candidate meets the minimum requirements of the position. Any interview, written examination, skill demonstration or other form of inquiry required must relate to the Bonus position. All applicants for that position shall be asked the same basic questions during the oral interview component. All basic questions asked of Bonus
148
611 DLW
applicants shall be germane to the position sought and be designed to elicit responses that will indicate propensity for successful performance in the Bonus assignment.
Unless a member of the Selection Board or an applicant declares that a personality or other conflict exists, whenever possible the same Board members shall be used throughout the selection process for all applicants. (Note: the intent is that all applicants will participate equally in the same testing process.)
2.	The Selection Board will provide an alphabetized list of up to eight recommended candidates to the Unit Commander for possible appointment. The list of recommended applicants, prepared by the Selection Board, shall be considered by the Unit Commander for either:) (1) Specific List; or (2) Active List. The life of an Active List shall be six months. However, it may be extended up to ninety (90) days if announced in writing by the Unit Commander and posted for the term of said extension at the Unit.
If the Unit Commander or Acting Unit Commander does not intend to appoint a candidate from the Selection Board's Active List, he/she shall personally inform the candidate in a timely manner and provide the reasons therefore. (Note: the intent is that applicants will have ten (10)
149
611DLW
days to initiate the grievance process before the Unit Commander actually fills the Bonus vacancy.) Active Lists shall not be cancelled prior to the time specified in the Sheriff’s Department broadcast or period of extension as long as any qualified candidates remain on the list.
The "Selection Board" shall submit a Bonus Selection and Appointment form (see Appendix) to the Unit Commander who shall, upon selection of the employee for assignment, forward this form along with the Bonus Pay Authorization form to their respective Division Headquarters. Division Headquarters shall, upon verification that the Selection Standards and Appointment process is complete, forward these forms to Personnel Administration for further processing.
Appointed applicant(s) (upon verification by Division Headquarters) shall be notified of their selection and the name(s) posted on the Unit's bulletin board. In all cases, a copy of the Selection Board List (Specific or Active) shall be posted at the Unit using the format listed in Appendix.
3.	Applicants who are not selected shall be personally informed by the Unit Commander, Operations Lieutenant, or member of the Selection Board as to the reason(s).
150
611DLW
4.	If the “Selection Board” rejects an applicant because he/she does not meet the minimum selection standards, these reasons must be communicated directly to the candidate by the Chairman of the Selection Board.
5.	The "Selection Board" will review and the Unit Commander shall be responsible for compliance with Selection Standards. To assist in compliance, three exemplar forms have been drafted (see Appendix), The Field Operations Region Bonus Qualification Record form is to supply experience verifications; the Bonus Selection and Appointment form will be used by the “Selection Board” and Unit Commander for appointment; and the Bonus Pay Authorization form will be used to alert Personnel Administration as to the position held for pay purposes.
Selection Standards and Criteria
Refer to Bonus Selection Standards Manual for specific criteria. Unit Commanders will be charged with the responsibility for ensuring that the selection criteria for all Bonus positions are accessible to all concerned Unit personnel.
Bonus Pay Authorization - Process
When it is determined that an individual will be appointed to a Bonus position, with the exception of Training Officer, the Unit Commander shall forward the Bonus Pay
151
611 DLW
Authorization form, SH-AD 633, through Divisional channels to Sheriff's Personnel Administration.
Station Training Officer - Pay Authorization Process
The Station Training Officer shall receive Bonus pay only during periods when a trainee is assigned to the Station and Training Officer. In such cases, Personnel Administration shall forward a Bonus Pay Authorization form, completed with the assigned trainee's name, to the concerned Unit. The receiving Unit shall complete the form with the Training Officer's name and return it to Personnel Administration. The parties agree to continue discussions regarding FTO Bonus Pay/full-time Bonus status. Discussions to start within sixty (60) days following ratification of the MOU.
Relief for Short Term Sick, Injured Personnel or Position Vacancies
Individuals may be assigned to Bonus jobs as relief for short term sick, injured personnel or position vacancies. (Short term = off or unable to perform the job for 30-days or less.) This assignment will not be authorized for payment of the Bonus. Deputies shall not be assigned to these relief positions in excess of 20 working days within a three-month increment.
Should the assignment of an individual as relief exceed 20 working days, that relief person shall, however, receive Bonus for the following three-month increment. This would take effect on the first day of the upcoming month. The Bonus would be paid
152
611 DLW
whether or not the relief person continues to perform the Bonus job. The relief personnel would not be considered as regular Bonus personnel beyond one quarter, unless formally appointed as regular.
It shall be the responsibility of the Unit Commander to ensure that personnel assigned as temporary relief for Bonus positions do not exceed this 20-day limit. Should the individual be assigned in excess of 20 working days within a three-month increment to a Bonus position, the Unit Commander shall process a Bonus Pay Authorization through proper channels. The box "other" shall indicate that the individual exceeded the 20-day limit.
Relief for Long Term Sick or Injured Personnel
Individuals who are assigned to Bonus level positions as relief for long term sick or injured personnel (long term = off or unable to perform the job for 30 days or more) shall be authorized to receive Bonus payment. The same three-month increment assignment rule applies to the appointment of relief personnel and therefore an overlap payment period will exist where it is necessary to fill in behind sick or injured personnel. It is, however, intended that relief personnel be appointed with the understanding that at the end of the three months they are subject to automatic removal. Unit Commanders shall inform the individuals selected, in writing, of their status of "temporary relief. The procedures for notification processes for selection and Bonus pay authorization shall be the same as those for regular Bonuses.
153
611DLW
Waiver of Selection Standards
No Waiver of Selection Standards shall be authorized if any fully qualified employee has applied for the Bonus position. If after the filing deadline has passed and the Selection Board finds that no applicant meets all of the minimum qualifications for the Bonus position, this shall cause the issuance of a Sheriff’s Department broadcast or Unit message for unit specific positions which shall explain that no fully qualified applicant was identified and that all other Deputies are free to apply for the position. An approved Waiver of Selection Standards must bear the signature of the concerned Division Chief and be posted at the unit.
In order to control this process, a Request for Waiver of Bonus Selection Standards form will be completed and placed in the concerned employee’s personnel file (see Appendix).
Bonus Pay - Effective Dates
Authorization to receive Bonus pay granted between the 1st and 15th of the month shall become effective from the first of the month. Authorizations granted between the 16th and the 31 st of the month shall become effective on the 1 st of the following month. The Bonus payment shall be awarded in three-month increments. Once assigned, the employee shall receive this Bonus for the entire three-month increment, regardless of subsequent reassignment during the three-month period (except upon voluntary transfer). Upon voluntary transfer from the position, the Bonus is removed at the end of
154
611DLW
the three-month increment. (Bonus II positions fall within the previously defined incremental Bonus pay removal process.)
Bonus Pay - Relating to Retirement
Bonus pay is considered as a base pay and will be computed toward retirement.
Bonus Pay - Relating to Overtime
Overtime paid to personnel receiving the Bonus shall be computed based upon the Bonus pay irrespective of the position in which the overtime was worked. This provision, though limited to the Bonus I and Bonus II pay levels, shall not alter existing Policies and Procedures relating to Bonuses existing prior to the implementation of the new system and remaining following its implementation.
Criteria for Removal from Bonus Level Assignments
In determining removal of individuals from Bonus level positions, Unit Commanders shall be governed by the following criteria. The individual being removed must fall within one or more of the following categories.
A.	Voluntary relinguishment of the position.
1.	If a Deputy voluntarily relinquishes a Bonus position, he/she may remain at the Unit unless all of the Unit's items are designated as Bonus positions.
155
611 DLW
2.	An employee desiring to voluntarily relinquish a Bonus position shall submit a memo to the Unit Commander requesting to be removed from the position. Upon authorization by the Unit Commander, the memo shall be forwarded along with a Bonus Pay Authorization form (SH-AD-633) to the respective Division Headquarters.
3.	Voluntary relinquishment of a Bonus position will not require Division Chief authorization but will be forwarded by Division Headquarters to Personnel Administration for processing.
B.	Substandard performance.
1.	Requires counseling as to areas of deficiency with specific recommendations and guidance for improving performance.
2.	The employee shall be given a minimum of one additional three-month period in which to improve performance.
3.	An evaluation of the employee's performance verifying removal steps taken shall be forwarded along with the Bonus Pay Authorization form (SH-AD-633) to the concerned Division Headquarters.

611 DLW
6.	With the Chief's authorization and signature, the Bonus Pay Authorization form shall be forwarded to Personnel Administration for processing. The Unit Commander shall be responsible for notifying the employee in writing of removal from the Bonus pay.
C.	Medical limitations.
1.	I.O.D.
In the event a Deputy suffers a job-related injury or illness, he/she shall continue to receive the Bonus pay whether or not the Deputy’s performing a Bonus job during the period the employee's case is either pending or carried under Worker's Compensation as temporarily disabled, and up to such time as he/she is either fully recovered or rated as permanent or stationary. At such time, a continuation of the Bonus pay shall be based upon reevaluation of the Deputy's fitness to perform at a Bonus level.
Should the employee file for a disability retirement as a result of an injury sustained while working a Bonus assignment, the Bonus payment will continue pending the outcome of the retirement hearing. Should the Deputy not retire, the continuation of Bonus pay is intended to be based upon a reevaluation of the Deputy's fitness to perform at the Bonus level.
2.	Illness or injury not related to work
If a Deputy is off duty or unable to perform the Bonus job for more than one month due to an illness or injury unrelated to work, the Bonus
157
611DLW
payment shall stop at the end or the three-month increment in which the individual was unable to return to work or to perform the Bonus level job for that length of time (extended illness or injury which the employee is unable to return to work with a medical release certifies the Deputy capable of performing the job with no medical limitations).
3.	Return to work from illness or injury
When a Deputy has recovered sufficiently to return to work after having been removed from the Bonus pay, he/she shall be returned to his/her Unit of assignment and to the Bonus position if medically certified as able to perform the job.
D.	Disciplinary - Result of founded administrative investigation.
(1)	May be criteria for removal depending upon the seriousness of the violation and the extent to which it compromised the employee's job competency. (2) Shall be applied in conjunction with overall evaluation of employee competency in the Bonus position. (3) Shall not be used in lieu of existing disciplinary avenues available.
The intent being that the investigation result from some action by the employee related directly to the job for which the Bonus is given, and that in all cases the removal of a Bonus be justified standing alone. The incident, by itself, must be significant enough to warrant removal from the
158
611DLW
position and to indicate the individual to be a hazard/detriment to himself/herself, other individuals or to the Department should he/she continue in the position.
E.	Position (Job) status change.
1.	Budget elimination of the job.
It is not only intended but mandatory as a part of this Bonus system that there be no situation in which the Bonus money is removed and the job remain. Any budget reductions must impact a job in its entirety and not the Bonus as a separate entity.
2.	Realignment/real location of the job.
Any realignment/reallocation of Bonus positions shall be made at the Division level. These changes may result from staffing pattern changes, contract increases or decreases, etc. It is intended that realignment be determined at the Division level to ensure consistency of rationale and approach.
F.	Job limitations and duration.
It is anticipated that certain jobs may have automatic limitations and durations of assignment. For example, a Patrol Training Officer will receive the Bonus only so long as he/she has a trainee and to a maximum of six months per individual trainee. After six months, should the trainee need further training he/she shall be assigned to another Training Officer.
159
611 DLW
G.	Removal authorization.
Justification for removal from a Bonus position other than those with automatic termination or voluntary relinquishment shall be documented and submitted to the concerned Division Chief for his/her review, concurrence, and authorization.
Reports of Filled Bonus Positions
Personnel Services shall be responsible for submitting a monthly report to the Assistant Sheriff of all authorized and unauthorized filled Bonus positions.
Increasing the Numbers of Personnel Assigned to Bonus Jobs
All increases in the numbers of personnel assigned to Bonus positions shall require the authorization of the respective Assistant Sheriff. This applies to the realignment of Deputy items resulting in an increase in the allocation of existing Bonus Level Jobs.
Creation of New Bonus Level Jobs
All requests for the creation and designation of new jobs as Bonus Level positions and/or the reevaluation of existing jobs for purposes of designating them as Bonus Level positions shall be submitted through Divisional channels to Personnel Services by September 1st of each year. This shall be a once-a-year process requiring Assistant Sheriffs' approval for the process to begin. A decision by an Assistant Sheriff on each such request shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days of the September 1s1 submission deadline. In the event the Assistant Sheriff does not authorize a request for
160
611 DLW
a Creation of New Bonus Level Job (CNB) study to be conducted, ALADS shall, within ten (10) business days of said decision(s), be provided with a written explanation of the reason(s) of the disapproval of each request for a CNB study. Personnel Administration is responsible for reviewing and submitting these requests to the Assistant Sheriffs for final authorization.
To the maximum extent practical, all approved requests for CNB studies shall be promptly undertaken and competed in a timely manner. Normally this process should not exceed one (1) year. However, in the event the CNB study will exceed one (1) year, Department will provide ALADS with a written explanation of the reason(s) for the delay. Completed CNB studies shall be transmitted to ALADS within ten (10) business days of the date said CNB studies are completed. Thereafter, the parties shall meet promptly to discuss the results of said CNB studies.
Notwithstanding the above, management agrees to initiate a new CNB study for the SSB Crime Scene Investigators immediately upon ratification of the MOU. The parties agree to meet within 60 days following completion of the CNB study.
Grievance Procedure
An applicant for a Bonus Level position may file a grievance if dissatisfied with the results of his/her application. It is suggested prior to filing a formal grievance, that the applicant first contact the Unit's Operations Lieutenant to discuss the results of the
161
611DLW
selection process pertaining to the applicant as the first/informal step. If dissatisfied, the applicant may waive the first formal step of the Grievance Procedure and submit his/her grievance directly to the Unit Commander. All other grievances filed by current Bonus Deputies at the unit shall be processed in accordance with the existing Grievance Procedure.
