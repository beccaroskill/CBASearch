JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES
The Employer and the Metal Trades Council, together with all the affiliated Local Unions of the Council, agree that in the event any jurisdictional disputes arise with respect to the jurisdiction of occupational titles as listed in Appendix A or any occupational titles added thereto by the Employer such dispute shall be referred to the Metal Trades Council of New London County for settlement in the following manner:
Upon notice by either the Employer or an affiliated Local Union involved in a jurisdictional dispute, the Metal Trades Council will appoint a committee whose responsibility will be to render an interim decision within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of said notice. Such decision shall remain in full force and effect until such time as amended or ratified by the International Union Presidents whose Local Unions are involved in such dispute.
It is further agreed that pending the adjustment of jurisdictional disputes there shall be no stoppage of work and the work in dispute shall continue to be performed as assigned by the Employer. The provisions of this Article shall be absolutely and equally binding upon the Employer, the Metal Trades Council, its affiliated Local Unions, and all employees in the bargaining unit.
ARTICLE VI
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.
A.	Should differences arise between the Employer and any of its employees or the Union with respect to the effect, interpretation, application, or alleged violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no suspension of work but an earnest effort shall be made to settle differences promptly in the manner hereinafter outlined.
B.	Before any differences, as defined above, are processed through the grievance procedure, the Steward, with or without the employee, shall discuss the problem with the immediate supervisor involved and attempt to resolve it. Failing this, the grievance procedure shall be utilized, starting with Step 1.
7
Section 2.	It is agreed that all grievances shall be dealt with as provided for in this Article.
A.	Step 1. The Chief Steward, or the Steward with or without the employee, shall present the grievance to the immediate Employer representative of the employee involved. Such grievances shall be heard by a grievance committee composed of not more than three (3) representatives of the Employer including the appropriate Labor Relations representative and not more than three (3) representatives of the Local Union involved, including the local Chief Steward and/or Business Agent.
The grievance committee shall meet each week, when necessary, to consider grievances before it for consideration and shall meet until pending grievances are disposed of through settlement or referred to the next step of the grievance procedure.
When the Local Union requests, grievances affecting employees on the second shift shall be heard between the hours of 3:00 pm and 5:00 pm once a week.
If the grievance is settled in this step, the Employer representative will retain one copy of the grievance for departmental records, give one copy to the Local Union, and forward two copies to the Labor Relations section of Human Resources. Labor Relations shall forward one copy to the Metal Trades Council for its records.
B.	Step 2. If the grievance is not satisfactorily adjusted in Step 1. of the grievance procedure within five (5) working days of submittal to the Labor Relations section of Human Resources, it shall be submitted to a committee composed of five (5) representatives of the Metal Trades Council appointed by the President of the Metal Trades Council and five (5) representatives of the Employer appointed by the Director of Labor Relations. The aggrieved employee and his immediate supervisor shall upon request, be physically present consistent with production requirements either at that meeting or a subsequently rescheduled meeting for the purpose of testifying on the facts of an individual grievance. When the committee feels such testimony has clearly established the facts of the situation, the employee and his supervisor will be excused and the committee will make its final determination regarding the grievance. All second shift grievance hearings will commence at the employee's normal second shift starting time.
8
C.	Step 3. In the event the grievance is not satisfactorily adjusted within five (5) working days from submittal to Step 2., the Union may, in writing, refer such grievance to arbitration within twenty (20) working days. In no event will such submittal occur after twenty (20) working days of the Union's receipt of the Employer's final position. If a grievance is not so referred within twenty (20) working days, it shall be administratively closed.
Any grievance arising out of the issuance of a warning slip not scheduled for arbitration within six (6) months of the date of the warning slip shall be administratively closed.
It is agreed that no Local Union grievance shall be referred to arbitration without the approval of the Metal Trades Council in writing.
Should the Metal Trades Council give written permission to arbitrate a dispute to one Local of the Union, the Metal Trades Council will also be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.
If the Union refers a grievance to arbitration, it shall determine the order in which hearings will be scheduled as follows:
Within five (5) working days after receiving the Union's written referral to arbitration, a representative of the Employer and the Union will meet for the purpose of telephoning arbitrators to schedule a hearing. The parties will maintain two (2) lists of arbitrators who will serve to hear disputes. One list will contain arbitrators mutually acceptable for the hearings of disciplinary grievances and will be selected on a rotating basis. In all other arbitrations, a mutually agreed upon arbitrator will be selected from a pre-agreed-to list.
In arbitrations involving discipline, the arbitrator will be selected on the basis of "first up, first used" in alphabetical order. When an arbitrator is called for a hearing and cannot meet within forty-five (45) days, the parties will continue down the roster until an arbitrator accepts the assignment. Those called, but not available, will not be called again until their names appear again in rotation.
It is the intent of the parties that all disputes under this procedure involving both disciplinary and non-disciplinary grievances, be heard within forty-five (45) days of the call to the arbitrator. It is understood that the scheduling of three (3) arbitrations per week under this procedure is within the discretion of the Union.
9
In arbitrations involving non-disciplinary grievances, the arbitrator will be selected by mutual agreement of the parties from a pre-agreed-to list. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, the parties shall alternately strike one (1) name from the list (the right to strike the first name having been determined by lot) until only one (1) name remains and that person shall be the arbitrator.
The Union may, following the scheduling of a grievance for arbitration, substitute another grievance to be heard by an arbitrator if the following conditions are met: (1) The Employer is given written notice thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled hearing, if the grievance to be substituted involves a non-disciplinary matter and twenty (20) days if the grievance to be substituted involves a disciplinary matter. (2) A grievance involving a disciplinary action with continuing liability is rescheduled to a later date, no damages will accrue from the date of the originally scheduled hearing until the grievance is actually heard. (3) The arbitrator is mutually acceptable to hear the specific non-disciplinary grievance being substituted.
Arbitration hearings involving disciplinary matters will be conducted as follows:
A transcript of the hearing shall be made if either party so requests. Transcripts shall be paid for by the party requesting it (unless the other party also orders a copy) and in no event shall the utilization of the transcript affect any of the time limitations herein.
Either party may file a post hearing memorandum to be placed in the mail to the arbitrator within five (5) working days following the close of the hearing. The arbitrator shall render a decision within five (5) working days of receipt of the post hearing memorandum, but in no event more than ten (10) working days from the close of the hearing. In no event shall the filing of a post hearing memorandum delay the arbitrator's award. The arbitrator's decision shall be based upon the record developed by the parties and should include a brief written explanation for the basis of the decision.
In arbitration hearings involving non-disciplinary matters, the arbitrator's award will be rendered within thirty-five (35) working days following the conclusion of the hearing. If either party has declared its intention to file a post-hearing brief, the brief will be submitted within twenty-five (25) working days following the conclusion of the hearing. In no event shall the filing of a post-hearing brief delay the arbitrator's award.
In all arbitrations, the arbitrator shall be without power to change, alter, or amend the language of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties and the decision of the
10
arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. In cases where the question of arbitrability is raised, the arbitrator (as selected in accordance with this Article) may decide the arbitrability of the grievance. In the event the Employer raises the question of arbitrability, the arbitrator shall receive evidence and testimony on arbitrability and the merits at the same hearing.
Arbitrators selected in accordance with the procedures involving disciplinary matters shall determine the issue of just cause only. In the event the Union challenges the discipline on other contractual or legal standards, it shall utilize the procedures involving arbitration of non-discipline grievances and, in such a proceeding, the arbitrator shall resolve all appropriate issues including just cause.
Section 3.	All grievances must be presented in writing within twenty (20) working days from date of knowledge of the occurrence or knowledge of the failure of occurrence, whichever may be the case, of the incident upon which the grievance is based. The Company and the Union hereby agree to extend the timeliness constraints of Article VI, Section 3 as specifically applied to the presentation of subcontracting grievances and hereafter agree that subcontracting grievances can be presented in writing no more than six (6) months subsequent to an alleged violation of the subcontracting provisions of Article XXX. It is further agreed that grievances will be scheduled for arbitration within sixty (60) days of notification and will be considered withdrawn if not heard within that period unless the parties mutually agree to reschedule or postpone or circumstances beyond the control of either party prevent hearing as scheduled.
Section 4.	Grievances "general in nature" involving interpretation and application of the provisions of this Agreement shall be initiated and signed by the Chief Steward and/or Business Agent of a Local Union or the President of the Metal Trades Council and submitted to the Labor Relations Office in Step 2. of the grievance procedure.
Section 5.	The settlement of any grievance involving wage adjustments shall be retroactive to the nearest pay day it is agreed that the adjustment should have been made.
Section 6.	Any grievance arising from discharges, suspension, or layoff will be given priority over other grievances, in the order named. The Company will conduct a suspension hearing and render its final disposition within five (5) working days of an employee's suspension from work.
Section 7.	Employees participating in grievance hearings during their normal working hours as provided in this Article shall be paid at
11
their working rate of pay by the Employer, except in the arbitration step of the procedure.
Section 8.	It is agreed that time limits defined in this Article may be extended by mutual agreement.
Section 9.	It is further agreed that jurisdictional disputes are not a subject for the grievance or arbitration procedure as defined in this Article but will be settled in accordance with the procedure as set forth in Article V, Jurisdictional Disputes.
Section 10.	Both parties shall disclose all pertinent facts within their knowledge during the course of the grievance procedure. Even though a grievance has been received and/or scheduled for arbitration, both parties have a continuing obligation to provide the other party with notification of facts that have come to the attention of either party since the referral and/or scheduling of the grievance for arbitration. Failure to do so shall preclude the introduction into evidence of those facts at the subsequent arbitration.
Section 11.	Once per month, the President of the Metal Trades Council and the Director of Labor Relations shall meet for the purpose of reviewing cases scheduled for arbitration and any other matters related to the arbitration procedure including the continued acceptability of individual arbitrators contained on the lists referred to above. The parties will give particular attention to cases involving common fact patterns so as to combine them in a single presentation before an arbitrator.
Section 12.	The Company will provide the Union with copies of payroll authorization memorandums authorizing payment of grievance adjustments and/or arbitration awards.
ARTICLE VII
WARNING SLIPS
Warning slips, will be eliminated from the personnel records of an employee after a period of six (6) months provided no other warning slips have been issued in the interim period.
It is understood by the parties that a supervisor may remove a previously issued warning slip from an employee's record earlier than the time periods indicated above.
12
It is further agreed that all warning slips shall state the date and nature of the violation.
Each warning slip shall have a space for the affected employee to sign indicating that he has received the slip. His signature shall not signify agreement with the validity of the slip. In the event that the employee refuses to sign the slip, a member of management shall so indicate on the slip. Failure of the Company to comply with this paragraph shall not be grounds to overturn the discipline, but an arbitrator may fashion an appropriate remedy for repeated failures to comply.
The Employer agrees to provide the Metal Trades Council with a copy of all warning slips issued employees in the bargaining unit on a weekly basis.
ARTICLE VIII
HOURS OF WORK
Section 1.	Basic Workweek and Workday

13
put no change of such schedule into effect without prior written agreement with the Union.

Section 5.	The Employer shall not institute any rotating shifts without prior discussion and agreement with the Union.
ARTICLE IX
CALL-IN AND REPORT TIME
Section 1.	Call-In

The Vice President of Human Resources
14
will be directly involved in the decision-making process in order to ensure compliance with the terms of the preceding statement.

B.	An employee may refuse an overtime assignment only where he has a reasonable excuse and the refusal in such event shall not prejudice his right to future overtime. However, for the purpose of
16
equalizing overtime, this refusal shall constitute having worked such hours and will be charged accordingly.
C.	Probationary employees will not be permitted to work overtime unless all other employees in their occupational title (regardless of department) and all other employees in their department (only in their local union) have been first given the opportunity.
D.	The Employer agrees that it will not, as a disciplinary measure, deny or deprive an employee his rightful turn to work overtime, as provided for in this Article. The Employer will not deprive employees of overtime assignments as disciplinary action.

It is understood, however, that if the workload requires that all employees of the respective occupational title by appropriate subdivision be asked to work, then all employees covered by this paragraph will be dealt with in accordance with the Labor Agreement.
F.	The Employer will furnish the President of the Metal Trades Council with two (2) copies each of the three (3) separate MTC Overtime Reports listed below:
(1)	A weekly report for physically limited employees (see Section 3, B(4)).

*However, all paid overtime hours accrued by second and third shift employees, only as part of their "basic workweek and workday" (see Article VIII - Hours of Work), shall not be considered or construed to be "overtime work" for purpose of equal distribution of overtime.
B. Equalization Groups
(1) It is the intent of the parties that all overtime work will be divided equally among employees within an occupational title on each shift, but not between
18
shifts by rotation if necessary, except as provided by subparagraphs B.(2) through (6) below.
(2)	The Company has the obligation to give all employees within an occupational title an opportunity to work before the occupational title is considered exhausted. This includes employees who poll unavailable for their own shift but poll available for off shift overtime. However, the Company has no obligation to work an employee a double shift on a weekend overtime assignment.
(3)	For the purpose of overtime distribution, it is agreed by the parties that each occupational title shall be separated into two (2) categories.
(a)	Skilled mechanics (including Working
Leaders and Specialists) and Apprentices.
(b)	Semi-skilled mechanics.
(4)	The Employer will reasonably balance the distribution of overtime between the two categories within the respective occupational titles.
(5)	Employees who have been limited to particular functions, within an occupational title, for health reasons, shall have their overtime equalized within the work function(s) which they are capable of performing, on a yard-wide (Employer's facilities) basis.
(6)	For other employees, not covered in subparagraph B.(4) above, who are not capable of performing particular function(s) within their occupational title, their overtime shall be divided equally within the work function(s) which they are capable of performing on a yard-wide (Employer's facilities) basis.
(7)	The Union agrees that whatever overtime hours are accumulated outside of the (16) sixteen hour tolerance on a road job shall not be considered as a liability for the company to pay in with the formulas outlined in Article X, Section 3.C.(1)(a) (b)
19
provided sufficient overtime is not available during the term of the Labor Agreement to equalize.
C. Distribution
(1)	The Employer shall distribute overtime as per paragraph B above. If there is an inequality in the distribution of overtime, the Local Union shall notify Labor Relations in writing. The Employer shall then have six (6) months to equalize overtime within the cited category of the occupational title. If the cited inequality is not corrected, the Local Union may then file a grievance on behalf of those employees who have not been equalized. The Employer shall then have ninety (90) days from the expiration of the cited six (6) months period to equalize those employees. If the Employer has failed to equalize during the total nine (9) months period, the Employer shall remunerate to make whole only those employees who have not been equalized, in accordance with the following, the intent being to pay for premium hours (including straight-time hours associated with the determined liability).
(a)	Where the inequality is fifty (50) overtime premium hours credited or less, the Company liability shall be determined as follows:
Total overtime hours paid for the employee's overtime category divided by the total number of eligible employees within the overtime category, less total overtime hours credited to each such employee(s), multiplied by such individuals rate at time of filing of the grievance.
(b)	Where the inequality is greater than fifty (50) overtime premium hours credited, the Company liability shall be determined as follows:
The employee shall be made whole by payment to him of an amount equal to the total overtime premium hours credited to the highest employee within the overtime
20
I
I
category, minus the sum of sixteen (16) overtime premium hours and the employee's total overtime premium hours credited, multiplied by such individuals rate at time of filing of the grievance.
(c)	If, at the end of the six (6) months period, no grievance has been filed, it is agreed that this period will be considered equalized and no liability may be imposed upon the Employer for the cited period.
(2)	Employees entering or reentering an occupational title will be credited with the "average" total overtime of the pertinent category of that occupational title.
(3)	When employees progress into the skilled mechanic category, they will be credited with the "average" total overtime of that category.
(4)	Overtime work involving employees represented by Local 106, O.P.E.I.U., will be distributed by occupational title by shift by Department.
(5)	Employees permanently transferred from one shift to another will be credited for purposes of overtime equalization, with the "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" on the prior shift (excluding their prior starting average) or the average "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" ("Average Premium Hours") of the pertinent category of the occupational title of the new shift, whichever is greater. The Employer will not change an employee's normal or regular shift to equalize overtime and/or correct an inequality. The Employer will furnish the President of the Metal Trades Council every two (2) months a report of all employees whose shift has been changed.
EXAMPLES
A.	A second shift employee completes the probationary period and is assigned a starting average of the "Average Premium Hours" of the second shift (200 hours). Six months later the employee is transferred to 1st shift where the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent category are 120.
21
I
I
The transferred employee now has "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" or 252 consisting of:
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
12 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused"
24 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show 8 hrs. x 3)"
200 "Start Average"
268 "Total Overtime Premium
Hours Credited"
In this case the employee's starting average would be reduced to 68 hours making the employee's "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" equal to the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent shift.
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
12 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused"
24 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show 8 hrs. x 3)"
68 "Start Average"
136 "Total Overtime Premium Hours
Credited"
B.	In this example a second shift employee has 262 "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" consisting of:
160 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused"
16 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show)"
54 "Start Average"
262 "Total Overtime Premium Hours
Credited"
The employee is transferred to first shift where the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent category are 120. In this case the entire starting average would be removed to reduce the employee's "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" to 208 as shown below:
160 "Overtime Premium Hours Paid"
32 "Overtime Premium Hours Refused"
16 "Overtime Premium Hours
(No Show)"
0 "Start Average"
208 "Total Overtime Premium Hours
Credited"
22
This employee would not be asked to work until the "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" for other employee(s) in the category increased enough to make the person eligible.
C. Employees who are transferred to a shift where their "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" are less than the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent category will be given an average to make them equal to that pertinent category.
(6)	Employees who are absent on Friday, regardless of reason, shall be charged with the applicable amount of "refused overtime" based on the overtime assignment that would have been offered had the employee been at work.
(7)	Letters of April 1, 1977 and September 22,1977 between the parties are	re-executed	and
incorporated in their entirety (except for names and titles) in this Article.
(8)	Employees transferred from restricted duty and suspense departments to regular duty will be credited for purposes of overtime equalization with the "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" at the time of their return (excluding their prior starting average) or the average "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" ("Average Premium Hours") of the pertinent category of the occupational title and shift, whichever is greater. Where their "Total Overtime Premium Hours Credited" are less than the "Average Premium Hours" of the pertinent category they will be given an average to make them equal to that pertinent category. The Employer will not transfer employees to and from restricted duty and suspense departments to equalize overtime and/or correct an inequity.
Section 4. Continuity of Application and Intent
A.	Assimilation of Interpretive Documents
(1)	This Article is a combination of:
23
(a)	Article X and Memorandum of Understanding No. 27, as published in the 1975-1979 Collective Bargaining Agreement.
(b)	Memorandum of Understanding dated January 28, 1977 (amended Article X and Memorandum of Understanding No. 27).
(c)	Memorandum of Understanding No. 72, dated September 8, 1976 (exclusion of overtime work hours accrued by second and third shift employees).
(d)	Memorandum of Understanding No. 74, dated September 30, 1976 (Sea Trial Pay).
(e)	Memorandum of Understanding No. 81,
dated January 13, 1977 (National Guard).
(f)	Memorandum of Understanding No. 84,
dated February 17, 1977 (Heating Plant Operator).
(g)	Letter from the President of the Metal Trades Council to the Manager of Labor Relations, dated April 1, 1977.
(h)	Letter from the Director of Operations to the President of the Metal Trades Council, dated September 22, l977.
(2)	This Article has been restructured to eliminate the need to refer to additional documents (cited in subparagraph A.(1) above); however, the intent and application of this Article, as modified by said documents, shall remain the same, except for the specific changes executed herein pertaining to shift changes, and separate MTC Overtime Reports for physically limited employees, and sea trial and road jobs.
B.	(1) Overtime hours accrued as a result of cold weather duty, whereby transportation repairmen report to work earlier than their normal shift start time to start vehicles in temperature less than 20 degrees Fahrenheit, will be removed from the overtime tab
24
run for transportation repairmen on said voluntary duty.
(2) The Union and the Company agree to the following regarding the assignment of Truck Driver/Forklift Operators, Trailer Truck Drivers, Locomotive Operators, Ctec Operators, Mechanics and Warehouseman on launching and commissioning overtime assignments.
Pursuant to past practice, the Truck Driver/Forklift Operator title will be exhausted before proceeding to exhaust the remaining titles in the following sequential order:
(1)	Trailer Truck Drivers
(2)	Locomotive Operator
(3)	Operators
(4)	Mechanics
(5)	Warehouseman
Once a title has been exhausted, i.e., all its occupants have been given the opportunity to work, any overtime accrued "out-of-title" will be removed from the MTC Overtime Report.
(3)	All employees in occupational titles under the jurisdiction of the Laborer and Teamster locals must be given the opportunity (exhaust) to perform snow removal work on overtime before other employees will be afforded similar overtime opportunities.
Any overtime hours accrued as a result of snow removal will be removed from the overtime tab run for all employees in all occupational titles.
(4)	The parties mutually agree that the performance of nuclear work (any work where TLD is required to measure radiation exposure) constitutes an exemption for overtime equalization pursuant to Article X, Section 3.B.(6) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The recognition of this exemption by the parties will not affect the interpretation or application of Article X, Section 3.B.(6). The applicability of this provision to situations involving other capabilities or qualifications will continue to be determined on a case by case basis. Each
25
I
I
case will involve consideration of the principles delineated in two arbitration awards, OPE-218-83 and MTC-2029A-8.
(5)	The Company and the Union agree to the following regarding the assignment of bargaining unit employees to perform submarine availabilities (Availabilities) at the Subbase in Groton, Connecticut.
Availabilities performed at the Groton Subbase will not be considered a "road job" as defined in Article X, Section 3.A. However, for purposes of overtime equalization, the exemption provided by Article X, Section 3.B.(7) applies to those employees so assigned. For the purposes of selection, employees will be eligible for said assignment if they fall within the 35-hour variance as determined from low to high in their respective occupational title and shift. The Company agrees to put forth a good faith effort in providing advanced notification of selected employees. Article X, Section 3.B.(7) would apply to those employees so assigned. Assigned employees who exceed the reported high in their respective occupational titles as a result of overtime work accumulated on the Availabilities will be coded to indicate that they are exempted from overtime equalization requirements.
Upon completion of the Availabilities assignment, exempted employees will be frozen from future overtime assignments until said employees fall within the 16 hour variance afforded by Article X, Section 3.A.(4). An assigned employee who subsequently falls within the 16-hour variance will be eligible for road job assignments of a non-local nature pursuant to the Foley-Degregory memorandum dated September 22, 1977 as referred to in Section 4.A.(1)(h) of the current labor agreement.
(6)	In utilizing "Group assignment flexibility" ("flexibility") for making weekend overtime assignments, the Company shall assign overtime to employees in occupational titles normally assigned to perform the primary tasks scheduled.
When weekend overtime is being performed the Company may utilize flexibility as circumstances require.
If it is determined that overtime was not properly assigned under the terms of this Memorandum, the proper remedy will be hour-for-hour equalization for the affected title.

Section 1.	Introduction
Employees will be reimbursed for transportation and subsistence expense while on authorized Employer business in accordance with the provisions of this Article and SP 8-2 (Revision 30, effective 8/2/05).
37
Section 2.	Definitions
A.	Local Assignment - Travel to locations which do not require overnight accommodations.
B.	Regular Business Trips - Travel assignment, other than foreign, within the continental limits of the United States and Canada requiring overnight accommodations lasting not more than thirty (30) days.
C.	Extended Work Assignment - An assignment, other than foreign, which is expected to last more than thirty (30) days but not more than twelve (12) calendar months and requires an employee to obtain lodging at a location other than his established residence.

Section 3.	General
A.	Policy - The basic intent of this Article is to ensure that an hourly employee will not lose wages as a result of travel required on Company business which occurs during the employee's regular hours of employment. Travel by hourly employees on Company business is usually required during the normal work shift and during the normal workweek; however, Company business objectives may make deviations from this policy if necessary.
B.	Travel Authorization - Determination of the need, method, and length of travel, the amount of cash advance, and justification of expenses are subject to approval by the cognizant Manager or his designated alternate. The method of travel used is based on consideration of transportation costs, subsistence expenses, conflict of schedules, and the importance of the time element.

Any employee who requests and receives sick leave hours for an absence will not be subject to discipline for that absence.

Section 3.	Termination for Lack of Work,
Regression and Recall
A.	When a reduction in the working force becomes necessary,
employees will be laid off by seniority within their occupational title and seniority category as provided for herein, except as provided in Section 1A and Section 2.
(1)	Probationary employees within any occupational title shall be laid off before any employees with seniority within that occupational title.
(2)	Semi-skilled Mechanics within any occupational
title shall be laid off, in order of seniority, before Skilled Mechanics and Apprentices (combined) within that occupational title.
57
(3)	If further layoffs become necessary, the Skilled Mechanics and Apprentices (integrated for purposes of seniority) shall be laid off in order of seniority.
The number of employees to be included in the reduction of the working force within each occupational title and seniority category shall be determined by the Employer.
Each occupational title shall be considered separately in cases of termination for lack of work, regression and recall. For example: Pipefitter shall be considered a separate occupation from Pipefitter-Silver Brazer, and Burner shall be considered a separate occupation from Welder-Structural.
Any employee who has been, or is, promoted to a premium title and becomes subject to layoff within that occupational title may elect to regress, in lieu of layoff, to the classification and occupational title from which he was promoted (learners and mechanics will be allowed to regress to their former occupational title at the rate of pay they would have attained through normal progression had they remained in their former occupational title, but in no event lower than third class). The employee may re-enter, seniority permitting, with all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union.
Recalls of employees who have properly registered for recall shall be accomplished in reverse order of layoff within their occupational seniority category as requirements are established by the Employer. This means the last employee laid off within his seniority category in an occupational title shall be the first employee recalled, assuming he has maintained his recall registration.
Representatives of affected Local Unions will assist in the recall process by calling recalled employees to determine whether they intend to exercise their recall rights.
Employees recalled must notify the Employment Office of their intent to accept recall, within seven (7) days after mailing of a certified letter by the Employer, and must report to work within seven (7) calendar days from date of notification to the employer of intention to return to work.
B.	Promotions During Periods of Layoff. Eligible employees shall be promoted within a seniority category of an occupational title defined in Appendix A during periods of layoff.
58
C.	It is agreed that the Employer may terminate employees for temporary periods not to exceed thirty (30) days if circumstances require such action due to a temporary lack of work. The least senior employees in affected occupational titles shall be the first employees temporarily laid off in such circumstances.
D.	If the Employer decides that a reduction in force within an occupational title is necessary, the Union will be contacted to determine whether any employees in the affected occupational title desire to be laid off out of seniority order in lieu of less senior employee. Volunteers within the occupational title will be laid off before any other employee. If there are more volunteers for layoff than required, the most senior volunteers will be selected. Once employees have been notified of layoff, no further volunteers will be considered unless the affected employees agree that their layoff be canceled. Employees who volunteer for layoff under these circumstances will be required to sign an agreement waiving their right to be laid off in seniority order and informing them of their layoff and recall rights. Employees who sign this agreement will not be permitted to revoke it thereby forcing another employee to be laid off. If such employees subsequently accept temporary recall for a period of six (6) months or less, they will not be permitted to displace less senior employees when they are laid off at the conclusion of the temporary recall.
Section 4.	Loss of Seniority
A.	When an employee fails to report absence from work within five (5) working days unless such employee can furnish a reason satisfactory to the Employer for not so reporting. An employee who fails to report, as provided herein, will receive a certified letter from the Employer, and unless such Employee can furnish, within three (3) days from the date of mailing, a reason satisfactory to the Employer for not so reporting, he will be terminated.
B.	All employees on layoff status will be required to register with the Employer, either in person or in writing, once every six (6) months in order to retain recall rights. The registration periods are January 1-15 and July 1-15 of each calendar year. Failure to register within these defined periods will cause the employee to lose all recall rights under the Agreement.
Thirty (30) calendar days prior to the above registration periods the Company will notify all employees with recall rights by certified letter of their obligation to comply with the registration requirement.
C.	Failure to return at the expiration of an authorized leave of absence.
59
D.	After an employee is absent due to lack of work for more than thirty (30) consecutive months. Employees on recall status shall keep Employer informed of current address.
E.	(1) If an employee voluntarily quits, is discharged for cause or is retired under the provisions of Article XV.
(2)	Whenever an employee is laid off and is subsequently rehired into another occupational title, the employee shall be required to satisfactorily complete a probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days from the date of rehire. This new probationary period is only to determine the employee's suitability in the new job. The employee shall be eligible for overtime assignments during this probationary period.
Seniority shall be credited in accordance with Article XXII, Section 5, Paragraph G(1) from the date of rehire.
Seniority and recall in the title from which originally laid off shall not be lost:
(a)	If the employee voluntarily quits (excluding resignation in lieu of discharge) within thirty (30) days of the date of rehire.
(b)	Within ninety (90) days of rehire, it shall be management's right to remove any rehired employee whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory. Any such removal will not be subject to arbitration.
F.	Any employee who has been, or is, promoted or transferred out of the bargaining unit to a salaried non-supervisory position.
Section 5.	Retention of Seniority
Employees shall accrue seniority when they are on:
A.	Military Service/Reserve Duty, Article XIX.
B.	Authorized Leaves of Absence, Article XVII.
C.	Vacations, Article XVI.
60
D.	Jury Duty, Article XVIII.
E.	Sick Leave, Article XX.
F.	Plant Shutdown, Article XVI.
G.	Periods of Layoff which do not exceed thirty (30) consecutive months when recall registration has been maintained as required by Section 4.B.
(1)	When employees are rehired into another occupational title during the thirty month period, their service time in the new occupational title (up to thirty months) shall be temporarily credited in that title for purposes of layoff. If such employees are laid off again, they shall have recall rights to their original title only.
(2)	(a) If any employee covered by paragraph (1)
refuses recall to their original title, seniority in the new occupational title shall be the date of rehire for purposes of layoff and recall. Such employee shall retain all other rights and benefits based on total service with the Employer.
(b) Any employee who declines an offer of recall to a position for a period of thirty (30) calendar days or less will not lose his recall rights.
(3)	If any employee loses his recall rights because the
Employer was unable to recall him, the employee will then be credited with all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union for purposes of layoff and recall. If the employee was rehired into a different Local Union, such employee shall retain all other rights and benefits based on total service with the Employer.
(4)	When an employee is laid off from a premium title,
he will have all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union for seniority when applying for a transfer to another premium title. On the date of transfer the employee will have all of the service
61
time he has accrued within that Local Union for seniority. However, by transferring the employee waives his recall rights to his former premium title.
H.	Medical Transfers.
(1	) Whenever an employee is transferred for medical reasons and the medical limitations are eliminated or altered sufficiently to permit the employee to resume working in their former occupational title, such employee will then be returned, seniority permitting, and credited with all the seniority that would have been accrued had the employee not been medically transferred. (This provision will be applied retroactively to December 31, 1984, for all employees thus affected.)
In the event a reduction in the workforce becomes necessary affecting the above mentioned employees, these employees shall be returned to their status in the suspense department they came from. This is not considered a layoff. However, the parties agree the reduction will be accomplished by seniority.
The Company agrees when a restricted duty opening occurs, first consideration for that opening will be given to the senior qualified employee on the applicable restricted duty list of employees with the necessary physical capacities. If the Union objects to the medical restrictions placed on an employee by the yard hospital it must grieve within twenty (20) working days of notice of the restriction to the employee.
Section 6.	General Provisions
A.	Probationary Period: All new employees of the Employer shall be required to satisfactorily complete a probationary period of one hundred-eighty (180) calendar days from the date of hire before attaining any seniority status. If an employee is retained on the active payroll, the employee's seniority shall be computed from his date of hire. If such employee transfers to an occupational title within the jurisdiction of the same local union during probation, his seniority date shall be computed from date of hire. If the employee transfers to an occupational title outside the
62
I
I
jurisdiction of his own local during probation, his seniority will be computed from the date of the transfer. Employees in the probationary period have recourse to the Grievance Procedure in all matters except discharge. The provisions of this section do not apply to the apprenticeship program.
B.	Conditions of Transfer and/or Promotion:
(1)	(a) When employees are transferred between
occupational titles within the jurisdiction of one Local Union, such employees shall have seniority in the occupational title to which they are transferred as of date of hire upon satisfactorily completing six (6) months in the new occupational title. During this six (6) month period, the transferred employee shall retain seniority rights in the occupational title from which he was transferred. If a reduction in the work force should occur during this six (6) month period, the employee will be subject to layoff on the basis of his seniority in his original occupational title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual who transfers to a premium title within the jurisdiction of the same Local Union will have all of the service time he has accrued within that Local Union as of the date of transfer.
(b) In cases of transfer or promotion between occupational titles within the jurisdiction of one Local Union, the senior qualified employee shall have preference over other employees provided he possesses the necessary qualifications to perform the work in the occupational title where the opening occurs.
(2)	(a) Employees transferring between
occupational titles represented by different Local Unions of the Metal Trades Council shall have seniority in the occupational title to which they are transferred as of date of transfer for purposes of layoff and recall. Such employees shall receive fringe benefits under this Agreement based on total seniority since their most recent date of hire.
63
I
I
(b) In case of transfer or promotion between Local Unions, senior qualified employees within the bargaining unit shall be given the opportunity for such transfer and/or promotion before any new employees are hired into the occupational title where the opening exists.
(3)	It is understood and agreed that no employees will be transferred into any occupational title within the bargaining unit where there are employees on layoff status with recall rights.
(4)	Seniority Lists: The Employer agrees to provide the Metal Trades Council a seniority list of employees in the bargaining unit on the basis of occupational titles defined in Appendix A each January and July during the term of this Agreement.
(5)	Any employee who is transferred to a job represented by another Union, and is subsequently returned to the bargaining unit, shall have seniority as of the date of his return.
(6)	Any employee who is transferred out of the bargaining unit to the MDA-UAW Design Work Category and is subsequently laid off and transferred back to the occupational title from which he was transferred shall be credited with full bargaining unit seniority accumulated up to the time of leaving the bargaining unit.
The laid off employee may re-enter his occupational title in the bargaining unit provided his former bargaining unit seniority is greater than any employee on layoff status with recall rights in that occupational title.
This provision is limited to employees who transferred to the MDA-UAW Design Work Category between June 4, 1995 (or who were enrolled in Drafter Training Class #5) and December 7, 1997 (or who were enrolled in Drafter Training Class #35).
64
C.	Conditions for openings in premium trades:
(1)	The Company will give the M.T.C. written notice which will specify the occupational title, the number of openings to be filled, and the effective date of the posting.
(2)	The Company will post the opening for a period of ten (10) working days in accordance with past practice.
(3)	The notice, if not filled, will expire no later than nine (9) months from the effective date of the posting. The Company may issue a new notice pursuant to paragraph (1) within a nine (9) month period. However, the new notice will automatically cancel and supersede the prior notice.
D.	Premium to Premium Title Transfers
(1)	Employees wishing to transfer from one premium title to another will be required to apply through the normal premium posting procedure. They will be integrated by seniority into the posting list along with non-premium applicants from the same local.
(2)	In the event of a layoff in a premium title, affected employees will regress to the last non-premium title held, within the bargaining unit, seniority permitting.
(3)	For premium to premium transfers, resulting from a posting, a lateral transfer memo is not required.
E.	The occupational titles of Construction Mechanic, Laborer, Custodian, and Janitor will be combined for purposes of layoff and recall, but not for medical transfers as defined in Article XXII, Section 5H of the 19911995 collective bargaining agreement.
F.	The occupational titles Fire Inspector and Firefighter will be combined for purposes of layoff and recall.

During the term of this Agreement there shall be no lockouts on the part of the Employer and no strikes, slowdowns or stoppages of work on the part of the employees, and the Union and each of its affiliated Local Unions agree that neither it nor they nor any Local Union officers or representatives will call, instigate, authorize, sanction, or ratify any strike, slowdown or stoppage of work. It is further agreed that there shall be no liability on the part of the Union or any of its affiliated Local Unions, its Local Union officers or representatives for any damages resulting from such strike, slowdown or stoppage of work unless a strike, slowdown or stoppage of work has actually been called, instigated, authorized, sanctioned or ratified by the Union or a Local Union affiliated with the Union or any of its Local Union officers or representatives or unless said Union or affiliate fails to comply with the provisions of the following sentences of this section. Should any employee, group of employees or Local Union affiliated with the Union engage in any strike, slowdown, or stoppage of work, the Union and the Local Union affiliated with the Union whose members may be involved, shall forthwith disavow any such strike, slowdown or stoppage of work and shall refuse to recognize any picket line established at any of the Employer's facilities in connection therewith. Furthermore, the Union and the Local Union affiliated with the Union involved, at the request of the Employer shall take every reasonable means to induce such employees, group of employees, or Local Union affiliated with the Union to terminate the strike, slowdown or stoppage of work and resume normal operations. It is understood and agreed that the Employer during the first twenty-four (24) hours of such strike, slowdown or stoppage of work shall have the sole and complete right of reasonable discipline short of discharge including forfeiture of vacation pay theretofore earned, and such employees shall not have any right to or be entitled to recourse to any other provisions of this Agreement. After the first twenty-four (24) hour period of such strike, slowdown or stoppage of work and if such stoppage continues, however, the Employer shall have the sole and complete right to discharge immediately any employee participating in any such strike, slowdown or work stoppage, and such employee shall not be entitled to or have any recourse to any other provision of this Agreement, but if the Employer shall fail to exercise its right of discharge within five (5) calendar days after the commencement of such action by the employee or employees, it may not thereafter discharge or discipline such employee or employees for that violation or violations of this Article.
Section 2.	Notwithstanding the provision of Article VI Grievance Procedure, either party to a dispute under Section 1 hereof shall be entitled to obtain immediate arbitration whenever a violation of Section 1 above shall be alleged. In this event, notice shall be made by telegram to the
72
other party to this Agreement, and if one or more Local Unions affiliated with the Union are involved, to such Local Unions, and to the permanent arbitrators to be selected by the parties for such purposes, who shall serve as such for the duration of the Agreement. The arbitrator shall hold a prompt hearing within forty-eight (48) hours after receipt of the notice and shall render an award within twelve (12) hours after the hearing. In such case, the arbitrator shall make findings of fact concerning the alleged violation, and if a violation shall be found to have occurred, he shall prescribe appropriate relief including an order requiring any party or parties or employee or group of employees to desist from any violations of Section 1 hereof, and/or an award for damages, including liquidated damages for a breach of this Article, after the same or a subsequent hearing, against the offending employee or employees, party or parties. In the event the arbitrator enters an order to desist from any violations of Section 1 above, it is agreed that he shall make as a part of his order a provision in his award to the effect that if he finds there is thereafter a continuing or future violation of this Article during the term of this Agreement, it shall automatically be deemed to be subject to the desist order entered by the arbitrator in such proceeding. Upon receipt by the parties from the arbitrator of a finding that a continuing or future violation of Section 1 has taken place, the offended party may proceed forthwith to secure a court order to confirm and enforce said desist order. It is understood that the liability of the Union and of each of the Local Unions is several and not joint.
Section 3.	It is intended and agreed that the procedure herein established for the adjustment of grievances and disputes shall be the exclusive means for the determination of all grievances and disputes whatsoever, including the arbitrability of any grievance or dispute or any claim based upon an alleged breach of this Article. Neither the Employer nor the Union shall institute any action or proceeding in a court of law or equity, state or federal, other than to compel arbitration or to correct, confirm, vacate, modify or secure enforcement of any award or decision of the permanent arbitrator. This provision shall be a complete defense to and also grounds for a stay of any action or proceeding instituted by any party contrary to this Agreement.
Section 4.	Employees will undertake to carry out properly any work assignment given them. In the event any grievance arises over the propriety of the assignment of the work, the work will be performed by the employee without interruption and the employee shall have the right to have the grievance disposed of in accordance with the grievance procedure established herein, except as modified in the above sections of the Article.
73
Section 5.
A.	Whenever a violation of Section 1 of the Strikes and Lockouts Article shall be alleged, notification by telegram shall be made by either party to each of the arbitrators on said panel in turn until one is found to be immediately available to hear and decide the case in accordance with the provisions of said Article of the Agreement. The parties have agreed upon the following panel of arbitrators: Timothy Bornstein and Eric Schmertz.
B.	The costs of the arbitration shall be shared equally by the Employer and the Union.
ARTICLE XXXII
SEPARABILITY AND SAVINGS
Should any part hereof or any provisions herein contained be rendered or declared invalid by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation or by any decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidations of such part or portion of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remaining portions hereof; provided, however, upon such invalidation the parties agree immediately to meet and negotiate such parts of provisions affected.

Section 1.	The Employer shall make provision for the safety and health of its employees during the hours of their employment.
Section 2.	The Union will cooperate with the Employer in encouraging employees to observe all safety regulations prescribed by the Employer and to work in a safe manner.

One or more of these members may be designated from each shift where two hundred (200) or more employees are assigned. This committee will meet with the safety representatives of the Employer to assist and make recommendations to, and cooperate with, the safety representatives of the Employer. Such meetings shall be held at least once each month and minutes thereof shall be prepared by the Employer's safety representative and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Union. The employees on the Safety Committee shall be designated in writing by the Union. Employees so designated shall deal exclusively in safety matters. The employees who shall be so designated by the Union on the Safety Committee shall be employees who have knowledge of the practices at the Yard and who have worked there a minimum of one (1) year.
Section 3.	The defined method of operation for members of the MTC Safety Committee agreed upon by the Employer and the Union is as follows:
75
A.	When a Union Safety Committee member receives a complaint on safety, he/she will be allowed to check the condition personally to evaluate the complaint.
B.	After he/she personally investigates the complaint and feels it is valid, he/she will advise the Safety Department in writing of the condition he/she feels hazardous. The Union Safety Committee member may deal directly with supervision on the job to attempt to resolve any given situation, except in case of extreme emergency.
C.	The Safety Department will investigate the complaint and take corrective action if it is deemed appropriate. The Union Safety Committee member will be advised of the disposition of the case in writing as soon as possible.
D.	Any complaints which the Union does not feel have been satisfactorily resolved may be brought up at the next scheduled meeting of the Union/Management Joint Safety Committee. If the committee feels that the Union complaint is valid, it will recommend appropriate action through Human Resources and/or management channels. If the Union is not satisfied with the action of the Joint Safety Committee, it may pursue the issue through the grievance procedure.
E.	Safety Committee members designated by the Union shall have the right to devote their full time during the regular scheduled workweek to perform the functions outlined in this Section. They shall be paid at their working rate for all time provided for in the Agreement.
The Employer shall not be obligated to pay second and third shift Safety Committee members for attendance at the scheduled Joint Safety Committee meetings.
Section 4.	The booklet "Accident Prevention Booklet for Employees," shall be made available to all employees.
Section 5.	It is the aim of the parties to solve problems and promote safety at the work place. The Employer therefore agrees to abide by the provisions of "OSHA" and to comply with all state and federal regulations pertaining to safety on the job.
Section 6.	The Employer shall train all electrical employees that work energize circuits in C.P.R. as frequently as recommended by the American Heart Association guidelines. All new employees expected to work on energized circuits shall receive C.P.R. training before starting work on live circuits. In addition, the Employer agrees to train employees (the
76
number to be determined by the Employer) in C.P.R. to provide coverage in all areas where employees are working.
Section 7.	The Employer shall provide a Tank Watch for each shipboard tank wherein only one (1) employee is working.
Section 8.	The Employer shall instruct employees in the proper use of safety equipment required by the employee to perform assigned work.
ARTICLE XXXVI
INVENTIONS
The Employer shall have the right to require each employee to sign the Invention Agreement Form No. 84-00-2515.
ARTICLE XXXVIII
SHIFTS
1.	The second and third shift employees shall receive seven percent (7%) per hour above "base rates", figured to the nearest cent.
2.	Where the starting time of an employee is prior to the starting time of his normal or regular shift, the employee will receive shift premium for all hours worked.
3.	Where the normal or regular shift starting time of an employee is 12 noon or thereafter, the employee will receive shift premium for all hours worked.
4.	Whenever an employee is receiving shift premium and his assignment continues into the first shift, shift premium will continue to apply.
5.	It is the intent of the parties that qualified employees with seniority of five (5) years or more be given preference, on the basis of seniority, for openings which occur on any shift except in those situations where there is a lack of qualified employees to fill the openings.
In any such instance, the Employer may fill the openings with qualified employees with more than five (5) years seniority on the basis of the least senior employees in the occupational title.
77
6.	The Employer agrees that it will not change an employee's normal or regular shift as a disciplinary measure.
7.	The Employer will attempt to provide notice of shift changes to affected employees as much in advance as practicable, but in no event less than five (5) working days prior to the change, except in those cases where conditions result in making such notice impossible.
8.	Employees who regress from premium titles will be assigned to the shift on which an opening in their former occupational title occurs.
ARTICLE XXXIX
SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEE REGRESSION
Any employee who has been, or is, promoted or transferred out of the bargaining unit to a supervisory position within the Electric Boat Corporation and is subsequently transferred back to the occupational title from which he was promoted or transferred, shall be credited with full bargaining unit seniority accumulated up to time of leaving the bargaining unit.
The transferring employee may re-enter his occupational title in the bargaining unit provided his former bargaining unit seniority is greater than any employee on layoff status with recall rights in that occupational title.
ARTICLE XL
UNION-EMPLOYER COOPERATION IN CRAFT JURISDICTION AND WORK PRACTICES
Current practices in regard to work assignments and operations that have been in effect under the 1968-1972 Agreement shall remain in effect, except as provided otherwise by Memo 11. It is the intention of the parties to work cooperatively toward the mutually beneficial objective of enabling the Electric Boat Corporation to compete successfully in the technologically advancing shipbuilding industry. The parties agree to discuss changes in current practices which may be proposed by either party and which are reasonably designed to improve productivity without infringing on fundamental craft union principles.
78
ARTICLE XLI
DURATION
This Agreement, effective November 8, 2008 at 12:01 a.m., shall remain in full force and effect until 11:59 p.m., of Friday, April 11, 2014, and from year to year thereafter unless either party shall, at least 60 days but not more than 90 days, prior to the expiration date of the Agreement, notify the other party in writing of a desire to amend or terminate the Agreement. The provisions of the 2003 - 2008 collective bargaining agreement will remain in effect except as modified herein.
If either party gives notice to the other as herein provided, representatives of the Employer and the Union shall commence negotiations on proposed changes within 30 days of receipt of notice of desire to amend or terminate the Agreement.
It is the intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of the Agreement, which supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, expressed or implied, between such parties, shall govern their entire relationship and shall be the sole source of any and all rights or claims which may be asserted in arbitration hereunder or otherwise.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 2C
Prefunding of Post-Retirement Medical Benefits
Before the expiration of the Agreement, the Company may establish a welfare benefit fund to facilitate the funding of post-retirement medical benefits payable under this Agreement and prior agreements between the Union and the Company. The establishment and existence of such a fund shall in no way expand or diminish any individual's right to post-retirement medical benefit coverage.

The Company may then contribute to the welfare benefit fund established under this proposal.
The Company, if it creates such a fund, may elect to use a tax-exempt trust under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9) (also known as a "VEBA") to fund any post-retirement medical benefits provided under this Agreement or prior agreements and may take any actions necessary with respect to establishment or administration or operation of such a welfare benefit fund.

111

Revenue Code, no assets of the welfare benefit fund shall ever revert or inure to the Company's benefit although the funds accumulated thereunder may be otherwise used for the benefit of the Company's employees as permitted by law or regulation.

4.	Carrying time under the Pension Plan will remain at 60 months for layoffs.
5.	Bridged Service. Employees actively at work on or after January 1, 1989 with one (1) or more years of continuous service or upon completion of one (1) year of continuous service thereafter will be eligible for bridging of credited service which was lost before January 1, 1976, subject to the following rules:
a.	The break in service which caused the loss of such service occurred prior to January 1, 1976; and
b.	Effective January 1, 2005, the benefit level for bridged credited service for employees actively at work on or after January 1, 2005 will increase to twenty-one dollars ($21.00) a month per year of restored credited service.

Effective January 1, 2009, the benefit level for bridged credited service for employees who retire from the Company on or after January 1, 2009, or terminate with a deferred vested benefit on or after January 1, 2009, will increase to twenty-three dollars ($23.00) a month per year of restored credited service.
6.	Government Approvals.
The retirement plan as agreed to between the Company and the Union shall be contingent upon initial and continuing approval of the Internal Revenue Service as a qualified plan under the Internal Revenue Code and subject to being in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REACT), the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) and any other laws affecting qualified retirement plans and the regulations and orders issued pursuant to such laws.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 4
Active Employment After the Attainment of Age 65
Pursuant to agreements reached between General Dynamics, Electric Boat Corporation and the Metal Trades Council of New London County, it is mutually agreed by and between the parties that unless otherwise permitted or to the extent required by law, including a final order of a cognizant court or order or regulation of a government agency, mandatory retirement by reason of age is eliminated.
Effective on the date of the Agreement, any employee who continues to work for the Company beyond age 65 will continue to accrue credited service under the plan while actively employed until the employee actually retires. With respect to employees who are actively at work on the date of the Agreement and are over 65 on that date, they will receive credited service for all periods of active employment worked with the Company after attaining age 65. Retirement benefits will not be paid until employees over age 65 actually retire from active service.
The parties further understand that the government agencies administering the age discrimination laws recognize that costs of such benefit plans as group life insurance, optional life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, health expense benefits program, accident and sickness coverage, and dental program may increase for those employees age 65 or older. Interpretations concerning provisions of those benefit plans to employees age 65 and over have been issued. In accordance with these interpretations, the Company Plans are amended as follows:
A.	Basic Life Insurance Paid by Company. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
B.	Optional Life Insurance. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
C.	Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Paid by Company. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
D.	Accident and Sickness Weekly Disability Benefits. Continue equivalent coverage as established for employee under age 65 but integrate benefits payable with any Social Security payments received while on disability.
114
E.	Dental Plan Paid by Company. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
F.	Medical Plan
1.	Employees age 65 and older; spouse age 65 and older will continue on the same basis as prior to age 65. If an employee elects Medicare coverage and rejects Company's medical coverage (including HMO Plan coverage), Medicare will be the employee's and eligible dependent's only medical coverage and the Company would then reimburse the employee for the standard "Part B" Medicare contribution for employee and dependent until the date the employee actually retires.
2.	Spouses under age 65, regardless of the employee's age, will be covered under the plan of benefits for dependents of active employees under age 65.
3.	Spouses 65 and over of employees under age 65 will be covered under the plan of benefits for dependents of active employees under age 65.
G.	Retirement Plan for Hourly Employees. Coverage as set forth in Memorandum of Understanding 3.
H.	Savings and Stock Investment Plan For Hourly Employees.
Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
I.	Other Benefits such as Vacation, Holidays, Sick Leave as set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Continue on same basis as prior to age 65.
From time to time the Company will review its experience and determine if the per capita cost to provide a benefit or insurance program (other than medical benefits coverage), for employees 65 or older is greater than the per capita cost for the hourly employees under age 65 (in the age class specified by government regulations) and employed by the Company. If the cost for any one such benefit, or insurance program is greater, then the Company will, at its option, have the right to change that benefit or insurance program, adjust or eliminate any payments or reimbursement so that, to the extent permitted by law, the cost to the Company will be no greater than the
115
cost it incurs for the hourly employees under age 65 (in the age class specified by government regulations) and employed by the Company.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 5

F.	The Company and the Union agree to the following regarding selection of transporter (CTEC) operators when available openings exist.
118
(i)	The senior truck driver/forklift operator or tractor trailer driver responding to a job posting will be given the opportunity to serve a one hundred eighty (180) day probationary period as a back-up driver with promotion to CTEC operator contingent upon successfully completing (a) a manual ("hands on") examination and (b) a written examination (or oral examination at the employees option) on procedural aspects associated with CTEC functions. The parties agree to cooperate in eliminating obvious poor placements based on work history and observed job-related performance deficiencies. However, the Union reserves the right to file a grievance should it disagree with management's selection in this regard.
(ii)	The Company will expeditiously develop reliable and valid manual and procedural examinations and will test one incumbent CTEC operator with the Union's concurrence in order to establish reliable and valid performance baselines. The parties agree to cooperate in developing and refining the examinations while the Union reserves the right to file a grievance should it disagree with the job-relatedness of the examinations in question or the relative weighting of job elements examined.
(iii)	No provision of this agreement will affect the Company's right to assign work within Group 3 as contained in the flexibility provisions of Memorandum of Understanding 11 of the current labor agreement.
G.	The Company and the Union agree to the following regarding the training of Department 545 employees for the Connecticut Public Service License.
Six (6) volunteers will be solicited from the truck driver/fork lift operator occupational title and one (1) volunteer from the tractor trailer occupational title to be trained for the Connecticut Public Service License. The number of employees required to hold this license will be determined by the Company. Seniority will be considered when making the final selections. The Company agrees to pay the initial required fee for the testing process in applying for the license. The Company also agrees to reimburse the initial required fee for those employees who have incurred the expense of obtaining a license as a result of the CDL training program and who currently hold an active license.
119
This provision supersedes and renders null and void the Memorandum dated June 17, 1993 on the same subject.
H.	The Company and the Union mutually agree to the following regarding Storm Crew assignments for Department 223 employees in the occupational titles OSE Preheat and Temporary Service Technician.
Due to the critical nature of work performed by these titles work must continue to be supported in instances where the facility is closed for normal production due to severe storm conditions (e.g. winter storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, high tides, flooding or other acts of God) or other emergency situations.
In an effort to secure a reliable workforce in these instances, the Company will, on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each hurricane season (by June 1st), afford all Preheat and Temporary Service Technicians an opportunity to volunteer for Storm Crew assignments.
Department Management will determine the appropriate number of employees required for each Storm Crew assignment and will consider input from the Union in this regard.
In instances where additional support over and above the level of existing volunteers is needed, management may supplement the Storm Crew with additional employees who volunteer at the time of the emergency.
In instances where the number of volunteers exceeds the required level of support, seniority, by shift, within each title, would dictate selection of the crew. Those employees who volunteer for the Storm Crew list are expected to make every effort to report to work or remain at work once the Storm Crew mode begins. Assignments may result in extended shift hours depending on the nature of each emergency.
Any overtime worked in association with this support would be removed from the employees' overtime record in instances where identified employees, for reasonable reasons, are unable to support, no "refusal" or "no show" hours will be charged.
Endorsement of this provision can be discontinued at any time by either party by providing in writing, thirty (30) days advanced
120
notification of intent to discontinue. The agreement contained herein shall remain in effect until such time that either party exercises its right to discontinue.
I.	The parties agree that vacuum cleaners will be used by occupational titles outside Painters Local 1122 only for the expressed purpose of cleaning up trade debris contemporaneous with and incidental to work assignments. This agreement will not preclude performance of trade specific use of vacuum cleaners for purposes outside these agreed to clean-up functions.
J.	The Union and the Company agree to the following regarding the authorization of pipefitters assigned to temp heat to drive a vehicle in the shipyard only to service heat to all vessels.
No passengers will be allowed in the vehicle except pipefitters assigned to temp heat duty.
Tools and equipment specifically required to perform the duties of temp heat will be the only thing carried in the vehicle.
The people assigned to temp heat must also have a valid driver's license.
Violation of this agreement in regard to the use of this vehicle as required will result in termination of this agreement and the vehicle will be removed from service.
K.	The Union and the Company agree to the following regarding the use of the Cushman Industrial Carts:
1.	The Employer has purchased seven (7) carts, Model 459 two-passenger bench type, for use by Electric Boat Corporation at Groton, Connecticut. It is agreed that no additional vehicles will be used without discussing the need for such vehicles with the Union.
2.	These vehicles will be used only to transport a mechanic or mechanics to and from his/their job site.
3.	These vehicles will be used only by a mechanic(s) to transport equipment, material and/or tools to/from their job site or tool crib.
121
These vehicles will not be used to infringe on the core functions of the affected Teamsters occupational titles.
It is understood between the parties that any violation of this agreement in regard to the use of the Cushman Industrial Carts will be cause for submitting said violation to the grievance procedure (not Article XL, Memo 11).
L.	The Company and the Union agree to the following regarding the Cushman Industrial Carts:
The Company, on a one time basis, has purchased two (2) Model U14TQHPDL2M Mitsubishi Carts as replacements for two (2) Model 459 Cushman Carts which are being removed from service. Operation of the Mitsubishi Carts will remain the same as the current agreement (dated July 18, 1989) for the operation for the Cushman Carts.
All future replacements of carts will be with Model 459 Cushman Industrial Carts unless agreed to otherwise by the parties.
M.	The parties agree that use of cleansing agents such as "simple green" for the purpose of performing general clean-up on boats by occupational titles outside of Painters Local 1122 is not within the original clean-up functions recognized by arbitrator Richard Mittenthal in PA-105-83 and as a consequence is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Local 1122. This agreement will not preclude performance of trade specific use of cleansing agents for purposes outside general cleanup functions.
N.	If the Company has reasonable suspicion that an employee is unfit for work due to the ingestion of alcohol, the employee will be directed to report to the yard hospital to take appropriate tests to confirm the presence of alcohol. If the employee refuses the tests or otherwise attempts to avoid the tests (i.e. leaves the shipyard) he/she will be treated as if the test was positive and appropriate action under the "Five, Fifteen and Out" memorandum will be initiated.
O.	When employees desire to be absent on non-paid holidays such as Martin Luther King day, such absences will only be excused if the absences are scheduled in advance and charged the time to vacation or sick leave or the employee works an alternative work week as defined in Article XIV.
122
P.	The Union and the Company agree to the following regarding the authorization of heating plant operators to drive a vehicle to service and maintain boilers at the Procurement Building, R & D Annex, Firehouse and the Fleet Service Garage.
No passenger will be allowed in the vehicle except another heating plant operator being shown the work required to service and maintain the boilers.
Only tools and equipment specifically required to service and maintain the boilers will be carried in the vehicle. However, it is not the intent of this paragraph to prohibit the use of the vehicle to transport materials in response to unplanned system shutdowns (outages) where immediate restoration of operation is essential.
Any violation of this agreement in regard to the use of the subject vehicle will be cause for submitting said violation to the grievance procedure. Continued violations would be cause for removal of the vehicle from Maintenance.
Q.	It is mutually understood and agreed by the parties that when openings occur within the occupational title "warehouseman," notice of these openings will be posted in Department 545 and senior qualified applicants from the occupational title "truck driver/forklift operator" will be considered for these openings.
The word "considered" means if there is a qualified "truck driver/forklift operator" they will be offered the opening before anyone else is hired for the position "warehouseman."
R.	1. The VANTRAN Program provides a service and does not come within the scope of any collective bargaining agreement.
2.	The Commuter Services Department promulgates VANTRAN rules and regulations for employees who ride in Company vans and is solely responsible for enforcing its rules and regulations.
3.	Violations of VANTRAN rules and regulations may result in appropriate disciplinary action up to and including loss of ride privileges.
123
*Labor Relations shall have no right to impose any discipline (e.g. warning slips, suspensions, discharges) for violations. The Union shall have no right to grieve any discipline affecting suspension of or loss of ride privileges that the Commuter Services Department may impose.
(*This paragraph shall not apply when the van is in the Company's parking lot. At such time employees will be treated as if they were in a personal vehicle and the collective bargaining agreement will apply. For example, the Company has discharged employees for use and/or possession of drugs in their car while it was in the Company's parking lot. This settlement does not waive the Company's right to discipline VANTRAN riders under such circumstances nor does it waive the Union's right to utilize the grievance procedure to represent such disciplined employees.)
S.	Electric Boat management and the MTC continue to work together to eliminate vibratory whitefinger caused by the use of vibrating hand tools such as burrs and grinders. The overall effort to eliminate vibratory whitefinger has included protective measures such as anti-vibration gloves and tools and voluntary medical testing.
Testing for the sole purpose of determining intervention strategies to reduce the risks associated with prolonged grinding will be conducted on a voluntary basis with the understanding that the Company reserves the right to implement testing on a mandatory basis in the future. The tests will not be used to determine an employee's continued fitness to perform assigned duties without concurrence from the employee's personal attending physician or a physician mutually agreed to by the employee and the Company. Employees will be paid at their normal hourly rate for any and all associated testing.
Employees will be individually informed of test results and given feedback on how to minimize the risk of developing whitefinger disease.

(iv)	The Company will notify the Laborer Local Chief Steward if snow removal manpower requirements are not being met in the Company's effort to exhaust Construction Mechanics and Laborers. The Chief Steward will assist the Company in meeting its manpower objectives upon notification.
(v)	In providing shift relief for Construction Mechanics and Laborers manning the snow removal, the Company will determine whether the continued services of the shift being relieved is still required. If required, those assigned will be expected to continue to man the snow removal. If not required, the Company will dismiss those employees being relieved. The Company reserves the right to consider fatigue factors in providing relief to assigned employees.
(vi)	Pursuant to the snow bill, meals will be provided every six (6) hours after completing a normal eight (8) hour shift while the bill is in effect.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 9
Lost Tool Procedure
This Memorandum will confirm the understanding reached between Electric Boat Corporation and the Metal Trades Council of New London County with respect to lost tools.
Effective this date, the Employer will replace lost tools to those employees who have adhered to the following guidelines:
A.	All employees required to bring in personal tools for the performance of their work, in order to make a valid claim, must have listed such tools and their cost on an affidavit which will be attested to by their supervisors as being the tools in the employee's possession. The affidavit will be placed on file in the Foreman's Office for the record. Should employees add or take home any of these tools, they must notify their supervisor prior to taking home or adding such tools. A notation to this effect will be made on the signed affidavit with the date.
B.	In the event an employee's tools are stolen or lost due to the Employer's fault and the employee submits a claim for replacement, the claim will be checked against the master list on file and verified as a tool or tools in the employee's possession. After the regular Security Department investigation is completed, the Employer will replace the lost tools and the entry of replacement made on the employee's master list.
Supervisors will be informed of the conditions of this settlement and are expected to cooperate in verifying and preparing lists of tools for all employees under their jurisdiction.
Should a claim for replacement of lost or stolen tools be denied by the company, then the President of the Metal Trades Council and the Director of Labor Relations may meet to review the circumstances of the individual claim denial.
127
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 10
Placement and Swiping of MPT’S
The Union recognizes the right of the Employer to place Automated Time and Attendance System multi purpose terminals (MPT’s) in the employees’ work areas instead of at the entrance gates. The Employer will give the Union notice and an opportunity to discuss the placement of MPT’s. If the Union believes that such MPT has been placed in an unreasonable location and the issue cannot be resolved, the Union shall have the right to resort to the grievance procedure.
The Employer agrees that employees represented by the Union who are required to swipe MPT’s in their work areas instead of at the gates shall have a grace period of three (3) minutes on all starting times at the beginning of their respective shifts on all shifts to swipe into work and shall not be considered late for work unless they swipe in more than three (3) minutes after the said starting time of their respective shifts and that said employees shall not be disciplined or penalized in any way by the Employer regardless of the number of times said employees exercise said grace period of three (3) minutes.
The Employer and the Union agree that employees thus required to swipe MPT’s in their work areas shall be allowed to line up in an orderly manner next to their MPT’s not earlier than two (2) minutes prior to the end of their respective shifts but shall not be allowed to swipe out until the end of their respective shifts.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 11
Memo Concerning Article XL
A.	The Company and the Union agree that a fully motivated, efficient work force is essential to achieving our mutual objective of continuing to be the best submarine builders in the world. The Company and the Union also agree as follows:
B.	The Company recognizes the benefits of traditional craft jurisdictions in a high rate production environment. It has invested substantial time and money in equipment and training of its employees in developing and fostering valuable craft skills. However, the realities of reduced workloads and low rate production necessitates a change to this historical approach.
128
C.	The Company is not looking for total interchangeability.
D.	The Company has the responsibility to seek to reduce idle time and will seek to continue to improve its methods, processes, scheduling and planning, training within the occupational titles, facilities, tools, and maintain adequate manpower and equipment in order to be more productive. The MTC, in working with the Company to responsibly administer Article XL, agrees that unreasonable delays in the completion of an employee's assignment will be avoided in a common sense manner without unrealistic restrictions.
E.	Notwithstanding Article XL, and subject to the procedures of this Memorandum, the Company may make assignments in the following manner to increase production efficiency and to minimize the impact of fluctuating workloads:
1.	Within each of the below-listed Groups, the Company may
assign work ordinarily or historically performed by the members of any occupational title in that Group to members of any other occupational title in the same Group. This practice is referred to as "flexibility". The Company may exercise flexibility without limitation.
2.	The Company may assign work ordinarily or historically performed by occupational titles in one Group to occupational titles in other Groups. This practice is referred to as versatility. The Company will have unlimited versatility for a maximum of sixteen (16) weeks per year for each employee. Only versatility assignments exceeding four (4) hours per day will be counted toward the sixteen (16) week limitation period. Effective January 1, 2000, this sixteen (16) week limitation period will be reduced to twelve (12) weeks.
3.	The Company will utilize versatility to enhance productivity and to reduce disruption caused by workload fluctuation. It will not be used for the purpose of depopulating local unions. The Company will endeavor to maintain historical ratios between locals consistent with construction schedules. If the Union believes that the Company has violated any provision of this paragraph, it will provide written notice of such violation to the Director of Labor Relations. The Company will have thirty (30) days to remedy the violation. If the Union is not satisfied
129
with the Company’s remedial action it may initiate a grievance under the provisions of Article VI.
4.	The Company may assign qualified employees in any occupational title to dispense tools and wire.
5.	In the event a conflict between any other provision of this Agreement and this memorandum regarding work assignments, this memorandum will control.

F.	Dispute-resolution procedures:
1.	Disputes relating to Article XL, this Memorandum and/or Appendix A will first be raised, by the employee or Local Union involved, with the MTC. If the MTC determines to
134
pursue the matter after investigation and review, it shall (within twenty (20) working days from the date of knowledge of the occurrence or knowledge of the failure of the occurrence of the incident upon which the dispute is based) provide Labor Relations with a Fact Sheet or a "Notice of Violation'', as the case may be, giving written notice of the existence of such dispute. The MTC shall provide the Company with sufficient information to properly investigate and/or respond to the dispute. Labor Relations will investigate Fact Sheets and "Notices of Violation" which have been filed.
2.	In the case of a regular grievance filed under the procedures of Article VI alleging a violation of any provision of the Agreement other than Article XL or this Memorandum, the Company may elect that such grievance be processed and resolved under the procedures of this Memorandum unless the grievance states, or the Union thereafter stipulates, that the Union does not challenge the propriety of any assignment of work. If the Union claims that the effect of properly-conducted work assignments was to violate occupational title seniority rights, such grievance may be processed and resolved under Article VI.
3.	Designated representatives of the MTC and Labor Relations shall meet, no less than monthly, to attempt to resolve such disputes. At such meetings, the parties will discuss all Fact Sheets and "Notices of Violations" filed thirty (30) days or more prior to the date of the meeting. If at such meetings the Union presents the results of its factual investigation and its reasons for believing that a particular assignment was violative, Company will provide the Union with the results of its factual investigation and its position as to whether a violation occurred and its reasons if any why the assignment was permissible.
4.	If no resolution of a specific dispute is thus achieved, or if Labor Relations should refuse to meet with MTC representatives on a monthly basis, then the MTC may within twenty (20) working days of the meeting described in Paragraph F (3) schedule such grievance for arbitration as provided below, by giving the Company written notice thereof. If any Fact Sheet or "Notice of Violation" is not scheduled for arbitration within the time provided above it shall be "administratively closed," which shall be without precedent to future assignment disputes but with prejudice
135
to the specific Fact Sheet or "Notice of Violation" thus administratively closed.
5.	Such grievance shall be resolved by expedited arbitration by a standing Arbitrator (who is willing to serve on a continuing basis), who has shipyard-related experience and who is to be selected by mutual agreement (through the A.A.A. processes if need be) and will after the issuance of his first decision continue to serve by mutual agreement.
6.	Where an Award by the standing Arbitrator holds that in a particular instance the Company committed a violation relating to Article XL, Memo 11 and/or Appendix A, there shall be no monetary remedy imposed but the standing Arbitrator shall only issue a cease-and-desist order which identifies the prohibited work performed, occupational title to which the assignment was made, occupational title claiming the work, and such other factual circumstances (such as location, duration, equipment, processes, etc.) as the standing Arbitrator decides are determinative. Each such cease-and-desist Award shall take effect twenty (20) working days after notice to the Company of the Award.
7.	If the Union claims that the Company thereafter violates a prior cease-and-desist Award:
(a)	The Union shall file a written "Notice of Violation" (identifying the prior Award in question) in accordance with, and which shall be processed through, the provisions of Paragraphs F.l., 3. and 4. above.
(b)	The Company may at any time elect that any "Notice of Violation" filed shall be heard in immediate arbitration on specially-scheduled dates within ten (10) working days or as nearly thereto as may be feasible by written Company notice to the Union and the standing Arbitrator, which hearing shall not displace any date established for the hearing of an initial dispute under Paragraph F.4. or a "Notice of Violation" scheduled for hearing by the Union under this Paragraph F.7.
(c)	If any "Notice of Violation" is pursued to arbitration (by either Company or Union election), the prior cease-and-desist Award in question may not be invoked by the Union or used by the standing
136
Arbitrator as a basis for finding a repeat violation or imposing any monetary remedy unless the subsequent disputed assignment involves the same work performed, occupational title performing the work, occupational title claiming the work and other determinative factual circumstances (such as location, duration, equipment, processes, etc.) as the prior cease-and-desist Award; provided, that the Union shall not be precluded, in an appropriate case as determined by the standing Arbitrator, from demonstrating to the standing Arbitrator that in the context of the specific work involved the particular occupational title performing the work should be regarded as immaterial to the propriety of the assignment; in such event the dissimilarity of performing titles shall not alone constitute a bar to invoking or using the prior cease-and-desist award as a basis for monetary remedy.
(d)	If the standing Arbitrator determines that the prior Award was violated, the Company shall pay the Union on an hour-for-hour basis for each hour the assignment (or portion thereof) found to be violative is proved to have been performed, provided that the Company shall not be monetarily liable for any period of performance prior to the date which is five (5) days before the "Notice of Violation" was filed. Such payment shall be at the applicable rate in effect at the time of the assignment for the occupational title claiming the work (including the overtime rate to the extent that the work was performed on an overtime basis).
8.	For all arbitrations of disputes relating to Article XL, this Memorandum and/or Appendix A:
(a)	The standing Arbitrator shall be without power to change, alter or amend the language of the contract or this Memorandum, and the decision of the standing Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties.
(b)	The Company need not respond to, and the standing Arbitrator shall not decide, any dispute which is determined by the standing Arbitrator not to have been first processed in the manner and within the time limits described above, provided that the time
137
limits set forth above may be extended by the parties themselves by mutual agreement in writing.
(c)	Such arbitrations shall be separate from, and not in
any way interfere with, postpone or replace any arbitration case scheduled or processed under the standard contractual arbitration procedure.
(d)	The standing Arbitrator shall issue his decision
forty-five (45) working days after the close of the hearing.
(e)	The Company and the Union shall equally share the fees and expenses of the standing Arbitrator and hearing officers.
G.	The purpose of this Agreement is a good-faith effort to improve productivity without eliminating fundamental craft jurisdiction. The Company and the Union agree to strive to improve labor management relations and communications so that incipient problems can be dealt with and resolved before they reach major proportions.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 12
Application Agreement - Radiation Areas
The Employer shall not be precluded from the assignment to an employee of work incidental to his job assignment which is outside his normal trade in radiation areas. The term "radiation areas" as used herein shall mean:
A.	The area of a commissioned ship between a line ten (10) feet forward of the forward reactor bulkhead and a line ten feet aft of the aft reactor bulkhead and,
B.	The high radiation work area in the nuclear repair building.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 13
Trade Technician
It is mutually agreed and understood that a new occupational title, Trade Technician, is hereby established for each of the following Local Unions: Boilermakers, Electricians, Machinists, and Pipefitters.
138
Trade Technician occupational titles will be included in Flexibility Group Nos. 1, 4, 5, and 6 under Memorandum of Understanding 11. Employees promoted to Trade Technician may perform work ordinarily and historically assigned to any occupational title listed in their Flexibility Group, including premium occupational titles.
No employees will be promoted to Trade Technician until the total MTC represented population reaches 2,400. No more than 240 employees will be assigned to these occupational titles. The Company will have the sole discretion to fill or not to fill these positions.
The purpose of the Trade Technician occupational title is to preserve skills within the shipyard. In order to qualify for promotion to Trade Technician, an employee must possess two or more designated skills. To the extent an employee cannot immediately demonstrate such skills, training will be considered if sufficient skills can be acquired in a reasonably short period. The qualification criteria for each Trade Technician vacancy will be discussed with the cognizant Local Union and an effort will be made to agree on the appropriate criteria. With or without agreement, the Company will post the vacancy. Candidates from the affected Flexibility Group will be jointly evaluated by the Company and the Local Union. If there is disagreement over who is qualified, the Company may proceed with the selection.
Employees in premium occupational titles are eligible to apply for promotion to Trade Technician. They will be promoted in seniority order from groups of qualified applicants.
Promotion to Trade Technician will be based on seniority in the group of qualified applicants. If the Union disagrees with the qualification criteria or the application of these criteria to the applicants, it may pursue this disagreement through the grievance procedure and arbitration.
Employees promoted to Trade Technician will be paid fifty cents ($0.50) above the First Class Mechanic rate of pay.
Effective November 8, 2008 the Company and Union agree to eliminate the occupational title for all Locals.
Employees in the trade technician occupational title as of November 7, 2008 will continue in this title until such time as they sever from the Company, take a position in another occupational title within the bargaining unit, or take another position outside the bargaining unit with the Company. An employee who takes a supervisory position within the Company does, however, retain any applicable regression rights back to the trade technician occupational title as provided in Article XXXIX.
139
All existing trade technicians will be merged into their former occupational titles for purposes of seniority, overtime equalization, and any other applicable contract provision as of November 8, 2008.

Occupational Summary Toolmaker I/II
In settlement of grievances M-100-93 and M-147-93 the Union and the Company agree to the following regarding the consolidation of Toolmaker and ISM Tool Grinder occupational titles:
1.	Toolmaker and Tool Grinder occupational titles will be consolidated into the Toolmaker occupational title for the purposes of determining each affected employee's contractual status including but not limited to seniority. The two (2) occupational groups will remain separate for the purpose of overtime equalization.
2.	For the purposes of merging the two (2) affected titles, Toolmakers will remain Toolmakers as classified (from this point forward referred to as Toolmaker I) and Tool Grinders will be reclassified as second class Toolmakers (from this point forward

ISM Occupational Titles Performing Toolmaker Functions
1.	From time to time in the Inside Machine Shop, various ISM occupational titles have occasion to perform work which might otherwise be performed by the occupational title "Toolmaker", a premium title.
2.	It is the Company's position that assignment of such work to nonToolmaker ISM occupational titles is based on historical practice and thus justified under Article XL, such that the Company is not obliged to pay a premium wage rate to the non-Toolmaker ISM occupational titles while they are engaged in such work. However, for business-related reasons the Company has determined that, for the duration of the current labor agreement, it is willing to pay non-Toolmaker ISM occupational titles the "while engaged" premium wage rate when performing such work, provided that:
A.	Such payments do not constitute a Company agreement or admission that such "while engaged" payments are required;
B.	The Company reserves its right to discontinue the practice of making such "while engaged" payments within the
150
Inside Machine Shop at the termination of the current labor agreement;
C.	The Union reserves its right to file and pursue an Article XL/Memo 11 fact sheet if the Company should discontinue such ISM "while engaged" wage payments; and
D.	This Agreement and the actions described herein are without precedent or prejudice to the positions of either party in any dispute, including any dispute described in paragraph 2(C) above, provided that either party may refer to this Agreement or use it as evidence, to the extent necessary to enforce its terms and meaning.

Overtime - Utilization of AT&A
During the negotiation of the 1995-1998 Agreement, the parties discussed ways to improve the existing overtime equalization system in order to ensure fairness in the distribution of overtime while reducing the administrative burden associated with record keeping.
The parties agreed to implement the following changes to the overtime distribution system and to make necessary changes to existing language if the AT&A or similar computer based system can be adapted for that purpose during the term of the 1995-1998 Agreement.

G.	Overtime
162
It is mutually agreed between the parties that overtime equalization in the occupational title Rad Con Monitor will be governed by the following provisions which shall implement the current collective bargaining agreement and associated memoranda. Except as modified herein, all provisions of Article X and associated memoranda including, but not limited to, provisions dealing with notices of inequality and grievances shall not be affected by this Agreement.
1.	Overtime shall be equalized within each of the following sub-groups in the occupational title RadCon Monitor, by shift:
(a)	Qualified monitors, as defined in Section E of this memo.
(b)	Unqualified monitors, as defined in Section E of this memo.
2.	Unqualified RadCon Monitors will not be offered overtime until all qualified monitors, on the same shift, have been offered such overtime. RadCon Monitors who have not initially qualified will not be offered overtime until all qualified monitors and previously qualified monitors on the same shift have been offered such overtime. In no event will the Company be required to assign overtime to unqualified monitors when the Company, in its sole discretion, determines that such overtime requires qualified monitors.
3.	(a) When an unqualified monitor initially becomes
qualified he will be assigned the applicable shift average of qualified monitors.
(b)	When a qualified monitor loses his qualification he shall have a four (4) week grace period to requalify. If he requalifies, he will re-enter the qualified subgroup maintaining his accumulated	overtime
credits. If he does not requalify during the four (4) week period, upon subsequent requalification he will be assigned the applicable shift average of qualified monitors. The accumulative overtime credits include hours worked or refused during the grace period as a non-qualified monitor. Upon loss of qualification he will be averaged into the nonqualified rotation.
163
(c)	When a monitor changes shift he will be assigned the new shift average for qualified or unqualified monitors in accordance with his qualification status under paragraph (1) above.
4.	The following assignments shall not count toward credited hours for purposes of overtime equalization:
(a)	Refusals for work which is canceled and through lunch assignments.
(b)	Assignments and refusals for shifts other than the monitor's regularly assigned shifts. Off-shift overtime will be offered by the current weeks rotation schedule, unless a shift's rotation list remains constant for more than two weeks. In such case, action will be taken to rotate off-shift overtime until the situation is alleviated. Monitors working on off shift assignment out of rotation due to a specialty training or qualifications will be charged for the hours worked.
(c)	Overtime worked as a result of an emergency or caused by an Act of God.
5.	The provisions of Section B concerning shield surveys will not be affected by this Agreement.
6.	Departmental overtime records shall be the controlling overtime records, and these records shall be available to the responsible department steward(s) for review.
7.	Local Submarine Availabilities for Radcon Monitors will not be considered as "Road Jobs" and will be manned within the scope of the normal/regular job assignments with overtime work being subject to the parameters established herein.
8.	Any job, including a local Submarine Availabilities assignment covered in paragraph G(7), that requires mockup training and/or extended hours, i.e., assignment projected to exceed one (1) month of ten (10) hr. shifts, six (6) days per week, will be staffed in accordance with the following guidelines:
In addition to the regular shipyard overtime list, an additional rotation list will be maintained for the above mentioned jobs.
164
I
I
Selection for assignment will be by the separate rotation list (ranked by seniority). 2nd and 3rd shift personnel will be afforded an equal opportunity to volunteer for the back shift assignment for each job. Employees whose normal shifts have been affected by the conditions of this Memorandum will be returned to their normal shifts at the completion of said assignment. Accepting or refusing an assignment will place the individual on the bottom of the rotation list. Newly qualified monitors will be placed on the bottom of the rotation list. The rotation list will continue into a new agreement as long as paragraph G(7) is "carried over" in its present form and substance.
In the event the company feels it is lacking experienced workers, it may reasonably pass over less experienced monitors on the list in order to ask more experienced monitors. In this case the less experienced monitors shall not lose their place on the list. Similarly, less experienced monitors can be rotated ahead of more experienced monitors where necessary for training purposes. In all cases the Company shall make a good faith effort to abide by the order on the list without discrimination.
Persons accepting said assignment will be charged for overtime worked on a deviated overtime list which shall be kept separate from the normal shipyard overtime. Accumulated overtime hours will be added to normal shipyard overtime at the completion of said assignment. Chargeable overtime is limited to a maximum of four hours for Saturday and eight hours for Sunday.
The penalty for refusal will be limited to being rotated to the bottom of the rotation list. Hours will not be charged for refusing said assignment. An employee asked out of rotation will not be penalized, i.e., will not be rotated to the bottom of the rotation list. Should the title be exhausted on a voluntary basis without attaining the required manpower, the provisions of Article X, Section 2.B. of the current agreement will be implemented excluding that provision requiring charging of refusals.
H.	RadCon Monitor Service Engineer Lead Monitor
The basis for promotion into and demotion from the classification of RadCon Monitor Service Engineer Lead Monitor will be based upon the need as determined by management; however, it is agreed that a minimum of one (1) LM per shift will be designated

Reasonable opportunity to qualify or requalify in a deficit area will be given, however. Any Department 438 Clerk promoted to Department 438 Administrative Clerk* will have ninety (90) days subsequent to their initial qualification in a basic Dosimetry Technician or Radiological Control Monitor function to decide whether they will continue to remain in the Administrative Clerk* Occupational title or return to their original title without loss of seniority.
4.	Department 438 Administrative Clerks* will be given consideration for promotion to the Dosimetry Technical and Radiological Control Monitor occupational titles consistent with historical promotion procedures.
5.	The following Department Clerks will be promoted immediately to the Administrative Clerk* occupational title. The Administrative Clerks* will be paid an engaged rate pursuant to subsection 3. above.
