Employees retiring under the early or disability provisions of the pension plan shall become eligible for the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Senior Advantage coverage (or the dual choice option if accepted by the Administrator) upon becoming eligible for and participating in Parts A and B of Medicare. For early and disability retirees who retire after November 1,1992, the requirement that employees must maintain Kaiser coverage during the period from early retirement to age sixty-five (65) in order to qualify for coverage at age sixty-five is eliminated.
