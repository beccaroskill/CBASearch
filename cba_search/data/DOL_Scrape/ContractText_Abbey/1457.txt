(a) Market Preservation and Recovery - With the rise of nonunion competition and infringements by other craft unions, Sheet Metal Workers and signatory contractors in recent years have suffered significant declines in their share of the market for work within the jurisdiction of the SMWIA. It is the intent of all parties of this Agreement to take strong measures to reverse these trends and provide for the long term health of the union employing industry. Accordingly, the Employers agree to commit themselves fully to Union construction and maintenance, and refrain from the forms of business organization commonly known as the “dual shop” or “double-breasted” operation. The Union commits itself to provide the Employers with wage scales and working conditions that will enable them to be fully competitive and profitable in 'all sectors of the Building and Construction Trades jurisdiction without exception, including, those most heavily impacted by non-union competition.
Section 12.	Inasmuch as the Union has demanded recognition from the Employer as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Employer’s Employees in the bargaining unit described herein under Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, and has submitted proof thereof in the form of signed and dated authorization cards, and the Employer is satisfied that the Union represents a majority of its Employees in the bargaining unit described herein, the Employer hereby recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of its Employees on all present and future job sites within the jurisdiction of the Union, unless and until such time as the Union loses its status as the Employee’s exclusive representative as a result of an N.L.R.B. election requested by the Employees. The Employer agrees that it will not request an N.L.R.B. election and expressly waives any right it may have to do so.
Section 13.	The Employer hereby agrees that all of its members, both collectively and individually, shall be bound by this
2
I Agreement, just as surely as if each and every member signed it and whether or not each does so individually and whether or not r membership is retained in the Employer Association party to this r Agreement. The Employer, as an Association, through its duly elected officers and representatives hereby declares and affirms that each and every Member has so agreed and has authorized the officers and representatives named below to sign this Agreement, both for the Association and for each member individually.
Section 14.	The Employer agrees that any and all new members) of its Association within the jurisdiction of Local Union No. 19 shall be required, as a binding requirement of membership therein, to become parties to this Agreement, immediately upon establishing membership.
Section 15.	The Employer agrees to furnish information upon request by the Union, relative to all work wherein the Union has a jurisdictional interest.
Section 16.	The Employer agrees to furnish within ten (10) days of request by the Union, completed forms as required by the Slate and/or Federal Departments of Labor for purposes of prevailing wage surveys by county. Occasional or out-of-town contractors shall complete and submit to. the Union said forms immediately upon start of a job within the bounds of Local Union No. 19.
Section 17.	If any more favorable conditions are granted by this Local Union to any other Employer in the jurisdictional area of this Contract, all Employers will have the right to adopt the same as amendment to this .Agreement.
Section 18.	The Employer agrees to submit to the Union a completed wage survey at the conclusion of every job. The Employer and the Union agree to work together on these surveys in order to complete them as efficiently as possible.
Section 19.	In order to secure job opportunities for workers covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement, each Employer who is a party to the Agreement invests significant amounts of capital and time in the training of Sheet Metal Workers, including the training of Apprentice Sheet Metal Workers and upgrading our Joumeyperson Members through on-the-job training and through the Joint Apprentice and Training Fund (JATF). In assuming these training obligations, the Employer assumes a great deal of risk in undertaking various projects. In order to secure the investment that each Employer party to this Agreement makes in both Joumeyperson and Apprentice Sheet Metal Workers, the parties hereto agree that no Sheet Metal Worker employed by any Employer party to this Agreement will compete with the Employer by going to work for a non-signatory Employer engaged in work covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement within the geographic jurisdiction of Local Union No. 19 for a period of three (3) years following their leaving the employ of any signatory Employer except as a Union Salt. Any . Employer and/or the Association party to this Agreement may enjoin any worker who violates this Agreement from working during the three (3) year period as set forth above. In addition to the foregoing right to seek injunctive relief, and whether or not such relief is sought or obtained, and because the measure of damages suffered by the Employers may be difficult to
prove,'the parties agree that an appropriate measure of liquidated damages is the cost to the Employers that is required to provide the Apprentice and Joumeyperson on-the-job training necessary to replace workers who breach this covenant. The cost of such a four (4) year Apprentice Program is two thousand (2,000) hours per year at gross labor rates times four (4) years. In the event this covenant not to compete is deemed by a court to be too restrictive, such court shall be entitled to mold a remedy for the breach, which in its discretion is more appropriate than the remedy provided herein.
The provisions of this Covenant Not to Compete will be considered to be separable and independent of each other, and in the event any provision of this Covenant is found to be invalid, it will not affect the validity or effectiveness of the remaining provisions of this Covenant.
The Union shall enforce this clause with respect to its members in accordance with the provisions of the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association Constitution and Ritual.
Section 20.	(a) In order to secure job opportunities for the Employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement the Employer shall, where the Employer sells to a purchaser which intends to operate its business as a going concern, that is, continues the operations of the business without substantial change, require the purchaser, as a condition of the sales transaction, to assume and be bound by this Agreement and to recognize the Union as the exclusive representative of the purchaser’s Employees pursuant to Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act.
