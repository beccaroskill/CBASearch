5.1	Workweek
The official work week for all employees begins at 12:01 a.m. on Sunday and ends at 12:00 midnight the following Saturday.

The City will determine which schedule will be in use; however, schedules shall not be changed without ten (10) calendar days’ notice or with mutual agreement.
When operational needs require an unanticipated change to an employee’s regular work shift with less than 10 calendar days’ notice, the employee’s schedule may be flexed within the same workweek by mutual agreement. If not flexed, the hours will be paid as overtime or banked as earned compensatory time at the discretion of the supervisor.
It is expressly understood that the City does not guarantee any number of work hours per week.

A paid rest period of fifteen (15) minutes shall be permitted for all employees during each half work day, which shall be scheduled by the City in accordance with the operating requirements of each employee's duties.

5.3	Meal Period
All employees shall be granted a one-hour or thirty (30) minute unpaid meal period during each workday depending on the operational needs and requirements of the department. To the extent consistent with operating requirements of the department, each meal period shall be scheduled in the middle of each workday. Employees may take meal periods away from the work site. City vehicles shall not be used to go for meal periods but may be allowed on a de minimis basis for employees assigned off site work.

Employees called back to work shall receive overtime pay for the work for which they are called back, and if called back shall be credited with not less than 2 hours’ time compensated at time and one-half. This section applies only when callback results in hours worked which are not annexed consecutively to the beginning or end of the working day or working shift. This section does not apply to scheduled overtime, annexed at the beginning of the work shift, or holdover times annexed to the end of the work shift or work day. If at the end of the assigned shift the employee has departed the City’s premises before being called back, the same shall not be considered a holdover time, but shall be compensated as callback under this section.
Callback shall only apply when employees are required to respond to their regular worksite to perform the duties for which they are called back.
5.7	No Pyramiding
In no event shall any employee be compensated twice for the same hours.
5.8	Compensatory Time
By mutual agreement, a non-exempt employee may receive compensatory time off at the rate of 1-1/2 times their regular rate of pay for overtime earned in accordance with Article 5.5.

Vacation leave shall not accrue during a leave of absence without pay.

It is expressly understood the employees scheduled for a workday of greater than eight (8) hours will be charged an amount of hours equal to their respective workday for every day of vacation time utilized.
7.6	Payment on Termination
In the event of death or termination of an employee who is otherwise eligible for vacation credits the employee shall be entitled to payment for accrued vacation leave at the employee’s current pay rate.

This benefit is in addition to and may run concurrently with bereavement leave the employee may be eligible for under the Oregon Family Leave Act.
8.3	Utilization
It is expressly understood that employees scheduled for a workday of more than eight hours will be charged an amount of hours equal to their scheduled hours of work for every day of sick time utilized.
(a)	Illness or Injury of the Employee. Employees may utilize their allowances of sick leave on the record at the end of the preceding pay period when unable to perform their work duties by reason of illness or injury or exposure to contagious diseases under which the health of the employees with whom associated or a member of the public would be endangered by the presence of the employee, or for any OFLA qualifying purpose or any reason allowed under the Oregon Sick Time law.
(b)	Illness in Family. Employees may utilize their allowance of sick leave when there is illness or injury within their immediate family is defined as:

(c)	Notification. In the event an employee utilizes sick leave under this section the employee shall notify their immediate supervisor or designee of the absence, the nature of the situation and the expected duration of the absence. Notification will be made as far in advance of the employee’s next regularly scheduled shift as possible unless unable to do so because of the serious nature of the illness, injury or other situation. Sick leave with pay shall not be allowed unless such report has been made.
11 | P a g e
(d)	Physician’s Statement. At the request of the immediate supervisor or other supervisor, the employee will obtain certification from an attending physician documenting the nature and period of illness.
In the event that an employee is off more than three (3) consecutive work days under this section, the employee shall provide a physician’s statement, upon City request, as to the nature of the illness, the need for the employee’s absence, and the estimated duration of absence.
The City may require a doctor’s release stating that the employee may return to his normal duties without risk of aggravating an illness or injury prior to allowing the employee to return to work. When an employee is, by reason of a personal illness or injury, unable to perform the essential duties of the job with the regularity, efficiency or degree of safety necessary and/or when an employee’s illness is at a stage where it may present an unreasonable risk of infection to others, the City may require that the employee absent himself and take further sick leave
(e)	Abuse. Abuse of sick leave privilege shall be cause for dismissal. Abuse is defined as improper use.
8.4	Sick Leave Without Pay
Upon application by the employee, sick leave without pay may be granted by the City for the remaining period of the disability after the employee’s accrued sick leave has been exhausted. The City may require a physician’s statement on a periodic basis during the period of disability.
8.5	Integration with Worker's Compensation
When an injury occurs in the course of employment, the City's obligation to pay under this sick leave article is limited to the difference between any payment received under Worker's Compensation laws and the employee's regular pay minus state and federal deduction. In such instances, no charges will be made against accrued sick leave for the first thirty (30) days of time loss that result within sixty (60) days from the date of the original injury.
8.6	Sick Leave Accumulation
The maximum accumulation shall be unlimited.
8.7	Sick Leave Conversion Program
A portion of the balance of an employee’s accumulated sick leave shall be paid to the employee who terminates employment in good standing after 10 or more years of service, or to the employee’s beneficiary in the event of death while a regular employee with the City.
Sick leave shall be converted in the following manner:
(Each full year of continuous service) x (2.5%) x (employee’s sick leave accumulation) x (employee’s hourly rate) (Example of an employee with 10 years of continuous service, with 300 hours of sick leave, who earns $18.01 an hour: 10 x 2.5%=25%; 25% x 300hrs=75hrs; 75hrs x $18.01 =$1350.75)
A PERS Tier 1 or Tier 2 employee may opt out of the sick leave conversion program and utilize accrued sick leave as defined in ORS 238.350.
12 | P a g e
ARTICLE IX	- OTHER LEAVES OF ABSENCE
