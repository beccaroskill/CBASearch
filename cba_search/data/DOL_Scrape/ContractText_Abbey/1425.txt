It is mutually understood that the following terms and conditions relating to the employment of workers covered by this Agreement have been decided, upon by means of collective bargaining and that the following provisions will be binding upon the parties to this Agreement during the term of this Agreement and any renewal thereof.
ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
Therefore, with the DECLARATION OF PURPOSES and DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES as part of and fundamental to this Agreement, the parties hereby agree to the following:
ARTICLE I
1.	Union Security. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that, as a condition of continued employment, all persons who are hereafter employed by the employer in the unit which is the . subject of this Agreement shall become members of the Union not later than the eighth day following the beginning of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; that the continued employment by the employer in said unit of persons who are already members in good standing of the Union shall be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the periodic dues of the Union; and that the continued employment of persons who were in the employ of the employer prior to .the date of this Agreement and who are not now members
-3-
of the Union, shall .be conditioned upon those persons becoming members of the Union not later than the eighth day following the execution of this Agreement. The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such required times shall obligate the employer upon written notice from the Union to such effect and to the further effect that Union membership was available to such person on the same terms and conditions generally available to other' members to forthwith discharge such person. Further the failure of any person to maintain such person's Union membership in good standing as required herein shall, upon written notice to the employer by the Union to such effect, obligate the employer to discharge such person.
2.	Agency Shop. In states in which the foregoing provisions may not lawfully be enforced, the following provisions to the extent that they are lawful shall
■ apply. Each employee who would be required to acquire or maintain membership in the Union if the foregoing Union security provisions could lawfully be enforced, and who fails voluntarily to acquire or maintain membership in the Union, shall be required as a condition of employment, beginning on the eighth day following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, to'pay to the Union each month a service charge as a.contribution toward the administration of this contract and the representation of such employees. The service charge for the first month shall be in an amount equal to ninety percent (90%) of the Union's regular and usual initiation fee and dues, and for each month thereafter in an amount equal to ninety per-
-4-
cent (90%) of the regular and usual monthly dues.
3.	The Union agrees to indemnify the Employer and hold the Employer harmless from any final determination of liability to any employee by reason of the discharge of such employee if such discharge was caused and effected by a request by the Union as provided for in the preceding paragraphs of this Agreement. At a written
■ request from the Union for an individual laborer's date of starting of employment, the Employer agrees to give in writing to the Union the laborer's starting date. The Union shall not, however, be obligated to indem-. nify the employer for any damages, expenses, or costs accruing, or incurred in the defense of any claims which may be made without merit or justification.
4- The Union security provisions in Paragraph 1 above shall not be effective in any state which prohibits union security, and shall in no event permit or require any greater union security in any state than is permitted by the laws of that state.

NEW EMPLOYEES
The parties agree that there will be no employee referral system. This is not meant to preclude the identification of employees when filling requests for job applicants.
Whereas, there has been a growing problem in the industry the last few years of employers employing new and inexperienced workmen at times when many of the regu
-40-
lar year-around employees were out of work; and whereas, this practice has created a situation where experienced employees have often times had long periods of unemployment or have had to leave the industry to find employment while new and inexperienced employees were being put to work; and whereas, management desires to maintain its management rights as set out elsewhere in this contact; and further whereas, the Union desires to afford some protection of work potential to the long-time experienced employees;
NOW THEREFORE, it is agreed by and between the parties hereto that the experienced work force which the industry normally relies upon year around must be given preference as follows: In order that the Association may prevent, insofar as possible, the entrance of large numbers of inexperienced transient or temporary workers into the industry to the detriment of the experienced and stable work force which is conducive to the efficiency of the industry, it is hereby agreed that employers under this Agreement will not put to work any new employee until after they have received written permission from the Association to do so. A new employee as herein used shall mean an employee who has not previously worked for an employer in the area covered by this Agreement or whom the employer has not employed during the past year. The Association will make its determinations based on work volume, number of men out of work, peculiarities of the job, time and circumstances, and by the records as shown by the fringe benefit files.
This provision is not intended to limit the employers in their right to hire under other provisions of this
-41-
Agreement except insofar.as they hereby grant to the Association, as. set out above, the right to safeguard the interest of the construction industry in this area by/allow-ing the Association to give employment preference to experienced employees who look to the industry the year around for employment and who have some degree of permanency in the industry. The Union agrees to give allowances or variances from-the new employee clauses in those instances where a contractor is endeavoring to comply with field personnel diversity issues and/or MBE/WBE/DBE requirements, whether dictated by the specifications on a given project or as a result of governmental ukase.
This provision is for the above purposes only and is not intended to permit any discrimination for the purpose of encouraging or discouraging membership in the Union, or to permit any discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, age, sex or national origin. The Union agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Employer and/or the Builders Association from all causes of action and/or liability arising under this Article, New Employees.
Trainees or apprentices who have completed a training program established by the parties hereto pursuant to this Agreement who have not been previously employed in the construction industry may not be employed without a referral from the appropriate local union in whose jurisdiction the proposed employment is located.
