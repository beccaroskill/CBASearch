2016 National Agreement
Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
NTEU
The National Treasury Employees Union
www.nteu.org

As the world’s largest financial institution, the Internal Revenue Service plays a pivotal role in funding the United States government and enforcing the nation’s tax laws. As the nation’s largest independent federal-employee union, the National Treasury Employees Union represents 150,000 employees in 31 departments and agencies, including tens of thousands of IRS workers.
NTEU and IRS have been negotiating national-term contracts for nearly 50 years and each new agreement has improved upon the preceding one. These innovative contracts protect the rights of IRS employees, improve working conditions, enable employees to serve taxpayers more effectively and further the mission of the IRS.
Every year, the IRS processes more than 240 million individual returns, collects more than $3 trillion, audits more than 1 million returns and maintains a website that gets more than 400 million views. Delivering these accomplishments does not happen automatically, and it does not happen by accident. It happens because of the talent, expertise and dedication of our workforce.
NTEU negotiated contracts enhance the well-being of that talented, dedicated workforce. Over the years, the negotiations have resulted in worker-friendly provisions that established alternative work schedules and telework, provided for transit subsidies and tuition reimbursement, and established bilingual, time-off and performance award programs.
Over the decades, as the scope of the IRS has grown, NTEU has grown as well. NTEU works in the courts, at the bargaining table, with Congress and with the media to strengthen the federal workforce. Through a variety of outreach efforts, NTEU provides top-notch representation to IRS employees. And in workplaces nationwide, highly-trained NTEU local leaders work alongside IRS employees and stand ready to address their everyday issues and concerns.
In the future, the IRS will continue to embody the mission to provide America’s taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities. The IRS is committed to enforcing tax laws with integrity and fairness to all.
This 2016 National Agreement is a landmark six-year deal that protects and expands upon employee rights and benefits, and it has been nearly 50 years in the making.
Some of the new benefits employees will find in this contract are:
•	An annual awards program that recognizes employees even in tight budgetary times.
•	Expansion of the Frequent Telework program with more occupations eligible.
•	New call monitoring protections for call-site employees.
•	New administrative leave policy for delayed openings or early office closures.
•	Reimbursement for costs related to accreditation, CPA/CLE courses and dues for professional organizations.

Section 3

Section 4*
A.	1. Any employee who is the subject of a conduct investigation, or is being interviewed as a third party witness, and who reasonably believes that an interview with the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) or any other representative of the Employer may result in disciplinary action has the right to representation, if requested, by a person designated by the Union.
2.	At the time the employee is contacted to schedule such an interview, the employee will be provided the following information:
(a)	the subject matter of the interview in as much specificity as possible, including whether the interview involves criminal or non-criminal matters, if known, except when doing so would undermine the investigation;
(b)	that he or she is the subject of the conduct interview or whether the employee is being interviewed as a third party witness;
(c)	that if the employee reasonably believes that the interview may result in disciplinary action, the employee is entitled to representation during the interview, if requested, by a person designated by the Union;

right to Union representation before beginning the interview. However, at the time the Special Agent or any other representative of the Employer should reasonably believe that the information offered by the employee indicates that the conduct of the employee could reasonably result in discipline to the employee, the employee must then be advised of the right to Union representation as provided in subsection 4A1 above.
5.	If an employee appears for a scheduled interview without representation and reasonably believes, because the subject of the interview has changed, that disciplinary action may result, the employee may request a brief delay to secure such representation.
6.	If an employee is represented in an interview and the subject of the interview changes to subjects over which the employee and the representative have not conferred, the employee or the representative may request a brief recess to confer on such issues.
B.	When an employee is interviewed by the Employer or an agent of the Employer (e.g., a representative of the Treasury Inspector General forTax Administration) and the employee is the subject of an investigation, the employee will be informed of the subject matter of the interview in as much specificity as possible, except when doing so would undermine the investigation, and whether it concerns criminal or administrative misconduct at the time the interview is scheduled. If in cases solely involving administrative misconduct the employee refuses to respond to questions, the employee shall be advised of the following: "Pursuant to 31 C.F.R. § 0.207, when directed to do so by a competent Treasury (e.g., the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration) or Internal Revenue Service authority, employees must testify or respond to questions in matters of official interest. Employees must give such testimony, or respond to questions, under oath when required or requested to do so. Your failure to respond as required may result in severe discipline including removal."
C.	When the subject of an investigation is being interviewed regarding possible criminal conduct and prosecution, and the interview is custodial in nature, at the beginning of the interview the employee shall be given a statement of Miranda rights contained on IRS Form 5228 (Exhibit 5-2). If the employee waives his or her rights, the employee shall so indicate by signing the above referenced form, and shall be given a copy of said executed form.
D.	When the subject of an investigation is being interviewed regarding possible criminal conduct and the interview is non-custodial, at the beginning of the interview the employee shall be given a statement of rights contained in Form 12036 (Exhibit 5-6). If the employee waives his or her rights, the employee shall sign the above referenced form and shall be given a
E.
G.
copy of said executed form.
In an interview involving possible criminal conduct where prosecution has been declined by appropriate authority, at the beginning of the interview the employee shall be given a statement of the Kalkines warning. The warning shall contain the following language:
"You are here to be asked questions pertaining to your employment with the Internal Revenue Service and the duties that you perform for IRS. You have the option to remain silent, although you may be subject to removal from your employment by the Service if you fail to answer material and relevant questions relating to the performance of your duties as an employee. You are further advised that the answers you may give to the questions propounded to you at this interview, or any information or evidence which is gained by reason of your answers, may not be used against you in a criminal proceeding except that you may be subject to a criminal prosecution for any false answer that you may give."
When employees are given the Kalkines warning, they shall be given IRS Form 8112 (Exhibit 5-3). Employees will acknowledge on IRS Form 8112 the receipt of the above warning. Employees shall be given a copy of the executed IRS Form 8112 for their own records.
When the person being interviewed is accompanied by a representative furnished by the Union, in both criminal and non-criminal cases, the role of the representative includes, but is not limited to, the following rights:
1.	to clarify the questions;
2.	to clarify the answers;
3.	to assist the employee in providing favorable or extenuating facts;
4.	to suggest other employees who have knowledge of relevant facts; and
5.	to advise the employee.
However, a representative may not transform the interview into an adversarial contest. Once it is determined that an investigation is not criminal in nature or once prosecution is declined, the Union and the employee may request a reasonable delay of the interview; such request shall not be unreasonably denied.
In interviews regarding possible criminal conduct when the employee interviewed is represented by counsel, and when a representative of the Treasury Inspector General forTax Administration or any other representative of the Employer is on reasonable notice of such representation, the employee's counsel shall have authority to represent the employee during the interview. Special Agents and other agents of the Employer on reasonable

ARTICLE 5
notice of such representation shall not initiate ex parte communication with the employee. It will continue to be the practice of agents of the Employer (e.g., the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration) and the Employer to contact the employee's supervisor to arrange an interview or other contact.
H.	Interviews conducted by agents of the Employer (e.g., the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration) may be manually and/or mechanically recorded by either party. The role of any person other than employees or their representatives in the recording of the interview shall be subject to applicable disclosure provisions. The recording may not unreasonably delay the interview.
I.	The Employer will issue a notice to all employees on a semi-annual basis that states, in part, the following:
1.	Employees have the right to be represented by the Union in an examination conducted by the Employer or a representative of the Employer in connection with an investigation if:
(a)	the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and
(b)	the employee requests such representation; and
2.	Employees may exercise this right if the above conditions are met whether the employee is the subject of the investigation (including a background investigation) or is a third party witness. The IRS fully supports the aforementioned right.
J.	When the Employer has determined to use a Statement Analysis Questionnaire in an investigation, employees are entitled to all the applicable rights of this Agreement that apply to the subjects of investigations, including Miranda and Kalkines, if appropriate.
K.	As prescribed by the Privacy Act (and only in non-criminal matters), the Employer shall collect information to the greatest extent practical directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits and privileges under federal programs.
L.	The Employer recognizes the importance of completing an investigation of an employee in as timely a manner as practicable. When an employee has been advised that he or she is/was the subject of an investigation, and a determination is made not to propose disciplinary action, the Employer will issue the appropriate letter (i.e., clearance or closed without action) to the employee within a timely fashion, normally within thirty (30) days of when the case involving the employee is closed.
M.	On a quarterly basis (i.e., April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31), the IRS will issue a report to the Union which, at a minimum, provides information on when each investigation of a bargaining unit employee was opened and closed during the preceding period, and
the date of issuance of the clearance letter or notice of proposed disciplinary or adverse action.
Section 5
A.	The questions whether, and on what date, to resign are voluntary matters of free choice for each employee. When an employee is faced with the prospect of Employer-initiated action such as termination or removal, the employee shall have the right not to resign or, if the employee chooses, to make a resignation effective at any time prior to the effective date of the Employer's action. When authorized by a settlement agreement, the employee's record shall only state that he/she resigned; no reference shall be made to such action occurring "for cause" when an employee voluntarily resigns.The employee will be advised that he or she may consult with a Union representative and have a representative present prior to making a decision. This advice will be acknowledged in writing by the Employer and the employee. A copy of this acknowledgment will be provided to the employee. Resignations shall not be secured by coercive or deceptive means.
B.	An employee may request to withdraw a resignation at any time prior to its effective date, provided the withdrawal is communicated to the Employer in writing. The Employer may deny the withdrawal request before its effective date only for legitimate reasons including, but not limited to, administrative disruption or the hiring of a replacement or a valid commitment to hire a replacement. Avoidance of an adverse action proceeding is not a legitimate reason to deny the withdrawal. The denial and the reasons for the denial will be communicated to the employee.
C.	If the Employer has committed to hire or has hired a replacement, the Employer will consider granting the withdrawal of the resignation application if a position in the employee's same grade and series, including any special skills (if applicable), and commuting area becomes vacant prior to the effective date.
D.	The Employer recognizes that, pursuant to law and regulation, certain resignations can be considered involuntary. The Employer will attempt to avoid causing such resignations.
Section 6
The Employer is entitled to require truthful answers from employees in response to questions in matters of official interest. An employee who fails to provide such answers is subject to disciplinary action, including removal. An employee may properly refuse to answer questions regarding matters in which the Employer has no official interest. The Employer has determined that no employee shall be required to play the role of a corrupt employee, or be required to operate undercover.
Section 7
A.	The Employer and the Union agree that mutual respect

Section 16
The Employer has determined that any employee, who is the subject of a Section 1203 complaint from a taxpayer or a taxpayer's representative, will not meet with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative, until the Employer has made a determination regarding the reassignment of the case.

All decisions in this respect are grievable under Article 41.
Section 17

Article 9 | Stewards and Official Time
Section 1
Designation
A.	The Employer and the Union recognize that the use of official time to conduct authorized representational activities is in their mutual interest.The parties share the responsibility to ensure that such time is used effectively and appropriately accounted for. In this regard, the use of time by a Union steward in the conduct of his or her representational duties shall be charged to either official time or bank time in accordance with Section 3, below, unless otherwise approved by the Employer. Whenever the term "steward" is used in this Article, it shall include Chapter Presidents, Chapter Vice-Presidents, Chief Stewards, Assistant Chief Stewards and any other bargaining unit employees authorized by the Union in advance to act on its behalf.
B.	The Union may designate stewards to act on its behalf in accordance with the following:

3.	The Union will provide the Official Time Coordinator (OTC) or designee with a roster of the names of stewards appointed pursuant to this subsection, and any changes to such rosters as they occur, along with any assigned area of responsibility if such designations are made by the Chapter. The roster will be posted on the Union portion of all official bulletin boards.
4.	If requested, NTEU at the national level will provide the Human Capital Officer of the Employer with the jurisdictional area of each Chapter by July 1 each year.
5.	Annually and if requested, the Human Capital Officer of the Employer or designee, will provide NTEU at the national level with electronic organizational charts for each Business Unit showing the chain of command down to the group or unit level and the name of the management official leading that component.
6.	One (1) steward per Chapter will be designated as a Chief Steward, unless there is more than one (1) shift (day, night or swing, as defined in Article 23) operating within the Chapter's jurisdiction, in which case the Union may designate one (1) Chief Steward per shift, up to a maximum of three (3) Chief Stewards per Chapter. The steward must work the shift for which he or she is designated Chief Steward.
7.	Each steward, Chief Steward, and Chapter President may cross Division lines to represent employees in any other Division or work group within that Chapter's jurisdiction; however, all stewards (except retired stewards) must be employed within the jurisdiction of their assigned Chapter.

B.	Stewards shall be granted official time for participation in the meetings with the Employer and any other activities described in subsection 2C, below, (including official time to travel to and from such meetings as
16
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 9
specified in this Agreement). Unless authorized by specific provisions of this Agreement, the Union will be entitled to only one (1) steward on official time for each of the meetings and/or activities listed below.
C. Official time shall be granted for only the following meetings and activities:
1.	formal discussions with the Employer concerning grievances or personnel policies, practices or other general conditions of employment consistent with 5 U.S.C. §7114(a)(2)(A);

approved. The Employer will change the tour of duty of the steward whose assigned tour of duty does not coincide with the hours of the training class. However, the tour of duty change will not be made solely to accommodate travel. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon a reasonable amount of time for a specific training event, the Union may use bank time and address the dispute through the institutional grievance process and the streamlined arbitration procedures of this Agreement. The parties also agree that the Union's use of official time for training under the Contract includes training to promote an understanding of the legislative process;
14.	to participate in other third party proceedings, to the extent authorized by governing law, regulation, and/or this Agreement;

11.	meeting with an employee to prepare a grievance meeting over a grievance regarding the employee's appraisal;
12.	coordinating labor-management meetings and other representational activities authorized by this Article, where otherwise warranted by a Chapter's level of activity, as provided by the parties' Local Official Time Utilization Plan (LOTUP);

14.	related communications whether written, electronic, or telephonic; and
15.	activities related to the Employee Engagement Survey.
F.	Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
the parties agree that any activities performed by stewards relating to the internal business of the Union shall be performed during the time the stewards are in non-duty status.
G.	Allocation of Bank Time
Bank time as described in subsection 2E, above, will be made available for each Chapter as outlined in this subsection. The parties agree that, beginning in FY 2016 and continuing in each successive FY covered by this Agreement, bank time will be allocated to each Chapter at the beginning of the FY as follows:
1.	Chapters with fewer than 100 bargaining unit employees and zero (0) full-time stewards will be allocated the per capita (PC) rate for bank time that it used in the prior year. Such Chapters will be entitled to an incentive for bank time reductions as described below in Sections 2H4,2H5, and 2H6.
2.	If the Chapter has a PC rate of 6.99 or below, it will be allocated the same PC rate of bank time that it used in the preceding FY.
3.	A Chapter that has a PC rate of between 7.0 and 7.99 will be allocated a PC rate of bank time of ten percent (10%) less than what it used in the preceding FY.
4.	A Chapter that has a PC rate of 8.0 and above will be allocated a PC rate of bank time of fifteen percent (15%) less bank time than what it used in the preceding FY.
5.	The parties' additional efforts to reduce the use of both official time and bank time by seeking to achieve efficiency gains and reducing the time spent in travel status to conduct representational activities are addressed in the parties'Article 9 Side
Letter. Incentives for Chapters to make significant reductions in the amount of bank time they use per year are set forth in subsection 2H below.
6.	Chapters may not carry over any unused bank time to the next year.
H.	The parties are committed to reducing the amount of bank time used for representational activities during each year of this Agreement and will do so in accordance with the following:
1.	If the Chapter's per capita rate for bank time, as of the last pay period of September 2015, was between 6.50 and 6.99, and the Chapter had more than one (1) full time steward, the Chapter must choose one of the following:
(a)	a cap on bank time in FY 2016 that amounts to a ten percent (10%) reduction from the Chapter's per capita rate at the end of the last pay period in September 2015, until the Chapter reaches a per capita rate of 6.0 or lower, and in FY 2017, no lower than five percent (5%) below the previous year's actual number of bank time hours used until the Chapter reaches a per capita rate of 6.0 or lower; or
(b)	a reduction of one (1) full time steward, with the local parties addressing the impact on the full time steward (e.g., check-in and checkout procedures, exceeding the 850 hour cap).
2.	No Chapter with a per capita rate as of the last pay period in September 2015 or at the end of FY 2016 of more than 7.0, and at least one (1) full time steward, may seek additional bank time using the procedure in subsection 2K below. If a Chapter, whose time is calculated under this subsection, exhausts its bank time allotment, the Chapter will be limited to no more than eight (8) hours of bank time per week for the remainder of the fiscal year. However, Chapters with a per capita rate below 7.0 may seek additional bank time through the procedure in subsection 2K, below, based on representational needs.
3.	If a Chapter is entitled to more than nine (9) full time stewards, the Chapter must reduce its previous year bank time per capita rate by five percent (5%) for both FY 2016 and FY 2017 or until the Chapter per capita rate is below 4.0.
4.	Chapters with a per capita bank time rate below 2.0 at the end of FY 2016 or FY 2017 will be entitled to send two (2) additional stewards to an NTEU national training session during the subsequent fiscal year consistent with subsection 6B of this Article.
5.	Chapters with a per capita bank time rate between 2.0 and 3.5 at the end of FY 2016 or FY 2017 will be entitled to send one (1) additional steward to an NTEU national training session consistent with subsection 6B of this Article.
18
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 9
6.	Other Chapters will be entitled to the incentive in subsection 2H5, above, as follows:
(a)	If the Chapter has achieved a seven (7%) percent reduction to bank time by the end of any FY (FY 2016,2017 or 2018) compared to the preceding FY, and the Chapter's PC rate by the end of that year is between 3.51 and 5.99, the Chapter will be entitled to send one (1) additional steward to an NTEU national training session consistent with subsection 6B of this Article.
(b)	If the Chapter has achieved a twelve (12%) percent reduction to bank time by the end of K. any FY (FY 2016,2017 or 2018) compared to the preceding FY, and the Chapter's PC rate by the end of that year is 6.0 or above, the Chapter will be entitled to send one (1) additional steward to an NTEU national training session consistent with subsection 6B of this Article.
I.	Full Time Stewards
The Employer recognizes that Chapters are likely to use their allotments of bank time, and other time in such a way that may result in a limited number of representatives who engage in labor-management activities permitted under this Agreement on a full time basis.
1.	The number of full time stewards will be determined in the LOTUP.
2.	Chapters that represent fewer than 125 bargaining unit employees may not appoint full time stewards unless the employees represented by the Chapter are located in more than four (4) PODs or the parties mutually agree otherwise in the LOTUP, and the level of activity justifies a full time steward. In the absence of mutual agreement, the parties may not invoke the arbitration procedures of subsection 2K2 below.
3.	Stewards designated as full time in the LOTUP will be permitted to work the time needed to qualify for a rating of record consistent with Article 12, subsection 4J2.
J.	Other than Full Time Stewards
1.	All other stewards will be limited to a total of 850 hours of bank and/or official time during the LOTUP annual period. The LOTUP annual period shall be each fiscal year.	I_
2.	Chapter Presidents and Chief Stewards not designated as full time in the LOTUP, may exceed the 850 hour cap during the fiscal year provided sufficient time is accumulated to meet the sixty (60) day minimum appraisal period needed to receive an annual rating of record. An exception may also be made for other stewards if sufficient justification is provided in the LOTUP and the Chapter has appointed no full time stewards.
3.	Full time Chapter Presidents and Vice Presidents who no longer serve in the capacity of officer of the Chapter during the LOTUP period may serve as a steward of the Chapter for the remainder of the LOTUP period. The 850 hour cap will be prorated once the former officer commences work as an "Other than Full Time" Steward.
4.	Chapter Presidents and Chief Stewards who transition from FT steward to "other than full time steward"will continue to not be required to check in and check out.
1.	When a Chapter uses seventy percent (70%) of its allotted bank time, National NTEU can enter into negotiations with the Employer for more bank time. Such negotiations shall occur between the national parties or their designees. If unresolved, the matter will be referred to the National Official Time Oversight Committee (NOTOC) Chairpersons to determine whether additional bank time should be provided. If no agreement is reached at the NOTOC within fifteen (15) days after notice is served on the Employer by the Union of the Union's desire to negotiate, the Union can invoke arbitration by serving a second letter on the Employer. Either or both parties will then contact an appropriate umpire who will be retained to resolve these disputes. The umpire will assist the parties to reach agreement through appropriate means including the issuance of an award. Where the umpire cannot help the parties reach a voluntary agreement, the parties will be entitled to a decision as to what is a reasonable solution and the umpire will decide the question of "what is reasonable" under the circumstances presented. The award, if issued in writing, will be considered a final and binding arbitration decision under 5 U.S.C. § 7122.
2.	Disputes regarding LOTUPs, including whether Chapter representatives should be authorized to pursue labor-management duties on a full time basis, shall also be subject to the expedited resolution process as described in this subsection. However, final and binding arbitration decisions as defined above will only be binding during the LOTUP annual period, or until the LOTUP is renegotiated subject to the LOTUP reopener provision in subsection 7B, whichever is later.
Quarterly, the local parties (that is, a management official designated by the Employer and the applicable Chapter President(s) or designee(s)) shall meet to discuss the use of bank and official time, the reporting of such time, and any other related issues. To that extent, and in conjunction with the provision set forth in Subsection 7D, below, the parties will rely on the monthly reports generated by the OTC regarding the use of official and bank time and travel.These meetings
19
ARTICLE 9
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
and reports will be used to identify efficiencies gained and to discuss additional measures and means to further reduce travel and the use of official and bank time. In particular, the parties at the local level will address:	p
1.	Strategies utilized by the parties to reduce official time and costs, such as:
a.	The number of formal meetings that were combined, as well as those held electronically in lieu of face to face meetings; and
b.	The number of meetings where the parties saved travel expenses by holding them electronically, consistent with Section 8 below; and
2.	Usage of official and bank time in the general categories.
Quarterly, the local parties will jointly report to the NOTOC all efficiencies gained, the identification of potential future efficiencies along with a related implementation plan, and the measures identified to indicate future progress.
M.	The Employer may place a steward on special reporting requirements over and above those set forth in this Article, if, after discussing the matter with the appropriate NTEU Chapter (or where applicable, the Union's National Office), the Employer's concerns are not resolved. The Union retains the right to challenge such restriction under the streamlined grievance and arbitration procedures of this Agreement.
N.	For any situation where the Employer refuses to release a steward and/or an employee to use bank or official time or administrative time respectively under this Article, the Employer will provide the steward and/or the employee with a written explanation for the denial of time (i.e., the reason(s) and/or rationale for the denial, including any data, etc., as appropriate). On a semi annual basis, the Employer will provide NTEU with a report on official/bank time denials for stewards by Division and location.
0.	Time Usage Reports
1.	The Employer will provide each Chapter with a monthly accounting, and the NTEU National Office with an annual accounting, of the amount of time used by each NTEU Chapter under this Article. If the Chapter does not submit any disagreement with the monthly report (in writing) within ten (10) workdays following receipt, the accounting shall be considered accurate through that period Q-of time. If the Employer fails to provide the monthly reports in a timely manner, no request by a Chapter for bank time will be denied on grounds R. that it has insufficient bank time.
2. On an annual basis, the Employer will provide the Union with an accounting of bank time and official time usage by Chapter, including time used to process complaints of discrimination
1.	Consistent with the Statute, stewards and employees requesting official time, bank time and administrative time, respectively under this Article will request time from their immediate supervisor and if official, bank or administrative time is otherwise permitted for this activity by this Agreement, will be released provided work requirements or work schedules do not prohibit release. In this regard, the steward or affected employee will inform their supervisor(s) as to where they will be when using the time, the approximate amount of time that they will need, and a general description of the activity for which the time will be used, (e.g., time permitted under subsection or 2C or subsection 2E6). If the steward request is for official time and includes meeting with another supervisor, the steward will provide the name of the other supervisor. If the name of the other supervisor is not known, the steward will provide the location of the activity. If the steward plans to leave IRS facilities to perform the representational activity, the supervisor must approve the location requested.
2.	If there is a disagreement over the amount of time requested, the activity for which the time is requested and/or when the steward/employee is to be released, the supervisor may refer the matter to a higher level management official (e.g., the designated management OTC) for review and determination. That management official should make a reasonable attempt to contact the appropriate Chapter President in an attempt to resolve the matter.
3.	Denial of release and/or disagreement over the amount of time may be challenged under the negotiated streamlined grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in Articles 41 and 43 of this Agreement. The first step grievance meeting will include the affected steward/employee, as appropriate, the official(s) who did not grant the request for time, and a steward appointed by the Chapter.
4.	To the extent such disputes are decided in favor of the Union by an arbitrator, the provisions of subsection 4A1 of Article 43 will apply.
Stewards who enter work areas pursuant to this Section will check in with the supervisors in those work areas before contacting the employee to be visited.
When stewards or employees have completed the use of approved time, they must check back in with their supervisors and will inform the supervisors of the amount of time they used and record the amount in accordance with Section 3, below.
20
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 9
S.	As noted above, normally, the steward and/or employee will be released if workload conditions permit; however, where release is denied, any applicable time frames (for example, grievance filing deadlines) will be tolled until workload conditions permit such release.
Section 3
Time Reporting
A.	The Service uses the Single Entry Time Reporting (SETR) System for recording time spent conducting Union representational activities. Since SETR utilizes the Form 3081, NTEU stewards will be required to use the form to report time. For Union stewards who report their IRS time on the Employer's electronic Form 3081, the electronic Form 3081 is to be used as the exclusive mechanism for the reporting of time used by Union stewards under this Agreement, regardless of whether such time is authorized as bank or official time. The reporting of such time will be consistent with the steward's current time reporting cycle (for example, weekly basis).
B.	Any employee, regardless of NTEU title and/or variation on the title, who is designated to act for the Union as a NTEU steward, is required to report bank and official time used. The term "NTEU steward" includes, bargaining unit employees who are designated to serve on contractually-established joint committees and bargaining unit employees who are designated to participate in activities outlined in Exhibit 9-1.
C.	The following procedures will be used for reporting time:
1.	Since employees are required to report their time prior to the end of the reporting cycle, NTEU stewards will make a good faith effort to accurately report time spent on representational activities to the proper NTEU OFP code for the activity based on the codes listed in Exhibit 9-1 of this Agreement and on what activities are known at the time of the report. If corrections are necessary, they will be made in accordance with established local procedures for correcting data entered into the SETR system. However, under no circumstances will time chargeable to the official time and bank time codes be charged to any other OFP code for the activity.
2.	The process of reporting time and making corrections is an integral part of the SETR time reporting procedures. Such activity normally will not be viewed as falsification of the Form 3081.
3.	Timekeepers will not change the OFP code to which bank and official time has been charged. If the time charged to those codes on the Form 3081 cannot be entered in SETR, the timekeeper will contact the employee's supervisor or the Chapter's OTC for resolution.
4.	SETR requires an accounting of all the time in an employee's workweek. Therefore, all NTEU stewards must account for all the time in their workweek on the Form 3081. That is, full time employees, other than those on a 5/4/9 schedule, must account for forty (40) hours, and part-time employees must account for all the hours in their part-time schedules. Employees on a 5/4/9 schedule will account for 35/45, 36/44, 45/35 or 44/36 hours per week according to their individual 5/4/9 schedule.
5.	NTEU representatives, including Chapter Presidents, who perform bank time activities, must charge that time to the appropriate bank time OFP codes.
6.	Form 3081 will be submitted to the employee's timekeeper or immediate supervisor, consistent with the practice in the local office. At the same time, or prior to submitting the Form 3081 to the timekeeper or supervisor, as appropriate, the NTEU stewards may submit the information to the Chapter President for review. The Employer, prior to signing the Form 3081, will ensure that time charged to all OFPs is accurate. If management and/or the reviewing Chapter discover discrepancies, management and the NTEU stewards, at the appropriate level, will discuss the issue and attempt to resolve it. If it is not resolved before management must sign the time sheet for final entry into SETR, the time will be reported in accordance with management's records. If management and NTEU come to agreement on how to report the time later, a corrected Form 3081 can be entered into the system. If there is no agreement on how to report the time, NTEU may file a grievance.
Section 4
Work Conflicts
A.	The Employer has determined that it will reassign work previously assigned to a steward when it determines that the work cannot be timely performed due to the steward's representational duties.
B.	The steward may request that the Employer consider such reassignment of work by providing a list of the work that the steward believes should be reassigned.
C.	When a steward disagrees with the Employer's determination, the steward and Employer will attempt to resolve the dispute through a meeting. Only if the parties meet and still fail to resolve the dispute may the Union request the Employer's reasons in writing. At that point, the Employer will put the reasons for refusing to reassign the work in writing.
21
ARTICLE 9
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
Section 5
A.	Credit Hours
Union stewards, to the extent otherwise permitted by law and governing regulation and consistent with Article 23, subsection 5A1 of this Agreement, will be allowed to earn credit hours for performing any official time activities listed in subsection 2C1 through 2C12 of this Article, including travel to and from such activities to the extent otherwise permitted by law and governing regulation.
B.	Overtime and Compensatory Time
Employees serving as stewards may not earn compensatory time or overtime for representational activities. However, when stewards are already in an approved overtime or compensatory time status, due to the fact they are performing the work of the IRS, they may earn compensatory time or overtime to perform the representational duties on official time if approved by the Employer.
C.	Telework
1.	Union stewards, who otherwise meet the criteria set forth in Article 50 of this Agreement, and are in positions that are eligible for Frequent or Recurring Telework, may perform bank and official time activities while on approved Telework. The performance of such activities on Telework may be addressed in the LOTUP.
2.	Chapter Presidents and Chief Stewards whose positions are not listed as eligible for Frequent Telework, but who otherwise meet the criteria of Article 50, subsections 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 2H of this Agreement, may perform bank and official time activities on Recurring or Ad Hoc Telework for up to twenty-four (24) hours a month, subject to mutual Agreement in the LOTUP.
Section 6
NTEU National Office Training
A.	Official time will be authorized for the attendance of Union stewards at any training event conducted by the Union's National Office, provided that the content thereof is approved in accordance with this Article. Only training locations in accordance with the August 22, 2001, memorandum, Guidelines for Holding Off-Site Meetings, will be eligible for Employer reimbursement under this subsection.
B.	The Employer will pay the travel and per diem of one (1) steward per Chapter per calendar year to attend NTEU National Office training. The Union will submit the names of attendees for whom the Employer is paying, generally one (1) week in advance of the training event to the appropriate OTC. Only the representatives for whom the Employer is paying travel and per diem expenses will be required to attend the training on bank time.
C.	To reduce the cost of travel, all stewards (outside of a center campus) whose travel is paid by IRS will attend the training session closest to his or her regular work location (i.e., POD). Alternatively, those stewards will attend a training session at an alternate location if the overall cost of attending at the alternate location would cost less than attending at the location closest to the steward's regular work location.
Section 7
Local Official Time Utilization Plans
A.	Designated local representatives of the national parties (for example, the Chapter President and the designated OTC) will establish a LOTUP or may elect to open for discussion an existing LOTUP. Such plans will be maintained for each Chapter and shall address official/ bank time issues involving training, travel, release from duty and appeals of any denials to use time, etc.
B.	Each plan will cover a one (1) fiscal year period of time designated the LOTUP annual period. LOTUP plans that are currently under a calendar year will become a FY plan as of October 1, 2016.

Definitions
A. Annual Rating/Annual Rating of Record - a written record of the appraisal of each critical job element and the overall performance rating. Annual ratings are prescheduled ratings of record and are generally issued once a year. Ratings of record are the official documentation for personnel actions such as within-grade increases, career ladder promotions, successful completion of probationary period, reductions in force, and adverse performance based actions, absent acceptable substitutes in accordance with

Government-wide regulations. These are based J. upon summary level ratings, i.e., an overall rating of performance.
Appraisal - the act or process of reviewing and evaluating the performance of an employee against K. the described performance standard(s).
Critical Job Element (CJE) - a component of an employee's job that is of sufficient importance that performance below the minimum standard established by the Employer would result in unacceptable performance in the employee's position. Departure Appraisal - a performance appraisal prepared when either the supervisor or employee moves from a permanent or temporary assignment to another permanent or temporary assignment. The employee's performance must have been observed under a signed performance plan for at least sixty (60) days to be ratable.
Evaluative Recordation - a supervisor's record of indications of performance which forms the foundation for employee development, performance improvement, and/or a summary rating of record, which may have an impact on personnel actions affecting the employee, including the written results of workload or progress reviews. In the case of a monitored contact, the evaluative recordation is the written record of the contact, not the audio or visual recording. Evaluative recordations also include progress reviews as defined in subsection 2K below. However, in no case will the Employer use measures of program effectiveness to evaluate or appraise an individual employee.
Merit Promotion Appraisal (MPA) - an appraisal prepared for an employee applying for a position where the employee does not have any rating of record or MPA as of the closing date of the vacancy N. announcement (e.g., newly hired employee who has met the minimum appraisal period requirements).
This merit promotion appraisal is to be used for all merit promotion announcements until the employee receives a rating of record.	O.
Performance Appraisal - the Employer's written assessment of an employee's work performance for purposes of all personnel actions, including, for example, ratings of record (including annual appraisals), summary departure ratings, departure appraisals, promotion appraisals, and revalidated appraisals.
Performance Aspect - a portion of the performance standard.	P-
Performance Plan - the document that communicates to the employee what performance is expected in the job and what the employee will be rated against for performance appraisal purposes for the employee's appraisal period.The performance plan is the assigned CJEs, performance aspects and the Retention Standard for the Fair and Equitable Treatment of Taxpayers.
Performance Standards - the expressed measure of the level of achievement established by the Employer for the duties and responsibilities of a position or group of positions.
Progress Review - a review of an employee's work based on the supervisor's observation of measurable behaviors related to the critical job elements and performance standards of a position. All employees will receive at least one (1) progress review, if not more, as part of an annual evaluation process, usually about six (6) months before the end of the rating cycle. However, in no case will the Employer use measures of program effectiveness to evaluate or appraise an individual employee.
Quantity Measures - Quantity measures consist of outcome-neutral production and resource data that does not contain information regarding the tax enforcement result reached in any case that involves particular taxpayers. Examples of quantity measures include, but are not limited to (1) cases started; (2) cases closed; (3) work items completed; (4) customer education, assistance, and outreach efforts completed; (5) time per case; (6) direct examination time/out of office time; (7) cycle time; (8) number or percentage of overage cases; (9) inventory information; (10) toll-free level of access; and (11) talk time.
Records of Tax Enforcement Results - records of tax enforcement results are data, statistics, compilations of information or other numerical or quantitative recordations of the tax enforcement results reached in one or more cases, but do not include tax enforcement results of individual cases when used to determine whether an employee exercised appropriate judgment in pursuing enforcement of the tax laws based upon a review of the employee's work on that individual case. Retention Standard - indicates the level of performance necessary to be retained in a position. The Employer has determined that retention standards are equivalent to CJEs, except retention standards are written only at the "met" level.
Revalidated Appraisal - an appraisal for a journey level or above employee in at least the second year of his or her position who receives a rating of record for the current appraisal period that is identical to the rating of record received for the previous period. Identical, in this regard, means the ratings for all aspects and CJEs remain the same as the previous rating. Appraisals may be revalidated indefinitely.
Tax Enforcement Results - tax enforcement results are the outcome produced by an IRS employee's exercise of judgment in recommending or determining whether or how the IRS should pursue enforcement of the tax laws. Examples of tax enforcement results include a lien filed, a levy served, a seizure executed, the amount assessed, the amount collected and a fraud referral.Tax enforcement results do not include quantity measures

and data derived from a quality review or from a review 3. of an employee's or a work unit's work on a case, such as the number or percentage of cases in which correct examination adjustments were proposed or appropriate lien determinations were made.	4
Section 3
Critical Job Elements and Performance Standards
A.	The Employer has determined the following:
1.	pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 9508 and 4302, performance standards must, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria related to the positions in question;
2.	to the maximum extent feasible, performance standards must be specific, observable and measurable;
3.	the performance standard, through its description of the goal in terms of quality, efficiency or timeliness, must provide a clear means of assessing whether objectives have been met; and
4.	it will not use critical job elements and standards that impose absolute or unreasonable standards	5.
unless authorized by law.
B.	Forced Distribution
The Employer has determined that it will not prescribe a distribution of levels of ratings for employees covered by this Agreement.
C.	New Rating Levels	6‘
The Employer has determined to write critical job elements and performance standards at the fully successful level and at a level above and at a level below the fully successful level. The Union will be afforded the opportunity to bargain impact and implementation before new critical job elements and standards go into effect.
Section 4
Performance Appraisals
A. 1. Employees will receive performance appraisals 7 annually using Form 6850-BU. Annual ratings will be issued on a monthly basis between October and June. The ending date for an employee's annual rating period shall be based on a month determined by the last digit of the employee's Social Security Number (SSN) (Exhibit 12-1).
2. For employees assigned to measured rating plans, annual ratings will be issued on a quarterly basis by January 31, April 30, and October 31 based on Social Security Number (e.g., appraisals through December 31 are due January 31). The ending date for an employee's annual rating period shall	g
be based on the last digit of the employee's SSN (Exhibit 12-2).
If an employee changes from one (1) permanent position to another during the last sixty (60) days of the appraisal year, the departure appraisal becomes the rating of record for the appraisal period.
The Employer has determined the following:
(a)	if the supervisor permanently departs his or her position, a departure appraisal must be prepared for all employees reporting to that supervisor that have met the minimum appraisal period for their position. The new supervisor will then use the departure appraisal as appropriate in preparing a rating of record when the employee's appraisal period ends;
(b)	if the supervisor permanently departs his or her position during the last sixty (60) days of the employee's rating period, the departure appraisal becomes the rating of record; and
(c)	if the supervisor temporarily departs for a position during the last sixty (60) days of the employee's appraisal period, that supervisor will be responsible for preparing the rating of record.
A departure appraisal that does not become a rating of record constitutes a recordation and cannot be grieved until used in an annual rating unless the departure appraisal is used to disadvantage the employee (e.g., deny an overtime opportunity or suspend Telework or AWS).
The Employer has determined that when a rating of record cannot be prepared at the time specified in the plan, the appraisal period shall be extended for the amount of time necessary to meet a reasonable minimum appraisal period at which time a rating of record shall be prepared. The employee's existing rating will be used as the next annual rating until the new appraisal is prepared. The annual rating period date will remain as established regardless of within-grade increases, promotions, and any other actions whether temporary or permanent.
The Employer has determined that the employee will use his or her annual rating of record prepared in accordance with this Article for merit promotion as described in Article 13. If the employee does not have an annual rating of record for the current appraisal period, the employee will use his or her most recently completed annual rating of record prepared within the last four (4) years for merit promotion purposes. The procedures for using annual ratings of records in other personnel actions may be found in other Articles of this Agreement (e.g., RIF, Article 19, subsection 6B).
In the event that the employee has no previous annual rating of record, the supervisor or designee will prepare a merit promotion appraisal on Form
35
ARTICLE 12
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
6850-BU as long as the employee has served at least sixty (60) days on a signed performance plan. This merit promotion appraisal is to be used for merit promotion purposes until the employee receives a rating of record.
9.	For employees on career ladder positions beginning at the GS-5 level or higher, who are new to Federal employment and their annual appraisal is due prior to the completion of six (6) months of service with the IRS and the supervisor is prepared to issue a rating of record of minimally successful, the	6.
Employer has determined that the supervisor will extend the rating period to permit the employee to complete six (6) months of service. Thereafter, the employee will be evaluated in accordance with Exhibits 12-1 and 12-2 of this Article.
B.	1. The Employer has determined that annual ratings/ annual ratings of record and merit promotion appraisals will be prepared and recommended by employees' immediate supervisors of record (those who are immediately responsible for the employees' work and who assign, review and evaluate the employees' work). The Employer has determined that bargaining unit employees (e.g., Leads), may report to a supervisor what they have observed involving the performance of workload assigned to the employees of their work group. However, since bargaining unit employees do not have access to performance data (e.g., EPFs), such employees will not prepare or recommend any part of an appraisal unless the conditions in subsection 4B4 are met regarding acting supervisors.
2.	Ratings of record will be prepared within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the appraisal is due. Upon request, the Employer will provide the local affected Chapter a list showing the names and locations of the employees whose annual ratings are overdue by more than sixty (60) days.	7
3.	The Employer has determined that in a competitive action, if the immediate supervisor of record preparing the appraisal to be used in ranking the	8
applicants is to be considered for a vacant position for which the employee is also being considered, the appraisal will be made by the next higher level supervisor.
4.	The Employer has determined that in the event that the immediate supervisor is an acting supervisor, that is, a bargaining unit employee who has been designated to act as a supervisor, but who has not been acting in a managerial capacity for sixty (60) days or more, the appraisal will be made by the next higher level supervisor.
5.	Annual ratings/annual ratings of record when used will reflect the employee's performance for the full annual appraisal period unless the
information necessary to make such an appraisal is not available. The employee's current annual appraisal will not reflect performance between the end of the month in which the employee's current appraisal cycle ended to when the appraisal was given to the employee. Ratings for periods of time which are less than the full annual appraisal period will be so noted. However, annual ratings/annual ratings of record must be postponed or delayed as required in 5 C.F.R. § 430 and 531.
During the final thirty (30) days of an employee's annual appraisal period (or as otherwise agreed upon), the employee may prepare a written self-assessment on a form to be provided by the Employer to submit for their supervisor's consideration. Subject to the right to assign work, any employee who chooses to prepare such assessment shall be granted a reasonable amount of administrative time, not to exceed four (4) hours to do so, and shall submit that self assessment to his or her immediate supervisor by no later than the last workday of his or her annual appraisal cycle.The self-assessment will be limited to four (4) pages in length. Employees who wish to do self-assessments will be given appropriate guidance on how to write self-assessments.
(a)	The Employer will maintain a Web-based tutorial (as well as a comparable paper-based version for employees who do not have access to the Employer's Intranet) to help employees prepare self-assessment of their performance.
(b)	Employees will be afforded a one-time opportunity to complete the tutorial on administrative time, at an appropriate time to be determined by their immediate supervisor. However, employees may take the tutorial any number of times on their own time.
If the supervisor rejects an employee's selfassessment, the supervisor or designee will meet with the employee and explain his or her reason.
(a)	In addition to the appraisals that are due based on the above requirements, an employee may request that another appraisal for merit promotion purposes be prepared if it has been more than 180 days since his or her last annual appraisal, he or she is applying for a position, and he or she has received a midyear progress review that indicates that the employee is performing at an overall rating level one level higher (e.g., Exceeds Fully Successful versus Fully Successful).
(b)	If the above conditions are met, an appraisal for merit promotion purposes will be prepared if the current appraisal is to be used in a competitive action and is not valid

ARTICLE 12
and indicative of performance. This appraisal does not become the rating of record for the employee and will be used for merit promotion until the next rating of record is issued.
C.	Performance appraisals will be made in a fair and objective manner. They will measure actual work performance in relation to the performance requirements of the positions to which employees are assigned and will be based on a reasonable and representative sample of the employee's work.
1.	In selecting cases for review, the Employer will select a reasonable and representative sample of the employee's work. Where work is selected as part of a targeted review, the supervisor must select other non-targeted work in order to achieve an appropriately balanced and representative sample.The Employer will supplement the sample with a reasonable amount of work if submitted by the employee.
2.	Where an annual appraisal is based on reviews of a limited number of cases and some of the cases were targeted for selection, the Employer will be obligated to justify that the mix of cases reviewed presents a reasonable and representative view of the work of the employee.
D.	An employee will be advised each time an appraisal is used in a personnel action, and the employee will be provided a copy upon request.
E.	Performance appraisals will provide for the uniform treatment of all employees in a Division with identical elements and standards and with similar working conditions, with particular attention to employees performing the same job in the same work unit. Emphasis on the work unit does not lessen the Employer's obligation to provide uniformity at the Divisional level.
F.	Supervisors or designees will discuss employees' annual or revalidated appraisals at the time such appraisals are issued to employees.
G.	Employees may make written comments concerning any disagreement with an annual or revalidated appraisal within fifteen (15) workdays of issuance. In the case of any appraisal which will be used in a pending competitive action, written comments concerning disagreements must be submitted within three (3) workdays of issuance. Such comments will be attached to and become part of the appraisal.
H.	The Employer has determined that within the time frame provided in subsection 4G, above, employees will be provided with a reasonable amount of administrative time, not to exceed four (4) hours, to prepare written comments concerning any performance appraisal that becomes the employee's annual rating of record. Such comments will be attached to and become part of the appraisal and maintained as part of the employee's performance folder (EPF). Failure to rebut does not
indicate employee agreement with the appraisal. Similarly, failure by the supervisor to comment on the employee's rebuttal does not indicate agreement with the employee's comments. It is not necessary or appropriate for a supervisor to prepare additional remarks regarding the employee's comments in that the appraisal constitutes the Employer's stated position.
I.	An employee's initials on a performance appraisal, where the signature is provided for, indicates only that the performance appraisal has been received, not an employee's agreement with the performance appraisal.
J.	1. The Employer has determined that only time spent performing work related to an employee's critical job elements and standards will be considered in performance appraisals. Authorized time spent performing collateral duties and Union representational functions will not be considered as a negative factor when evaluating any critical job elements. For example, if a Union representative has spent thirty percent (30%) of a work period on official time, annual leave, LWOP or performing Union duties, this fact will be considered in the application of expected performance standards. Additionally, if an employee is performing collateral duties or Union representational functions that result in frequent interruptions of normal work, such factors will be taken into account when evaluating the employee.
2.	The Employer has determined that a Union representative working full-time on Union duties, will receive an annual, revalidated or merit promotion appraisal, provided the Union representative has worked enough time to be rated, i.e., performed at least 120 hours of ratable work in an evaluation year. If the minimum period cannot be met, the Union representative will receive a "Not Ratable" (NR) rating. While the parties anticipate that some Union representatives may perform representational duties on a full time basis, they also want to maximize the opportunity for those representatives to perform IRS work. Consequently, each year, these representatives and their supervisors will meet to attempt to identify ways to assign them at least 120 hours of work, which can be performed in a manner consistent with their representational duties. For example, the appraisal could be based upon working an amount of time equal to that which would meet the center learning curve for the position held by the Union representative or the performance of tasks, projects, cases, or other work products/activities which are included in the employee's position description, are ratable under one (1) or more critical job elements and are completed on direct time as defined by the Employer. If the steward performs the duties of his or her position on overtime during the rating
37
ARTICLE 12
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
period, that time will count toward the 120 hour requirement if the Employer deems the overtime work to be ratable. If the supervisor and steward cannot agree upon what constitutes 120 hours of ratable time, the steward will need to meet the sixty (60) day minimum appraisal period to receive a rating of record.
K.	In the application of standards to individual employees, the Employer will take into account mitigating factors such as availability of resources, lack of training, mix of work, collateral duties or frequent authorized interruptions of normal work duties.
L.	The process of monitoring performance is ongoing. Therefore, the Employer will counsel employees in relation to their overall performance rating on an as needed basis. Such counseling will normally take place when a supervisor notices a decrease in performance, defined as a drop in the average CJE score and include advice or recommendations on better communicating job requirements and providing additional coaching, monitoring, mentoring, and other developmental activities, as appropriate, to help improve employee performance until the employee shows improvement. Special emphasis should be given to those cases when an employee's performance indicates a decrease in the overall rating (e.g. exceeds fully successful to fully successful). Written feedback will not be the sole means to deliver counseling. Feedback will also be provided by oral communication between the employee and the supervisor.
M.	In disciplinary actions, performance appraisals, if used to support the actions, may be challenged only in the grievance procedure provided for by this Agreement. In adverse actions or actions taken for unacceptable performance, performance appraisals, if used to support the actions, may be challenged in the grievance procedure or statutory appeals procedure.
N.	All scored performance appraisals must contain a written narrative justification for each score given beyond simply stating that the standards have been met. Normally, this narrative need not exceed two (2) single-spaced typed pages. If no justification is available due to a lack of opportunity to perform in that element or to be observed performing in that element, a "Not Applicable" (NA) will be awarded in lieu of any score. However, if the supervisor decides to award a "4"or "5" in an element and that same score or a lower score was awarded the prior year, no narrative will be required. In these instances the employee may prepare a narrative summary for that element in the same manner as provided in subsection 4B6 above.
1.	If the Employer determines that a journey level or above employee in at least the second year of his or her position would receive a Rating of Record for the current appraisal period identical to the Rating of Record received for the previous period, he/she may revalidate that the most recent Rating of Record is valid for performance in the current appraisal period. At least five (5) workdays prior to this revalidation, the employee will be advised by the Employer of the decision. While there is no narrative summary required for revalidation, the supervisor or designee will still conduct a performance discussion with the employee.
In these instances, the employee may prepare a narrative summary or self-assessment as provided in subsection 4B6, above, and it will be attached to the revalidated evaluation for all purposes. If the supervisor objects to its accuracy, the supervisor may prepare his or her own full evaluation with narrative. The lack of a full evaluation in response does not indicate the supervisor agrees with the employee's self-assessment.
2.	The Employer has determined that an employee's annual appraisal can be revalidated as many times as the supervisor determines that the appraisal is still accurate and reflects the employee's current performance.
3.	Explanations or other notes will not be added to the revalidated appraisal with the exception of 4N4 below. If the supervisor wishes to change the narrative of the existing appraisal, a new appraisal must be prepared.
4.	However, if the revalidated appraisal is to be used for merit promotion, the supervisor or designee must prepare a narrative for each critical job element that does not have a narrative describing the performance in the appraisal period covered by the rating.
The fact that an employee assumes new tasks, receives new critical job elements, changes positions, is a trainee, and/or gets promoted to a new position does not create a presumption that his or her performance is only "fully successful." Rather, an employee's performance rating will be based strictly on his or her performance against those critical job elements that apply during the appropriate performance rating cycle. The counseling requirement in subsection 4L, above, does not apply when the employee is reassigned, promoted or voluntarily changes to a lower grade to a different series.

Section 5
Rating Scale
A.	The Employer has determined that annual appraisals will be made on Form 6850-BU and will consist of ratings of "5,""4,""3,""2,"" 1" or NA, on each critical job element. The ratings and definitions, which were established and determined by the Employer, are defined as follows:
1.	Outstanding: "5" exceeds all performance aspects or standards as appropriate of the critical job element;
2.	Exceeds Fully Successful: "4" exceeds more than half (1/2) of the performance aspects or standards as appropriate of the critical job element and meets the other performance aspects or standards as appropriate;
3.	Fully Successful: "3" meets all of the performance aspects or standards as appropriate;
4.	Minimally Successful:''2"fails one (1) performance aspect or standards as appropriate;
5.	Unacceptable:"! "fails two (2) or more performance aspects or standards as appropriate; and
6.	NA (Not Applicable): performance of the duties/ responsibilities reflected by the critical job elements and standards has not been observed.
B.	Each performance appraisal will include an overall rating, established and determined by the Employer, as follows:
1.	Outstanding: employee is rated Outstanding in more than half (1/2) of the critical job elements and Exceeds Fully Successful in the other critical job elements;
2.	Exceeds Fully Successful: employee is rated Exceeds Fully Successful or above in more than half (1/2) of the critical job elements and Fully Successful in the other critical job elements;
3.	Fully Successful: employee is rated Fully Successful or above in all of the critical job elements;
4.	Minimally Successful: employee is rated Minimally Successful in one (1) or more critical job elements but not Unacceptable in any critical job elements; and
5.	Unacceptable: employee is rated Unacceptable in one (1) or more critical job elements.
6.	Not Ratable (NR): Employee's performance has not been observed for a minimum of sixty (60) days during the appraisal period or the employee has not received a performance plan fora minimum of sixty (60) days. The NR designation only indicates that the employee was not ratable for the current appraisal period and it is not a rating of record.
C.	Retention standard(s) will be rated by the Employer as follows:
1.	Met;
2.	Not Met; or
3.	Not Applicable (performance of the duties/ responsibilities reflected by the retention standard were not observed).
D.	In accordance with law, rule and regulation, the Employer will provide the following reports to the Union at the national level by October 1 of each year:
1.	a report comparing the average CJE scores for the twenty (20) largest occupations during the last appraisal year to the average CJE scores for the previous appraisal year;
2.	a report indicating the average CJE score by group for the appraisal year just completed; and
3.	a report by Division for the twenty (20) largest occupations showing the distribution of appraisal rating levels by RNOGAD category and number of employees in that category.
Section 6
Receipt and Notice of Elements and Standards
A.	The Employer has determined that first line supervisors will meet with their employees once every twelve (12) months to discuss new or revised critical job elements and standards; however, if the critical job elements have not changed, the supervisor need not meet with journey level and above employees but will communicate that the critical job elements will remain the same for that rating period. These meetings can occur as a group meeting (that is, more than one, or all of the employees, and the supervisor or designee), or as a one-on-one session between an employee and the supervisor or designee. The type of meeting will be decided on a case-by-case basis by the supervisor. Each Union Chapter whose bargaining unit members are attending the meeting will be provided reasonable notification and an opportunity to attend the meeting in accordance with the provisions of Article 9. The purpose of these meetings or sessions will be to clarify any questions that the employees have concerning their critical job elements and standards (for example, explanations or examples of what employees must do to perform at the levels above fully successful).
B.	In no event will employees be held accountable or responsible for their critical job elements and standards until they are received by the employees. All aspects of all standards, including numerical standards, procedures, or requirements, referenced in the critical job elements and standards will be communicated to affected employees at the time the employees receive their critical job elements and standards. When an employee is expected to meet a numerical standard that is different from that referenced above, that
39
ARTICLE 12
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
difference will be communicated in writing. A receipt will be obtained for substantive changes to critical job elements and standards, for example, changes in numbers for organization, function, and program (OFP) codes, changes in written time deadlines, or substantive changes in other written standards. This receipt will identify the changes as well as the effective date of those changes. Each critical job element and each aspect of the element will be numbered and/ or lettered for identification purposes. The Employer will inform the employee, at the time the critical job elements and standards are communicated, whether aspects of any critical job elements are to be accorded different weights. All changes in working procedures must be communicated to employees before they can be charged with errors. If instructions were previously in writing, the Employer will issue new written instructions as soon as possible.The Employer has the responsibility of proving that the critical job elements and standards were received by the employees.
C.	Employees will initial and date a receipt for the critical job elements and standards to show when they were received and discussed with the employee. In accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 430.204(b)(1), after initial issuance of critical job elements and standards, the critical job elements and standards will be reissued annually, normally within thirty (30) days of the beginning of the appraisal period. The Employer has determined that critical job elements and standards will be based on the requirements of the employee's position. Employees will be evaluated based on a comparison of performance with the standards established for the appraisal period. In addition, for employees covered by the Employer's general performance plans, each time an employee is assigned to a new position, the Employer will communicate the specific critical job elements and performance standards of the position that will apply to the employee. A journey level or above employee must initial and date a receipt even if an annual meeting is not held consistent with subsection 6A. Initialing does not mean the employee agrees with the Employer established critical job elements and standards. This receipt will be maintained by the Employerand will be available to the employees upon request.
D.	Employees permanently assigned to a new position description, new positions or work units with different critical job elements and standards, will be given a copy of those and an opportunity to discuss them with the Employer.The Union will be invited to attend these meetings. Union representatives will receive copies at least two (2) workdays in advance of the employees. Employees will be provided time at the beginning of the meetings to read their critical job elements and standards.
E.	Questions left unanswered during the meetings referenced above will normally be responded to within one (1) week of the end of the meeting. Answers to questions raised by or of interest to the entire group will be communicated to the group.
F.	Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. § 430, when employees are detailed or temporarily promoted and the assignment is expected to last sixty (60) days or more, the Employer will provide the employees with critical job elements and standards as soon as possible (no later than thirty (30) days from the beginning of the assignment). The employees will be rated on the critical job elements for the assignment. These ratings will be considered in deriving the employee’s next rating of record.
Section 7
New and Revised Elements and Standards
A.	As part of the monthly notice procedure in Article 47, subsection 2A, the Union National Office will be provided copies of critical job elements and standards that are new or revised.
B.	If a more than de minimis change occurs to the CJEs or standards, or to the performance expectations needed to meet a particular standard, the Union will be afforded an opportunity to bargain impact and implementation before the critical job elements, standards or performance expectations are put into effect. A request to negotiate must be submitted within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the newer revised standards or performance expectations. Subsequent to implementation, employees will be responsible for the elements and standards when received.
C.	If deletions are made for any reason in critical job elements, performance standards, or the aspects that make up the critical job elements, the Union will be notified, as well as the affected employee(s), but the change will take effect immediately.
Section 8
Use of Statistics
A.	The use of statistics by the Employer for the purpose of rating critical job elements will be in accordance with 26 C.F.R. § 801.The provisions of 26 C.F.R. § 801 may be found in Appendix I to this Agreement and were placed there for informational purposes only.
B.	The Employer has determined that it will not use records of tax enforcement results to evaluate employees or to impose or suggest production quotas or goals on employees. Rather, employees will be evaluated according to their CJEs and standards or such other performance criteria as may be established for their positions. Employees who are responsible for exercising judgment with respect to tax enforcement results in cases concerning one or more taxpayers may be evaluated on work done on such cases only in the context of their CJEs and standards.
40
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 12
C. The Employer has determined that performance C. measures based in whole or in part on quantity measures will not be used to evaluate the performance of any employee who is responsible for exercising judgment with respect to tax enforcement results.
Section 9
A.	Evaluative Recordations
The Employer has determined that an evaluative recordation will be furnished to an employee within fifteen (15) workdays of the time the supervisor becomes aware, or should have been aware, of the event which it addresses. If furnished after that time, it may not be used by the Employer to evaluate performance. Any material which may have an adverse effect on an employee's appraisal, the maintenance of which is not required by the IRM system and which is not shared with the employee, shall be removed and destroyed. Telephone monitoring evaluative recordation will be conducted in accordance with subsection 9B below.
B.	Contact Recording and Monitored Contacts
1.	Evaluative recordations arising from monitored contacts or contact recordings will be the written feedback provided by the Employer, not the actual recording. In the case of a recorded contact, the employee may listen to the recording and rebut in writing (consistent with subsection 9C1 of this Article) the Employer's assessment of the contact. In the event the evaluative recordation shows that the manager found fault with a recorded conversation, the manager will provide to the employee a screen shot of all other calls that were reviewed (listened to) by the manager, but not evaluated, on that day. Recordings of contacts that remain in dispute after rebuttal and discussion, along with any other recorded contacts that were reviewed on the same day as the disputed recordation, will be retained by the Employer (consistent with subsection 9C of this Article) until the performance appraisal is issued and any resulting litigation is resolved. If a copy of the recorded contacts described above was not retained, and there is an unresolved disagreement, the recordation with which the Employer found p fault may not be used by the Employer. Upon request, an employee will be allowed to listen to any recording.
2.	If the employee has provided incorrect information to a taxpayer, the Employer will inform the employee as soon as possible. In all other instances, the evaluative recordation will be shared with the employee within fifteen (15) workdays of when the call was received by IRS or the contact was made with the IRS.
1.	The Employer has determined that it will grant the employee a reasonable amount of administrative time to make written comments concerning any disagreement with an evaluative recordation or other review document at any time prior to its use in a performance appraisal or personnel action. Such comments will be attached to and become a part of the evaluative recordation or other review document. The supervisor will determine the appropriate time for the employee to prepare the written response based on workload demands. This time will be scheduled no later than three (3) workdays after the receipt of the request for administrative time.
2.	Where a manager has notified the employee via a formal evaluative recordation within fifteen (15) workdays of the recorded conversation that he or she has found fault with a particular conversation and if the employee fails to indicate disagreement with the manager's judgment prior to the time the contact recordings described in subparagraph 9B1, above, are deleted (which will not be sooner than forty (40) calendar days after the contact with the taxpayer was recorded), the formal evaluative recordation may still be used to evaluate the employee. The employee's disagreement with the manager's assessment must be in writing (for example, it could take the form of a written rebuttal, a grievance, an e-mail, or some other writing).
3.	At the time a recordation is provided to an employee, the manager will remind the employee that the record of the taxpayer contact is normally maintained for approximately forty (40) days and that if the employee fails to indicate disagreement through rebuttal and discussion prior to the time the recording of the taxpayer contact is deleted, the recordation may still be used to evaluate the employee.
4.	Evaluative recordations are not considered ratings of record and therefore are not grievable until used in an annual rating of record unless the recordation is used to disadvantage the employee (e.g., deny an overtime opportunity or suspend Telework or AWS).
When a review of a particular employee's work performance is specifically made by a supervisor above the employee's immediate (or first line) supervisor, and that review produces any negative feedback with respect to that particular employee's performance, the procedural requirements set forth in subsections 9A, 9B and 9C apply. Wherever possible, the employee will be given the opportunity to meet and/or discuss the matter with the higher-level supervisor who provided the evaluative comments.

Section 10
Reopener
If the Employer decides to implement any new system of critical job elements and standards, including retention standards and/or performance standards, during the life of this Agreement either party may reopen this Article.
Section 11
The parties recognize that automation technologies have enabled some information that is presently stored in paper-based systems to be stored in other systems. If the Employer elects to change its method of storing any information during the term of this Agreement, the Employer may reopen this Section at the national level under the provisions of Article 47 of this Agreement.
Section 12
Embedded Quality (EQ)
The use of Embedded Quality data must conform to all provisions of this Article. Furthermore, the Employer has determined the following:
A.	1. Employees will be evaluated on the performance of their CJEs. The Employer will not use quantitative EQRS data (i.e., percentages) as the sole basis for performance ratings in each or any critical element. At a minimum, a supervisor may not substantiate an appraisal score in a CJE or an aspect only by referring to the total number of errors or "yes" or "no" percentages.
2.	Supervisors must look at other performance documentation and include such sources in the appraisal. Furthermore, where EQ numerical percentages are used to evaluate employees, the Employer will carry the burden of proof in any grievance or arbitration hearing to demonstrate that the cases selected for review were a reasonable and representative sample of all assigned work of the employee.
3.	Where the EQ analysis includes a measure of timeliness expressed in calendar days, the Employer has determined that any error identified against the measure will not be charged against the employee in an annual appraisal unless the employee also missed the deadline when it is expressed in his or her workdays. For example, if the EQ standard requires an action within ten (10) calendar days and failure to take action in that time frame is considered failure to meet the standard, an error will not be held against the employee in the annual appraisal unless the employee also failed to take action within ten (10) days of work for that employee. For the purposes of this provision, a "workday of the employee"
excludes Federal Holidays, week-end days, AWS regular days off (RDO), including full days off in a Maxiflex schedule, and days when the employee is on approved leave.
B.	Managers and supervisors will not use EQRS data to compare one employee to another, or to suggest that one employee's error rate is too high compared to others in the unit or organization.
C.	Non-quantitative data gathered from reviews completed in EQRS may be relied upon for the basis of a mid-year or annual appraisal. However, supervisors will consider all factors (not just EQRS case reviews) to provide a fair and accurate assessment of the employee's overall performance throughout the rating period.
D.	Supervisors will have the authority to conclude that an employee's performance on a particular case or attribute was acceptable even though a time frame, guideline or attribute may not have been met.
E.	The Employer will conduct a biannual assessment of existing EQRS attributes and results, at the national program level, to assess the clarity of existing definitions, and to identify systemic barriers to functional program performance. EQRS quality assurance measures with results below seventy-five percent (75%) will be analyzed to identify causes, corrections, impacts, and the Employer will conduct a causal analysis. Changes, corrective actions and other procedures implemented that impact the attribute(s) at issue will be monitored quarterly. The Employer will share this information with National NTEU annually.
F.	The Employer will provide NTEU with quarterly National EQRS reports (covering the prior six (6) months) on each of the attributes for each EQRS system in use.
G.	The Employer will hold an EQRS Summit (or focus group) biannually at the operating unit level (e.g. Accounts Management, Campus Compliance, Field Exam) in every operating unit that uses the EQRS system. These EQRS Summits will include input from employees and managers or supervisors who use the EQRS system. Four (4) bargaining unit employees will be chosen by National NTEU to represent the Union at each summit.The Summits will be held telephonically or by electronic means, at the Employer's discretion. National NTEU will receive a telephonic or electronic briefing on the results of the Summit and any decisions made by the Employer.
Section 13
Measured Employees Performance System (MEPS)
Measured Employees Performance System (MEPS) provides information for the evaluation of GS-08 and below employees who are measured in either quality and/ or efficiency under Numerical Performance Standards.
42
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 12
Section 14
Numerical Performance Standards for
Measured Employees
The parties recognize that the work performed within the Submission Processing function, and other portions of a campus designated by the parties, requires specific understanding and procedures as identified below:
A.	MEPS is the employee performance evaluation system used to evaluate all center employees, GS-08 and below, on a measured performance plan.
B.	For purposes of this Agreement, a "measured employee" is an employee who may or may not receive a "measured appraisal," depending on whether or not certain criteria (described below) are met; and a "measured appraisal" is an appraisal derived, in part, from systemically computed "Quality and Efficiency" ratings by MEPS. The Employer has determined that an unmeasured rating will be issued if the supervisor decides that the systemically computed measured rating is not valid and indicative of the employee's performance.
C.	Performance standards for measured employees are set by the Employer pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 4302 and Section 3 of this Article. Quality performance standards are for each operation function (OF) at the National level and efficiency performance standards are for each operation, function, and program (OFP) code, at the campus (local) level by grade level, and are set by the Employer in the manner described in IRM 3.43.405.
D.	The local Chapter will be provided with proposed changes to performance standards at least two (2) weeks in advance of their proposed implementation date and will be afforded an opportunity to discuss them with the Employer before the employee group meetings described below.
E.	Meetings between the Union and the Employer relating to changes in performance standards will be held at the Department level. The Union may bring up to three (3) representatives to these meetings. Official time for the meetings will be granted in accordance with Article 9, and bank time may be used for preparation, in accordance with Article 9.
F.	In addition to the revised performance standards, the Employer will provide the local Chapter with the reasons for the proposed changes in numerical standards, together with relevant and necessary data supporting the changes.
G.	For purposes of Section 7 of this Article, the right of the Union to bargain over any adverse impact in the implementation of new or revised performance standards shall be as follows:
1.	when the procedures of IRM 3.43.405 are not followed; and
2.	when the National Director Ranges are revised.
H.	In cases where the impact bargaining relating to changes in performance standards is not completed by the time the proposed performance standards are scheduled to take effect, the proposed performance standards will not be implemented as scheduled. Employees will, in advance of the effective date of changes in performance standards, be provided notification of the new performance standards, be invited to group meetings to discuss the changes, and be afforded an opportunity to comment on them. These meetings are deemed to be "formal meetings" for purposes of Union attendance. The Employer will explain to employees the reasons for the proposed changes to performance standards during these group meetings.
Section 15
Quarterly Performance Summaries for Measured Employees
A.	On a quarterly basis, MEPS will calculate Annual Individual Performance Reports (IPR) for measured Quality and/or measured Efficiency. These summaries will be given to employees in January, April, and October of each year, based on their rating period, and will cover the employee's performance for the previous four (4) full quarters. Annual IPRS will not be generated for the quarter ending in June.
B.	Performance summaries are not, in and of themselves, performance appraisals within the meaning of subsection 2G of this Article. Performance summaries are evaluative recordations.
Section 16
Annual Ratings for Measured Employees
A seasonal employee, who has worked a minimum of sixty (60) days, shall receive an annual appraisal consistent with Exhibit 12-2 using all available performance data for the current year, provided that such data is valid and indicative of the employee's performance.
Section 17
Criteria for Quality Ratings for Measured Employees
A.	The Employer has determined that employees will receive measured ratings in Quality based on their performance against numerical standards established by the Employer as described in Section 14 above.
B.	Measured Quality performance summaries will be derived from a random sampling of an employee's work by OF. To select a random sample of an employee's work, samples must be taken on a continuous basis (generally weekly) throughout the rating period. Random sampling is the process of choosing a sample in such a way that all completed work has the same chance of being included in the sample.
C.	The goal of the Employer's sampling system is to achieve a confidence level of ninety percent (90%) within a plus or minus two percent (2%) sampling error.
43
ARTICLE 12
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
D.	Defects are established (or may be established by the employer in the future) based on any opportunity for error on a document/case as displayed in a Data Collection Instrument (DCI) in the EQSP system.
E.	The Employer has determined that the employee's performance scores for Quality will be based on documents/cases reviewed and stated as "percent accurate," (documents correct divided by total documents reviewed multiplied by 100). When computing the accuracy rate, the sample will be adjusted using a precision margin to ensure a ninety percent (90%) confidence level.
F.	Each OFP worked by an employee will be time weighted, and the results combined to derive the employee's performance index in Quality, commonly referred to as the "Employee Index Score".
G.	Measured ratings for Quality will be calculated only in those cases where the affected employees have spent at least forty percent (40%) of their direct time or twenty five percent (25%) of their total time on measured work during their rating period.
Section 18
Criteria for Efficiency Ratings for
Measured Employees
A.	Employees will receive measured ratings in Efficiency based on their performance against numerical standards established by the Employer as described in subsection 14C.
B.	Employees will receive an effectiveness score for each OFPG worked. These effectiveness scores will be multiplied by the appropriate time/weight factors. The sum of these time weighted effectiveness scores will be used to derive the employee's performance summary in Efficiency.
C.	Measured ratings for Efficiency will be calculated only in those cases where the affected employees have spent at least forty percent (40%) of their direct time on measured work and at least twenty-five percent (25%) of their total time on measured work.
Section 19
Reports Relating to Ratings For Measured Employees
A.	The following reports will be provided to affected employees:
1.	Weekly Individual Performance Report (IPR); (weekly, monthly and annual with performance data from the beginning of an employee's rating period to current month ending); and
2.	Statistics Reports by Operation (posted in unit).
B.	The following reports will be provided to the Union via "Control D:"
1.	Mid-Quarter/Quarterly Efficiency Performance Report;
2.	Rating Statistics Report by Operation and Center -Quarterly Quality Report;
3.	Calculation Base Point Report for Quality;
4.	Calculated Base Point Report for Efficiency; and
5.	Performance Standards Report for Efficiency and Quality.
The information listed above will be retained in "Control-D"for at least one (1) year.
The Employer will provide NTEU, at the National level, the Rating Statistics Report on a quarterly basis.
C.	Nothing in this Section serves as a waiver of the Union's statutory right to additional information that is reasonable and necessary for it to perform its representational duties.
D.	The Employerand the Union shall, upon request of the Union, conduct quarterly meetings at the Operation level or equivalent outside Submission Processing to discuss the contents of the foregoing reports to the Union. Rights relating to attendance and time are set forth in subsection 14E above.
E.	The Employer will provide each center Chapter with a personal computer (PC), a printer and as much software as is necessary to read and print from the data referenced above. The PC, printer, and software will be owned and maintained by the Employer, but shall be for the exclusive use of the local center Chapter to perform its representational duties. All reports in subsection 19B, above, shall be provided to the local Union Chapter. Each Union center Chapter shall be provided with access to "Control D"and the necessary computer hardware and software to allow it to read, print, and manipulate the data that is provided. Access to "Control D" is only available to the Chapter President or designee and the Chapter MEPS coordinator or designee on the computer provided to the NTEU Office by the IRS.
F.	Reports provided under the provisions of this subsection will be adjusted for any organizational component outside Submission Processing where the parties have agreed to place employees on measured performance plans.

Miscellaneous Provisions
A. Time spent by employees at the health unit, preparing Forms 3081 and at group meetings will be charged in a uniform manner throughout a center. Direct time is considered to be only that time spent specifically
44
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 12
performing work rather than administrative functions.
B.	If an employee is held accountable for work under a particular skill code, that employee will be assigned that skill code.
C.	Any grievance, by or on behalf of a measured employee, over an annual rating that is made in advance of a related personnel action, (for example, within-grade increase, career ladder promotion) will be joined automatically to any grievance, by or on behalf of such	$
measured employee, over the subsequent related personnel action if the original grievance has not been resolved at the time the subsequent grievance is filed.
D.	For purposes of this Agreement, the determination that a rating is valid and indicative involves a decision that the data is correct (valid) and that numeric results reflect the employee's actual performance.
E.	If it is determined that a measured rating is not valid and indicative of an employee's performance, or if the work is not measured at all, the employee will be evaluated on an unmeasured basis as provided for in that employee's performance plan and other applicable provisions of this Article.
F.	The Employer has determined that Quality and Efficiency Ranges will be set Service-wide, as the national ranges are:	E
Quality: 2 = 77; 3 = 95; 4 = 125; 5 = 140
Efficiency: 2 = 70; 3 = 90; 4 = 120; 5 = 140
G.	Employees will receive learning curves based on the quality level of the OF. If the employee is measured in quality only, the employee will receive a learning curve for each OFP (parent) when the employee initially reports time and volume to the OFP (parent). None of the work performed (quality or efficiency data) on an OFP (parent) while under a learning curve will be used in any evaluative recordations or in the measured data base.
Section 21
The following provision applies to the Submission Processing function:
A.	The parties agree to the following terms which change the way MEPS operates as of the effective date of the Agreement. The goal is to increase the number of employees receiving measured evaluations.
B.	The IRS will provide National NTEU the Measured Performance Reports for the nation, local level copies of measured report statistics, report by operation and service center, and local levels copies of the Statistics by Operation, (MEPSOP), Statistics for Service Center, (MEPSSC), and Statistics for Nation, (MEPSNA) reports.
C.	Management has determined to label the work in all organization, function, and program groups (OFPs) that has a ninety-seven percent (97%) accuracy rate or higher in a quarter to be a High Quality Function
(HQF). Once the work achieves this level, Individual Quality Review (IQR) will cease in that OFP until the level of accuracy for the OFP drops below ninetyseven percent (97%). IQR will be replaced with product review (PR). All those employees who are working on an OFP during the time it is considered HQF will be granted the minimum employee efficiency score needed to achieve a five (5) rating in that OFP.
The accuracy of a HQF will be assessed at the end of the eighth (8th) week of a quarter. If the work is below the ninety-seven percent (97%) level at that time, management will notify employees working that HQF, through a medium agreed upon, but not negotiated, locally, that the work will return to IQR at the beginning of the next quarter. Prior to this announcement, there must be a meeting between the Union and the Employer representatives to examine the accuracy of the calculation. Care should be taken by the local parties to follow the IRM rules on PR for HQF, and they should involve their MEPS Coordinators in this effort. A decision to drop IQR and return to PR may be announced at anytime and the determination to make the change will also be made on data from the eighth (8th) week unless agreed otherwise in local discussions, but not negotiations.
Employees must be working on measured work for more than sixty (60) days before they can be given a measured evaluation. Thereafter, the employee will be evaluated using the learning curves for the work in each OFPG and none of the work performed during an employee's learning curve will be included in the measured data base or in the employee's evaluation.
The"valid and indicative"requirement is retained, but the parties will exclude "low hour data" (as defined in the revised IRM 3.43.405) for Efficiency if a base point was added consistent with Section 14 and the IRM. They will also exclude data from those OFPs with less than six (6) employees working them in a quarter. The Employer has determined that these will be excluded from the measured data base as well as the employee's evaluation.
The Quality and Efficiency Ranges will be set consistent with subsection 20F, above. Moreover, the Employer recognizes that a change in the Ranges can be a change in working conditions that is negotiable. It will, therefore, give the Union advance notice of a change prior to the change and bargain, if requested and required. If the Ranges are changed (initially or subsequently) and the parties reach an impasse over the impact and implementation issues related to the change, the ranges will remain the same.
The Employer has determined that base points will be set reasonably. The MEPS system automatically deletes any base points added. The MEPS system will not rate any programs that do not have sufficient "valid and indicative" data. Quality Base Points represent the
45
ARTICLE 13
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
accuracy rate of work processed. Quality base points are set nationally for all sites, for each Operation, Function (OF) (parent) and are the mean (average) accuracy rate of all measured work that was quality reviewed during same quarter, prior year at all Submission Processing Sites.
I.	The parties agree to delete any prior agreement that lower graded employees always have lower standards than higher graded employees.
J.	The Employer will provide all NTEU Chapters representing employees on a measured performance plan the data it normally receives on MEPS in as streamlined and uniform manner before the implementation of these changes.
K.	Stewards will receive the same MEPS training as that which is provided managers.
Article 13 | Promotions/Other Competitive Actions
Section 1
Purpose
A.	The parties recognize the importance of a systematic and equitable process that affords long-term employees opportunities to work in the location of their choice and provides bargaining unit employees the maximum opportunity to develop and advance to their full potential, consistent with the recognized need of the Employer to maintain staffing and skill levels sufficient to meet mission requirements. Thus, the Employer has determined that the area of consideration for bargaining unit positions announced under the provisions of Article 13 will be Service-wide and that the organizational assignment, as well as the geographic location of the candidate, except when related to a priority entitlement listed in subsection 2E, will not be used as an evaluative factor when filling vacant positions.
B.	The Employer has determined that it will provide first consideration to IRS employees for its bargaining unit vacancies by considering the Best Qualified (BQ) candidates at all grades for which a position is announced.
1.	In this regard, the Employer may simultaneously post vacancy announcements for, and separately rate, rank, and assess, as applicable, both internal and external candidates for such vacancies. However, the certificate(s) listing internal BQ candidates, as determined according to the procedures set forth in this Article, will be referred first to the selecting official for final consideration.
2.	Under no circumstances will the selecting official be permitted to review and/or consider external candidates prior to making a final determination
regarding the selection or non-selection of internal BQ candidates. Once the selecting official has made final select/non-select determinations regarding internal candidates, the certificate(s) listing external BQ candidates may referred for consideration.
3.	When considering external applicants for bargaining unit vacancies, in accordance with this subsection, post-of-duty (POD) assignments for external selectees may not be made until POD assignments for internal selectees have been made.
C.	The Employer will provide National NTEU with a yearly accounting of the number of bargaining unit vacancies by grade and series filled with bargaining unit employees and those filled with non-bargaining unit employees. The information will also include the retention rate for external selectees for the prior year.
D.	The Employer agrees that where OPM establishes a positive education requirement in accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 300, and if received from OPM, the Employer will provide NTEU with copies of the validation study or studies that support that requirement, as well as other pertinent information. Such information shall be furnished at least sixty (60) days prior to the use of the positive education requirement in a vacancy announcement. In this regard, the Union agrees to comply with any security and/or confidentiality requirements established by the Employer with regard to release of the validation study or studies to the Union in accordance with this Section.
E.	Nothing in this Article precludes an employee from applying for IRS positions announced both internally and externally.
F.	Other corrective actions, including retroactive promotion, are appropriate when an employee has been found to have undergone an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as described in 5 C.F.R. § 550 and Comptroller General decisions. Additional information pertaining to corrective actions and retroactive promotions may be found in IRM 6.550.1, Pay Administration.

1.	announcement number;
2.	opening and closing date;
3.	the number, title, series, grade, and organizational location(s), and POD of the vacant position(s) to D. be filled. In no case may a position be filled unless the Employer has announced via the vacancy announcement the POD and the number of positions in that POD. Nothing in this Section g requires the Employer to fill a particular position in a particular POD; however, when the Employer announces multiple positions in multiple PODs, whether by roster or individual vacancy announcement and if the Employer decides to announce a vacancy or vacancies in multiple PODs before determining where to place the position(s), it may only select from a single consolidated BQ
list that has the top four (4) candidates (or more if appropriate to the number of vacancies).
4.	shift information (i.e., day, swing and night) and hours of work and the availability of alternative work schedules (AWS) and/or staggered work hours;

The ranking of applicants, completed by the automated system, will be based on the Critical Job Elements (CJEs) for the position to be filled using responses to job related questions completed during the automated application process. The applicant's responses to the questions will determine their potential to perform in the vacant position. CJE questions will be developed in accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 300, Subpart A. Consistent with subsections 5C and 5D, below, points will also be added for related awards and the employee's rating of record.
2.	The Employer has determined that bargaining unit employees will be included in the CJE question validation process, including validation of newly added or revised questions. Meetings to validate questions will be conducted via telephone or other electronic means. The Employer will provide National NTEU with a list of qualified bargaining unit employees and the number of employees needed by occupation for each job analysis. National NTEU will select from the list the participants to represent the Union for each occupational category.

E.	The selecting official will receive a list of BQ applicants in rank order along with the appropriate supporting documentation such as the automated hiring system resume, performance appraisal, or transcript. Contingent upon Treasury approval, the Agency will seek to secure a system enhancement that will generate the overall CJE scores for all BQ candidates to be provided to the selecting official.
F.	The BQ applicants will be the top four (4) applicants plus one (1) additional name for each additional vacancy. All tied candidates will be referred. An employee will not be removed from the BQ list of a pending package because he or she has accepted another position unless he/she withdraws from consideration from that pending package in writing.

E.	Additional positions of the same kind (that is, those with the same title, series and grade, at the same POD, and same group or unit) may be filled within forty-five (45) days of the initial selection in cases where vacancies remain or occur within the forty-five (45) days. In such cases, the originally selected employee will be replaced on the new BQ list if eligible candidates remain. The forty-five (45) day time frame may be extended to sixty (60) days if the Employer: 1. has additional positions to fill within sixty (60) days of the initial selection and the need is due to an originally selected candidate rejecting the position offered; or
2.	has selected seventy-five percent (75%) of the candidates originally on the BQ list; or
3.	has not filled any of the announced positions with external candidates other than employees who applied externally; or

The counseling will provide the reasons for his or her non-selection (e.g., a higher-rated candidate was selected), as well as feedback concerning what the
51
ARTICLE 13
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
employee can do to improve his or her chances for selection when applying for similar vacancies in the future.
2.	If the Employer elects to select a candidate from outside the IRS, the counseling will include reasons for the selection (e.g., the candidate displayed superior communication skills in the interview, the candidate possessed more job-related skills) and suggestions on how the employee may be better prepared for similar opportunities in the future.
3.	In addition, the Employer will provide guidance to supervisors on ways to provide more meaningful feedback to employees, and upon request, will provide employees with additional information on obtaining assistance in improving interview skills and obtaining career counseling.
4.	Nothing herein waives an employee's right to receive whatever level of detail is required to explain his or her non-selection by law or Governmentwide regulation when an employee alleges a civil rights violation, unfair labor practice, prohibited personnel practice or other statutory violation.
Section 8
Career Ladder Promotions
A.	Employees in career ladder positions will be promoted in the first pay period after:
1.	they become minimally eligible to be promoted (after the last workday of the 52nd week in their positions or whatever lesser period satisfies the basic eligibility requirements); and
2.	they are capable of satisfactorily performing at the next higher level. For employees whose elements and standards are no different than those of the next higher grade level in the career ladder, an overall annual rating of fully successful at the current grade will satisfy the performance requirements.
B.	As an exception to Subsection 8A, above, if the employee is currently on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) or has received an Intent to Deny Within Grade Increase (WGI) letter, management will delay the career ladder promotion until the employee receives a notification that they are performing at a fully successful level.
Section 9
Miscellaneous
A.	The fact that an employee is the subject of a conduct investigation will not prevent or delay the employee's promotion, which would otherwise be made, unless the Employer judges that such delay is necessary to protect the integrity of the Service.
B.	Subject to its right to assign employees, the Employer will make a reasonable effort to return employees
to their former or like positions, who, within the last year, were promoted and subsequently demoted for inability to perform at the higher level. Employees hired through an external source will be required to serve a probationary period. However, if the employee has already served a probationary period with IRS and does not successfully complete the probationary period and/or the formal training agreement required for the new position, as applicable, the Employer will make a reasonable effort to reassign the employee to their previous grade and same or similar position.
C.	For employees who are selected for a promotion and are not required to attend any initial classroom training (e.g., Unit I training), the promotion will be effective no later than one (1) complete pay period following selection. For employees who must first complete training, the promotion will become effective at the beginning of such training.
D.	In accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, any applicant on the BQ list who declines in writing a selection offer will be replaced by the next higher ranking qualified applicant.
E.	Upon request, the Employer will make available to any applicant involved in a competitive action governed by the terms of this Article the overall score assigned to the applicant. Subject to the Privacy Act, upon request, the applicant will be provided the overall scores assigned to the other BQ applicants. Such request should be made through the applicant's supervisor or designee.

54
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 14
2:	The release and recall of seasonal employees and employees on term appointments will be accomplished by a combination of performance and seniority of those employees possessing the . skills needed.

7.	The Employer has determined that term employees will be released before career status employees and will be recalled after career status employees are recalled.
8.	Ties in ranking will be broken first by IRS EOD, second by Service Computation Date (SCD), and third by comparing the last four digits of the tied employee's social security numbers. In bdd numbered years, employees with the lowest number will be placed first on the release/recall list. The opposite will hold true in even numbered years.

(b)	those employees with the highest score will be at the top of the list;
(c)	employees with ratings of minimally
successful will be placed below employees with ratings of fully successful or above in descending IRS EOD order;
(d)	employees with ratings of unacceptable will be placed below employees with ratings of minimally successful in descending IRS EOD order;
(e)	newly hired seasonal employees who do not have performance appraisals consistent with the provisions of subsection 2A6 will be placed on the bottom of the release/recall list by their training test scores until such time as they are evaluated for the next list; and

Expedited Resolution Process
A. The parties agree to use the following process to resolve impasses that result from negotiations:
1.	Either party may contact the designated Factfinder that has been selected by the national parties, to advise the Factfinder of the dispute. This contact will be on the last day of scheduled bargaining or when the parties reach impasse, whichever is earlier.The parties will submit their final proposals and any supporting documentation to the Factfinder within three (3) workdays of the initial contact.The Factfinder will also rule on assertions by the Union that the Employer failed to provide information requested for the negotiations pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7114(b)(4). Consistent with Article 47, subsection 2G1(b), if the Factfinder finds that the Employer has failed to provide the
information when it had a legal obligation to do so under applicable law, the Factfinder must compel the production of the information and will extend bargaining for an appropriate period of time to permit the Union to consider the information and adjust proposals accordingly.
2.	The Factfinder is empowered to assist the parties in reaching agreement. The Factfinder shall determine the appropriate resolution process, including last and best offer (Article by Article or issue by issue) or amendment of final offers.
3.	The Factfinder may contact the parties via conference calls, subject to Article 47 subsections 2H2 and 2H3 of this Agreement, to discuss the offers and will recommend a resolution to the dispute within two (2) weeks of the final factfinding session. For disputes resulting from negotiations consistent with Article 47, Section 2 of this Agreement, the time frame is extended to four (4) weeks after the final factfinding session.The recommended resolution will be in writing. In no case may the Factfinder intrude on the Employer's right to reassign/realign. Any disputes as to whether the Parties have engaged in their final factfinding session will be determined by the Factfinder.
4.	Any disputes remaining after submission to the Factfinder will be resolved pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119, or other appropriate provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7101, et. seq. The party that moves such remaining disputes to the statutory impasse resolution process carries the burden of proof regarding the reasons the Factfinder's report does not resolve the issue at impasse.
5.	If the Union seeks impasse resolution pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119, reassignments/realignments will be implemented while the Union pursues the statutory impasse process. If the Employer seeks impasse resolution pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119, reassignments/realignments and other changes to conditions of employment will be delayed pending resolution of the disputed issues, unless exigencies are present. If a party seeks impasse resolution, the parties will ask the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) to expedite the matter.
6.	If a dispute moves to the statutory process, the objecting party will pay the full costs of the Factfinder who produced the decision. Should neither party object, the costs of the Factfinder will be shared by the parties.
Section 4
Reassignments/Realignments -General Provisions
A.	The parties jointly commit to work together in minimizing the adverse impact on employees involuntarily reassigned/realigned under this Article. The parties
59
ARTICLE 15
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
further commit to fully exploring a variety of options which minimize adverse impact such as Telework, alternative work schedules, and telecommuting.
B.	Notwithstanding the provisions outlined in Section 2, above, employees in their first year as revenue agents, revenue officers, or tax auditors are subject to reassignment/realignment without regard to their length of service, provided that, among such first year employees, IRS EOD will be used when fewer than all such first year employees need to be reassigned/ realigned.
C.	1. When employees have been reassigned/realigned due to the abolishment of their positions, they will be given the preference for reassignment/ realignment back to such positions provided that such positions have been reestablished within three (3) years of abolition, and the employees apply for such positions within fifteen (15) days of receiving written notice (to be given by the Employer) of the reestablishment of the positions. If such reassignment/realignment due to job abolition was to a position within the commuting area, employees will be offered the right of first refusal back to such positions. If there are two (2) or more applicants for a reestablished position, the most senior applicant, using IRS EOD, who meets the position requirements will have preference. The parties recognize it is in the interest of the Government to return applicants to their former positions at Government expense whenever possible.
2.	When employees have been involuntarily reassigned/realigned from a position in the last five (5) years, they will be entitled to return to a vacant position with the same title, series, and grade in the location they were forced to leave. No moving expenses are authorized in such circumstances.
D.	The Employer has determined that reassignments/ realignments will not be used in lieu of discipline.
Section 5
Hardship Relocations
Part 1:	Hardship Relocations Through Vacancy Process
A.	1. The Employer has determined, that consistent with workload needs, it will relocate an employee demonstrating a significant hardship that can be relieved by a relocation outside their commuting area or a change in POD, provided that there is a vacant position which the Employer intends to fill in the employee's current job series and the employee meets the position and skill requirements.
2.	Employees requesting a hardship relocation will be eligible for positions to be permanently filled at the same or lower grade for which they meet OPM qualifications and selective placement factors.
B.	The Employer has determined that all hardship relocation recipients who are above the journey level will be limited to entitlement to positions in their current occupation at the journey level.
C.	Situations may arise wherein the Employer may attempt to accommodate a hardship eligible by offering assignment to a position in another series when it is determined by the Employer that the employee is minimally qualified for the position, can readily perform the work and there is no vacancy in the employee's current series, provided that there is no hardship eligible currently in the series being considered. The Employer has determined that the hardship eligible is not required to accept a position in another series. Declination of such an offer will have no impact on the employee's entitlement under this Agreement.
D.	The Employer may fill an announced vacancy with an applicant without accommodating a hardship eligible if the hardship eligible has, within the previous ninety (90) days declined an offer of assignment made in accordance with the provisions of his Agreement. Declination of an offer made under subsection 5C, above, does not serve to trigger this provision.
E.	The Employer has determined that employees who accept a voluntary change to lower grade in order to receive a hardship reassignment will be assigned work commensurate with their grade level.
F.	The Employer has determined that notification of the hardship request prior to the close of a vacancy announcement will result in that hardship relocation being made through that vacancy announcement provided the employee meets the hardship criteria.
G.	The Employer has determined that if a "gaining" office has more than one (1) hardship waiting for relocation, that office will offer the hardship relocation according to the length of time that an eligible employee has been waiting. That is, the employee who can perform the duties and meets the position requirements and who has been eligible the greatest length of time.
H.	Until such time that employees who accept a voluntary downgrade achieve their previous grade, employees who apply for a position may indicate on their application that they have previously received a hardship relocation.The Employer will take into consideration prior to selection that the employee(s) have accepted a downgrade as a result a hardship relocation.
Part 2:	Hardship Relocations By Reassignment
A.	At the Employer's discretion, the hardship eligible may be reassigned after clearing other priority programs pursuant to Article 13, subsections 2E1 through 2E6.
B.	The following provisions apply to all hardship relocations by reassignment:
1)	the reassignment must be within the same Business Operating Division;
60
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 15
2)	the employee must be in a permanent position and retain his or her current series, grade, and position description (except as set forth in subsection 2E, below);
3)	the employee must retain his or her current work schedule (e.g., seasonal to seasonal, part-time to part-time);
4)	the employee must accept the work conditions of the gaining office; and
5)	Facilities Management and Security Services has confirmed that the new POD can accommodate the employee.
C.	The Employer has determined that if a "gaining" office within the BOD has more than one (1) hardship waiting for relocation, that office will offer the hardship relocation according to the length of time that an eligible employee from within the BOD as defined in subsection B, above, has been waiting. That is, the employee who can perform the duties and meets the position requirements and who has been eligible the greatest length of time.
D.	Any reassignments or denials of reassignments made under Section 5, Part 2, above, are non-grievable.
E.	The Employer has determined that all hardship relocation recipients who are above the journey level will be limited to entitlement to positions in their current occupation at the journey level.
Part 3:	Provisions Applicable to All Hardship Relocations
A.	Employees accepting a voluntary hardship relocation will have their pay set in accordance with Government wide regulations.
B.	The employee must provide verifiable documentation concerning the situation or condition that gave rise to the hardship request. The application form (Exhibit 15-1) will be used to substantiate and document hardship reassignment requests.
C.	The employee's office will notify the "gaining" office within ten (10) workdays of receipt of a completed hardship application. The employee, at his or her option, may submit a copy of his or her completed application to the gaining personnel office sooner than the ten (10) workdays.
D.	Employees will be eligible for hardship relocation so long as their most recent annual rating of record is fully successful or above, they are not currently on a Performance Improvement Plan, and they are not currently the subject of a disciplinary action or a continuing conduct investigation.
E.	The hardship relocation application is good for one (1) year from the approval date. At the expiration of the one (1) year period, the employee must reapply.
F.
G.
J.
In addition, the employee may be required to recertify that the hardship still exists before an office extends an offer of a position. Employees will notify the "gaining" office of any change in the hardship situation.
Examples of hardship situations or circumstances are listed below.This list is not intended to be all inclusive. There may be other situations when the totality of circumstances constitutes a hardship situation. The Employer reserves the right to exercise its judgment in those circumstances.
1.	The employee or employee's immediate family is experiencing a significant hardship. "Immediate family" refers to spouses, parents (or legal guardians), brothers, sisters, and children. "Step" relationships and life partner are included in the definition of immediate family.
2.	If medical in nature, the hardship must be serious, affecting major life functions and not treatable in the employee's current location, for example, a severe condition of hay fever which might be alleviated by relocation to another geographic area would not be considered a significant hardship unless the employee's condition cannot be alleviated or controlled by recognized medical treatment.
3.	Access to a hospital that specializes in treatment of a specific life threatening disease or condition would qualify as a hardship, even though there is a general care hospital in the employee's current location.
4.	Access to special educational facilities (for example, schools for hearing or visually impaired) would be considered a significant hardship if there is no equivalent facility in the employee's present location.
5.	Employment-related situations that constitute a hardship situation include any spouse, fiance, or life partner being offered the choice of relocation or unemployment, receiving a promotion opportunity in another location, losing a job and receiving a job offer in another location, or receiving military orders to relocate.
With the exception of hardship requests sought pursuant to Section 5, Part 2, above, denials of hardship requests will continue to be resolved through the grievance procedure. Grievances that remain unresolved at the first step will be waived to the last step of the grievance process. Upon invocation, unresolved grievances over denial of hardship requests will be discussed at the national level prior to scheduling the arbitrations.
The Employer will provide the NTEU National President a monthly report listing all approved hardship applications. The report will include the date of the request, the grade, series and current location of the employee and the new location requested by the employee.
A hardship relocation under this process will not entitle the employee to moving expenses, but neither will it void any independent entitlement the employee
61
ARTICLE 15
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
may have.
K. The Hardship Relocation Program does not apply to positions to be filled on a temporary basis.
Section 6
Voluntary Relocations Within a Geographic Area
A.	Employees may volunteer for relocation under this Section for any POD within their geographic area. Geographic area for the purposes of offering voluntary relocations is defined in Exhibit 15-2.
B.	The Employer has determined that the procedures of this Section will be used in the following situations:
1.	in filling vacancies below the journey level of an occupation; and
2.	in filling one-half (1/2) of the positions that the Employer determines to fill at the journey level and above in each POD. For example, if the Employer has four (4) above journey level revenue agent vacancies at a particular POD, this process will be used in filling at least two (2) of them; if there is only one (1) vacancy or an odd number of vacancies, the Employer will use this process in filling every other vacancy. Selections made under the voluntary relocation process will be subject to the priority selection order in Article 13, subsection 2E. For example, this process will not be used before priority placement, priority consideration, reassignment Preference eligible, hardship and staffing imbalance candidates are considered. It will be used before competitive or other placement methods are used.
C.	Employees wishing to relocate using this process must annually file voluntary applications for consideration listing the location(s) within their geographic area for which they wish to be considered. The opportunity to apply will be announced Service-wide for fifteen (15) calendar days from the beginning of January and July for each year of this Agreement. The Employer has determined that when it decides to fill a vacancy, it will review the voluntary applications and list the candidates in order of IRS EOD and Employees will be excluded from the list if they do not have a rating of Fully Successful or above on their last rating of record, are not in the same position as that of the vacancy, have moved voluntarily under this program, received a new appointment, or were competitively selected under Article 13 of this Agreement in the last two (2) years. Employees in positions with specialty areas that require specialized training will only be eligible to volunteer for relocation to vacancies in the same specialty area. Once this list is assembled, applicants will be selected in order of earliest IRS EOD date for relocation to perform the duties of their positions at the new location so long as they have a current rating of record that "Exceeds Fully Successful" or higher. Employees with a rating of "Fully Successful" on their
last rating of record will be considered and selected after those with "Exceeds Fully Successful" or higher ratings on their last rating of record, but may be passed over for just cause.
D.	A relocation under this process will not entitle the employee to moving expenses, but neither will it void any independent entitlement the employee may have.
E.	Within budgetary limitations, any qualified employee working a Part-Time Career Act schedule who previously worked full time will be returned, upon request, to a full time schedule in his or her occupation.
Section 7
Job Swaps
The Employer has determined that Employees in the same occupational classification series, with the same work schedule (e.g., seasonal to seasonal), same specialty area, if applicable, and at the same grade levels may swap positions, absent just cause. Additionally, once an employee has swapped positions with another employee, he or she may not swap again for three (3) years. In order to be eligible for such voluntary movement employees must be at least fully successful in their current positions and the swap must not require any formal training or relocation costs to the Employer. Employees approved for a job swap are subject to the working conditions in the work area of the other employee involved in the swap (e.g., AWS, Telework, TOD). The parties recognize and acknowledge that such job swaps are solely for the benefit of the employees involved and it is the responsibility of the employees to identify the other employees interested in such a job swap.
Section 8
Temporary Hardships
A.	Where an employee is experiencing a temporary hardship, the employee may request a temporary Telework arrangement.The Employer will make every reasonable effort to approve a temporary Telework location, including another IRS POD, to accommodate the temporary hardship.
1.	The mileage requirement of Article 50 of this Agreement for the location of a Telework site is temporarily waived.
2.	The requirement to report to the assigned POD at least two (2) days each pay period or, if the work location varies on a recurring basis, regularly perform work within the commuting area of the POD, is temporarily waived.
3.	Temporary hardship locations will not be outside of the United States (Puerto Rico is within the U.S.)
B.	The Employer may approve temporary hardship requests for various periods, up to one (1) year, depending on the specific circumstances of the hardship, subject to staffing and workload needs. Employees may seek to extend the temporary

(a)	the employee performed such higher graded duties at least at a level of skill and
responsibility properly expected;
(b)	the employee meets minimum OPM qualifications for the promotion to the next higher grade; and
(c)	the employee meets OPM requirements for promotion to the next higher grade.

63
ARTICLE 17
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
solicit for volunteers from interested and qualified employees possessing the necessary grade, skill level, and experience requirements for the detail from within the commuting area.
2.	If there are more qualified employees than there are positions to be filled, the most senior qualified employee, using IRS EOD, who bids on such a position shall be selected. Once an employee completes a rotational assignment, he or she will be placed at the bottom of the selection list.
3.	Details of employees will not be made in a manner which conflicts with the provisions of Article 14 or Article 22 of this Agreement.
B.	When the rotation of employees through higher graded positions has the effect that compensation at the higher grade is avoided, the Employer will comply with the provisions of IRM 6.335.
Section 5
Solicitation Procedures
A.	With the exception of subsection 5B, below, the solicitation procedures in this Section cover all details to bargaining unit positions at the same or lower grade exceeding sixty (60) days and all non-competitive temporary promotions and details to higher-graded positions to bargaining unit positions exceeding sixty (60) days, but no more than 120 days.
B.	The procedures of Article 14, Section 5, will be used to solicit for interest in details for seasonal employees who are in an organizational area in which employees with the necessary skills are being placed in a nonwork status and needed in another organizational area that is in the process of recalling or hiring seasonal employees.
C.	1. Solicitation for details and non-competitive temporary promotions, consistent with subsections 5D, 5E and 5F, below, will be accomplished by the Employer using electronic media including, but not limited to e-mail and electronic bulletin boards and/ or other appropriate means for employees without computers (e.g., memorandums, desk drops).

competitive temporary promotion of more than sixty (60) consecutive days becomes available, the Employer will solicit and consider volunteers in the following order: 1. Center Campus or commuting area (by Division first, then among all Divisions);
2.	Area, or its equivalent (by Division first, then among all Divisions); and
3.	Service-wide (all Divisions).
E.	Volunteers for details of more than sixty (60) consecutive days will be solicited from interested and qualified employees in the order set forth in subsection 5D, above. If there are too many volunteers, selection will be made in descending order using IRS EOD date, unless competitive procedures are used to identify the best qualified candidate.

Article 17 | Acceptable Level of Competence Determinations
Section 1
A.	The Employer has determined that acceptable level of competence determinations will be made as they become due by the employee's immediate supervisor as described in Article 12.
B.	Acceptable level of competence determinations will be made in a fair and objective manner and will be made only on the basis of the work requirements of the particular position or specific work standards as may have been established by the Employer for the position; provided, however, that a determination that an employee is not performing at an acceptable level of competence (that is, at a fully successful level) will not be used to dispose of questions of misconduct. In accordance with applicable law, an employee shall be advanced in pay to the next higher step of his or her grade upon meeting the following requirements:
1.	the employee must have completed the required waiting period;
64
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 18
2.	the employee must not have received an equivalent increase in pay during the required waiting period; and
3.	the employee's performance must be of an acceptable level of competence in each of the critical job elements of his or her position (that is, the employee's most recent performance appraisal is fully successful as provided in Article 12 of this Agreement).
Section 2
A.	If an employee has not been informed of the requirements for successful performance in his or her current position at least sixty (60) days in advance of the completion of the required waiting period, and has not been given a performance rating in any position within the ninety (90) days prior to the completion of the required waiting period, the acceptable level of competence determination will be postponed until sixty (60) days from the date on which the employee has been informed of his or her current critical job elements. If at the end of this period it is determined that the employee's work is at an acceptable level of competence, the within-grade increase shall be made retroactively to the beginning of the pay period following completion of the applicable waiting period consistent with 5 C.F.R. § 531.409(c).
B.	When a manager's review leads to the conclusion that an employee's work, is not at an acceptable level of competence the employee will be provided with the following in writing within a reasonable period of time, but never less than sixty (60) days before the employee will have completed the required waiting period:
1.	notice of the critical job element(s) in which the employee's work is less than fully successful;
2.	examples of less than fully successful performance on which the action is based;
3.	advice as to what the employee must do to bring performance up to the fully successful level;
4.	a statement that the employee's performance may be determined as being less than successful unless improvement to a fully successful level is shown; and
5.	a statement that the within-grade increase will be withheld unless the employee's work is at an acceptable level of competence by the end of the waiting period.
Section 3
A.	If the employee's performance becomes fully successful, the notice given as provided in Section 2 will be canceled. If the employee's performance is not at an acceptable level of competence, the Employer will notify the employee in writing that the within-grade increase will be withheld. The notice will include reasons for the action. The employee will also be advised
of the right and how to seek reconsideration of the action in accordance with 5 U.S.C. §§ 5335(c) and 9508(d)(2).
B.	If the within-grade increase due date has passed at the time the employee achieves an acceptable level of competence determination (i.e., a fully successful rating of record), and the employee has met other eligibility requirements, the within-grade increase will be effective on the first day of the first pay period after the acceptable determination has been made.
Section 4
A.	Neither the substantive nor the procedural aspects of this Article may be grieved until an acceptable level of competence determination is final. The acceptable level of competence determination will be considered final when a reconsideration decision is due or issued. A reconsideration decision shall be considered due thirty (30) days from the date of the Employer's receipt of an employee's written request for reconsideration. The grievance procedure will begin one (1) step above the reconsideration official. If the reconsideration official also represents the final step of the grievance procedure, the level of competence determination is appealable directly to arbitration. This Section will not apply, however, in cases where the grievance is based solely on nonperformance and/or non-merit reasons, e.g., an unfair labor practice or a prohibited personnel action.
B.	In the event an employee disagrees with the Employer's determination as to whether the employee has satisfied the within-grade waiting period, the employee may grieve the denial of the within-grade increase within fifteen (15) days of becoming aware of the Employer's determination.
Section 5
Any alleged violation which results in a new acceptable level of competence determination will provide for retroactivity of any pay increase, unless prohibited by applicable law or higher Agency regulation.
Section 6
In accordance with law, rule and regulation, the Employer will provide the Union with sanitized copies of written notices referenced in subsection 2B, above, any decision letters, and any reconsideration letters simultaneously with their issuance to employees.
Article 18 | Awards
Section 1
General
A. Performance Awards (that is monetary awards earned as a result of an employee's annual performance rating); Time Off Awards; Honorary; Suggestion; and Invention
65
ARTICLE 18
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
Awards; and Quality Step Increases (QSI) are granted by the Employer on the basis of merit, and within applicable budget limitations, to individuals or groups.
1.	Within the first month of each fiscal year, or within two weeks of when it receives its budget, whichever is later, the Employer will determine and inform the Union of the amount by which it will fund the bargaining unit performance awards pool for the performance year. The Employer has determined that it will distribute no less than one percent (1%) of total annual bargaining unit salary pursuant to the NTEU-IRS Contract Award program discussed below."Total annual bargaining unit salary" will be determined by the total prior fiscal year actual salary cost (base + locality) of bargaining unit employees, adjusted for subsequent increases in Government-wide civilian pay raise adjustments, if any. The Employer may reduce the initially announced amount only in response to a significant, unforeseen adverse event impacting the budget and occurring during the course of the year, subject to its obligation to bargain the impact and implementation of the reduction and grant parity with the highest nonbargaining unit employees awards pool consistent with the requirements in subsection 1A2, below.
2.	As an exception to the funding described in subsection 1 Al, if the Agency funds any of the two nonbargaining unit award pools (IR managers and nonsupervisory NBU) at an amount that exceeds the one percent (1 %) rate applicable to bargaining unit employees for the same fiscal performance year, the Employer will ensure parity between bargaining unit employees and nonbargaining unit employees such that the percentage of pay allocated for awards to bargaining unit employees will be equal to the percentage of pay allocated to awards for the highest nonbargaining unit award group for the same fiscal performance year. The percentage rates applicable to the overall bargaining unit and the nonbargaining unit groups will be calculated in the same manner as described in subsection 1A1, above.
3.	The bargaining unit awards funding will be allocated first to Bilingual Awards and other awards required to be paid under negotiated provisions. After this allocation, one hundred percent (100%) of the remaining funds will be distributed to bargaining unit employees' performance awards. With the exception of time off awards (granted consistent with subsections 4E and 4K below), Special Act and Manager Awards will not be granted.
4.	Should the Employer determine to reduce the budget for the bargaining unit award pool described in subsection 1A1, above, to less than 1% or to cancel bargaining unit awards altogether, either at the
beginning of the fiscal year or during the fiscal year consistent with Section 1A1, the following shall apply:
Bargaining: The Employer shall provide notice to the Union that the funding has been decreased or cancelled.The notice shall include a statement that the funding of the two non-bargaining unit awards groups has been reduced in the same amount or cancelled. Upon such notice, the Union may negotiate over the impact and implementation of the Employer's decision to decrease or cancel the awards budget. Such negotiations shall be concluded within thirty (30) days of the notice.
At the beginning of the bargaining period, the parties will contact the next available mediator/ fact-finder from the list compiled pursuant to Article 47, Section 2, to ensure his or her availability for the last full week of bargaining. If necessary to make a recommendation on the merits, the mediator/fact-finder will rule on assertions by the Union that the Employer failed to provide information requested for the negotiations pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7114(b)(4) or other procedural or substantive issues over which the mediator/fact-finder may have statutory authority.
If the parties fail to reach agreement by the end of the thirtieth (30th) day of bargaining and the mediationfactfinding process, or if either party rejects the nonbinding recommendation of the mediator/ factfinder, either party may pursue the matter using the statutory process (by filing a request for assistance with the Federal Service Impasses Panel).
5.	Consistent with applicable law, the Agency retains the flexibility to pay for performance awards either in the same fiscal year as the performance ratings of record upon which the awards were assigned to employees or within the first quarter of the following fiscal year, unless an unforeseen adverse event significantly impacts the Agency's obligation to pay awards in such time, or the parties fail to reach resolution of any bargaining pursuant to Section 1A4, above. In no event will payment be delayed beyond the end of the following fiscal year.
The Employer will provide the Union data on awards pools in Excel format at least ten (10) workdays before issuance of the awards reflecting the following individual information:
1.	A complete listing of all eligible bargaining unit members by name, which includes NTEU Chapter, award pool identification information, award status, award amount, time off hours, number of award shares earned, salary, grade, step, current annual salary rate (base + locality), award share value, award qualifying average CJE score, employee's average CJE score, rating, effective date, and time spent in a BU position.
66
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 18
2.	The following summary information: award pool ID code, NTEU Chapter and name; qualifying average critical job element score (cut-off score) for an award in that pool; award share value for that award pool; the number of eligible employees in the award pool; the number of those employees who received awards; the number of those employees C"’ who received awards in the award pool divided by the number of eligible employees in that D. award pool (this reflects the impact of ties for all employees having the qualifying average critical job element score).
3.	The Union will also receive an annual report on non-unit salaries for each non-unit award pool for the comparative period and award amounts for each non-unit award pool.
C. The fact that an employee is the subject of a conduct investigation or has been the subject of a disciplinary action during the rating period will not preclude a performance award that would otherwise be granted unless such preclusion is necessary to protect the integrity of the Service. The merits of the Employer's decision to withhold an award are subject to the negotiated grievance procedure.
Section 2
IRS-NTEU Contract Awards Program
A.	1. Awards granted under this section will be known as awards under the "IRS-NTEU National Performance Awards Agreement," and this designation will be noted on award certificates, as well as any other letters or memoranda given to employees in connection with these awards. If the Employer decides to issue letters, the appropriate NTEU Chapter President will be given the opportunity to co-sign the letters. Pursuant to that agreement, all employees who are otherwise eligible (including those with tied CJE scores) shall be granted a monetary award.	E.
2.	Subject to the prorating provisions of the NPAA, the minimum performance award is $500 the F. maximum performance award is $3500.
3.	Employees with an average CJE score lower than 3.4 will not be eligible for a performance award.
4.	Employees with fewer than twelve (12) continuous months on IRS rolls as of the last day of the last pay period that ends on or before June 30 are not eligible for a performance award.
5.	The parties agree that the NPAA, including addendums, as modified by but not inconsistent with this Agreement, will remain in force during the term of this Agreement.
B.	QSIs
1.	The Employer appreciates the importance of recognizing those employees who have consistently
performed in an outstanding manner through the maintenance of a quality step increase (QSI) program.
2.	The Employer may grant Quality Step Increases (QSI) to employees consistent with its discretionary authority under 5 C.F.R. § 531, Subpart E.
No employee with an overall rating of Minimally Successful or lower is eligible for a performance award.
For employees converted to a bargaining unit position as a result of a Unit Clarification Petition (UCP), the following will apply:
1.	If the employee was evaluated using CJEs on the NBU position, the employee will continue to receive annual appraisals consistent with Exhibits 12-1 or 12-2 of this Agreement and awards with the NPAA.
2.	If the employee was not evaluated using CJEs, and received appraisals on an annual rating period starting on October 1 each year, the employee will receive a BU performance award as follows:
(a)	In the award year of the conversion, if the employee does not receive a rating of record prior to the cut-off date for bargaining unit awards, has worked at least sixty (60) days on the bargaining unit position and is otherwise eligible; the employee will receive a performance award. In this case, the supervisor or designee will issue an ad hoc appraisal to determine award eligibility and the award will not be prorated.
(b)	If the employee receives a rating of record that qualifies for a performance award prior to the award cut-off date and is otherwise eligible, the award will not be prorated.
3.	Funding for the additional award amounts will be drawn from the allocation for performance awards consistent with subsection 1 A3 above.
The Employer will advise the Union in advance if the Employer elects to hold an official award ceremony.
For employees who will otherwise be receiving an award under the NPAA and who meet one of the criteria below, the Employer will calculate their performance award at the grade level of the higher graded duties performed by the employee.
1.	The employee was not eligible for a temporary promotion, but performed higher-graded work for twenty-five percent (25%) or more of his or her direct time for at least four (4) consecutive months during the rating period; or

ARTICLE 18
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
days during the remainder of the rating period. Employees are encouraged to notify their supervisor if they know that they performed higher-graded duties during their rating period, indicate what percentage of their direct time was at the higher grade and note the grade level of that work they believe is proper.
Employees are encouraged to notify their supervisor if they know that they performed higher-graded duties during their rating period, indicate what percentage of C. their direct time was at the higher grade and note the grade level of that work they believe is proper.
Section 3
Other Awards
A.	Other awards will be made by the Employer in accordance	D.
with the provisions of IRM 6.451.1., unless modified by the provisions of this Article, subject to the restrictions in Section 1 A3, above.
B.	Managers are encouraged to utilize the provisions of IRM 6.451.1 to motivate and reward employees.
C.	The Employer and the Union agree that employees' suggestions to improve work processes and working conditions provide a valuable and unique source of E-ideas which can greatly increase the efficiency of the Service and/or employee morale. In accordance with the Parties'2001 Suggestion Program Memorandum of Understanding and applicable law, rule and regulation, F. an employee who has a suggestion adopted by the Employer will receive twenty-five percent (25%) of the tangible first-year savings resulting from that suggestion, as well as additional monetary and nonmonetary benefits, as provided by the memorandum of g. understanding. NTEU at the national level will be sent quarterly reports showing the date a suggestion was submitted, the name of the suggesting employee, the organizational unit to whom the employee is assigned, and a designation of a case as overage.
D.	Non-monetary awards will be given to employees at the option of supervisors consistent with the policies established by the Employer.
Section 4
Time Off As Incentive Award
A.	The purpose of the IRS/NTEU Time Off Award is to increase employee productivity and creativity by rewarding their contributions to the quality, efficiency, or economy of Government operations. The award is j also intended to increase the quality of work life for all employees, as well as encourage and recognize one-time, non-recurring accomplishments above or beyond normal job requirements.
B.	It is within the Employer's sole discretion to offer time off in lieu ofcash to an employee. The Employer agrees K
to grant time off to bargaining unit employees on the basis of their performance, in a fair, consistent, and objective manner without discrimination. However, where an employee requests time off in lieu of an award, the Employer will normally grant the request absent workload demands. If granted, the scheduling and use of time off shall be subject to the same approval process as is used for annual leave as set forth in Article 32 of this Agreement.
A Time Off Award (TOA) provides an employee with an excused absence without charge to leave or loss of pay. All bargaining unit employees shall be eligible for such TOAs unless the employee is or was on a leave restriction letter within the (12) months prior to the effective date of the award.
During any single leave year, employees may be granted up to the average total number of hours that such an employee works during a biweekly scheduled tour of duty. For example, a full time employee is eligible for a total of eighty (80) hours of time off; and a part-time employee working an average biweekly schedule of sixty-four (64) hours is eligible for a total of sixty-four (64) hours of time off.
To encourage the use ofTOAs for timely recognition of an employee's contribution, the Employer has determined that supervisors may grant up to eight (8) hours of time off without higher level review or approval.
The minimum amount of time off for any contribution shall be one (1) hour.The maximum TOA for any single contribution shall be forty (40) hours for a full time employee. A part-time employee will be granted a TOA not to exceed his or her weekly work schedule.
ATOA may be used in single blocks of time or in one (1) hour increments, subject to approval by the Employer. A TOA must be scheduled and used within one (1) year from the effective date of the award or it will be forfeited. TOAs should be scheduled so as not to conflict with use of "use or lose" annual leave. When physical incapacitation for duty occurs during a period of time when an employee is using his/her TOA, sick leave will be granted for the period of incapacitation and theTOA will be scheduled at another time.
TOAs in this subsection can be granted for any type of monetary award provided for in this Article. The value of any such accomplishment must exceed the cost of labor and the value of work which would have been performed during the employee's absence.
Time off under this provision shall be calculated by dividing the employee's hourly rate, to the nearest dollar, into the recommended award amount and rounding-off to the nearest whole hour provided that the time does not exceed the maximum time allowed for a given contribution per subsection 4F.
The monetary equivalent of the TOA (as determined solely by the hourly wage of the employee during
68
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 19
the time off) will be charged back to the appropriate awards budget where the employee elects time off in lieu of a performance award. In all other instances, the value of a time off award will not be charged to the awards budget.
L. The receipt of a TOA does not prevent an employee from receiving any other Cash or Incentive Award and receiving prior Cash or Incentive Awards does not prevent granting a TOA.
Section 5
Bilingual Awards
A.	Employees, who on a regular basis, rather than occasionally:
1.	utilize their bilingual skills;
2.	whose performance is currently rated at least fully successful; and
3.	who are not otherwise compensated through a Performance Award or Superior Accomplishment Award based on the use of their bilingual skill shall receive a Special Act Award of $350.
4.	Employees will be eligible to receive one (1) such award per calendar year.
B.	The Employer has determined that Bilingual Awards shall be paid out of the performance awards budget established by the Employer in accordance with subsection 1 A3 above. The provisions of subsection 5A, above, shall terminate upon approval and implementation of a Foreign Language Proficiency Pay Demonstration Project, including any negotiations required by law.
Section 6
Except as specifically provided for above, the Agency may not change the Awards program without first providing notice to and bargaining with the Union to the extent required by law.

C.	For the purposes of this Article, directly impacted employees are those employees;
1.	who occupy positions that are identified by the Business Unit as affected by an approved realignment or reorganization (i.e., the position is being abolished, or the position is in the same grade, series and competitive level as the position being abolished in the competitive area);
2.	whose positions are included in a competitive sourcing study; or
3.	who are identified in the RIF simulation described in subsection 3D3 for downgrade or separation in a RIF.
D.	All RIFs will be accomplished by the Employer in accordance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and this Agreement.
Section 2
Pre-Decisional Input
A.	At least fifteen (15) days before the Agency provides formal notice of a RIF to the Union, the Employer shall inform the NTEU National President in writing that it has made a preliminary determination to conduct a RIF.

Section 3
Thirty (30) Day Notice Period and RIF Simulation
A.	Subject to the provisions of Section 12, no later than twelve (12) months in advance of the off-rolls date for any RIF, the Employer shall provide the Union with formal notice that the Service has determined that a RIF is necessary. This notice shall comply with statutory notice requirements and include any reorganization associated with the RIF and the following information: 1. the applicable competitive area(s), approximate numbers, types, and geographic locations of the positions affected, and the anticipated effective date;
2.	projections with an analysis of the number of employees that will likely be separated; and
3.	the information relied upon by the Employer and a description of the reorganization associated with the RIF, including all related reports/analysis.
B.	During the thirty (30) day notice period, the Agency shall inform the Union whether there are any employees in the competitive area(s) undergoing a RIF with ratings of record under other than a five (5) summary level system. If there are such employees, the Agency shall provide the Union with its proposed conversion formulas. The Union will have ten (10) days from the date on which it receives the conversion formula to propose alternatives. The parties will thereafter agree to the conversion formula to be applied in the RIF within ten (10) days of receipt of the Union's suggested alternatives. If no agreement is reached within the ten (10) day period, the parties will resolve the dispute following the process contained in Article 15, Section 3.
C.	Within ten (10) days of receiving notice, the Union may request and receive a briefing on the proposed RIF and any reorganization associated with the RIF.
D.	1. At the time it provides notice to the Union, the Employer will initiate employee records validation pursuant to Section 7 of this Article. It will also initiate the employee briefings described in Section 8.
2.	Employees may request to review their Official Personnel Folder (OPF) or Employee Performance Folder (EPF) consistent with Article 7 of this Agreement.
3.	The Employer agrees that it will complete records validation and employee briefings no later than sixty (60) days after the notice date. As soon as the records validation has been completed, the Employer will conduct a RIF simulation which will identify those employees who would likely be downgraded or separated if the Employer
conducted a RIF at that time. The RIF simulation will be completed within fifteen (15) days of the end of the records validation and the results given to the Union at that time. No later than five (5) days thereafter, employees who are identified in the RIF simulation as likely to be downgraded or separated will be apprised in writing that they are "directly impacted employees." Employees determined to be "directly impacted" in the RIF simulation who previously did not hold that status will be entitled to the mitigation strategies established by this Article.
4.	Consistent with the Privacy Act, the Employer will, within five (5) workdays, make available to the Union the results of the RIF simulation. The results will show the positions into which employees will bump or retreat.
5.	A RIF simulation will not be required if all positions in the competitive area are being abolished.
E.	In any RIF, the Employer will, subject to the Privacy Act, provide National NTEU with relevant EEO data for directly impacted employees as defined in subsection 1C3 above. The data will be provided to National NTEU within ten (10) workdays of the date of the RIF simulation.The data will include race, age (over/under forty (40) years), national origin, gender and disability status of directly impacted employees. Within twenty (20) days of receipt, National NTEU will provide the results to the Employer of any adverse impact studies conducted utilizing the data.The Employer will consider the information provided by National NTEU.
Section 4
Expedited Bargaining
A.	The parties agree to expedited bargaining beginning thirty (30) days after providing the RIF notice to the Union and continuing for ninety (90) days.
B.	Bargaining will be limited to those matters not expressly addressed in this Article or that are specifically reserved for bargaining by this Article. By permissive mutual agreement, however, the parties can change any terms of this Agreement in those expedited negotiations. If the notice provided by the Employer does not meet the specificity requirements of law, the expedited bargaining period will be tolled until the Employer satisfies said specificity requirements. If the Union asserts that the notice provided by the Employer fails to meet the statutory notice requirements, it will notify the Agency of its determination in writing within seven (7) days of receiving the notice and explain the basis for the assertion. This notice will be given within twenty-four (24) hours where the announcement is related to A-76 or budget emergencies.

If needed, the timeline listed above for expedited bargaining will be modified to allow time for the Employer to give the Union the data and the Union to make appropriate adjustments in its proposals.The time should not be extended more than thirty (30) days after the Employer has responded to the Union's initial request.
E.	Impasse
If an agreement is not reached at the end of expedited bargaining, the parties agree to employ the services of a third-party neutral who will assist the parties to resolve the impasse. If no resolution is reached, the neutral will issue a recommended finding. If either party is dissatisfied with the Factfinder's recommendation, it may pursue the dispute through the statutory process. If the Employer has provided all of the mitigation strategies set forth herein in accordance with this Agreement, and the impasse is not resolved by the time Certificate of Expected Separation (CES) letters or RIF notices are to be issued to employees (six (6) months in advance of the effective date of the RIF unless the provisions of Section 12 apply), the Employer may move forward with the RIF. In no circumstances will the Employer delay the issuance of CES letters or RIF notices to employees prior to the effective date of the RIF.
Section 5
Mitigation Strategies
For each RIF, the Employer agrees to implement the following mitigation strategies at the time the Employer gives NTEU notice of a RIF, or thereafter, as required by this Article.
A. Reassignment Preference Notice (RPN)
1.	The Employer will provide Reassignment Preference Notices (RPN) to directly impacted employees in accordance with Exhibit 19-2. The RPN will entitle directly impacted employees to priority selection for vacant positions for which they apply and qualify either at their same or lower grade Servicewide (i.e., both within and outside the employee's commuting area).
2.	Under the reassignment preference process, a vacancy is defined as any position the Agency is filling regardless of whether a vacancy announcement is issued unless one (1) of the exceptions identified in 5 C.F.R. § 330.609 exists.
3.	Upon providing notice to the Union in accordance with Section 3, the Agency will provide RPNs to those employees who occupy positions to be abolished or occupy positions in the same grade, series and competitive level as a position being abolished in the competitive area. Once the RIF simulation is completed, the Agency will provide RPNs to any employees identified as likely to be downgraded or separated in the RIF who have not otherwise been provided with an RPN.
4.	RPNs will be rescinded when the employee meets one of the criteria outlined in Exhibit 19-2.
VERA and VSIP
1.	The Employer shall make every effort to obtain VERA/VSIP authority from OPM for any RIF action under this Article. Subject to the approval of VERA/ VSIP authority by OPM, the Employer will make VERA and VSIP available as a mitigation strategy in accordance with IRS policy found in Exhibit 19-4. In each RIF, the Employer will make every effort to obtain OPM approval for direct VERA/VSIP.
2.	In circumstances where the Employer determines that an employee, whose direct buyout application has been approved and is still temporarily needed on the job because of special workload requirements, the employee will be informed that the direct buyout has been approved.The employee's off rolls date will be temporarily delayed and will be advised of the date on which the buyout will be effective.
Voluntary Incentives Through Job Swaps
1.	In the event the Employer has obtained VERA/VSIP authority, VERA/VSIP will be made available as a mitigation strategy via the vehicle of "job swaps." In the event of a RIF, the parties agree to modify the provisions of Article 15, Section 7 so that directly impacted employees will be permitted to swap jobs into other occupied positions, either inside or outside of the commuting area, so long as:
(a)	the swapping employee is at least fully successful; and
(b)	occupies a position at the same grade as the directly impacted employee; and,
71
ARTICLE 19
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
(c) the directly impacted employee is at least fully successful, qualified for the position occupied by the swapping employee, can perform the duties of that position with little or no formal training (e.g. refresher training) and with only minimal on the job instruction.
2.	For job swaps outside of the commuting area, both the impacted and the swapping employee will be assigned to their new POD. The Employer will inform the employee receiving the buyout F. that the employee's pay and tax obligations will be based on the POD subject to the RIF.
3.	Job swaps will be permitted into the competitive area undergoing a RIF in conjunction with each open direct VERA/VSIP window if there are still directly impacted employees within that competitive area. Employees swapping positions with a directly impacted employee & must do so only for the purposes of retiring or resigning with VERA and/or VSIP and must meet minimum qualifications for the position. If the proposed RIF will eliminate all positions in the competitive area, the swapping employee may choose to retire or resign with VERA and/or VSIP or be separated in the RIF process and receive severance pay.
4.	Any swapping employee who meets the eligibility requirements for VERA and accepts VSIP will be authorized VERA retirement.
5.	The Employer will not be responsible for relocation costs for any approved job swaps.
6.	To facilitate job swaps, the Employer will establish an electronic bulletin board for use by employees interested in job swaps.
(a)	Access to the electronic bulletin board will be available to facilitate job swaps.
(b)	Employees must access the bulletin board on their own time or employees may request time as described in Exhibit 19-3.
D.	Outplacement Service

Additional outplacement services and training for directly impacted employees may be negotiated by the parties during the expedited bargaining process. Vacancy announcements will be posted on www.USAJobs.gov.
E.	Relocation to “Follow Your Work”
The Employer has determined that it will offer to those directly impacted employees, who occupy positions to be abolished or who occupy a position in the same series and grade as a position being abolished, the opportunity to voluntarily relocate and be realigned
to a vacant position in a continuing site to perform the work that the employee is currently performing so long as there are no employees with superior placement rights under Article 13, subsection 2E of this Agreement. Moving expenses for such relocations will not be authorized. Should the Agency receive Voluntary Relocation Incentives (VRI) authority, such incentives will be authorized in accordance with IRS policy.
Part-Time and Job Sharing Opportunities
1.	The Employer will offer job sharing and part-time opportunities consistent with Article 22, Section 3 of this Agreement.

1.	Grade and pay retention will be granted in accordance with applicable law, regulation and this Agreement. For example:
(a)	In accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 536.202, directly impacted employees who voluntarily apply and are selected for a position not more than
72
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 19
three (3) grade levels or three (3) grade intervals below their position of record will receive grade and pay retention if the employee otherwise meets all regulatory requirements (e.g., if immediately before being placed in the lower grade, the employee has served for at least fifty-two (52) consecutive weeks in a position(s) at one or more grades higher than the lower grade). Employees who do not meet the regulatory requirements for grade retention will receive pay retention.
(b)	Employees who are selected for positions more than three (3) grade levels or three (3) grade intervals below their position of record will have their salary set using highest previous rate.

Prior to assigning a seasonal employee to work outside the identified season in his or her seasonal work agreement, the Employer will follow the procedures in Article 14, subsections 3A and 3C of this Agreement. The Employer has determined that if a replacement possessing the necessary skills is available and willing to work, an employee who volunteers to be released will be placed in non-work status or an employee who turns down a request for recall will remain in non-work status. The Employer will issue an amended seasonal agreement to an employee assigned work outside the identified season in his or her seasonal work agreement. Copies of amended seasonal agreements will be provided to the appropriate Chapter upon request.
H.	1. The Employer has determined that, to the maximum extent possible, and in an effort to maintain health insurance eligibility for as many seasonal employees as possible, it will assign seasonal employees who would otherwise be subject to release, and who may otherwise lose their health insurance eligibility, to other work within the Division for which they meet the minimum qualification requirements. For seasonal and intermittent employees who do not meet the minimum qualification requirements of a particular position, but are capable of doing the work, the Employer will waive the minimum qualification requirements for such positions. The waiver of minimum qualification requirements may not include any positive education requirements.

ARTICLE 23
1.	Earning Credit Hours
(a)	An employee may, with prior approval by the Employer, work additional time to earn credit hours at a POD, a Telework site or any other location approved by the Employer. The employee's request to work credit hours will be approved if management determines that appropriate work is assigned, necessary and available and if it determines that the performance of such work at the time requested is not rendered inappropriate based on logistical, safety and/or other factors such as availability of seating, security, utilities or supervision. Management's determination to grant or deny an employee's request to work credit hours will be communicated in writing or by e-mail, prior to the time of the credit hours requested and will state the reason for any denial.
(b)	Whenever deemed appropriate by the Employer, a written understanding between an employee and his or her supervisor, defining circumstances when working credit hours are appropriate, will constitute prior approval under this subsection. For example, a manager and employee may agree that the employee may work credit hours whenever a field visit extends past the TOD of the employee.
(c)	Other than employees on Maxiflex schedules, employees will be allowed to earn a maximum of three (3) credit hours per regularly scheduled workday and up to ten (10) credit hours on regular non-workdays (e.g., Saturday and Sunday for a Monday to Friday workweek). Federal holidays are considered regular nonworkdays for the purpose of earning credit hours. Subject to prior approval by the Employer and established flexible time bands, credit hours may be earned at the beginning of the shift, the end of shift, or split between the beginning and end of the shift.
(d)	If approved, credit hours must be earned within flexible time bands, (e.g., an employee may earn one at the end of the workday and two more later that day at a site approved by the supervisor). If approved by the Employer, and when necessary, the applicable flexible time band will be temporarily extended to permit the earning of credit hours.
(e)	Credit hours will be earned and used in fifteen (15) minute increments.
(f)	A maximum of twenty-four (24) credit hours may be carried forward from pay period to pay
period, for full-time employees. In accordance with law, part-time employees may carry forward a maximum of one-fourth (1/4) of the hours in the employee's biweekly workweek.
2.	Using Credit Hours
(a)	The credit hours earned may be used at the election of the employee, and with prior approval by the Employer, to vary the length of a workday or workweek. Supervisors shall make reasonable efforts to grant employee requests for using credit hours consistent with workload and staffing needs. Upon request by the employee, the Employer will provide a written explanation for denying the use of credit hours within two (2) workdays.
(b)	Credit hours must be earned prior to being used. Subject to prior approval from the Employer, credit hours may be earned and used on the same day. Additionally, credit hours may be used in place of or in combination with other types of leave if the use of credit hours or the other types of leave is approved in advance by the Employer.
(c)	In cases where an employee has worked approved credit hours before his or her normal tour of duty and has subsequently been released on administrative leave due to the office closing during that day, the credit hours will be preserved.
(d)	Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 6126, in the event that an employee leaves the Department of the Treasury or is no longer assigned to a work schedule that allows credit hours, the Employer will compensate the employee for any unused credit hours.

(b) For voting purposes as described in Article 36, Section 2, employees on a gliding schedule will notify their managers at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the actual voting day as to what their start time will be on the voting day.
C.	Maxiflex Flexible Work Schedule
Maxiflex is a type of flexible work schedule that contains required core hours on less than ten (10) workdays within a biweekly pay period. A full-time employee has a basic work requirement of eighty (80) hours in a biweekly pay period.

However, once initial formal training is successfully completed, and if not prevented by the schedule for on-the-job instruction (OJI), the employee may begin an AWS if requested and approved by the Employer.
B.	Requests for a New or Modified AWS
Employees may request AWS and/or a change in start time at any time by submitting the form found in Exhibit 23-6 to this Agreement to their supervisor.The form will also allow employees to list prioritized choices if their
86
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 23
first choice is not available. Forms will be processed in accordance with AWS Exhibits 23-1 through 23-4.
1.	Employees Covered by the AWS Groupings Exhibits 23-1 through 23-4
The Employer will maintain a list of employees interested in AWS and/or change in start time and add employees to the list as the form in Exhibit 23-6 is received.
(a)	The Employer will periodically fill vacant and available AWS slots and consider requests for changes to start times from a consolidated list of interested employees consistent with the procedures in Exhibits 23-1 through 23-4 and subsection 6C below. For positions covered in Exhibit 23-1, requests to fill a vacant and available AWS slot will be considered outside the semi-annual process. The decision of whether to grant the request will be based upon management's consideration of the criteria set forth in Exhibit 23-1, subsections 6 A-E. However, denial of requests that are made outside of the semi-annual period may not be grieved.
(b)	Upon request, the Employer will provide a listing of available schedules to impacted Chapters.
(c)	In the case of too many requests for a vacant and available AWS and/or start times, the tie will be broken first by IRS EOD, second by SCD and third by comparing the last four (4) digits of the tied employees'social security numbers. In odd numbered years, employees with the lowest e. number will receive the AWS. The opposite will hold true in even numbered years.
(d)	Employees will be informed as soon as practicable, but not later than two (2) pay periods of consideration for a vacant and available AWS and/or change in start time, if their request is approved or disapproved.
2.	All Other Employees
Employees covered by subsection 4B, above, will be considered for vacant and available AWS and/ or changes to start times on an ongoing basis consistent with subsection 6C below. Employees will be informed as soon as practicable, but no later than two (2) pay periods of receipt of the application form in Exhibit 23-6 for a vacant and available AWS and/or change in start time if their F. request is approved or disapproved.
C. Approval of a New or Modified AWS
1.	For any compressed or flexible work schedule under this Agreement, an employee's work schedule request (including start and stop times)
will be approved consistent with the terms of Exhibits 23-1 through 23-4 unless the request would cause any of the following at the level where the AWS is approved (e.g., team, department, territory, executive):
(a)	diminished level of services;
(b)	insufficient coverage; or
(c)	increased cost.
2.	Upon request, the Employer will provide the employee with a written explanation for the disapproval of AWS and/or a change in start time.

4.	If seating constraints (e.g., shift operations where employees share desks) limit the number of AWS slots, the Employer will notify the impacted Chapter(s). As part of the notification, the Employer will provide necessary information regarding the seating constraints. To resolve the issue, the local parties will discuss the implementation of mutually agreeable solutions to the seating constraints in an effort to maximize the number of AWS slots. The Employer will consider the recommendations from the Union and inform the Union of its final decision in writing prior to limiting available AWS slots.
Effective Date

2.	After two (2) pay periods, if their previous schedule is not available, the employee must apply for a change to AWS under the procedures in this Section or may move to non-AWS (5/8 schedule) on their current shift with the same start time as their AWS. If a 5/8 schedule is not available with the start time as the employee's AWS, then the employee will return to a TOD on their current shift with the closest start time to the employees current work schedule.
Voluntary Requests for Temporary Changes to AWS
Prior to the beginning of a pay period, an employee who is on a flexible or compressed work schedule may request to make a temporary change to their current AWS for the next pay period. Such requests may not
87
ARTICLE 23

If a decision is made to temporarily remove the employee from AWS, the temporary removal will not normally exceed three (3) months unless the Employer decides a longer p period of time is appropriate. At the end of this period of time, employees temporarily removed from AWS will be returned to their previous AWS.
C.	If the Employer has sufficient evidence of serious wrongdoing that would impact the integrity of the AWS program, the employee may be immediately suspended from AWS pending resolution of the conduct investigation. If the wrongdoing is upheld by the
deciding official, the AWS may be terminated and the employee may not reapply for a period of one (1) year.

The Employer may require temporary changes to start or stop times and to flexible and compressed work schedules due to exigent circumstances (e.g., unexpected significant changes to filing patterns, Congressional mandates such as a stimulus package).
1.	The Employer will consider using overtime or compensatory time, as appropriate, to meet temporary staffing shortages prior to requiring involuntary changes to AWS and start or stop times.
2.	The Employer has determined that temporary involuntary changes to an employee's AWS and start or stop times will not exceed a total of eight (8) weeks in a calendar year.
3.	Prior to requiring a temporary involuntary change to AWS or start or stop times, the Employer will solicit for volunteers from among equally qualified employees as determined by the Employer.
4.	If an insufficient number of qualified employees volunteer, the least senior employees will be selected in IRS EOD order. In the case of ties, SCD will be used as the next tie breaker followed by a comparison of the last four (4) digits of the tied employee's social security numbers. In odd numbered years, employees with the lowest number will be selected. The opposite will hold true in even numbered years.
5.	The Employer has determined that any temporary involuntary changes to AWS or start and stop times will not be required on a frequent basis and will not be made for periods of less than two (2) weeks.
6.	For temporary involuntary changes to AWS or start and stop times, the Employer will normally provide the employee with five (5) workdays notice.
7.	The Employer will consider hardship requests on a case-by-case basis and will approve such requests to the extent permitted by workload.
Involuntary Permanent Changes to AWS and Start Times or Stop Times
If the Employer decides to alter the mix of work schedules by reducing the available AWS, start and stop times, noncore days or regular days off (RDOs), the Employer will notify National NTEU and bargain to the extent required by law prior to altering the mix of work schedules by reducing the available AWS, start and stop times, noncore days or RDOs. Any bargaining

Employees in travel or in training or on detail will adhere to the tour of duty required by the training, travel or detail. Employees attending training and on-the-job instructors or trainers will remain on their AWS unless a temporary change in their AWS (e.g., start time or RDO) is necessitated by training needs or the training schedule.
B.	For employees approved for AWS and staggered work schedules, adherence to those work schedules will be tracked in SETR (or successor system) by the Employer. Employees on a gliding schedule must notify their supervisor of their start time either prior to the start of their tour of duty or within fifteen (15) minutes after they have commenced working. Such notice may be communicated electronically (via email, telephone or Outlook calendar) or in person. Employees may also provide notice in advance of their start time for the entire week through the Outlook calendar. Where the local parties have established a notification method for employees on a gliding schedule that differs from the methods set forth in this Section, the local method of notice may continue only upon the mutual agreement of the local parties. If the local parties do not agree, such a notification method is terminated.
C.	Employees Changing Positions
1.	Employees permanently changing positions or temporarily changing positions as a result of a temporary promotion or detail will be subject to the AWS rules covering the new or temporary position in Exhibits 23-1 through 23-4 or subsection 4B above.
2.	Employees temporarily changing positions as a result of a temporary promotion or detail will be returned to the work schedule of their permanently held position once the temporary assignment ends.
D.	Reasonable Accommodation
AWS provided to employees as a reasonable accommodation will not be subtracted from the number of slots allocated for AWS.
E.	Seasonal Employees
The Employer has determined that seasonal employees will retain the same AWS each time they are recalled from non-work status, consistent with this Article.
F.	Dispute Resolution
Disputes arising under this Article regarding AWS will be resolved pursuant to Article 41, subsection 4A of this Agreement.
Section 9
Special Tours of Duty
Upon an employee's request, the Employer will, subject to workload requirements, establish a special tour of duty (e.g., a split shift) for educational purposes, including courses approved under the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Section 10
Religious Observances
A.	An employee whose personal religious beliefs require the abstention from work during certain periods of time, including a religious observance connected with a death in the immediate family, may elect to engage in compensatory overtime work for time lost, without charge to leave, for meeting those religious requirements. Such requests will be granted unless:
1.	an employee's presence on a job at the time in question is deemed necessary; or
2.	no reasonable opportunities are foreseen within a reasonable period of time (generally one hundred twenty (120) days) during which the employee will be able to repay the compensatory time. Reasonable opportunities include the Employer's effort to first assign that work regularly assigned to the affected employee as well as work not normally assigned, provided the employee is otherwise qualified to perform such work; however, the Parties agree that the following are types of situations envisioned above:
(a)	the work is such that productive work is not available on what is normally non-duty time; or
(b)	significant security, utility, rental or other costs would be incurred if work at normal non-duty times was permitted.
B.	Compensatory time off will be granted in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10A, above, and subsections 10D2 and 10D3, below, when an employee's personal religious beliefs require that the employee abstain from work during certain periods of the workday or workweek. The time off includes adjustments to the hours of work as necessary to recognize the employee's religious practices or requirements, including time to arrive at work late or leave work early.
C.	Employees must notify their supervisors in writing of a desire to take compensatory time off for a religious observance, and obtain prior approval. Employees may email the request to their supervisor or utilize Form 14451 to notify their supervisor. Notification should take place not less than fifteen (15) days in
89
ARTICLE 24
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
advance whenever possible, and will include the following information:
1.	The description of the religious observance for which absence is being requested;
2.	Date(s) and time(s) the employee must abstain from work on account of the religious observance; and
3.	The date(s) and time(s) the employee plans to perform overtime work to earn religious compensatory time off or to make up for the absence (Repayment Plan).
D.	1. Compensatory overtime may be worked either prior to or after the religious observance in fifteen (15) minute increments. An employee is entitled to take compensatory time off in fifteen (15) minute increments. Such increments may be accumulated in order for an employee to take compensatory time off in segments of one (1) hour or more.
2.	An employee will be allowed to accumulate only the number of hours of religious compensatory time needed to repay previous or anticipated future absences from work for religious observances. For such purposes, no more than eighty (80) hours of RCT may be accumulated unless special circumstances are present.
3.	Employees with religious compensatory time balances exceeding eighty (80) hours on the effective date of this Agreement may not earn more religious compensatory time until their balances fall below eighty (80) hours and the conditions in subsection 10D2, above, are met.
E.	1. A grant of compensatory time off will be repaid by the appropriate amount of compensatory overtime work, in increments of at least fifteen (15) minutes, within a reasonable amount of time (generally 120 days).
2.	If the compensatory time is not repaid within the specified time period in the plan, the time outstanding will be converted to annual leave or LWOP, as appropriate. The Employer will extend the time to repay if the failure to comply with the repayment plan was through no fault of the employee.
3.	Advanced religious compensatory time will be considered indebtedness to the Employer if the employee separates without repaying the advanced time and will be withheld from any final payments to the separating employee.
F.	Employees who take advanced compensatory time off for religious observances may subsequently charge that time to annual leave. However, employees who take annual leave or leave without pay for religious holidays may not subsequently change that to compensatory time off.
Section 11
Shifts
A.	The Employer will solicit requests from eligible employees who are interested in changing shifts (day, swing and night) and maintain a list of such employees from which future vacancies will be filled. Employees may submit interest statements at any time and will be considered. The Employer has determined that it will grant requests for assignments to shift vacancies on the following basis:
1.	the employee must be qualified for the vacant position;
2.	the employee does not require more than minimal training to assume the position on the other shift; and
3.	the employee has served on their present shift for more than one (1) complete year (or season, if a seasonal employee).
B.	1. Employees who have been assigned to their present shifts for the longest period shall be assigned first if there are more applicants than positions. Any ties will be broken by IRS enter on duty (EOD) date.
2.	If management will otherwise fill the vacancy on the preferred shift with someone outside IRS, a unit employee, meeting the criteria in subsection 11 A, above, will be selected over that candidate.
C.	The provisions of 11A and 11B, above, do not apply to employees on rotating shifts.
Section 12
Involuntary Reductions
Except in instances where it is a documented condition of employment, any involuntary reduction in an employee's hours of work will entitle that employee to appropriate adverse action rights and benefits.
Section 13
Nothing in this Article shall restrict the Employer's right to assign work or employees pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a).
Article 24 | Overtime
Section 1
A.	Employees who are required by the Employer to work overtime will be compensated in accordance with applicable law and regulations. While the Employer reserves the right to provide employees notice that no overtime work may be performed by either Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exempt or non-exempt employees, nothing in this Article precludes or impairs FLSA exempt employees from filing a claim for ordered or approved overtime or FLSA non-exempt employees from filing a
90
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 24
claim for "suffered or permitted" overtime or any other overtime that employees are entitled by law.
B.	For example, if a non-exempt employee performed work for the benefit of the IRS, the supervisor knew or had reason to believe that the work was being performed, and the supervisor had an opportunity to prevent the work from being performed, the work may be considered "suffered or permitted"and be compensable.
C.	Non-exempt employees entitled to elect either overtime pay or compensatory time under applicable law may not be compelled to accept compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay for required overtime work. When offering voluntary overtime, however, the Employer is permitted to offer non-exempt employees the choice of either earning compensatory time only for the overtime hours worked or electing not to work the overtime hours.
Section 2
A.	Qualifications
1.	Overtime will be distributed as equitably as possible among equally qualified employees based on the skills needed to perform the overtime work as identified by the Employer. When overtime becomes available, the Employer will contact the impacted Chapter(s) and provide the qualifications and skills identified and general information regarding the overtime, including the anticipated number of hours and the days the overtime will be worked.
2.	At the time the Employer contacts the impacted Chapter(s), either local party may notify the other that it is opening discussions to mutually agree to a process that satisfies the equitable distribution requirements in subsection 2A1 above. If the local parties are unable to reach agreement on an equitable process, the Employer will offer or direct overtime consistent with this Article.
B.	Voluntary Offers of Overtime
The Employer has determined that if a decision is made to offer overtime in a work area where seasonal employees are in a non-work status within the season designated in the Seasonal Work Agreement the Employer will first, consistent with Section 3, below, recall seasonal employees. After following the process in Section 3, and absent local agreement pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2A2, above, the Employer will use the procedures below to offer voluntary overtime. The procedures in this subsection satisfy the equitable distribution requirement in subsection 2A1 above.
1.	First consideration for overtime will be given to those employees in a work status whose permanent position of record is in the work area where overtime is being offered, including employees whose permanent position of record is in the work area
in which overtime is being offered, but who are currently on a detail or temporary promotion outside of the work area and may be released from that area for the overtime.
2.	If there are an insufficient number of volunteers, the Employer may elect to offer overtime to employees who are on temporary promotion or detail into the work area where overtime is being offered and who are performing the work for which overtime is being offered.
3.	If there are an insufficient number of volunteers, the Employer may elect to offer overtime to employees from outside the work area.
4.	Once the Employer identifies qualified employees in subsections 2B1, and if necessary, 2B2 and 2B3, the overtime will be offered to employees in equal amounts so long as the number of overtime hours equals or exceeds two (2) hours per employee.
5.	If there are too many volunteers, employees will be selected for the overtime assignment in IRS Entry on Duty (EOD) order. Any ties will be broken first by Service Computation Date (SCD), and then by comparing the last four (4) digits of the tied employees' social security number. In odd numbered years, employees with the lowest number will be selected first. The opposite will hold true in even numbered years.
6.	If otherwise eligible, full-time Union stewards who meet the subsection 2A and 2B criteria may work overtime that is offered outside of their normal tour of duty.
C.	Directed Overtime
1.	If there are insufficient volunteers using the process in subsection 2B, above, and the Employer determines overtime is still required, overtime will be directed from among qualified employees in a work status in reverse IRS EOD order and in the same priority order as offers of voluntary overtime in subsection 2B1 through 2B3, above, (i.e., employees covered in subsection 2B1, above, followed by employees covered in subsection 2B2, above, and so on). This procedure for directing overtime satisfies the equitable distribution requirements in subsection 2A1 above.
2.	An employee will, upon request, be released from a directed overtime assignment if a qualified replacement is available and willing to work. The Employer has determined that an overtime assignment should not be required if the overtime assignment will impair the health of the employee or cause an extreme hardship.
D.	General
1.	If the Employer determines that the ability to complete the work in a timely manner and at the
91
ARTICLE 24
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
time needed by the Employer is not compromised, the Employer will permit the employees to volunteer to work overtime on a regular workday, as long as the total time worked, including overtime, does not exceed twelve (12) hours.
2.	If overtime is offered, the Employer will permit employees to work overtime on their regular day off (RDO) or non-core workdays on a Maxiflex schedule if the work, equipment and seating are available.
3.	If an employee volunteers to work an overtime assignment and subsequently cannot perform the assignment, the employee will notify the Employer, normally within twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the overtime assignment (unless circumstances prevent the employee from providing such notice). Notice will be made by electronic mail or telephone call/message to their supervisor.
E.	The Employer will seek to avoid overtime assignments that result in employees working excessively long periods without a day off.
F.	The Employer will make available to the Union, upon request, current records of overtime assignments of employees to aid in resolving individual claims of unfair and inequitable distribution.
G.	The Employer will, when circumstances permit, notify an employee three (3) days in advance of scheduling an overtime assignment.
Section 3
Seasonal Employees in a Non-Work Status
The Employer has determined that it will follow the process in this Section if a decision is made to offer overtime in a work area where seasonal employees are in a non-work status within the season designated in the Seasonal Work Agreement prior to offering overtime.
A.	The Employer will determine the number of seasonal employees and requisite skill code(s) needed to complete the work and will recall the seasonal employees consistent with Articles 14 and 22 of this Agreement.
B.	The Employer reserves the right to direct or commence overtime work consistent with this Article without recalling seasonal employees in a non-work status if:
1.	the amount of overtime needed is insignificant (e.g., a total of forty (40) hours or less in a single workweek or on a single non-work day); or
2.	the recall of seasonal employees will not result in at least one (1) workweek in a work status for each recalled seasonal employee; or
3.	while seasonal employees in a non-work status are in the process of being recalled the Employer determines that the ability to timely complete the work is compromised due to such things as impending deadlines or delays in activating
required computer systems or building access credentials for recalled seasonal employees.
C.	The Employer has determined that if it decides to offer overtime after a recall of seasonal employees consistent with subsection 3A, above, the overtime will be offered in accordance with this Article to qualified employees in a work status or the Employer may elect to recall additional seasonal employees.
D.	The parties recognize that by recalling seasonal employees in lieu of offering overtime, overtime may no longer be needed to accomplish the work.
Section 4
Employees required to be on stand-by duty will be compensated if allowed by applicable law and regulation.
Section 5
A.	Consistent with applicable regulations, the overtime pay of employees whose positions are exempt, but who perform non-exempt duties for a majority of their duty time (including overtime) for a period exceeding thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, and thereby gain coverage under FLSA for overtime pay purposes, will have their overtime pay recalculated, as provided by the FLSA. Once an employee meets the test for FLSA coverage, he/ she will continue to receive overtime pay under the FLSA until the employee again performs exempt duties for the majority of the duty time (including overtime).
B.	In those instances where an employee is identified in advance and is eligible for FLSA coverage, the Employer will take the appropriate actions so that the employee can receive the correct rate of pay in the pay period in which they earn it.
Section 6
A.	The Employer will ensure that all overtime worked will be reported in fifteen (15) minute increments. Under the FLSA, a non-exempt employee must be compensated for every minute of work performed during his/her regularly scheduled administrative workweek, including regularly scheduled overtime. When irregular or occasional overtime work is performed in other than the full fifteen (15) minutes, any overtime worked for seven (7) minutes or less will be rounded down, and any overtime worked for more than seven (7) minutes will be rounded up.
B.	The Employer will ensure that accurate records of actual hours worked are maintained until the statute of limitations has expired for any potential overtime claims.
Section 7
When the Employer authorizes in advance an employee to perform work while traveling and outside normal duty hours, the actual time spent performing the work (e.g., mandatory
92
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 25
reading, Agency e-mail and/or voice mail, and contacting taxpayers) is compensable and will entitle the employee to overtime pay, compensatory time off and/or credit hours.
Article 25 | Workload Management
Section 1
A.	The parties recognize that the workload that employees can manage is dependent on such factors as geographic area covered, the type of work assigned, the grade level of work, the volume of work, priority programs and other assigned duties and that the Employer retains the right to assign work to employees under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a). However, if the exercise of that right by the Employer results in more than a de minimis change in working conditions, the Employer will notify the Union and bargain to the extent required by law. Such changes could include a negative impact on employee appraisals or the possibility of discipline as a result of a change in a performance standard or work rule. Any negotiations will be in accordance with the expedited procedures of Article 47, Section 6.
B.	The parties will establish one (1) Joint Committee in Small Business/Self Employed and one (1) Joint Committee in Appeals. Each committee will be comprised of three (3) designees from the Employer and three (3) designees from the Union. All members of Joint Committees must be from the applicable business unit.
Each committee will address work assignment practices among employees as follows:
1)	Small Business/Self Employed Joint Committee
a)	Bankruptcy Specialists and Advisors
b)	Revenue Agents
2)	Appeals Joint Committee
a) All Appeals Officers and Settlement Officers.
The two (2) committees will examine current inventory assignment processes, practices, and trends and explore whether there is a different way to distribute the work among employees at the same grade, in the same position, and with the same position title who are equally qualified.The committee meetings will be held by telephonic or electronic means. Each committee will begin work within no later than sixty (60) days of the effective date of this Agreement and will end work no later than one-hundred eighty (180) days thereafter.
For the first two (2) months (all time frames are approximate), the Joint Committees will examine the current inventory assignment processes, practices, and trends for each of the applicable occupations. This examination should involve a discussion between the members as to their experiences with regard to inventory assignment processes. For the following two
(2) months, the Joint Committees will pull relevant data, as described below. For the last two (2) months, the Joint Committees will examine the data within the context of the current inventory assignment process and trends as well as draft the recommendations on the Joint Committees'findings to be submitted to the BOD Directors and to the National NTEU President. The Joint Committees' recommendations describing the committees' examination of current inventory assignment processes, practices, and trends will be submitted within thirty (30) days of the last day of the committees' work. If the parties are unable to agree on joint recommendations, in whole or in part, either party may dissent from all or part of the recommendations and submit its own report and recommendations based on the evidence and data examined by the Joint Committee.
The Joint Committees will examine relevant data regarding the distribution of work assignment processes, practices, and trends. Such data will be focused on small populations spread across the Service (i.e., the inventory of 10 Revenue Agents in 5 geographically-disbursed areas on a particular day) and will provide the reason(s) as to why the employees have such an inventory. The parties agree that if an individual employee's case inventory is pulled, the employee's name will not be provided to the Joint Committee. The Union agrees that it will not use any collected data for any purpose other than for the Joint Committee discussions referenced above. The Union agrees that it will not use the aforementioned data to institute any administrative or judicial action, complaint, or grievance or arbitration proceeding. Nothing herein constitutes a waiver by the Employer of its right to assign work.
1.	Where a supervisor decides to downgrade a case with a systemically assigned grade level, he or she will notate the reasons for doing so in the case history and notify the employee via e-mail of the reasons for downgrading the case. If an employee disagrees with the decision to downgrade the case, the employee and/or the Union may file a written challenge to the decision by explaining why the case should not have been downgraded.
2.	The challenge must be filed within the same deadline as a formal grievance pursuant to Article 41, Subsection 6A of this Agreement. Once filed the parties will informally discuss the challenge to the decision to downgrade the case with the supervisor.
3.	If the informal discussion does not resolve the matter, the Employer will preserve the documentation related to the decision to downgrade the case for a period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days past the date of the employee's next annual appraisal or until the employee files a higher-graded duties grievance
93
ARTICLE 26
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
pursuant to Article 16, Section 2 of this Agreement, whichever is earlier.
4.	If the employee does formally file a grievance regarding the decision to downgrade the case, neither the grievance nor subsequent arbitration may address the formal classification of the employee's position. Instead, the scope of the grievance or arbitration will be limited to whether the contested downgraded case was properly downgraded given the rules and practices of the Employer.
5.	Nothing herein impacts the rights of any employee to file a classification or other statutory/regulatory appeal.
D.	1. If negotiations are not required by a change in workload as described in subsection 1A, above, employees are encouraged to discuss unmanageable inventory problems with their supervisors at any time. During such discussions, employees are also encouraged to suggest ways that their inventory could be adjusted that would increase efficiency. If the matter remains unresolved, employees or the Union may submit their concerns in writing to the appropriate management official. If requested by the employee, the Employer will provide a written response within fifteen (15) days addressing the concerns submitted by the employee.The employee may elect to attach the response from the Employer to the rebuttal to their annual appraisal.
2.	Chapters may also request a discussion of the workload at the Territory level in non-campus operations or at the Operation level for campuses or any larger organizational component within the jurisdiction of the Chapter. If workload problems are identified as a result of these discussions, the Employer will consider adjusting/rebalancing work assignments, approving credit hours, compensatory or overtime or taking other actions as appropriate. If the matter remains unresolved, employees or the Union may submit their concerns in writing to the appropriate management official. The Employer will provide a written response within fifteen (15) days addressing the resolution of the problem.
3.	Grievances seeking to remedy the adverse impact on employees can only be filed in connection with a completed personnel action, for example, nonselection for a promotion or discipline.
E.	For workload issues impacting employees in more than one (1) Chapter where negotiations are not required as described in subsection 1A above:
1.	National NTEU may request information through the Business Improvement Committee (BIC); and/or
2.	propose to discuss the workload issue as part of
the BIC agenda.
F.	Nothing in this Article precludes the Union from requesting other information consistent with 5 U.S.C. §7114(b)(4).
Section 2
The parties recognize the importance of developing employees in the performance of all tasks assigned to their positions.Therefore, the Employer will consider employees' requests to enhance their experience in all tasks assigned to their positions, including the opportunity to do higher graded work for developmental purposes in accordance with Article 16.
Section 3
When a group is without a group clerk due to an absence because of sickness, maternity leave, or for other authorized reasons for a period in excess of two (2) weeks, the Employer has determined that it will make reasonable efforts to utilize a temporary replacement within the scope of its authorized financial plans; or, when this remedy is not available, deal with the problem through the use of available employees.
Section 4
When a group secretary must serve the needs of more than one (1) work group, the supervisor or designee will consider the secretary's contributions when preparing the secretary's annual appraisal. The supervisor or designee may also recommend the secretary for a performance award or other appropriate award.
Article 26 | Position Classification
Section 1
A.	The Union may make recommendations and present supporting evidence concerning the adequacy and equity of a standardized position description or position classification standard.
B.	The Employer will review the presentation and advise the Union of the results of its review.
Section 2
A.	The Employer will inform the Union as soon as possible when significant changes will be made in the duties and responsibilities of positions held by employees in the unit due to reorganization, or when changes in position classification standards result in classification changes, or when changes will be made in position classification standards which could result in classification changes.
B.	Further, the Employer will furnish the Union copies of proposed classification standards for bargaining unit jobs referred to the Employer by the Office of
94
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 27
Personnel Management for comment.
Section 3
A.	The position description for each position will accurately reflect the actual duties, responsibilities, and the managerial relationships pertaining to the employee filling that position.
B.	Whenever a position description is amended, the Employer will provide copies to the local Union Chapter prior to issuance.
Section 4
A.	An employee who has filed a formal classification appeal with the Employer is entitled to one (1) representative at a desk audit or meeting with the Employer concerning the appeal.
B.	Work will not be reassigned for the purpose of avoiding reclassification during a classification appeal.
Section 5
Whenever there is a dispute or confusion over the difference between grade levels of a series, the Employer will, upon request of the Union, provide a complete and detailed list that contrasts the individual duties of each position, e.g., the difference between a GS-11 Revenue Agent and a GS-12 Revenue Agent.
Article 27 | Health and Safety
Section 1
A.	The Employer will, to the extent of its authority and consistent with the applicable requirements of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as well as other applicable health and safety codes and standards, i.e., General Services Administration (GSA), provide and maintain safe and healthful working conditions for all employees and will provide places of employment that are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm. The Union will cooperate to that end and will encourage all employees to work in a safe manner.
B.	When the Employer decides that it is necessary to move an employee from a work area due to temporary conditions in that work area that pose a threat to that employee's health or physical safety, a reasonable effort will be made by the Employer to find a work location for that employee elsewhere in the employee's post-of-duty (POD) or other IRS office in the commuting area. The impacted Chapter will be notified if an employee is moved under this subsection. If other Government facilities are not available, temporary Telework will be authorized if the employee's work may be accomplished at a Telework location.
C.	The Employer will, consistent with its right to assign
work, make a reasonable attempt to reassign tasks of employees who provide acceptable medical documentation that particular tasks presently assigned to the employee pose a health hazard.
D.	The Employer will identify the safety representatives in each building the IRS occupies who will be responsible for reporting to the Safety Officer any hazardous or unsafe conditions which have been observed or reported.
E.	When the Employer discovers a violation of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, it shall immediately notify the Union of that condition. The Employer shall also notify affected employees of the condition. After notifying appropriate authorities, the Employer will notify the Union of a bomb threat. Such notice will include an explanation for evacuating or not evacuating the building.
F.	The Employer will post information on the IRS intranet regarding safety procedures related to active shooter situations and emergency egress plans for each POD. The Employer will make employees aware of the procedures and plans on an annual basis.
G.	To the extent permitted by applicable building leases:
1.	Where there are break rooms provided by the Employer, refrigerators, microwave ovens and similar appliances must be located in those areas, unless approved by the local facilities manager (e.g., REFM). Such appliances meeting safety requirements, currently located in work areas, may remain. If the Employer has not provided break rooms, refrigerators, microwave ovens and similar appliances may be placed in the work area if approved in advance by the Employer.
2.	Coffee pots, personal heaters and fans will be permitted in the work area if inspected and approved by the Employer in advance of use.
Section 2
The Employer recognizes the existence of certain employee rights in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1960, among them the right to be free from reprisal, including charge to leave, when employees decline to perform their assigned tasks because of reasonable beliefs that, under the circumstances, the tasks pose an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, coupled with a reasonable belief that there is insufficient time to seek effective redress through normal hazard reporting and abatement procedures established by the Employer.
Section 3
A. A Safety Advisory Committee (SAC) with a minimum of six (6) members shall be maintained within each Campus or SCR geographic area consistent with Exhibits 46-1 and 46-2 of this Agreement. These committees shall have equal representation of management and non-management employees. The non-management members shall be designated by
95
ARTICLE 27
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
B.
D.
the Union. The function of the committees will be to advise the Employer concerning work-related safety matters in each Campus or SCR area. In the discharge of this function, the Safety Advisory Committee will consider existing practices and rules relating to safety and health and formulate suggested changes in existing practices and rules. In their consideration of the foregoing, the committees will give due regard to Public Law 91-596 and any applicable guidelines developed by the U.S. Department of Labor related thereto. In all cases, the Union will be allowed one (1) representative from each Chapter having representational jurisdiction in each Campus or SCR's area, and the size of the committee will be expanded to accommodate that, if needed.
Each committee shall designate a chairperson who shall be nominated from among the committee's members and shall be elected by the committee members. Management and non-management members shall alternate in this position. Maximum service time as a chairperson shall be two (2) years.
The committees will meet quarterly and all meetings will be held telephonically or by other electronic means except that Campus SAC meetings may be held face-to-face for participants in the commuting area; however, no travel and per diem will be authorized for such meetings. Meetings will be conducted during the normal tour of duty, without charge to leave, provided however, that no employees will be entitled to compensation for time in attendance at such meetings falling outside their regularly scheduled tours of duty. The Employer will change the shifts of committee members who are not on the prime shift.
Where the Safety Advisory Committee has been combined by local agreement with the local Labor Management Relations Committee (LMRC), the LMRC will assume the advisory responsibilities below. The Safety Advisory Committees are charged with, at a minimum:
1.	monitoring the annual safety and health plan for the facility or facilities within the Campus or SCR geographic area;
2.	identifying sources of blood pressure screening, EKG's, CPR training, sickle cell testing, cholesterol testing, breast and other cancer screening, flu shots, and physical examinations, which could be made available by the Employer at minimal or no cost;
3.	recommending the number of safety inspections to be conducted;
4.	recommending the means for advising employees of emergency evacuation procedures;
5.	recommending a basic inventory of first aid and safety and health equipment to be maintained in each POD;
6.	conducting an assessment of the sources of computer monitor screen glare and recommending appropriate corrective action;
7.	serving as a resource for educating employees about work-related safety concerns, such as asbestos exposure and abatement;
8.	reviewing all incident and accident reports (subject to Privacy Act restrictions) and recommending corrective actions; and
9.	reviewing data/statistics on Worker's Compensation claims from Safety and Health Information Management System (SHIMS) (subject to Privacy Act restrictions) and recommending corrective actions.
E. The Employer will release in a timely manner to members of the Safety Advisory Committee (or LMRCs, where combined), as appropriate, the results of all health and safety testing that is conducted by the Employer or received by the Employer for each POD with a copy to each Chapter President with representational jurisdiction.
Section 4

Section 1
A.	1. Consistent with 5 C.F.R. § 610.123, the Employer will, if practicable, schedule and arrange for travel of employees to occur within the employees' regularly scheduled work hours. However, if circumstances require the employees' presence on Monday, too early to permit travel that day, the employees should perform the travel on the preceding day (Sunday), leaving home or post-of-duty (POD) at a reasonable time. If the employees prefer, travel may be permitted during duty hours on the preceding Friday. In this event, subsistence reimbursement may be allowed to start with the departure time but will be limited to that which would have been payable if departure was made on Sunday. Employees who are required to travel during non-duty hours may obtain, upon request, the written reasons why such travel was required at those hours.
2. Employees directed to travel outside their regular tour of duty will be entitled to earn compensatory time for such travel, consistent with OPM,Treasury, and IRS policy regarding Compensatory Time for Travel. All employees will be compensated for time spent traveling for work purposes (excluding normal commuting time to and from work), during their regular tour of duty. In addition:

99
ARTICLE 29
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
(1)	involves work that can only be performed while traveling (e.g., courier required to drive a delivery van in order to deliver mail); or
(2)	is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling (e.g., courier driving an empty delivery van on return trip to his/her duty station); or
(3)	is carried out under arduous and unusual conditions; or
(4)	is in connection with an event that cannot be scheduled or controlled administratively by the Government.
(b)	Consistent with 5 C.F.R. 551.422, an employee who is covered by FLSA and is on official travel away from his/her official duty station shall be compensated for time in a travel status outside his or her regular tour of duty, if the overtime is ordered and approved in advance (or"suffered or permitted") and the time spent traveling requires the employee to:
(1)	work during travel (e.g., drive a vehicle, either privately or Government-owned as part of a work assignment); or
(2)	travel as a passenger on a one-day assignment away from the official duty station; or
(3)	travel as a passenger on an overnight assignment away from the official duty station during hours on non-work days that correspond to the employee's regular working hours.
(c)	If an employee (whether FLSA-covered or exempt) is required to travel directly between home and a temporary duty location outside the limits of his/her official duty station, the time he/she would have spent in normal "home to work/work to home" commuting will be deducted from any overtime that is allowed for travel time as defined in subsections 1A2(a) and 1 A2(b) above.
B.	When travel results from an event which cannot be scheduled or controlled administratively, such travel may be considered hours of employment for pay purposes pursuant to appropriate provisions of Title 5 of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Disputes arising under this subsection may be adjusted through the use of the grievance procedure provided in this Agreement.
C.	If the travel is expected to require employees to be absent from their POD for three (3) or more months, the employees will be given at least thirty (30) days notification of their date of departure when practicable.
Section 2
A.	Employees will use the ATM feature of their government-issued travel cards to obtain travel advances. If an employee has a restricted government-issued travel card or no card at all, then the approving official may authorize the issuance of travel advances through the electronic travel system or via a manual travel authorization.
B.	An employee not in a recurring travel status shall submit a travel voucher and liquidate the entire outstanding advance. Advances cannot be carried over from one authorization to another and must be repaid when the voucher is filed.
Section 3
A.	Maximum allowable per diem rates within the Conterminous United States (CONUS) will be based upon the traveler's actual lodging costs up to the maximum allowable amount as well as upon the meals and incidental expenses reimbursement rate for the locality subject to the most current rates published by General Services Administration (GSA) in the Federal Register.
B.	For travel within the CONUS to localities designated by GSA as specific per diem rate localities, travelers shall be reimbursed in accordance with the most current rates published by GSA in the Federal Register. For travel within the CONUS to all other CONUS localities, travelers shall be reimbursed in accordance with the most recent standard per diem rate as published by GSA in the Federal Register.
C.	In accordance with Federal Travel Regulations, and when authorized in advance by the Employer, reimbursement on an actual subsistence expense basis will be authorized when actual and necessary subsistence expenses of official travel are unusually high due to special or unusual circumstances. Reimbursement on an actual subsistence expense basis should be requested and authorized in advance. Employees will receive advance notice that there will be a need for actual expenses so that they can make a timely request for approval to be reimbursed for actual subsistence expenses.
D.	1. For computing meals and incidental expenses reimbursement allowances, official travel begins when the traveler leaves home, office, or other authorized point of departure and ends when the traveler returns home, to the office, or other authorized point at the conclusion of the trip.
2.	In accordance with Federal Travel Regulations, travelers will be reimbursed for full day official travel. The meals & incidental expenses (M&IE) allowance for a partial day of travel will be a flat three-fourths (3/4) of the applicable M&IE.
100
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 29
3.	For travel of more than twelve (12) hours, but not exceeding twenty-four (24) hours, when lodging is required, per diem shall be computed in the same manner as for travel of more than twenty-four (24) hours.
4.	For travel of more than twelve (12) hours, but not exceeding twenty-four (24) hours, when lodging is not required, travelers will be reimbursed at a flat three-fourths (3/4) of the applicable M&IE.
5.	Payment of per diem allowance for travel of twelve (12) hours or less is prohibited.
E.	Per diem entitlement is contingent upon an employee's assignment to temporary duty outside the commuting area of the official station or residence. To be considered outside the boundaries of the commuting area, the place of duty must first be outside the boundaries of the employee's official station. In addition, the temporary place of duty must be more than forty (40) miles from the employee's permanently assigned physical location (office) and also more than forty (40) miles from the employee's residence, measured by odometer or other readings on the most commonly used route. At any point beyond both these distances, and also outside the official station, is outside the commuting area.
F.	Unusual circumstances may exist that would justify an exception to the rules regarding the payment of per diem. Exceptions are contained in IRM 1.32.1 and include, among other circumstances:
1.	severe weather conditions exist that may endanger the health and safety of an employee and theTDY location is at least thirty (30) miles from both the residence and official duty station; and
2.	the employee is attending training or a conference and theTDY location is at least thirty (30) miles from both the residence and the official duty station. The delegated approving official may authorize such exceptions, provided the TDY location is outside the boundaries of the official duty station. The voucher must contain an explanation of the circumstances and the approving official's determination. Local area travel may be taxable and the employee may receive a Form W-2.
G.	The traveler on actual expenses will identify in the travel voucher the subsistence costs actually incurred each day and show in the subsistence column the total for each day, not in excess of the prescribed maximum. The expenses (with the lodging exception noted below) will be shown as follows:
1.	lodging for each day;
2.	individual meals for each day;
3.	an average of expenses that do not accrue on a daily basis; for example: laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing; and
4.	all lodging expenses, whether on actual or per diem must be supported by receipts (when lodging expenses continue for a period of time at the same daily rate, the total lodging expenses for the period may be supported by one (1) receipt).
H.	Consistent with Federal Travel Regulations, an employee may not remain in a travel status over a weekend solely to increase the entitlement to subsistence. The following requirements cover the completion of temporary duty on a Friday preceding a non-holiday weekend:
1.	the traveler should return to home or POD on the Friday unless arrival would be at an unreasonable late hour; in the latter event, the return should be made on Saturday; in either case, per diem or other authorized subsistence expenses will be payable until the traveler's arrival at home or POD; and
2.	instead of travel on Saturday as indicated in subsection HI, above, the traveler may be allowed to return on Monday following the weekend; in this event, subsistence reimbursement will be suspended as of midnight Friday, but will be resumed at 12:01 a.m. Monday, continuing until the traveler reaches home or POD.
3.	An employee whose official travel extends from one workweek through the next may travel home over the weekend or other non-workday using the cost comparison method to determine the amount of reimbursement the employee will receive for travel.The Employer agrees that, unless there is a finding of substantially increased costs, when lodging is included as part of a contract for conference rooms and/or other services, it will not include weekend lodging or lodging for nonworkdays so that the cost comparison method, including the cost of the hotel room, can be used.
I.	Employees authorized to use a POV for official business will be paid mileage in accordance with IRM 1.32.1. For example;
1.	when the use of a privately owned automobile for official business is advantageous to the Government (it is expected that the employee will travel less than 15,000 miles annually), the employee providing such automobile will be reimbursed at the most current rate published by GSA in the Federal Register; and
2.	when it is reasonably determined that an employee is a high-mileage driver (it is expected that the employee will drive at least 15,000 miles annually) and that a Government vehicle is available for the employee's use, the employee will be reimbursed at the most current rate published by GSA in the Federal Register if the employee elects to use his or her own automobile for official business.
101
ARTICLE 29
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
J.	Employees will be reimbursed for emergency personal telephone calls while in travel status. Employees will be reimbursed for brief personal telephone calls (usually five to ten minutes) each day while they are in travel status.
K.	Employees will be reimbursed for authorized fees in connection with changing official travel arrangements caused by the needs of the Service, or due to a significant personal emergency such as a family, medical, or natural disaster emergency.
Section 4
A.	When the Employer makes housing available for the employee, the employee will have the option, except in unusual circumstances, of remaining in the Employer-provided housing or of securing other housing. If employees elect to secure their own housing, absent unusual circumstances, their per diem reimbursement will be as provided in Section 3 above.
B.	Unusual circumstances sufficient to justify requiring an employee to use Employer-provided facilities are not present when an ordinary benefit to the Government, such as economy or the ready availability of personnel, is the rationale. Unusual circumstances are present under the following circumstances:
1.	the employee is participating in an investigation that requires the employee's presence in the quarters at all times; or
2.	the quarters provide the only place of lodging reasonably close to the employee's place of duty so that daily travel to and from another place of lodging would be impracticable; or
3.	the employees must keep in their possession highly valuable equipment or classified material whose security would be endangered if removed from the quarters; or
4.	the official who authorizes the travel or training determines that utilization of quarters furnished by the Government is a necessary and integral part of a particular mission or training course.
C.	When a determination is made that unusual circumstances exist requiring an employee to use Government eating and/or lodging facilities, employees concerned will be so notified, in writing, before they begin the travel. This notification will identify the days affected, will explain the need for the use of the facilities, and will inform the employees that their per diem will be reduced even if they use other facilities. However, in no case will the employee receive less than the standard M&IE allowance for traveling to that area, minus the amount the Government actually paid for his or her food in the Government housing.
Section 5
Consistent with FederalTravel Regulations, employees who are assigned to training or duty away from their regular assigned POD, and elect to return home during nonwork days will be reimbursed for travel not to exceed the amount reimbursable for the per diem had they remained away from home.
Section 6
Consistent with Federal Travel Regulations, when the nature and location of the work at a temporary duty location are such that suitable meals cannot be obtained there, the expense of daily travel required to obtain meals at the nearest available place may be approved as necessary transportation, not part of per diem or actual expense reimbursement. A statement of the necessity for such daily travel shall be notated on the voucher.
Section 7
A. An employee may be reimbursed for taxicab fares, plus tip, for transportation from the office to their home incident to officially ordered overtime provided all of the following conditions are met:
1.	reimbursement is authorized by the official authorized to order or approve the performance of the overtime duty; (see Delegation Order No. 255);
2.	the employee performed overtime duty incident to the conduct of official business at the designated POD;
3.	the employee is dependent on public transportation, incident to the officially ordered overtime; and
4.	the travel is performed during hours of infrequently scheduled public transportation or darkness.
Section 8
Each person having custody of transportation requests, tickets, or other transportation documents received in exchange for transportation requests or other procuring instruments, is responsible for their safekeeping. Such person is also accountable for any amount that the Government may be required to pay because of the person's fraud, fault, negligence, or other improper use of these documents.
Section 9
Employees having questions related to the content of the Travel IRM 1.32.1, or their entitlement thereunder, should take such matters up with their supervisors who shall be responsible for obtaining the answers to such questions.

Example: employee rents a parking space at a weekly rate for parking a privately owned automobile Monday through Friday, at or near the headquarters office. One-fifth (1/5) of the weekly rate will be allowed for each day that the employee uses a personally owned conveyance for official business. Example: an employee rents a parking space on a monthly basis at or near the office with the space available to the employee as provided by the rental agreement for twenty-one (21) days of the month. The employee uses the space for parking on official business seven (7) days during the month. The employee will be reimbursed for 7/21 or one-third (1/3) of the monthly cost. An employee who rents a parking space on a monthly basis and who receives a certificate from the parking facility that the space is available only during Monday through Friday shall be entitled to compute pro rata reimbursement based on the number of workdays in the month.
Section 12
Disabled employees may be directed to perform official travel and there are situations in which the assistance of an attendant or escort must be provided if the travel is to be accomplished.

Article 30 | Training
Section 1

B.	In accordance with 5 C.F.R. § 300 and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, the Employer may develop and administer assessments (including but not limited to written and on-the-job assessments), to determine the retention and/or advancement of employees in trainee/ developmental positions, up to the journey level and above, as applicable. Such assessments shall not be implemented without appropriate negotiations with the Union, as provided for by Article 47. Non-probationary employees, who do not demonstrate an acceptable level of proficiency or performance on such assessments, initially and/or after an appropriate performance improvement period, should be aware that the Employer may take an unacceptable performance action under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and Article 40 of this Agreement based thereon; the Employer will, consistent with staffing needs, make reasonable efforts to place employees who have successfully completed a probationary period with the IRS in a position that takes full advantage of their skills and abilities.
Section 2

C.	Where the Employer develops and administers valid training assessments (including needs assessment), the results of such assessments may be provided to the training coordinator and first-line supervisor, along with feedback from the classroom and on-the-job instructors, as appropriate.The results will not be used for performance evaluation purposes. Aggregate data will be supplied to the Employer to make decisions regarding training and developmental needs for groups of individuals. An employee may choose to reveal assessment scores to a line manager to assist in the career development process but is under no obligation to do so.
D.	Each employee will be entitled to establish a Career Learning Plan (CLP) with assistance and advice provided by the Employer. The primary emphasis of the plans will be, first, to address the competencies (or knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed by the employee in his/her current position; second, to prepare them for new career opportunities; and third, to address the competencies (or knowledge, skills, and abilities) needed for advancement beyond his/her current journey level. Although the primary responsibility for executing a CLP for career advancement falls with the employee, the Employer will provide reasonable advice and assistance. Each plan shall establish a series of milestones and shall state the responsibilities of each party to realize such milestones. For employees who have a CLP approved by the Employer, the Employer will make reasonable efforts, consistent with workload and staffing needs, to approve up to sixteen (16) hours of administrative time per calendar year for self-directed training or developmental activities, if such activities are related to the employee's current or prospective job duties.
E.

110
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 33
2.	The probable duration of the serious health E. condition or specify that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown duration and whether the patient is p presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity;
3.	The appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by a health care provider;

Medical certification requirements for leave requests to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness are found in Exhibit 33-2.
1.	An employee may elect to submit the required medical certification either directly to his or her supervisor (or higher level supervisor, such as Operations or Territory manager) or directly to FOH, the Employer's designated medical professional (i.e., employees may choose to provide any required medical certifications, such as Form WH-380, only to those medical professionals designated by the Employer). Employees will not be required to reveal the details of their medical condition to their supervisors or managers.
2.	Where an employee elects to provide the required medical certification directly to his or her supervisor, the Employer has determined that supervisors may approve the FMLA request without first obtaining a recommendation from the Employer's designated medical professional. Supervisors, however, may not disapprove the FMLA request without first submitting the required medical certification to, and receiving a recommendation from, the Employer's designated medical professional.
3.	The IRS recognizes the importance of keeping medical information secure and confidential as required by law and regulation. Managers and supervisors will not disclose any details of employees' medical conditions of which they become aware unless such disclosure is permitted by law or regulation.
Once an employee submits the completed medical certification signed by a health care provider, the Employer may not request new information from the health care provider, except as permitted by applicable regulations. However, with the employee's permission, the Employer's medical professional may contact the employee's health care providerfor purposes of clarifying the medical certification.The Employer may not demand that the employee authorize it or its medical professional to discuss the employee's medical condition with the employee's physician; or demand that the employee sign a release permitting the Employer or its medical professional access to the employee's medical records as a condition to granting FMLA leave.
Employees using FMLA leave due to pregnancy, or a chronic or a long term condition will not usually be required to obtain a medical certification more than once a year. The Employer may, however, at its own expense, require subsequent medical re-certifications on a periodic basis, but not more than once every thirty (30) days.
If the Employer doubts the validity of the certification provided by the employee's health care provider, as opposed to the completeness of the certification, the
111
ARTICLE 33

Section 2
Voting
A.	The Employer has determined to exercise its discretionary authority to grant excused absence for voting purposes to the extent that such time off does not interfere with agency operations. The granting of excused absences will be done in a fair and equitable manner. As a general rule, when the voting polls are not open at least three (3) hours either before or after an employee's regular hours of work, such employee may be granted an amount of excused absence to vote or register which will permit the employee to report to work three (3) hours after the polls open or leave work three (3) hours before the polls close, whichever requires the lesser amount of time off.
The same general rule will apply to early voting if the employee is unable to vote on the day of the election because of activities related to IRS mission (such as travel) and cannot vote by absentee ballot; and early voting hours are the same as, or exceed, voting hours on the day of election. If a manager refuses to grant an employee administrative leave to vote, the matter will immediately be referred to the SCR or Campus equivalent executive for a determination whether the granting of administrative time off is appropriate. In no circumstances will an employee be approved for more than four (4) hours of administrative leave for voting purposes. This provision applies to federal and state elections where candidates are running for office, including primaries and caucuses.
In addition, the Employer has determined that if an employee's voting place is beyond the normal
commuting distance and vote by eibsentee ballot is not permitted, the Employer may grant an excused absence of up to eight (8) hours, depending on the distance to be traveled, to allow the employee to make the trip to the voting place to cast a ballot under the circumstances described above.
B.	Employees on a gliding schedule will notify their managers at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the actual voting day as to what their start time will be on the voting day.

Such granting ofadministrative leave will be extended to include the time for necessary oral interviews and travel time on the day of the examination. Administrative leave may also be granted for specialized professional examinations in the computer field.
B.	The Employer has determined that it will grant additional administrative leave for this purpose to the above described employees who have shown reasonable progress toward achieving success in passing the applicable examinations.

Section 6
Travel Status

In such situations, the employee will (within the hour, if practicable) provide the supervisor with an estimate of the situation and obtain appropriate instructions.
Section 7
Return from Active Military Duty
Employees who return from active military service in support of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) are entitled to five (5) days of excused absence each time they return from active military duty. In order to receive the five (5) days of excused absence, employees must spend at least forty two (42) consecutive days on active duty in support of OCO. A returning employee is authorized to use this excused absence only once during a twelve (12) month period beginning after the first use of the excused absence. This provision must be applied consistent with current published OPM guidance.
Section 8
Blood Donation
The Employer has determined that an employee who donates blood or blood derivatives is authorized to receive four (4) hours of administrative leave immediately following the donation for recuperative purposes. However, subject to supervisory approval, the recuperative time may be taken later in the day that the blood is donated rather than immediately following the donation. At the employee's option, he or she may take the recuperative time at home. In addition, administrative leave will be granted for reasonable travel to and from the donation site and to actually give blood. If necessary, additional recuperative time may be requested. However, the total amount of administrative leave will be limited to the remaining scheduled work hours on the day of the donation. An employee who is not accepted for donating blood is only authorized to the time necessary to travel to and from the local donation site and the time needed to make the determination.
Section 9
Notwithstanding the above, nothing contained in this Article will restrict the Employer's ability to require the presence of an employee, pursuant to its right to assign work under 5 U.S.C. § 7106(a)(2)(B), should the Employer determine that the employees' services are necessary.

1.	the absence is directly related to the Service's mission;
2.	the absence is officially sponsored or sanctioned by the Employer;
3.	the absence will clearly enhance the professional development or skills of the employee in his or her current position; or
4.	the Employer determines that the activity is in the best interests of the Service.

Section 11
Benefits Counseling
Subject to workload considerations the Employer may grant an employee up to four (4) hours excused absence per calendar year for the purposes of attending a health benefits fair, reviewing health benefits information and materials, receiving financial counseling, and seeking supplemental retirement counseling. These activities must be sponsored or made available by the Federal Government or the Union.

Members of the Reserves and National Guard will not be charged military leave for weekends and holidays that occur within the period of military service.
1.	5 U.S.C. § 6323(a) provides fifteen (15) days per fiscal year for active duty, active duty training, and inactive duty training. An employee can carry over a maximum of fifteen (15) days into the next fiscal year.

118
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 36
will be made to inform all employees by private or public media, including email, the IRS Emergency Hotlines, and other methods as appropriate and available.

2.	the mode of transportation normally used by the employee;
3.	efforts taken by the employee to come to work;
4.	the success of other similarly-situated employees;
5.	any physical disability of the employee; and
6.	any local travel restrictions.

Closures Affecting Telework Employees
When an emergency condition forces the closure of an IRS facility and employees thereof are granted administrative leave as a result, an employee of that same facility (a) who is working at home on an approved Telework program and (b) who is prevented from accomplishing work because of that same emergency condition (for example, where a power outage forces the closure of an office, and that same power outage prevents a Telework employee from completing his or her work assignments at home), that Telework employee will be provided the same amount of administrative leave granted employees who were working in the closed facility. A Telework employee claiming administrative leave under this provision is responsible for providing appropriate documentation in support of that claim.
Office Open with Early Closure
1.	In the event of an "open with early departure" operating announcement, all employees working in the office (i.e., the official duty station) up to the early departure time will be granted administrative leave for the period from the departure time to the end of theirTour of Duty (TOD).
2.	When an early departure time is announced and the employee experiences circumstances warranting special consideration, consistent with workload and staffing needs, the manager may grant administrative leave from the time the employee leaves work through the remainder of the TOD, provided that the employee provides the manager with reasonably acceptable documentation.
Delayed Opening of Office
An employee who is on scheduled leave for the entire day but chooses to come in at the start of his or her TOD following the delayed arrival will contact his or her manager via telephone or will follow any other mutually agreed upon process to advise the manager of his or her intent to come in to the office, will receive administrative leave up until the time of the delayed arrival, and will have the remainder of the scheduled leave cancelled.

Article 37 | Probationary Employees
Section 1
Probationary employees will be advised of their progress at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of their probationary period with the Service.
Section 2
A.	The appropriate Chapter President will be notified at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to a meeting scheduled for the purpose of removing a probationary employee of the time and place of the meeting. Prior to the beginning of the meeting, and if the employee does not object, the Union will be afforded up to fifteen (15) minutes to speak in private with the employee.
B.	A letter of termination will advise probationary employees of their statutory appeal rights. The letter of termination will also advise the employee of the following:
"In addition to any right you may have to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), you may also have the right to file charges or complaints with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), Office of Special Counsel (OSC),the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or other Federal agencies if you believe your rights have been violated and your claims are within their jurisdiction."
Section 3
A. All provisions of this Agreement apply to probationary employees, except those provisions which are inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. The Union may represent probationary employees in connection with any matter consistent with law or regulation and this Agreement, e.g.,
1.	the denial of leave, including the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA);
2.	a request for an Alternate Work Schedule (AWS);
3.	an investigation conducted by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA);
4.	an improper reassignment or error in the merit promotion process;
5.	a negative recordation used in a performance appraisal;

Article 38 | Disciplinary Actions
Section 1
A.	A disciplinary action for purposes of this Article is defined as an admonishment, a written reprimand, or a suspension of fourteen (14) days or less.
B.	This Article applies to bargaining unit employees who have completed their probationary or trial period except to the extent prohibited by law.
C.	No bargaining unit employee will be the subject of a disciplinary action except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service, as those terms have been defined in applicable case law.
D.	The Union shall be given the opportunity to be represented at any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the Agency in connection with an investigation if:
1.	the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and
2.	the employee requests representation.
E.	A meeting between an employee and the supervisor, acting supervisor or other line management official during which the principal topic of discussion is discipline or potential discipline will entitle the employee involved to request to be accompanied by the Union steward during such meeting. If such a request is made, the supervisor, acting supervisor or other line management official will honor the request. Any meeting held for the purpose of issuing a disciplinary or proposed disciplinary letter to a bargaining unit employee will not be investigative in nature.
F.	In deciding what disciplinary action may be appropriate, the Employer will give due consideration to the relevance of any mitigating and/or aggravating circumstances. The following factors, included herein for purposes of illustration, are neither meant to be exhaustive nor intended to be applied mechanically, but rather to outline the tolerable limits of reasonableness:
1.	the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical and inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain, or was frequently repeated;
2.	the employee's job level and type of employment, including supervisor or fiduciary role, contacts with the public, and prominence of the position;
120
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 38
3.	the employee's past disciplinary record;
4.	the employee's past work record; including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability; B.
5.	the effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon the Employer's confidence in the employee's ability to perform assigned duties;
6.	consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses;
7.	the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the Employer;
8.	theclarity with which the employee was on notice c. of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question;
9.	potential for the employee's rehabilitation;	D.
10.	mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad E. faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter; and	p
11.	the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others.
G.	The Employer recognizes the importance of completing an investigation of an employee in as timely a manner as is practicable. Further, discipline, when proposed by the Employer, will also be administered as timely as possible.
H.	When an employee has been advised that he or she is/ was the subject of an investigation, and a determination is made not to propose a disciplinary action, the Employer will issue the appropriate letter (e.g., clearance or closed without action) to the employee within a timely fashion, normally within thirty (30) days of when the case involving the employee is closed. The letter will not be placed in the employee's Official Personnel Folder (OPF) unless requested by the employee in writing.
Section 2
Alternative Discipline
A. The Employer and the Union encourage the use of alternative approaches to traditional disciplinary actions. The goal of such an approach is to positively change an employee's conduct by offering an alternative means of correcting such conduct. The Employer will publicize to supervisors the benefits of q alternative discipline and will include such information on alternative discipline in the Guide to Penalty
Determinations. The Employer will recommend that traditional discipline and alternative discipline should not normally be combined.
Alternative discipline methods and mechanisms shall be implemented consistent with the following objectives:
1.	improving communications and interpersonal working relationships between supervisors and employees;
2.	correcting behavioral problems;
3.	reducing the costs and delays inherent in traditional disciplinary actions; and
4.	decreasing the contentiousness between the parties at the local level.
Alternative discipline is offered solely by agreement of the parties. Under no circumstances is alternative discipline required to be used but, if used, the provisions of this Agreement must be met.
Alternative discipline is an option when the disciplinary action would otherwise involve an official reprimand or a suspension of fourteen (14) days or less.
Alternative discipline discussions must occur prior to entering into the "traditional" disciplinary process.
1.	Prior to the issuance of a letter of reprimand or a proposal to suspend, the Employer will inform the employee that "traditional" discipline is being contemplated and that the employee may request consideration of an alternative form of discipline. The employee will have five (5) workdays to request consideration of the alternative discipline option. Should the employee request consideration of alternative discipline, meeting(s) will be held and concluded within five (5) workdays of the request. At the conclusion of the meeting(s):
(a)	an agreement on alternative discipline must be reached; or
(b)	the"traditional"disciplinary process will begin.
2.	If such meetings are held, they will include the proposing official or designee, other Employer representatives deemed necessary, the employee, and the employee's representative. Should alternative discipline meetings prove to be unproductive, either party may elect to terminate them prior to the five (5) workday time-frame and proceed with the "traditional" discipline. If an alternative discipline agreement is reached, it will be reduced to writing consistent with this Agreement. Should an alternative discipline agreement not be reached, the employee will be afforded his or her rights as described in this Article.
The parties may agree to extend the time frames in subsection 2F.
121
ARTICLE 38
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
H.	In any alternative discipline agreement, it is understood that:
1.	should future misconduct occur, the alternative discipline agreement will constitute a prior disciplinary action that may be considered in future disciplinary actions;
2.	the alternative discipline agreement will be maintained by the Employer in a manner which is consistent with the retention requirements of the underlying action;
3.	the alternative discipline agreement will not be placed in the employee's Official Personnel Folder (OPF);
4.	the alternative discipline agreement does not preclude the Employer from taking appropriate action regarding any other misconduct not covered by the alternative discipline agreement;
5.	the alternative discipline agreement is not precedential;
6.	should the employee violate the alternative discipline agreement, the employee will be notified in writing of the violation and that the penalty as outlined in the alternative discipline agreement will be effected immediately;
7.	should the employee dispute whether a violation of the alternative discipline agreement occurred, the employee may file a grievance within five (5) workdays of receipt of written notification on only whether a violation of the alternative discipline agreement occurred;
8.	should the employee grieve whether the violation occurred, imposition of the penalty will be stayed pending resolution of the grievance;
9.	if the grievance is not resolved it must be submitted to the expedited arbitration process, consistent with subsection 7D, below, where an arbitrator's review is limited to the dispute of whether or not there was a violation of the alternative discipline agreement; and
10.	the alternative discipline agreement must be signed by the employee, the employee's representative, and an Employer representative with the delegated authority to take the "traditional" discipline which was replaced by the alternative discipline.
I.	Any alternative discipline agreement must include the following:
1.	a detailed description of the alternative discipline which has been agreed to;
2.	a statement of the penalty for which the alternative discipline agreement is a substitute;
3.	a statement of the misconduct;
4.	a statement that the employee admits to engaging in the misconduct; and
5.	a statement that the employee and the Union waive all oral and/or written reply, grievance, appeal and complaint rights in tiny forum.
J.	If the underlying discipline involves charges of either (1) absence without permission for more than five (5) days (at least forty-one (41) hours) in any one calendar year; or (2) violations of subpart G of the Standards of Ethical Conduct of Employees of the Executive Branch for viewing, downloading or exchanging pornography, including child pornography, on a Federal Government computer or while performing official Federal Government duties; then the alternative discipline agreement must include a provision prohibiting the employee from working under any form of Telework arrangement for the same length of time as the retention requirements for the underlying action (e.g., for a period of two (2) years when the alternative discipline agreement takes the place of a non-tax related reprimand and indefinitely when the alternative discipline agreement takes the place of a suspension).
Section 3
A.	An employee will, in any disciplinary action and upon request, be furnished a copy of that portion of all written documents which contain evidence relied on by the Employer which form the basis for the reasons and specifications. In addition, the employee and/ or NTEU may request other information in response to the proposed action, consistent with appropriate Statutes (e.g., 5 U.S.C. §§ 7114(b)(4), 552, and 552a).
B.	Upon request, an employee, or the Union when designated by the employee, will be furnished all written documents pertaining to the investigation of the employee that were available to the proposing official at the time the notice of proposed action was issued to the employee.
C.	If probable cause exists and is demonstrated to the arbitrator by the Union on appeal that information provided for in an investigative report relating to the specifications has not been furnished by the Employer, upon request of the arbitrator, the report will be furnished for an "in camera" inspection to be made in conformity with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a). Material determined by the arbitrator to be favorable under the criteria of subsection 3B, and not previously furnished to the Union, will be furnished to the Union.
D.	Nothing in this Section is to be construed as a waiver of the employee's or Union's right to request additional information under other authorities, such as Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act, or Civil Service Reform Act.
122
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 38
Section 4	C.

Section 5
A. When the Employer proposes to suspend an employee for fourteen (14) days or less, the following procedures will apply:
1.	the Employer will provide the affected employee with fifteen (15) days advance written notification of the proposed suspension;
2.	The employee has the right, but is not obligated to make an oral and/or written reply on the reasons and specifications prior to a final decision, provided that the oral or written reply is received by the Employer within a reasonable period of time after the employee's receipt of the letter of proposed action. Any request for an oral reply must be made within seven (7) days of the employee's receipt of the letter of proposed action.
3.	The Employer agrees that when a record of an oral/written reply is made, it will always contain as an attachment, all documents submitted by the employee and his or her representative. Any q documents not submitted at the oral reply, but received within five (5) workdays of the date of the oral reply, where practicable, will be included in the reply record; and
4.	The Employer will issue a final decision after receipt of the written and/or oral reply, or the termination of the fifteen (15) day notice period. This letter will state which reasons and specifications are E. sustained and will address factual disputes, if any, raised in the employee's reply by stating the reasons why each factual dispute was rejected.
Section 6
A.	In cases where a suspension is proposed for reasons of off-duty misconduct, the Employer's written notification provided for in Section 5, above, will also contain a statement of the nexus between the off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the Service. The notification will describe why and how there is a connection between the specific off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the Service. (For example, how F. would drunk driving that led to an arrest interfere with the efficiency of the Service so as to warrant discipline?)
B.	If the Employer elects to change or modify the G. stated nexus prior to issuing a final decision letter, the employee will be informed of such changes or modifications in writing in accordance with Section 1 of Article 52.
The employee will have the opportunity to make an oral and/or written answer to the new statement of nexus. The parties intend that an oral response should be made only in exceptional cases.
1.	Within five (5) workdays of the employee's receipt of the new nexus statement, the Employer shall be notified of the employee's intention to submit an oral and/or written answer. The oral answer must be made within ten (10) days of the employee's receipt of the new nexus statement, absent mutual consent. The written answer must be served on the Employer on or before the tenth (10th) workday following receipt by the employee of the new nexus statement, absent mutual consent. "Served" means mailing by certified mail or hand delivery to the appropriate Employer office.
2.	Where an oral answer is submitted, the Employer shall make a written summary of the answer. The written summary shall be sent to the employee's representative. The employee's representative shall have three (3) workdays from receipt of the written summary to send corrections of the summary to the Employer. If the Employer sent the summary to the representative by express mail or hand delivery, the representative will return the corrections by express mail or hand delivery.
After issuance of the decision letter, the Employer may amend or change its nexus statement under the following circumstances:
1.	a new nexus statement is based on newly discovered evidence which was not discoverable earlier with the exercise of due diligence; or
2.	a change occurs in applicable case law or statute. If the Employer amends the nexus statement due to the discovery of new evidence as described in subsection 6D1, the Employer will expeditiously notify the employee's representative (or the employee, if unrepresented) of its intent to rely on a new nexus theory because of the newly discovered evidence. If it becomes necessary to delay or cancel an arbitration hearing because of the need of the Union to respond at hearing to this new nexus theory, and if the Employer's notification to the Union of the new nexus theory occurs within seven (7) days of a scheduled hearing, the Employer and the Union shall equally share the expenses of a cancellation fee.
Nothing in this Section shall preclude the Employer from responding to or rebutting any evidence, arguments, or defenses raised by or on behalf of the employee.
Letters of official reprimand which are based on reasons of off-duty misconduct will also state a nexus between such misconduct and the efficiency of the Service.

Section 15
Mutual Interest Resolution Procedure
The parties at the national level, at any time during the
term of this Agreement, may agree to engage in a Mutual Interest Resolution Procedure (MIRP) which is a means to expedite the resolution of certain grievances and arbitration cases (e.g., aged) jointly selected by the parties in a manner which balances the interests of the Employer, the Union and the impacted employees. Participation in the MIRP isentirely voluntary and neither party may grieve the failure to reach agreement on applying the process to any grievance or arbitration case. In addition, the process does not negate the Employer's authority to hear, settle, address, or resolve grievance/arbitration cases pursuant to the terms of this Article. Furthermore, the process does not circumvent the Union's rights and interests as the exclusive bargaining representative for IRS employees.
A.	Site Selection
Upon mutual agreement, the parties at the national level may apply the MIRP at any loccition.
B.	Panel Selection
The Employer and the local NTEU Chapter may each appoint up to three (3) local representatives with settlement authority to serve as panel members. The Employer and National NTEU have determined that General Legal Services (GLS), Labor Relations Specialists and NTEU Attorneys/Field Representatives may not serve as panel members.
C.	Case Selection
1.	The national parties will mutually select approximately ten (10) to fifteen (15) grievance and/or arbitration cases to resolve. The cases selected will typically involve matters involving appraisals, minor discipline, absence and leave, including AWOL, and hours of work (e.g., AWS, credit hours, overtime). For grievances to be included, the matter must have been processed through at least the second step of the grievance process. The parties agree that the process is generally not appropriate for grievance and arbitration cases involving sensitive or complex issues, such as discrimination, adverse actions, Union rights or contract interpretation issues that will involve bargaining history testimony.
2.	The Employer and local Union representatives will meet and agree to case selection two (2) weeks prior to the Phase 1 meeting. There will be no information requests. Using Exhibit 41-1, the parties will exchange written summaries of each selected case one (1) week prior to the Phase 1 meeting. In addition to a summary of each party's position, Exhibit 41-1 may include prior settlement offers and explanations of why they were not accepted, if appropriate. Exhibit 41 -1 will be completed for settlement purposes only and will not be admissible by either party in any other proceeding, including in Phase II of this resolution procedure. No supporting documentation will be exchanged since both parties are expected to
136
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 42
possess case files.
D.	Phase I
1.	The Phase I meeting will address and attempt to resolve the selected cases over a two (2) day period. This period may be extended subject to agreement by both parties. Management and Union officials will be empowered to reach resolution.To facilitate the process, the Employer and National NTEU, at each party's own expense, may have one (1) representative present at Phase I meetings.
2.	Primarily to respond to Union questions regarding a proposed settlement and at the option of the Union, the grievant or grievants in the case of a mass grievance, may attend the Phase I meeting in person, if located in the commuting area of the meeting, dr by telephone or other electronic means if located outside the commuting area of the meeting. If the grievance selected is a mass grievance as defined by Section 5, then the provisions in subsection 5A will apply to determine the number of grievants who may attend the Phase I meeting and the Phase II arbitration.
3.	To promote the mutually desired goal of resolving cases, the Employer and local NTEU at a particular site will receive four (4) hours of joint Interest-Based Negotiation (IBN) training the first time this resolution procedure is utilized at that site. In the event that the MIRP is utilized at a particular site more than once, the parties may mutually agree to participate in subsequent IBN training. The parties will request that the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) conduct training on the first day of the Phase I meetings. If available, the FMCS representative may facilitate initial settlement discussions in order to apply what was learned in training to specific cases.
4.	To ensure closure and once agreement is reached on a case, the agreement will be immediately reduced to writing and signed by both parties. A settlement template, Exhibit 41-2, is provided for this purpose. The parties may agree to modify the template based on the circumstances of the case being settled.
5.	In the event that any case is not settled, Phase II (Arbitration) will be initiated. Arbitration will be held as soon as possible, but no later than ninety (90) days from the completion of the Phase I meetings.
E.	Phase II
1.	All cases not resolved in Phase I will be heard by an arbitrator who will be selected from the appropriate regional panel and agreed to by NTEU and GLS. The arbitrator must be fully apprised of the MIRP process, including Phase II hearing procedures. The grievant(s) must be afforded the opportunity to be present (if co-located within the commuting area of the Phase II arbitration hearing or by telephone if outside the commuting area)
for Phase II. NTEU and GLS attorneys will both be provided up to one (1) hour to present the facts and their respective arguments. Subject to the one (1) hour limitation, exhibits may be introduced and/or witnesses may be called by either party. The arbitrator will be allowed up to one (1) hour to ask questions, attempt to mediate a settlement, and, absent settlement, issue a bench ruling.There will be no transcript of the Phase II process.
2.	If an agreement is reached with the assistance of the arbitrator, the material terms will be reduced to writing immediately and signed using the settlement template, Exhibit 41-2. The parties may agree to modify the template based on the circumstances of the case being settled.
3.	If agreement cannot be reached, the arbitrator will issue a bench ruling which will be reduced to writing. The bench decision will include language that the parties are responsible for their own costs and attorney's fees, the arbitrator's fees will be split between the parties 50/50 and that the decision is non-precedential.
4.	The decision by the arbitrator may be appealed to the FLRA by either party if an assertion is made that the decision violates law or regulation.
Article 42 | Institutional Grievance Procedure
Section 1	■
Purpose
The purpose of this Article is to establish an orderly and uniform procedure for the processing and disposition of institutional grievances stemming from application of this Agreement.
Section 2
Definitions and General Provisions for Local / National Institutional Grievances
A.	"Institutional grievance" means any complaint by the Union concerning the effect or interpretation, or a claim of breach of the provisions of this Agreement relating to the rights and benefits that accrue to the Union as the exclusive representative of bargaining unit employees. Grievances on behalf of employees, or that relate to the employment of employees, or that concern any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule or regulation affecting conditions of employment of employees are not institutional grievances within the meaning of this procedure unless the provisions of subsection 4A2 apply.
B.	Grievances must be in writing, signed by the National President or appropriate Chapter President or designee, and filed with the Employer within fifteen (15) workdays
137
ARTICLE 42
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
of the incident that gives rise to the grievance, or within fifteen (15) workdays from the time the Union learned, or should have learned, of the matter out of which the grievance arose. However, where the grievance is for failure to invite the Union to a formal meeting, as provided for in 5 U.S.C. § 7114 or for alleged violations of 5 U.S.C. §§ 7116(a)(2),(3),(5),(6), and/or (7), the time limits for filing grievances shall be 180 days.
C.	A grievance must provide information concerning the nature of the grievance, the Articles and Sections of this Agreement that are alleged to have been violated, the remedy sought and present sufficient information to explain the allegations. If a grievance is filed consistent with Section 3 of this Article and alleges a violation of law or regulation, the law or regulation will be identified to the extent possible (e.g., the "Privacy Act" in lieu of the specific citation). If the grievance is filed consistent with Section 4 of this Article and alleges a violation of law or regulation, the law or regulation will be specifically identified.
D.	The time limits specified for each step of this procedure shall be computed from the day after the receipt of a grievance or an appeal by the Employer and from the day after the receipt of a response by the Union.
E.	Time limits may be extended and the grievance meeting may be waived, by written agreement of the Employer and the Union.
F.	Meetings between the Employer and the Union to process local grievances under this procedure, if not scheduled during the Union's representative's tour of duty, shall be scheduled as close to the Union's representative's tour of duty as possible, and at the office of the appropriate Employer representative, unless otherwise agreed.
G.	Whenever a local or national institutional grievance is processed where, for any reason, no meeting is held, the Employer will issue its response within twenty (20) workdays of the submission of the grievance for local grievances and within thirty (30) workdays of the submission of the grievance for national grievances.
H.	Failure by the Union to comply with the provisions of this procedure will have the effect of nullifying the grievance for lack of prosecution. Failure by the Employer to comply with the provisions of this procedure will have the effect of raising the grievance to arbitration.
Section 3
Uniform Local Institutional Grievance Procedure
A.	The grievance must be filed with the first-level executive of the Division or Campus in which the grievance arose. The Executive may then decide that the issues(s) could be more appropriately addressed by a different representative of the Employer. Any grievance that involves more than one (1) Division in a particular SCR area must be filed with the SCR with
jurisdiction over the area within which the grievance arose. If the grievance involves more than one Division or Center in more than one SCR area, it shall be treated as a national grievance under Section 4.
B.	Within ten (10) workdays of the filing of the grievance, the Employer will meet with the Chapter President or designee to discuss the grievance. The management official conducting a local institutional grievance meeting pursuant to this Article may elect to hold the meeting by telephone or other electronic means. If the Employer decides to hold a local institutional grievance meeting face-to-face, the Employer will pay the reasonable travel and per diem expenses for one (1) Union steward to attend the meeting consistent with Article 9, subsection 8B2 of this Agreement.
C.	Within twenty (20) workdays of the meeting, the Employer will issue a written response to the Chapter President. If no meeting is held, a response is due consistent with subsection 2G above.
Section 4

1.	an institutional grievance as defined in subsection 2A of this Article; or
2.	a grievance concerning an issue of rights afforded to employees under this Agreement which otherwise would be recognized as separate grievances from two (2) or more Chapters over the same issue(s).
B.	Such grievances must be in writing and filed with the Human Capital Officer within fifteen (15) workdays of the date the Union became aware, or should have become aware, of the issue grieved. U pon presentation of a proper and timely grievance under this Section, any grievance(s) on the same issue1 shall be held in abeyance. Attendance at meetings provided herein shall be limited to the parties'representatives.
C.	Within twenty (20) workdays of the filing of the grievance, a meeting will be held between representatives of the parties. The meeting will be face-to-face unless the parties mutually agree to hold the meeting by telephone or other electronic means.

138
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 43
in the grievance have been adequately identified and to seek resolution of the matter prior to the arbitration hearing. This meeting will not delay the arbitration hearing unless mutually agreed by the parties.
Section 5
Union Invoked Arbitration
A.	If the matter is not resolved following the meeting and/or written response in Section 3 or Section 4, above, the Union may invoke arbitration, including expedited or streamlined arbitration.
B.	The Union must notify the IRS of any appeal to arbitration filed by the Union. Such notice must be sent to an e-mail address established by the Employer. The e-mail address will be provided to the Union at the national level whenever changed in the future. The Union must invoke arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date it receives the final decision issued by the Employer. If a final decision was not timely rendered, the Union may invoke arbitration at any time after the date on which the decision was due and up until thirty (30) days after the decision is eventually provided.
C.	Arbitration of grievances filed under this Article shall be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 43 of this Agreement.
D.	Where the National President of the Union chooses to file a grievance, and that grievance involves an allegation of an unfair labor practice or a prohibited personnel action, the Union may invoke arbitration at the time it files the grievance and have the case assigned to an arbitrator. Absent mutual agreement, neither party may contact an arbitrator before the time the grievance response is given or otherwise due, whichever is earlier. After that time, either party may contact the arbitrator. The party making the contact will notify the other via e-mail prior to unilaterally contacting the arbitrator and the parties will attempt to schedule the hearing once either is offered dates by the arbitrator. If they cannot reach agreement within five (5) days after the first contact with the arbitrator, the arbitrator will impose a date unilaterally if either requests.The arbitrator shall impose a date no sooner than forty-five (45) days from the date the grievance response was given or due no later than seventy-five (75) days from that date, unless the arbitrator believes that despite the parties' agreement to expedite decisions on these matters, management needs more time to fairly present its case.
Section 6
Grievability, Arbitrability and New Issues
Except for questions of grievability or arbitrability, new issues not raised by either the Employer or the Union during the grievance procedure may not be raised at arbitration except by written agreement of the parties. Procedural arbitrability issues, such as timeliness and failure to adequately state
a claim, must be raised by the Employer no later than the last grievance response. However, if the issue is whether the matter is substantively arbitrable, that matter may be raised at any time by the Employer and the grievance will be amended to include the issue.

B.	1. Each party may strike up to one (1) arbitrator from the National Panel every two (2) years during the term of this Agreement by giving notice to the other party.
2.	Each party may strike up to one (1) arbitrator from each geographic panel during each calendar year by giving notice to the other party.
3.	Upon receipt of notice by the other party regarding an arbitrator struck from the national or geographic panel, no further cases will be assigned to that arbitrator, but the arbitrator will hear and decide any cases already assigned.

140
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union

7.	Procedural arbitrability issues, such as timeliness and failure to adequately state a claim, must be raised by the Employer no later than the last grievance response. However, if the issue is whether the matter is substantively arbitrable, that matter may be raised at any time by the Employer and the grievance will be amended to include the issue.
8.	The arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding and, except for expedited or streamlined awards, precedential, and the arbitrator shall possess the authority to make an aggrieved employee whole to the extent such remedy is not limited by law, including the authority to award back pay and interest in accordance with 5 C.F.R. Part 550, Subpart H (Back Pay), reinstatement, retroactive promotion where appropriate, and to issue an order to expunge the record of all references to a disciplinary, adverse, or unacceptable performance action, if appropriate. For the purposes of this Agreement, "precedential" means an interpretation of this Agreement that is binding on the bargaining unit to the extent not contrary to law and the interpretation may be given due weight by an arbitrator hearing subsequent related matters.
9.	Consistent with Article 2 of this Agreement, arbitrators must follow laws, binding Governmentwide regulations, and applicable precedents.
10.	The arbitrator will set the date of the hearing with the concurrence of the representatives of the parties. Once that date has been established, a
party may unilaterally request that the arbitrator postpone, delay or reschedule the hearing. If the arbitrator elects to do so, the requesting party shall pay any and all fees.The hearing will normally begin at 8:30 a.m. and end at 5:00 p.m., unless mutually agreed otherwise.
11.	(a) With the exception of Article 42, subsection 5D, if after thirty (30) days of invocation, the parties are unable to agree to a hearing date, either party may contact the arbitrator who is required to select the hearing date. That date will be no sooner than forty-five (45) days and not later than seventy-five (75) days from the date the arbitrator is contacted. If the arbitrator cannot provide such a date, either party will have the option of reassigning the case to the next arbitrator in the rotation.
(b) Cases for which the Union fails to contact both the assigned arbitrator and the designated hearing representative of the Employer within six (6) months of the invocation date to schedule a hearing will be considered withdrawn. The six (6) month time frame may only be extended by mutual agreement of the national parties.
12.	In any grievance where the parties mutually agree to postpone, delay, and/or cancel an arbitration proceeding, they will equally share the cost of any fees being charged by the arbitrator and/or court reporter. The fact that one party has no objection to the request of the other party for postponement, delay, or cancellation of the arbitration hearing will not absolve the requesting party from the paying of all the fees being charged.
13.	In any grievance where the parties settle the matter prior to an arbitration hearing and there are fees being charged due to the cancellation of the hearing, both parties will equally share the cost of any fees being charged unless the parties agree otherwise.
14.	The strict rules of evidence are not applicable, and the hearing shall be informal.
15.	The parties have the right to present and cross examine witnesses and issue opening and closing statements.
16.	The arbitrator may exclude testimony or evidence which is determined to be irrelevant or unduly repetitious.
17.	Testimony shall be under oath or affirmation.
18.	The arbitrator will have no authority to add to, subtract from, alter, amend, or modify any provision of this Agreement, or impose on either the Employer or the Union any limitation or obligation not specifically provided for under the terms of this Agreement. The parties reserve the right to
141
ARTICLE 43
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
take exceptions to any award to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. Awards may not include the assessment of expenses against either party other than as specified to in this Agreement.
19.	The arbitrator may draw an appropriate inference when either party fails to present facts or witnesses that the arbitrator deems necessary and relevant. If information was requested under the Contract or Statute as part of the grievance, but the information was not provided, the failure to provide the requested information will be joined as an issue in the arbitration case. The Union may ask the arbitrator to address the issue before the hearing or as part of the arbitration decision, unless the Union has previously filed an ULP over the failure to provide the information. However, nothing in this Article entitles either party to discovery, unless such discovery is authorized by law (excluding FOIA requests).
20.	The Employer will make employees available as witnesses when requested by the Union. If the Employer determines it is not administratively practicable to comply with the Union's request, and the arbitrator determines the employee's testimony is relevant, then the hearing may be postponed. However, the Union may agree to submit an affidavit in place of the direct testimony of the employee.
21.	Bargaining history may not be used in an arbitration hearing unless the party proposing to use it has notified the other in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing. If a party gives notice of intent to use bargaining history, the other party may use it without providing notice. The parties should attempt to stipulate the bargaining history of each side and bargaining history testimony may be provided via the telephone.
22.	Upon the request of either party, the parties' representatives shall meet face-to-face or by telephone no later than five (5) workdays before the date of the arbitration hearing to clarify the issues involved in the case, to discuss their proposed witnesses and the potential testimony and to discuss any exhibits they intend to introduce during the hearing. If either party intends to introduce an expert witness report during the hearing, such report must be provided to the opposing party no later than fifteen (15) days in advance of the hearing.
23.	Grievances over the same issue, heard by the same Executive and involving the same issues which are pending when grievances are assigned to
arbitrators, shall be assigned to the same arbitrator. B. The following procedures apply to conventional
arbitration cases only:
1.	Transcripts will be used in conventional arbitration cases unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. The transcript will be made by an authorized court reporter. The arbitrator and each of the parties will be provided with a copy. All costs of the transcript will be paid by the Employer.
2.	Post hearing briefs may be submitted.
C.	The following procedures apply to expedited arbitration only:
1.	expedited cases will be heard by the same arbitrators who hear conventional cases;
2.	arbitrators are encouraged to try to mediate a settlement providing it does not delay closure of the case; decisions on cases shall be issued within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing; the decisions shall not exceed four (4) pages;
3.	there will be no transcript;
4.	neither party may file written post hearing briefs;
5.	either party has the right to submit actual copies of applicable case law, for example, copies of Employer-Union arbitration decisions, and relevant court decisions, up to the close of the hearing; and
6.	bargaining history testimony may not be introduced except by agreement of the parties.
D.	The following procedures apply to streamlined arbitration only:
1.	hearings will be conducted by telephone, unless the parties agree otherwise, and will include mediation/arbitration techniques. The arbitrator will issue bench decisions, to be confirmed in writing with a summary which generally should be no more than two (2) pages in length;
2.	where the facts are not in dispute, the parties may mutually agree to submit written briefs in lieu of a hearing;
3.	there will be no transcript;
4.	neither party may file written post hearing briefs;
5.	either party has the right to submit actual copies of applicable case law, for example, copies of Employer-Union arbitration decisions, and relevant court decisions, up to the close of the hearing; and
6.	bargaining history testimony may not be introduced except by agreement of the parties.
Section 5
A.	The arbitrator shall hold the hearing notwithstanding that one party refuses to attend the arbitration. The
142
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 44
first issue to be addressed shall be the question of whether the case is properly before the arbitrator. If the case is proper, the grievance will be heard on the merits. Copies of any transcripts, briefs, and decisions will be served on the other party. The party going forward will notify the other party of its intent, listing the date and location of the hearing.
B.	Any written decision by the arbitrator will be provided to the designated representatives of the parties in both paper and electronic forms.
Section 6
In any case where an arbitrator modifies an award pursuant to a request for reconsideration made by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the parties will share equally the additional fees of such reconsideration. In cases where OPM does not finally prevail, the Employer will assume full responsibility for the additional fees of the arbitrator.
Section 7
In cases where an arbitration decision has been modified or rejected by a reviewing body solely because the remedy was ruled illegal, the case will be remanded to the arbitrator by the parties to fashion a new remedy if appropriate.
Article 44 | Attorney’s Fees
Section 1
Reasonable attorney fees will be provided to employees (the Union) who suffer unwarranted and unjust personnel actions which result in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials; if the employee (the Union) is the prevailing party and the arbitrator determines that payment of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the Employer or any case in which the Employer's action was clearly without merit, and is otherwise consistent with applicable law.
Section 2
Upon issuance of an award, the arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to determine the entitlement to attorney fees, if any. The Union may request attorney fees within twenty (20) days of the date the award is final and all appeals have been exhausted. Such a request shall be accompanied by documentation, legal argument and citation sufficient to enable the arbitrator to decide. The Union's request shall be simultaneously served on the Employer. Within twenty (20) days of receipt of the Union's request, the Employer shall submit its response. Such response shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation, legal argument and citation. The Employer's response shall be simultaneously served on the Union. The arbitrator shall decide whether to accept further rebuttal briefs.
Section 3
The arbitrator's award, which shall be final and binding, shall be issued within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Employer's response. The award shall contain a detailed explanation of why fees were granted as well as the hours and rates allowed. All charges of the arbitrator will be shared equally by the parties.

Article 46 | Labor-Management Relations Committees
Section 1
A. The parties recognize that the entrance into formal agreement with each other is but one act of joint participation and that the success of a labor-management relationship is further assured if a forum is available and used to communicate with each other.

1.	building strong relationships nationally and locally between the key leaders of each party;
2.	exchanging information;

Section 4
Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures

To preserve the benefits of such informality as well as the parties' rights to negotiate, the following principles will be followed to allow for additional consideration of issues where the local parties have not satisfactorily concluded their discussions.
B.	If it appears at any time within fifteen (15) workdays of discussion of an issue at an LMRC that a satisfactory conclusion cannot be reached on an otherwise negotiable matter, either party may refer the issue to a national representative designated by the Employer and a national representative designated by the Union for additional consideration.
C.

M.	In accordance with 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71, to the extent permitted by law, either national party may initiate midterm bargaining by proposing changes in conditions of employment provided that such changes are not covered by this or any other collective bargaining agreement between the parties, and provided further that such changes do not relate to matters over which either party has expressly waived its right to bargain during the negotiation of this Agreement.

This contact will be on the last day of scheduled bargaining or when the parties reach impasse, whichever is earlier. The parties will submit their final proposals a nd any supporting documentation to the Factfinder on a mutually agreeable date but no later than five (5) workdays prior to the initial mediation session.
(b)	The Factfinder will also rule on assertions by the Union that the Employer failed to provide information requested for the negotiations pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7114(b)(4). If the Factfinder finds that the Employer has failed to provide the information when it had a legal obligation to do so under applicable law, the Factfinder must compel the production of the information and will extend bargaining for an appropriate period of time consistent with this Article to permit the Union to consider the information and adjust proposals accordingly.
(c)	The Factfinder is empowered to assist the parties in reaching agreement. The Factfinder shall determine the appropriate resolution process, including last and best offers (Article by Article or issue by issue) or amendment of final offers.
(d)	Following mediation and factfinding pursuant to subsections 2G1 (a) through 2G1(c), the Factfinder will issue a recommendation to resolve the dispute within four (4) weeks of the initial contact with the Factfinder. The Factfinder's recommendation will be in
148
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 47
writing. If the Factfinder is not available to commence mediation within fourteen (14) days of the initial contact by either party, the next Factfinder on the list will be utilized.
(e)	Any disputes remaining after submission to the Factfinder will be resolved pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119, or other appropriate provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7101, et seq.The party that moves such remaining disputes to the statutory impasse resolution process carries the burden of proof regarding the reasons the Factfinder's report does not resolve the issue at impasse.
(f)	If either party seeks impasse resolution pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119, the changes to conditions of employment will be delayed pending resolution of the disputed issues, unless implementation is otherwise permitted by law. If a party seeks impasse resolution, the submitting party will ask the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) to expedite the matter.
(g)	If a dispute moves to the statutory process, the objecting party will pay the full costs of the Factfinder who produced the decision. Should neither party object, the costs of the Factfinder will be shared by the parties.
H.	Neutrals
The parties at the national level agree to select panels of neutrals with substantial mediation skills to mediate/arbitrate disputes arising under Sections 2, 4, 5 and 6. The parties will select neutrals so that the disputes, to the extent possible, may be resolved quickly and inexpensively.
1.	The neutrals will make use of telephonic or face-to-face dispute resolution processes when applying the impasse procedures in subsection 2G above.
2.	Dispute resolution meetings may be face-to-face for negotiations conducted consistent with Section 4 and 5, below, if participants, including the neutral, are located in the commuting area of the meeting. No travel and per diem is authorized for such meetings.
3.	At least one (1) dispute resolution meeting, not to exceed three (3) consecutive days excluding travel to and from the meeting, may be face-to-face at the request of either party, for negotiations conducted consistent with Section 2 above. The national parties may agree to additional face-to-face dispute resolution meetings consistent with the provisions of this subsection.
Section 3
Modified National Bargaining
A.	The provisions of Sections 4, 5 and 6, below, provide a basis for negotiating matters consistent with law involving: (1) the directed reassignment/realignment of employees; (2) space, furniture, parking and leases; and (3) other issues consistent with Section 6 below. All negotiations described in Sections 4, 5 and 6, below, will remain at the national level, however, to provide for more efficient and effective negotiations, the parties agree to local involvement. The local parties identified for such negotiations will act as representatives of the national parties.
B.	The Employer may elect to consolidate issues to minimize the use of official time. The location for any bargaining sessions will be determined consistent with subsection 1C above. However, the location of the bargaining will be within the geographic area of the proposed change.
Section 4
Directed Reassignments/Realignments
A.	Article 15, Sections 2 and 3 procedures will be used where the primary reason for a change is the need to reassign or realign employees, as defined in Article 15, subsection 1B2. If the modifications to the physical structure of the employee's office are incidental (e.g., minor changes to space and furniture) to the reassignment or realignment of the employee, then those incidental changes will also be addressed under this procedure.
B.	Notice
1.	Notice of proposed changes involving directed reassignments or realignments covered by Article 15, Sections 2 and 3 may be provided to the impacted Chapter Presidents at any time by the Employer. The proposed changes may be provided by the Employer individually or they may be provided as part of a group of changes. Notice will be provided by geographic area (Exhibit 47-1) to the impacted Chapters in that geographic area. The Union may ask for a briefing in contemplation of bargaining over the proposed change. The briefing must be held within ten (10) days following the notice from the Employer of the proposed changes.
2.	Notice of reassignments/realignments impacting employees in more than one (1) geographic area will be provided to the National President of NTEU. The notice may be provided at any time.

However, the parties agree that the timeline for the expedited bargaining period will be extended to ninety (90) days under Article 15, Section 2.
149
ARTICLE 48
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
Section 5
Space, Furniture, Parking and Lease Related Changes
A.	The procedures in this section will be used where the primary reason for the change involves space, leases, parking or furniture. If a reassignment or realignment is also proposed as part of the change, the reassignment/realignment will be addressed under this process.
B.	The Employer will bargain with the Union at the national level (i.e., national or modified national bargaining) to the extent required by law if free or subsidized parking is not provided to employees where employees were previously provided free or subsidized parking.
C.	The parties agree that proposed changes of a substantial nature with a timeline for completion projected by the Employer that exceeds four (4) years are not covered by this procedure. Instead, the Employer will provide notice of such changes to the NTEU National President under the provisions of Article 47, Section 2.
D.	Notice
Notice of proposed changes under this subsection in space, furniture, parking and leasing matters may be provided at any time by the Employer to the impacted Chapter Presidents. The proposed changes may be provided by the Employer individually or they may be provided as part of a group of changes. Notice will be provided by geographic area (Exhibit 47-1) to the impacted Chapters in that geographic area. Changes impacting employees in more than one (1) geographic area will be provided to the National President of NTEU under the provisions of Article 47, Section 2.
E.	Bargaining Procedures and Dispute Resolution
1.	Once a project involving a lease, space or furniture is funded by the IRS, the Employer will provide each impacted Chapter with information regarding the project, including the general scope of the project and the projected completion date.
2.	Once plans are completed by the Employer for submission to the GSA or other appropriate outside party, the Employer will provide copies to the impacted Chapters for review. The impacted Chapters may submit any comments in writing to the Employer within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the plans.
3.	Following the receipt of any comments and once the proposed plans for lease, space or furniture changes are completed, the Employer will provide formal notice to the impacted Chapters.
4.	The Union may ask for a briefing in contemplation of bargaining over the proposed change. The briefing must be held within fifteen (15) days following the notice from the Employer of the proposed changes. If a briefing is held, the Union
must submit proposals to the Employer no more than ten (10) days after the briefing. If no briefing is held, the Union must submit proposals within fifteen (15) days following the notice of the proposed change from the Employer.
5.	Bargaining will start no later than thirty (30) days following the notice of proposed changes from the Employer and must be concluded within forty-five (45) days of the notice of the proposed change. At the completion of the bargaining period, either party may utilize the impasse procedures in Section 2 above.
Section 6
A.	Changes in working conditions, limited to a single geographic area as described in Exhibit 47-1, and involving one of the issues listed below, will be negotiated consistent with the procedures in Section 4 above. Changes impacting employees in more than one (1) geographic area will be provided to the National President of NTEU under the provisions of Article 47, Section 2.

2.	changes to work procedures;
3.	reorganizations;
4.	building security and building access; and
5.	other issues agreed to by the national parties, including changes submitted on the monthly notice.
B.	At the completion of the bargaining period, either party may utilize the impasse procedures in Section 2, above, except that the time frame for the Factfinder to issue a recommendation to resolve the dispute will be within two (2) weeks of the initial contact with the Factfinder. The Factfinder's recommendation will be in writing. If the Factfinder is not available to commence mediation within seven (7) days of the initial contact by either party, the next Factfinder on the list will be utilized.
Article 48 | Furloughs
Section 1
Shutdown Furloughs Due to Lapse in Appropriations / Debt Ceiling Limitations
In the event that funds are not available through an appropriations law or continuing resolution, a shutdown furlough occurs. Such a furlough may be necessary when an agency no longer has the funds to operate and must shut down those activities which are not excepted pursuant to the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 1341 a nd 1342.
150
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 48
The following procedures will apply:
A.	The Employer will provide written notice to National NTEU when it is reasonably foreseeable that a shutdown furlough will occur.
B.	All Service employees will be furloughed except for those employees performing excepted functions or those employees whose positions are exempt. When there is more than one (1) qualified employee in the same position, grade, post of duty, and tour of duty available for an excepted position, the Employer has determined that employees will be assigned to the excepted position by inverse seniority based on enter on duty (EOD) date. The Employer will consider an employee's request not to work due to a hardship. If the employee's request is honored, the Employer has determined that the next employee, meeting the above criteria, will be assigned to the excepted position.
C.	The Service will provide local NTEU Chapters with one (1) copy of the decision letter together with a list of those employees who have been designated as excepted or those employees who are deemed to be exempt. The local parties will determine the form of and the timing for delivery of the list. Employees will be given a written document notifying them of applicability to the employee.
D.	Employees are expected to listen to radio and/or television broadcasts to learn when an appropriation or continuing resolution has been signed or when the debt ceiling has been raised. The Employer and the Union are free to negotiate, at the national level, additional methods of notifying employees about the conclusion of the furlough. Employees will then be expected to report to work no later than four (4) hours after that announcement. In the event the announcement contains instructions on reporting to work later than that, employees will be expected to follow those instructions. A liberal leave policy will be in effect on the day employees are to return to work. Employees who travel during the time of the furlough will be expected to return to work in accordance with the terms of this Article or with the more specific instructions.
E.	If an employee has"use or lose''leave scheduled during the furlough, the employee and his/her manager shall make every reasonable effort to reschedule the expiring leave during the leave year. In the event that it cannot be rescheduled, the shutdown will qualify as an exigency of the public business and the forfeited leave may be restored in accordance with IRM 6.630.1.3.3.
F.	During any fiscal year in which a furlough occurs, the Service and NTEU shall jointly issue an all-employee notice with Questions and Answers attached which will advise employees of the impact of non-pay status on civil service benefits and programs and which will address some financial concerns employees may have
when faced with a pay reduction. The Service will distribute this notice to all employees.
G.	All employees will receive from the servicing Personnel Office a fact sheet describing unemployment benefits available in their jurisdiction. At a minimum, this notice will contain information on unemployment benefits availability, the waiting period, if any, benefits eligibility requirements, and the location and phone number of State and/or municipal agencies responsible for administering the program in the local area.
H.	During the period of the furlough employees may engage in outside employment in accordance with the "Plain Talk About Ethics and Conduct." Employees may not engage in any activity prohibited therein. While in a non-pay status, such employees may engage in outside employment without obtaining prior written permission that is otherwise required. Upon return to duty status, employees must submit a written request to engage in outside employment if such activity continues.
I.	When a shutdown furlough impacts the contractual deadlines of this Agreement, all parties will be provided one (1) additional day in which to meet those contractual deadlines for each day of the furlough.
Section 2
Administrative Furlough
Consistent with 5 U.S.C. § 7511 (a)(5), a furlough means the placing of an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay because of lack of work or funds or other non-disciplinary reasons. Such furloughs will be imposed only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. The following procedures will apply when an administrative furlough is expected to last thirty (30) days (i.e., twenty-two (22) work days) or less:
A.	Formal Notice and Expedited Bargaining
1.	The Agency will provide formal notice to the Union that it has determined to conduct an administrative furlough. The notice will comply with statutory notice requirements and include the maximum number of days it intends to furlough employees; the intended time frame within which the furlough will be conducted; and a description of the employees to be furloughed. The Employer will also provide the Union with a copy of any Executive Order, if applicable, directing the Agency to implement an administrative furlough. The Parties agree that, aside from the notice and bargaining schedule, the ground rules set forth in Article 47, Section 1 will apply to furlough negotiations (e.g., team composition, reimbursement of travel and per diem, etc.).
2.	The Parties will thereafter schedule a briefing which must occur within five (5) work days of the notice. Following the briefing, bargaining will be conducted at reasonable times and conclude no
151
ARTICLE 49
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
later than ninety (90) days after the date of the notice provided to the Union in subsection 2A1 above. The time period for bargaining may be extended, as necessary, upon mutual agreement. The parties may address in bargaining any matters that are not expressly covered by this Agreement, except that matters addressed in Article 39 shall be considered appropriate subjects for bargaining.
3.	If the Parties fail to reach agreement following bargaining, the Parties will resolve any impasse through the impasse resolution procedures contained in Article 47, Section 2.
B.	Miscellaneous
1.	Employees may not substitute annual leave, sick leave, paid administrative leave, compensatory time, credit hours or any other paid leave for furlough hours.
2.	If an employee has "use or lose" leave scheduled during the furlough, the employee and their manager shall make every reasonable effort to reschedule the expiring leave during the leave year. In the event that it cannot be rescheduled, the shutdown will qualify as an exigency of the public business and the forfeited leave may be restored in accordance with IRM 6.630.1.3.3.
3.	When an administrative furlough impacts the contractual deadlines of this Agreement, all parties will be provided one (1) additional day in which to meet those contractual deadlines for each day of the furlough.
Article 49 | Transfer of Function
Section 1
Purpose and Definition
A.	This Article establishes procedures for movement of work underTransfer of Function (TOF) regulations. Any TOF will be in accordance with applicable law, rule, and regulation.
B.	A TOF means the transfer of the performance of a continuing function from one competitive area and its addition to one or more other competitive areas, except when the function involved is virtually identical to functions already being performed in the other competitive area(s) affected. A TOF is also movement of the competitive area in which the function is performed to another commuting area. In a TOF, the operation of the function must cease in one competitive area and must be carried on in an identical form in another competitive area where it was not being performed at the time of transfer.
Section 2
Notification
A.	When it is determined that a TOF is necessary, management agrees to inform the Union as far in advance as practicable, giving the reason for the action, the appropriate numbers, types and geographic location of positions affected, and the approximate date of the action. At that point the Union will be permitted to invoke negotiations over this change.
B.	The Service will notify impacted employees of the proposed TOF plan in writing.The employee will be able to consider the action and decide whether he or she will transfer with the function or not. Where the TOF is to another commuting area, the employee will not have less than ten (10) days to state his or her intentions.
C.	Affected employees may be covered under the provisions of Article 51 CTAP, and/or may be separated under provisions consistent with 5 C.F.R. §§ 752 and 351.
Article 501 Telework
Section 1
General
A. 1. Telework is a program that permits employees to work at home or at other approved locations remote to the assigned post-of-duty (POD). Telework arrangements may include working at home or in satellite office sites or other approved Telework work sites with or without computers and other electronic equipment. The assigned POD of an employee approved for Telework must be an IRS POD and may not be the employee's residence.
2.	For all Telework arrangements approved by the Employer, the Telework location must be within a 150-mile radius of the employee's assigned POD.
(a)	Exceptions may be granted on a temporary basis if the nature of the employee's work permits such an exception and approval of the temporary exception is beneficial to the Employer.
(b)	Individual requests to permanently extend the mileage limitation up to a 200-mile radius from the employee's assigned POD must be filed by National NTEU with the IRS Director, Workforce Relations Division. Denials of such requests are not grievable.
3.	If requested by the Employer, the employee must be able to report to his or her office for his or her normal tour of duty on the following workday at no cost to the Employer. Furthermore, the
152
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
ARTICLE 50
requirement to report to his or her POD could C. be for any number of workdays or consecutive workdays and will not entitle the employee to reimbursement for travel and per diem.
4.	The employee may be removed from Telework if he or she fails to report to his or her assigned POD within the locality pay area at least two (2) days each pay period; or, if his or her work location varies on a recurring basis, and he or she fails to regularly perform work within the locality pay area.
5.	A supervisor's official relationship with, authority over, and accountability for an employee participating in the Service's Telework Program is no different than his or her relationship with, authority over, and accountability for employees who are not participating in the Telework Program. Consistent with the provisions of this E. Article, the supervisor retains the authority to review, determine, and approve participation in this program.
B. Types of Telework
Employees may be eligible for Frequent Telework, Recurring Telework or Ad Hoc Telework consistent with the criteria set forth in subsections 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H and 2I of this Article.
1.	Frequent Telework involves regular and recurring duties that may be performed at the approved Telework site for more than eighty (80) hours each month. Employees approved for a Frequent Telework arrangement will be provided equipment consistent with subsections 8A and 8D of this Article.
2.	Recurring Telework involves recurring work assignments performed at the approved Telework site for eighty (80) hours or less per month. Employees approved for a Recurring Telework arrangement will be provided equipment consistent with subsections 8B and 8D of this Article. A Recurring Telework Agreement may include recurring or concurrent days each week, a single day, or a group of single days (e.g., Mondays in October, Tuesdays in November), depending on the nature of the employee's work. Management and employees may decide not to designate specific recurring days but to engage in an ongoing discussion as needed as to which days should be designated based upon the nature of the employee's work.
3.	Ad Hoc Telework involves non-recurring projects or occasional work assignments that may be performed at the approved Telework site. Employees approved for an Ad Hoc Telework F-arrangement will be provided equipment consistent with subsection 8C of this Article.
Participants will be permitted to work at home or other Telework work sites full days or a portion of a day when approved for a Telework arrangement pursuant to the provisions of this Article. Work schedules for employees participating in Telework must be consistent with the provisions of Article 23 of this Agreement. Unless as otherwise provided by this Article, there is no limitation on how the days worked on Telework may be configured as long as the scheduling is not disruptive to the work that remains in the office nor causes an unreasonable burden on those who choose not to work a Telework arrangement.
Work away from the office may vary depending upon the individual arrangements between the employee and the manager.
1.	Employee participation in the Telework Program is voluntary. Once an employee enters into a Telework Agreement, the employee may, at any time, terminate, reduce, or request to increase the number of hours and/or days on which the employee performs work at the Telework location. If such modifications change the type of Telework for which the employee has been approved (e.g., from Frequent to Recurring Telework), the employee will be required to execute a new Telework Agreement.
2.	Employees who choose to work Frequent Telework should be prepared to continue in that program for a period of at least twelve (12) months given the impact it could create by returning to the office and requiring office space. Any time an employee on Frequent Telework believes he or she needs to permanently or temporarily return to work in the IRS office, the employee will normally provide the Employer with thirty (30) days notice of the needed change, except in emergency situations such as the loss of space in the home, security reasons or lack of equipment. The Employer will make reasonable efforts to accommodate the employee's needs. Employees returning to the IRS office in these circumstances must recognize that the equipment and workstations that are made available by the Employer may not immediately be the same as the ones they had prior to participating in the Telework Program. Subject to the provisions of Article 11, Section 23 of the Agreement, the Employer is expected to provide the employee a complete work area equal or similar to that of others in his or her occupation in their assigned POD within a reasonable time frame.
Telework is not a replacement for dependent/family care.
153
ARTICLE 50
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
Section 2
Eligibility
To be considered for a Telework arrangement or to continue to work on a Telework arrangement, an employee must meet the following criteria:
A.	An employee must have been in the Service's employ for at least twelve (12) months and have a "fully successful" (or equivalent) performance appraisal. If the employee has worked for more than twelve (12) months and does not have an appraisal, he/she will be assumed to be "fully successful." If the employee is on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), he or she is not considered to be fully successful and not eligible for participation in the Telework Program.
B.	1. The employee must not have received any disciplinary/adverse action in the last twelve (12) months that would negatively impact the integrity of the Telework Program.
2.	The employee must not have received a disciplinary action for being absent without permission for more than five (5) days (at least 41 hours) in any one (1) calendar year and the record of the discipline remains in the OPF. For the purpose of this provision, "officially disciplined" means any discipline that is placed in the employee's OPF.
3.	The employee must not have ever been officially disciplined for violations of subpart G of the Standards of Ethical Conduct of Employees of the Executive Branch for viewing, downloading or exchanging pornography, including child pornography, on a Federal Government computer or while performing official Federal Government duties.
4.	If the employee's duties are changed due to a conduct investigation in which management has sufficient evidence of serious wrongdoing that would negatively impact the integrity of the Telework Program, the employee may be suspended from Telework pending resolution of the conduct investigation.
5.	If the wrongdoing as stated in subsection 2B4 is upheld by the deciding official, the Telework arrangement may be terminated if the employee had been put on notice, given an opportunity to respond and termination is appropriate.
C.	The employee must be at the journey or full working level of his or her position (e.g., Revenue Officer GS-9) or have been in the position for more than two (2) years, whichever is less. However, the supervisor may decide to shorten the two (2) year time frame in this subsection and the one (1) year service requirement in subsection 2A, above, on a case-by-case basis.
D.	The employee must have a telephone, high-speed internet or an air card from an Employer-approved provider or other technology approved by the
Employer if the work being performed at the Telework site requires IRS network connectivity; work space suitable to perform work; utilities adequate for installing equipment; and a general work environment that is free from interruptions and provides reasonable security and protection for government property. Except where the Employer provides an air card consistent with the IT profile of the employee, the cost of these will not be paid by the Service.
E.	Frequent Telework Criteria
An employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in subsections 2A through 2D, above, is assigned to one of the occupations listed in subsection 2F, below, and has regular and recurring duties that may be performed at the approved Telework site for more than eighty (80) hours each month will normally be approved for Frequent Telework upon request. However, the parties recognize that some employees in the occupations listed below may be assigned duties that are not appropriate for Frequent Telework. Therefore, the Employer reserves the right to assert on a case-by-case basis that an employee is not eligible for Frequent Telework. Such an eissertion must be based upon a determination that the employee's work at the time of the request: (1) does not encompass regular and recurring duties that can be effectively accomplished outside of the traditional office/team setting; or (2) cannot be accomplished by an employee working independently of other co-workers, support staff, and/or his or her supervisor, without any adverse impact on individual and/ or overall team or office productivity or customer service.

C.	By mutual agreement, any arbitration of a reasonable accommodation request may utilize the streamlined arbitration process outlined in Article 43. A Party experiencing a delay in the scheduling of the arbitration hearing may utilize Article 43, Section 4A11 (a) to expedite the scheduling.
D.	Nothing in this Agreement bars the granting of an additional right, benefit, or process if needed to reasonably accommodate a qualified employee with a disability where (1) the particular right, benefit or process does not conflict with the terms of this Agreement or past practice and (2) the accommodation would not adversely impact a unit employee. If the accommodation conflicts with the terms of this Agreement or past practice or requires more than a "de minimis" change in the conditions of employment of other bargaining unit employees, the Employer will serve notice and bargain to the extent required by law pursuant to the provisions of Article 15, Section 2A.

E.	Additional information regarding the Reasonable Accommodation Program of the Employer may be found on the ERC and IRS Disability Office (IDO) websites.

Computation of Direct Time
(A)	For Revenue Officers and other employees who do case-graded work, but who do not report their time by case, direct time equals weighted inventory, which is calculated as in the following example for a GS-11 Revenue Officer with 100 cases in the inventory:
# of cases	Grade of cases	; Weight	Hours '	Div by Total Hrs.	% of Time
10	12	2.0	20	150	13
80	11	1.5	120	150	80
10	9	1.0	10 .	150	7
100			150		
In this example the Revenue Officer has performed 13 percent higher graded work and would not qualify for a retroactive temporary promotion.
(B)	Revenue Officers who have been converted to! the Entity System and who report time under that System will calculate direct time as'described in (C) below for Revenue Agents. For any time prior to conversion, Revenue Officers will calculate direct time as in (A) above.
(C)	For Revenue Agents and other employees who do case-graded work, and who : rbport their time by case, direct time is the hours reported on each case. Therefore, a GS-11 Revenue Agent must total the hours charged to all cases by grade and determine whether the hours charged to GS-12 and above cases constitute 25% or more of the total direct time worked over the qualifying period of time.
(D)	For other employees who do not do case-graded work or who dp not report time in any: way that is grade-based or grade-determinative, direct time is all total time in the qualifying period of time minus:	;
(1)	sick, annual and other leave,
(2)	holidays, :
(3)	time spent in training as eitherstudent or
instructor,
(4)	collateral duty time, such as time spent on union duties, and
(5)	time spent on other activities not directly related to the productive work of the employee.

EXHIBIT 16-2

Key Elements Related to Higher Graded Duties
A.	Employees who perform supervisory/managerial duties will receive a temporary promotion for the time spent performing those duties if:
1.	the supervisory/managerial position is at a higher grade than the employee.
2.	the employee performs the duties for one full pay period or more.
3.	the employee is eligible for promotion.
B.	An employee who is detailed to a higher graded managerial position for one (1) full pay period or more will be temporarily promoted, if eligible. If the employee performed higher graded work in addition to the detail to the higher graded managerial position, the length of time the employee is entitled to a retroactive temporary promotion will be determined as follows:
1.	determine the length of time on a pay period by pay period basis the employee was detailed to the managerial position;
2.	determine the percentage of time spent performing higher graded duties in the remainder of the four (4) month period;
3.	if the time spent performing higher graded duties in the remainder of the four (4) month period equals or exceeds 25%, the employee will receive a temporary promotion for the full four (4) months;
4.	if the time spent performing higher graded duties in the remainder of the time is less than 25%, and if adding the time spent performing the managerial duties does not bring it up to 25%, the employee will receive a temporary promotion on a pay period by pay period basis only for the time spent performing managerial duties;
5.	ifthe time spent performing higher graded duties in the remainder of the time is less than 25%, and if adding the time spent performing the managerial duties causes it to equal or exceed 25%, the employee will receive a temporary promotion on a pay period by pay period basis for the time spent performing the managerial duties and consideration will be given to a Special Act Award, as provided for in Article 18, for the amount of time not otherwise compensated.
809/810 Time
The 809 and 810 time (which are time-reporting categories in the Collection Entity Program) will be considered to constitute the same percentage of higher graded duties as applicable to direct time during the corresponding time frame. For example, if in a six month period an individual's direct time consists of 30% higher graded duties, the 809 and 810 time for that six month period will be assumed to consist of 30% higher graded duties. The employee will be credited for higher graded 809/810 time at the same ratio as other direct time when calculating eligibility for higher graded pay.
Mass Grievances
The parties agree that mass grievances are legitimate grievances that must be addressed by the IRS. However, such grievances cannot be adequately addresses and/or settled prior to disclosure of all relevant information by the Union. NTEU National Office will advise local chapters to provide any and all specific information that they have related to these cases.
Large Case/Actuarial Duties/CAP/Girand Jury/ Trial and Appeal Assistance
If the Service can demonstrate, through the existing work record, that an individual was assigned duties commensurate to his or her grade level when working the above referenced types of cases (e.g., one employee worked solely lower graded issues while emother employee worked higher graded issues), then those duties shall not be considered higher graded duties. If, however, the Service cannot demonstrate through the existing work record, that an individual was assigned duties commensurate to his or her grade when working the above referenced types of cases, then those duties will be considered to be at the grade level designation of the cases as a whole, and the time spent on the case by the individual shall be considered higher graded duty for the duration of the time spent on the case.
Minimum Direct
The criteria for cases in which individuals have worked a drastically small amount of direct time over a six month period (of which over 25% of the direct time was spent on higher graded duties), while the rest of the duties constituted indirect time, is as follows:
Ifthe employee spent less than 25% of his or her total time on direct time over a 12 month period, then the higher graded duties will be compensated on a pay period basis will be applied. For example, in a 6 month period, an employee may have worked only 10 hours of direct time, 6 of which were spent on higher graded work. This employee spent less than 25% of the total time on direct time in the six month period. Therefore, the employee will be compensated on a pay period basis. Assuming all 10 hours are in the same pay period, this employee will receive a temporary promotion for one pay period.
Highest Previous Rate
An employee who has received a temporary promotion for two contiguous full six month periods (i.e., 365 days) shall be deemed to have fulfilled all requirements related to and shall be granted highest previous rate for as long as IRM 0531.56 is in effect.

EXHIBIT 19-2
Reassignment Preference Policy
The Reassignment Preference Policy (RPP) is a mitigation strategy that affords maximum placement opportunities for employees directly impacted by an approved realignment or reorganization initiative that may or may not result in a Reduction in Force (RIF).
The RPP is designed to facilitate voluntary placement into permanent bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit positions at or below the employee's current grade before CES letters are issued, CTAP rights attach, or the effective date of an approved realignment, reorganization, or competitive sourcing initiative. Selections under RPP will be made without regard to bargaining unit status. This policy covers all positions Service-wide, bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit, regardless of the procedure used fill the positions.
The RPP does not apply to positions announced as temporary “not to exceed” or temporary “may be made permanent.” Prior approval is required from the Division Commissioner, Business Head or executive designee at an equivalent level to announce any permanent position as temporary “not to exceed” or temporary “may be made permanent” to ensure the availability of as many placement opportunities as possible.
The process will remain in effect until directly impacted employees are placed into a continuing position or issued a certificate of expected separation (CES), an official Career Transition Assistance Program (CTAP) notice, a RIF notice or any notice that provides selection priority or because of the mitigation strategies there are no longer employees in the competitive area who are “directly impacted” and a RIF will not be necessary.
This process requires an employee to apply for vacancies at the same or lower grade and work schedule (e.g. permanent to permanent; seasonal to seasonal) as their current position, both within and outside the commuting area. The same or lower grade position is defined as a position having no greater promotion potential than that currently held by the employee on a permanent basis.
Under the RPP, a vacancy is defined as any position the Agency is filling regardless of whether a vacancy announcement is issued unless one of the exceptions identified in 5 CFR 330.609 exists. That is, the same exceptions applicable to filling vacancies under 5 CFR 330, Subpart F will be applicable to the reassignment preference process. Vacancies not exempt from this program will be announced as long as there are directly impacted employees at or below the grade of the position to be filled.
A Reassignment Preference Notice will be issued to directly impacted employees to document eligibility and for use when applying for vacancies under this
process. Reassignment Preference applicants must meet qualification requirements for the vacancy and must have a Fully Successful or higher overall rating on their last annual performance appraisal.
Vacancy announcements must indicate whether moving expenses will be authorized. Moving expenses will only be paid when indicated in the vacancy announcement. All Reassignment Preference applicants who apply for a vacancy will be considered. If the selection certificate contains a Reassignment Preference employee(s) who meets all the requirements, the employee must be selected. If there are two (2) or more Reassignment Preference applicants on the priority reassignment roster, and the selecting official does not wish to select the candidate with the earliest IRS EOD, management will competitively rank the Reassignment Preference candidates before making a selection. Once the candidates are ranked, the selecting official may select any of the reassignment preference candidates.
Employees who voluntarily apply and are selected for a position not more than three (3) grades or three (3) grade intervals below their position of record, will receive the grade and pay retention, provided the employee meets all regulatory requirements.
Reassignment Preference Process
1.	The Business Unit will issue a Reassignment Preference letter to all identified directly impacted employees. The letter will outline their Reassignment Preference eligibility, if selected for a lower graded position.
(a)	The Business Unit is responsible for identifying and tracking their directly impacted employees in order to confirm Reassignment Preference entitlements. Copies of the reassignment certificates/ rosters will be provided to the Chapter Presidents in accordance with Article 13.
(b)	The Business Unit is responsible for rescinding Reassignment Preference letters when initiatives or positions are no longer directly impacted.
2.	The employee must apply for a vacancy. In order to receive consideration under this Process, a copy of the Reassignment Preference Notices must be attached to the employee's application.
3.	Management will accept applications from all employees. Special programs must be cleared in accordance with the National Agreement, Article 13, Subsection 2E. Reassignment Preference candidates will be considered in the priority provided for in Article 13, Subsection 2E.
4.	Management will refer Reassignment Preference

candidates to the selecting official in IRS EOD order. If the selecting official decides not to select the Reassignment Preference candidate with the earliest IRS EOD, management will then rank Reassignment Preference candidates using ranking procedures in accordance Article 13 of the National Agreement.
5.	Once ranked, all candidates will be referred in score order to the selecting official in accordance with Article 13 of the National Agreement. Tied scores will be broken by using IRS EOD.
6.	Any Reassignment Preference candidate referred can be selected. Selection of a Reassignment Preference candidate is required, absent just cause and subject to paragraph 7 below.
7.	Written approval by a Division Commissioner; Business Unit Head, or executive designee is required to:
(a)	non-select a Reassignment Preference candidate; or
(b)	cancel an announced vacancy if Reassignment Preference candidates are available.
8.	The Employer has determined that selections for vacant positions that were announced and closed as of the date directly impacted employees receive their RPNs, but where a certificate has not yet been issued to the selecting official, will be delayed in those instances where the vacancy is for the same series and same grade and the same work schedule (e.g. permanent to permanent; seasonal to seasonal to seasonal) as the position of the directly impacted employee and is in the commuting area of a directly impacted employee unless:
(a)	the Employer has a compelling need (e.g., workload and/or training schedules are disrupted) to fill the position in the interim;
(b)	other employees in the commuting area of the RIF hold a higher priority (e.g., CTAP, Priority Placement); or
(c)	other employees in the commuting area of the RIF currently hold RPN letters.
If there are a greater number of vacancies than the number of directly impacted employees who have applied, an equal number of vacancies may be set aside for those directly impacted employees and any excess positions may be filled through the procedures of Article 13 of the National Agreement. Directly impacted employees (within or outside of the commuting area) will be provided a short window (no less than five (5) workdays) to apply for the previously announced positions after the receipt of their RPN. The window will be announced on the Career Opportunity Listing (COL).
9.	Remaining vacancies can be filled through other competitive/non-competitive sources if there are no available Reassignment Preference candidates for the announced position.
10.	A Reassignment Preference candidate who is selected for a permanent position at the same or lower grade:
(a)	will have five (5) workdays from the date of selection to accept or decline the offer within the commuting area, if accepted, the reassignment or change to lower grade action will be effective at the beginning of the next pay period and the Reassignment Preference Letter will be rescinded; and
(b)	will have seven (7) workdays from the date of selection to accept or decline the offer outside the commuting area, and, if accepted, the reassignment or change to lower grade action will be effective no later than 60 days after selection.
11.	An employee may decline up to two (2) offers from outside the commuting area that would require a move and decline one offer from within the commuting area. Any declination after that will result in loss of the Reassignment Preference eligibility.

Section 5
Process for Telephone Employees
A.	The percentage of staffing on approved CWS RDO on any given day of the week will be determined at the national level based on the telephone AWS methodology specified in subsection 5G7, below. The Employer will provide NTEU National with the information used to determine the allowable CWS as described in subsection 5G, Steps 1,2, and 3, below. The Employer will provide this information to NTEU National before the two annual opportunities to change.
B.	The Employer will run the methodology as indicated in subsection 4B, above. Any expansion of RDOs will be allocated as described in subsection 5G (Step 3), below.
C.	The following process will be used in allocating the CWS:
1.	Using the percentage allocated; the Employer at the local level and the respective NTEU Chapter President will be advised of the number of employees who may take an RDO for each work day.
2.	The Employer has determined that the local NTEU Chapter President will determine the ratio of 4/10 work schedules to 5/4-9 work schedules, e.g., forty percent (40%) will be 4/10 and sixty percent (60%) will be 5/4-9.
3.	The chapter will communicate the distribution to the Employer at the local level within five (5) workdays of receiving the total number of RDOs available.
4.	If no ratio is communicated timely, the ratio will be thirty-three percent (33%) of the available RDOs assigned to a 4/10 schedule and sixty-seven percent (67%) of the available RDOs allocated to a 5/4-9 schedule.
5.	After the RDOs are allocated, the Employer will determine the start times for all TODs and the number of RDOs on any given day using the process in subsection 5G, STEP 4, below.
D.	In accordance with Article 23, subsection 6B1, subsection 4B above, and the AWS telephone methodology in subsection 5G, below, changes may be made to start times, stop times, increasing or decreasing the number of CWS schedules (4/10 and 5/4-9), and/or RDO of an employee consistent with subsection 6, below.
E.	The Employer will not increase or decrease the number of Enterprise RDO slots unless there is more than a one (1) percentage point change in the national total allowable CWS percentage per day. Moreover, the Employer will try to meet workload demands, and may consider offering overtime, compensatory time, etc., to mitigate the situation.
200
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
EXHIBIT 23-1
F.	Notwithstanding Article 23 subsection 7F, if the Employer determines to change AWS, the following procedures will be used:
1.	If there is an increase in CWS:
(a)	AWS TODs will be offered within each shift.
(b)	AWS will be offered in seniority order.
2.	If there is a decrease in CWS:
(a)	Employees not grandfathered into CWS whose TOD or RDO are impacted by the need for change will be asked to volunteer to change unless all employees with that start or stop time or certain RDO are needed to change.
(b)	If insufficient volunteers are available, inverse EOD will be used to change the start time, stop time, specific RDO, and/or decrease RDO slots. Employees not grandfathered would be removed by inverse EOD and will be placed back on the solicitation list by IRS EOD.
G.	The methodology for determining CWS availability for telephone employees is as follows:
STEP 1: Determine available employees at the national level
(a)	Capture total number of hours that represent all bargaining unit employees that are telephone trained (excluding leads). This number is derived by establishing telephone hours of operation for the various sites and including telephone trained employees who currently work outside of those hours.
(b)	Subtract: Overhead related to bargaining unit employees (sick leave annual leave, read time, training, meeting time, breaks, etc.).
(c)	Subtract: Other non-telephone hours (hours when employees are available but where telephone is not available, or telephone duties not worked).
(d)	Result: Available hours to perform the workload.
(e)	Divide available hours by eight (8) to determine employees available by day for telephone work.
STEP 2: Determine employees needed per day based on workload at the national level
(a)	Capture historical workload hours and current trending to determine the scheduled hours needed per day for telephones.
(b)	Divide hours by eight (8) to determine employees required by day.
(c)	Compare the number of employees available for work, Step 1e, to the number required, Step 2b, to determine whether RDOs are available and if so quantify them.
STEP 3: Allocate the RDO slots to operation sites at the national level
(a)	Determine the number of allowable CWS by day and Enterprise.
(b)	Subtract the actual number of CWS on each RDO currently in place to determine the amount of CWS to be allocated or removed.
(c)	The specific number of RDOs are assigned according to telephone trained (e.g., Customer Service Representatives (CSR)) employee population per site and the Lead CSR, Tax Law Specialist (TLS) and Taxpayer Service Specialist (TSS) group per site. The Site’s population of telephone trained employees divided by the Enterprise population of telephone trained employees.

	it is not practicable under the circumstances to provide the requested medical certification within 15 calendar days, despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must submit the medical certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the Employer requested the medical certification. (5)	If leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth or placement for adoption or foster care, the employee shall provide notice of his or her intention to take leave not less than 30 calendar days before the date the leave is to begin. If the date of birth or placement requires leave to begin with 30 calendar days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable. (6)	In the case of intermittent leave for planned medical treatment, the medical certification must include the dates (actual or estimates) on which such treatment is expected to be given, the duration of such treatment, and the period of recovery, if any, or specify that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown duration and whether the employee is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity. Leave taken to care for a child following birth or following the placement of a child through adoption or foster care may not be taken intermittently unless the employee and the Employer agree. (7)	When the employee requests basic FMLA leave, the Employer will provide the employee with either Form WH-380-E (Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health Condition) or Form WH-380-F (Certification of Health Care Provider for Family member's Serious Health Condition); and Form 9611 (Application for Leave Under the Family and Medical Leave Act).

Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Military Family Leave
	Family & Medical Leave (FMLA) Military Family Leave Summary of 5 C.F.R. § 630 Subpart L 26-week Entitlement
Generally	Section 585(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2008 amended the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to provide twenty-six (26) administrative workweeks of military family leave entitlements to care for a servicemember with a serious illness or injury incurred in the line of duty.
Description	Permits employees to use: •	26 administrative workweeks (1,040 hours for full-time employees) of unpaid (LWOP) FMLA military family leave during a single 12-month period for family members to provide care for a covered servicemember undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. •	Part-time employees are eligible for a pro-rated amount of FMLA military family leave. For part time employees, the amount of this leave granted may not exceed an amount equal to 26 times the average number of hours in his or her scheduled tour of duty each week, (e.g., an employee who works 20 hours a week may use a maximum of 520 hours. 20/hr. week X 26 = 520 total)
Application of the Single 12-month Period	The "single 12-month period" for FMLA military family leave begins on the first day the employee takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends 12 months after that date. Any leave under the regular 12-week FMLA entitlement used outside of this single 12-month period for FMLA military family leave does not count against the 26-week entitlement for FMLA military family leave. Examples: (1)	If an employee who invokes 26 weeks of FMLA military family leave during a single 12-month period does not use any regular FMLA leave during that same period, the employee is still eligible to use up to 12 weeks of regular FMLA leave immediately following the single 12-month period used for FMLA military family leave. (2)	If an employee invokes 26 weeks of FMLA military family leave and then four weeks into the single 12-month period, invokes entitlement to 12 weeks of regular FMLA for maternity reasons, the employee is entitled to a maximum of 26 weeks of both types of FMLA leave within the "single 12-month period." The 12 weeks used under the regular FMLA is subtracted from the combined entitlement to 26 weeks, leaving the employee with a total of 14 weeks of FMLA military family leave to care for the covered servicemember during the single 12-month period. (3)	If an employee exhausts 12 weeks of regular FMLA leave, then invokes entitlement to 26 weeks of FMLA military family leave to care for a covered servicemember, the time period during which the employee used regular FMLA leave does not count toward the 26-week entitlement for FMLA military family leave during military family leave single 12-month period. The employee, under these circumstances, would be entitled up to a maximum 38 weeks of FMLA leave over an extended period, not to exceed the period 12 months from the first date he or she invoked the 26-week entitlement for FMLA military family leave.
Who is Eligible	• Any employee who (1) is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (defined as the nearest blood relative) of a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness; (2) is covered by the Federal Leave system; and (3) has completed 12 consecutive or nonconsecutive months of Federal service.

Ground Rules for the 2018 National Agreement Midterm Reopener Negotiations between Internal Revenue Service and Nationall Treasury Employees Union
1.	This agreement is entered into pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7101, etseq., and serves as the procedural ground rules governing term bargaining between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Employer) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU or Union) over a midterm reopener agreement to the 2016 National Agreement.
2.	The parties will exchange written proposals on September 29, 2017.
3.	Proposals may include amendments to five (5) current articles and two (2) new articles proposed by each party, as well as Article 9. In addition, either party may propose ground rules for the 2021 successor term negotiations. Such ground rules will contain a mediation/factfinding process unless the Parties mutually agree otherwise. These ground rules will be in addition to the seven (7) articles that can be opened by either party.
4.	Proposals may be amended or modified during bargaining. Such amendments or modifications must be consistent with Article 47 of the National Agreement.
5	Bargaining will be conducted for five weeks (all non-contiguous, unless mutually agreed otherwise) between October 16, 2017, and January 12, 2018. The parties will schedule the times and dates for bargaining within that time frame.
6.	If needed, mediation/arbitration will be conducted between January 22, 2018, and February 9, 2018. The parties will schedule mediation/arbitration times and dates during that time frame. Unless mutually agreed otherwise, the parties will schedule mediation during the week of January 22,2018 and, if necessary, factfinding during the week of February 5,2018.
7.	Normally, face-to-face bargaining will be conducted from 1:00 p.m.to 5:00 p.m.on the first day of each session and 9:00 a.m. to Noon on the last day of each session. Otherwise, face-to-face bargaining will begin at 9:00 a.m. and end at to 4:30 p.m.. Federal holidays will be observed. The parties may agree to expand these time frames based upon the need to facilitate resolution of issues through the collective bargaining process to include bargaining on weekends, nights and holidays.
8.	The negotiations will be conducted in hotel space located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area or in IRS and/or NTEU office space in Washington, D.C.
If hotel space is used and if practical, the hotel space will be the same, or in close proximity to the hotels housing the IRS and NTEU bargaining teams and the hotel(s) will be in close proximity to a Metro subway station. The cost of meeting rooms (including caucus space) if any, will be shared equally by the parties consistent with past practice, except that NTEU will not be responsible for any space/equipment used by IRS support teams. NTEU will be afforded the opportunity to agree to any terms of the hotel contract that result in expenditures by NTEU.
9.	By mutual agreement and to expedite bargaining and facilitate the resolution of issues, the parties may conduct simultaneous bargaining at certain times and places to be agreed upon during any portion of the bargaining. Bargaining may also include the use of mini-bargaining teams.
10.	If an impasse remains following the last bargaining session (or sooner if the parties mutually agree), the parties will employ the services of a neutral third party Factfinder to use a combination of mediation and arbitration techniques to resolve any impasses. Prior to October 16,2017, the parties will select a Factfinder pursuant to the following process. The Parties will obtain a list from FMCS or AAA of eleven (11) neutrals who meet the following criteria:
a)	At least ten (10 years of experience in Federal sector mediation and arbitration);
b)	Must be an attorney;
c)	Must be a National Academy member; and d) Can be located anywhere in CONUS.
The procured list will be retained by FMCS or AAA. Each Party may submit a list of three (3) additional neutrals (who meet the same criteria listed above) to FMCS or AAA. The final list will be compiled by FMCS or AAA and distributed simultaneously to the parties. Not less than five (5) days after receiving the list, the parties will alternately strike one (I) name at a time from the list until only one (1) name remains. The parties agree that the remaining name will serve as the Factfinder. The party to make the first strike will be chosen through a coin toss. The work of the third party neutral Factfinder will include holding hearings on issues in dispute and the preparation of a written Factfinder's report with recommendations.
11.	The Factfinder will issue a final recommendation no later than February 23, 2018.
248
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
EXHIBIT 54-1
12.	The parties will have five (5) workdays from the receipt of the Factfinder's report to decide whether to accept the report in whole or part, or not at all. Thereafter, if a final resolution of the issues in dispute is not achieved, the procedures in Paragraph 13, below, will be followed.
13.	Any dispute remaining after receipt of the Factfinder's report will be resolved pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119 or other appropriate provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7101, etseq. Either party may move remaining disputes to the statutory impasse resolution process.
14.	The fees and expenses of the third party neutral utilized by the parties will be shared equally. However, in the event a party objects to the Factfinder's recommendation and either party requests the assistance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) to finally resolve the dispute, the objecting party will pay the full costs of a single mediator/arbitrator.
15.	Official time will be authorized for a maximum of seven (7) bargaining unit employees representing NTEU during negotiations and for travel to and from the negotiations during the time the employee would otherwise be in a duty status. There is no limit on the number of NTEU national staff or national elected officials on NTEU's bargaining team.
16.	Each party may have legal counsel during negotiations and impasse procedures. The parties also agree that each may have observers and consultants present during negotiations, mediation and arbitration, but not seated at the main bargaining table. As a matter of professional courtesy, observers and consultants will be identified at the beginning of each bargaining session.
17.	Generally, the parties will bear the costs of their own travel and per diem except that the Employer will pay for travel and per diem for up to seven (7) bargaining unit employees to participate in negotiations,
mediation and arbitration and to participate in any procedure conducted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7119 or other provisions of 5 U.S.C. § 7101, etseq.
18.	Travel and per diem (which includes lodging, meals and incidentals) will be reimbursed in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations.
19.	If a party relies upon documentary evidence to support a proposal, copies of such documentation will be timely provided to the other party upon request.
20.	Prior to the beginning of bargaining, the parties will identify the names of the members of their respective bargaining teams. Bargaining team members must be identified in time to permit the issuance of travel orders.
21.	All agreements reached on individual issues are tentative. Such agreement on issues must be committed to writing and initialed by each party's chairperson. There will be no final agreement on the issues as a whole until all issues are agreed. Thereafter, implementation will follow ratification by NTEU according to its bylaws and the approval of the agreement by the Department of the Treasury pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 7114. The ratification process will not negate any term lawfully imposed during the impasse resolution process unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.
22.	Proposals declared non-negotiable by the Department of theTreasury or moved to the statutory impasse process will not delay the effective date of the remaining provisions.The Union will be notified in writing by the Employer if any provisions are declared non-negotiable by the Department of theTreasury.
23.	Consistent with Article 47, subsection IF, the parties recognize that publicity concerning issues being negotiated has a detrimental impact on the bargaining process.

Title 26. Internal Revenue
Chapter I. Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury
Subchapter H. Internal Revenue Practice
Part 801. Balanced System for Measuring Organizational and Employee Performance Within the Internal Revenue Service
§ 801.1	Balanced performance measurement system; in general.
(a) In general. (1) The regulations in this part 801 implement the provisions of sections 1201 and 1204 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (Pub.L. 105-106, 112 Stat. 685, 715-716, 722) (the Act) and provide rules relating to the establishment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of a balanced performance measurement system.
(2) Modern management practice and various statutory and regulatory provisions require the IRS to set performance goals for organizational units and to measure the results achieved by those units with respect to those goals. To fulfill these requirements, the IRS has established a balanced performance measurement system, composed of three elements: Customer Satisfaction Measures; Employee Satisfaction Measures; and Business Results Measures. The IRS is likewise required to establish a performance evaluation system for individual employees.
(b) [Reserved]
801.2	Measuring organizational performance.
The performance measures that comprise the balanced measurement system will, to the maximum extent possible, be stated in objective, quantifiable, and measurable terms and will be used to measure the overall performance of various operational units within the IRS. In addition to implementing the requirements of the Act, the measures described here will, where appropriate, be used in establishing performance goals and making performance evaluations established, inter alia, under Division E, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996) (Pub.L. 104-106,110 Stat. 186,679); the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Pub.L. 103-62, 107 Stat. 285); and the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (Pub.L. 101-576, 108 Stat. 2838). Thus, organizational measures of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and business results (including quality and quantity measures as described in § 801.6T) may be used to evaluate the performance of or to impose or suggest production goals for, any organizational unit.
§	801.3 Measuring employee performance.
(a)	In general. All employees of the IRS will be evaluated according to the critical elements and standards or such other performance criteria as may be established for their positions. In accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 4312, 4313, and 9508 and section 1201 of the Act, the performance criteria for each position as are appropriate to that position, will be composed of elements that support the organizational measures of Customer Satisfaction, Employee Satisfaction, and Business Results; however, such organizational measures will not directly determine the evaluation of individual employees.
(b)	Fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers. In addition to all other criteria required to be used in the evaluation of employee performance, all employees of the IRS will be evaluated on whether they provided fair and equitable treatment to taxpayers.
(c)	Senior Executive Service and special positions. Employees in the Senior Executive Service will be rated in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 4312 and 4313 and employees selected to fill positions under 5 U.S.C. 9503 will be evaluated pursuant to workplans, employment agreements, performance agreements, or similar documents entered into between the IRS and the employee.
(d)	General workforce. The performance evaluation system for all other employees will—
(1)	Establish one or more retention standards for each employee related to the work of the employee and expressed in terms of individual performance;
(2)	Require periodic determinations of whether each employee meets or does not meet the employee's established retention standards;
(3)	Require that action be taken in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, with respect to employees whose performance does not meet the established retention standards;
(4)	Establish goals or objectives for individual performance consistent with the IRS's performance planning procedures;
(5)	Use such goals and objectives to make performance distinctions among employees or groups of employees; and
(6)	Use performance assessments as a basis for granting employee awards, adjusting an employee's rate of basic pay, and other appropriate personnel actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
(e) Limitations. (1) No employee of the IRS may use records of tax enforcement results (as described in § 801.6) to evaluate any other employee or to impose or suggest production quotas or goals for any employee.
251
APPENDIX I
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
(i)	For purposes of the limitation contained in this paragraph (e), employee has the meaning as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105(a).
(ii)	For purposes of the limitation contained in this paragraph (e), evaluate includes any process used to appraise or measure an employee's performance for purposes of providing the following:
(A)	Any required or requested performance rating.
(B)	A recommendation for an award covered by Chapter 45 of Title 5; 5 U.S.C. 5384; or section 1201 (a) of the Act.
(C)	An assessment of an employee's qualifications for promotion, reassignment, or other change in duties.
(D)An assessment of an employee's eligibility for incentives, allowances, or bonuses.
(E) Ranking of employees for release/recall and reductions in force.
(2)	Employees who are responsible for exercising judgment with respect to tax enforcement results in cases concerning one or more taxpayers may be evaluated on work done on such cases only in the context of their critical elements and standards.
(3)	Performance measures based in whole or in part on quantity measures (as described in § 801.6) will not be used to evaluate the performance of any non-supervisory employee who is responsible for exercising judgment with respect to tax enforcement results (as described in § 801.6).
§ 801.4	Customer satisfaction measures.
The customer satisfaction goals and accomplishments of operating units within the IRS will be determined on the basis of information gathered through various methods. For example, questionnaires, surveys and other types of information gathering mechanisms may be employed to gather data regarding customer satisfaction. Information to measure customer satisfaction for a particular work unit will be gathered from a statistically valid sample of the customers served by that operating unit and will be used to measure, among other things, whether those customers believe that they received courteous, timely, and professional treatment by the IRS personnel with whom they dealt. Customers will be permitted to provide information requested for these purposes under conditions that guarantee them anonymity. For purposes of this section, customers may include individual taxpayers, organizational units, or employees within the IRS and external groups affected by the services performed by the IRS operating unit.
§ 801.5	Employee satisfaction measures.
The employee satisfaction numerical ratings to be given operating units within the IRS will be determined on the basis of information gathered through various methods. For example, questionnaires, surveys, and other information gathering mechanisms may be employed to gather data
regarding satisfaction. The information gathered will be used to measure, among other factors bearing upon employee satisfaction, the quality of supervision and the adequacy of training and support services. All employees of an operating unit will have an opportunity to provide information regarding employee satisfaction within the operating unit under conditions that guarantee them anonymity.
§ 801.6	Business results measures.
(a)	In general. The business results measures will consist of numerical scores determined under the quality measures and the quantity measures described elsewhere in this section.
(b)	Quality measures. Quality measures will be determined on the basis of a review by a specially dedicated staff within the IRS of a statistically valid sample of work items handled by certain functions or organizational units determined by the Commissioner or his delegate such as the following:
(1)	Examination and collection units and Automated Collection System Units (ACS). The quality review of the handling of cases involving particular taxpayers will focus on such factors as whether IRS personnel devoted an appropriate amount of time to a matter, properly analyzed the facts, and complied with statutory, regulatory, and IRS procedures, including timeliness, adequacy of notifications, and required contacts with taxpayers.
(2)	Toll-free telephone sites. The quality review of telephone services will focus on such factors as whether IRS personnel provided accurate tax law and account information.
(3)	Other work units. The quality review of other work units will be determined according to criteria prescribed by the Commissioner or his delegate.
(c) Quantity measures. Quantity measures will consist of outcome-neutral production and resource data that does not contain information regarding the tax enforcement result reached in any case that involves particular taxpayers. Examples of quantity measures include, but are not limited to-
(1)	Cases started;
(2)	Cases closed;
(3)	Work items completed;
(4)	Customer education, assistance, and outreach efforts completed;
(5)	Time per case;
(6)	Direct examination time/out of office time;
(7)	Cycle time;
(8)	Number or percentage of overage cases;
(9)	Inventory information;
252
2016 National Agreement | Internal Revenue Service and National Treasury Employees Union
APPENDIX I
(10)	Toll-free level of access; and
(ll)Talktime.
(d) Definitions--(l) Tax enforcement results. A tax enforcement result is the outcome produced by an IRS employee's exercise of judgment in recommending or determining whether or how the IRS should pursue enforcement of the tax laws. Examples of tax enforcement results include a lien filed, a levy served, a seizure executed, the amount assessed, the amount collected, and a fraud referral. Examples of data that are not tax enforcement results include a quantity measure and data derived from a quality review or from a review of an employee's or a work unit's work on a case, such as the number or percentage of cases in which correct examination adjustments were proposed or appropriate lien determinations were made.
(2) Records of tax enforcement results. Records of tax enforcement results are data, statistics, compilations of information or other numerical or quantitative recordations of the tax enforcement results reached in one or more cases. Such records may be used for purposes such as forecasting, financial planning, resource management, and the formulation of case selection criteria. Records of tax enforcement results may be used to develop methodologies and algorithms for use in selecting tax returns to audit. Records of tax enforcement results do not include tax enforcement results of individual cases when used to determine whether an employee exercised appropriate judgment in pursuing enforcement of the tax laws based upon a review of the employee's work on that individual case.
§801.7 Examples.
(a) The rules of § 801.3 are illustrated by the following examples:
Example 1. (i) Each year Division A's Examination and Collection functions develop detailed workplans that set goals for specific activities (e.g., number of audits or accounts closed) and for other quantity measures such as cases started, cycle time, overage cases, and direct examination time. These quantity measure goals are developed nationally and by Area Office based on budget allocations, available resources, historical experience, and planned improvements. These plans also include information on measures of quality, customer satisfaction, and employee satisfaction. Results are updated monthly to reflect how each organizational unit is progressing against its workplan, and this information is shared with all levels of management.
(ii)	Although specific workplans are not developed at the Territory level, Headquarters management expects the Area Directors to use the information in the Area plans to guide the activity in their Territories. For 2005, Area Office 1 's workplan has a goal to close 1,000 examinations of small business corporations and 120,000 taxpayer delinquent accounts (TDAs), and there are 10 Exam Territories and 12 Collection Territories in Area Office 1.
While taking into account the mix and priority of workload, and available staffing and grade levels, the Examination Area Director communicates to the Territory Managers the expectation that, on average, each Territory should plan to close about 100 cases. The Collection Area Director similarly communicates to each Territory the expectation that, on average, they will close about 10,000 TDAs, subject to similar factors of workload mix and staffing.
(iii)	Similar communications then occur at the next level of management between Territory Managers and their Group Managers, and between Group Managers and their employees. These communications will emphasize the overall goals of the organization and each employee's role in meeting those goals. The communications will include expectations regarding the average number of case closures that would have to occur to reach those goals, taking into account the fact that each employee's actual closures will vary based upon the facts and circumstances of specific cases.
(iv)	Setting these quantity measure goals, and the communication of those goals, is permissible because case closures are a quantity measure. Case closures are an example of outcome-neutral production data that does not specify the outcome of any specific case such as the amount assessed or collected.
Example 2.	In conducting a performance evaluation, a supervisor is permitted to take into consideration information the supervisor has developed showing that the employee failed to propose an appropriate adjustment to tax liability in one of the cases the employee examined, provided that information is derived from a review of the work done on the case. All information derived from such a review of individual cases handled by the employee, including time expended, issues raised, and enforcement outcomes reached should be considered and discussed with the employee and used in evaluating the employee.
Example 3.	When assigning a case, a supervisor is permitted to discuss with the employee the merits, issues, and development of techniques of the case based upon a review of the case file.
Example 4.	A supervisor is not permitted to establish a goal for proposed adjustments in a future examination.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 801.8 Effective/applicability dates.
The provisions of §§ 801.1 through 801.7 apply on or after October 17, 2005.

national Treasury Employees Union
NTEU’s history is rooted with the IRS, dating back to 1938 when a group of Internal Revenue collectors organized to improve their working conditions. Over the decades, NTEU has grown to become the largest independent union of federal employees representing all IRS bargaining unit employees. In total, NTEU represents 150,000 employees at 31 different federal agencies and departments.
Through negotiations, lobbying, litigation and proactive public relations, NTEU provides top-notch representation to the IRS workforce. And in workplaces nationwide, highly-trained NTEU local leaders work alongside IRS employees and stand ready to-address their everyday issues and concerns.
Here are some of the many ways NTEU advocates for the IRS workforce:
•	Negotiating with the IRS over the issues that matter most to employees, such as performance awards, telework, leave and work schedules;
