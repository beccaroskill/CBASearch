25
*55. If the employee is unable otherwise to replace some employee whose work he/she is able to do and if he/she cannot do such available work as may be assigned by the Company (either before commencing work where assigned or after trying the job), and therefore he/she would have no further alternative but to accept a layoff from the working force and go home.
*56. An employee wishing to exercise his/her rights of replacing some other employee, as provided in paragraph 54 of this Article, must file a written bump grievance within two (2) workdays following the date he/she received his/her notice of layoff and transfer. The bump grievance shall name the Supervisor of the department and indicate the job classification in which he/she wishes to work. All such written bump grievances shall be recognized as filed at Step 3 of the grievance procedure as provided in Article XIII of this Agreement except that they shall be submitted to the Human Resources Department for proper disposition by the Department Steward, Plant Chairperson, or Union Committeeperson on the grievant’s work shift.
Failure to file such a written bump grievance within two (2) workdays following the date he/she received his/her notice of layoff and transfer, shall preclude the employee from any further right to exercise of said rights and, if the employee does not have enough plant seniority to replace as a last resort some other employee whose job he/she is able to perform and either has not been placed where work is available or else is unable to perform work duties assigned by the Company, the employee may then be laid off and replaced by recall or by hire. It is understood that if an error occurs, the terms of this section shall not serve to limit the force and effect of paragraph 61 of this Article. It is also understood that, if more than one employee files a bump grievance to exercise seniority as provided in paragraph 54 of this Article, the bump grievances of senior employees will be recognized and the employee with lesser seniority will be allowed to file revised bump grievances at Step 3 within two (2) workdays following the date of the Company's reply to their initial bump grievances.
26
*57. The Company and the Union will endeavor to settle such bump grievances within one (1) workday after the bump grievance is filed with the Company and the Plant Chairperson. In the event there is a delay in such decision and layoff becomes effective, the employee may, provided he/she is willing and there is available work in the plant, be placed by the Company, after due consideration to the employee's seniority and qualifications, at other work in the plant at the top prevailing rate of pay for said job or his/her regular rate of pay, whichever is greater, until a decision is reached. If the decision is adverse to the employee, he/she may be laid off without further notice. If die employee is offered work during said period but he/she chooses to go home until such decision is reached and the decision is in his/her favor, he/she may return to the job in question without loss of seniority but without any right to pay for time lost. However, if during the period of decision there is no other work available or he/she is not placed by the Company at other work in the plant and, of necessity, he/she goes home waiting for the decision and the decision is in his/her favor, then he/she may return to the job in question without loss of seniority and shall be paid for all regular hours of work lost during such period.
*58. Any employee who is unable to perform the regular duties of a job on which he/she exercises plant seniority shall be disqualified from that classification and shall be placed in other available work. His/her bidding rights shall be immediately available to him/her but he/she shall have no bumping rights.
59.	The Company and the Union also recognize that the strict observance of the seniority provisions in this Agreement could result in layoff from the working force of a skilled worker, specifically an Automatic Foam Machine Operator, Die/Mold Setter, Electrical Specialist, Coating Specialist, Plastics Set Up & Operator, Tooling Specialist, Mechanical Specialist, Refrigeration Technician or Waste Treatment Operator for whom no qualified replacement could be found among the employees remaining on the labor force. To determine whether or not such a qualified replacement is available, the Company shall post a notice on the bulletin boards of intention to retain an employee
27
with lesser plant seniority, stating the name of the employee and his/her job classification. An employee who has greater plant seniority and who believes himself/herself qualified for the job may file a written grievance at Step 3 within two (2) workdays following the day in which the notice was posted. If the grievant is properly qualified for the job he/she shall be given the opportunity to replace the employee with lesser plant seniority who will then be laid off. If, however, no qualified person files a grievance as provided in this section or if he/she does so but cannot perform the required job duties after being given an opportunity to do so, the employee with lesser plant seniority shall be retained or recalled, as the case may be, and the employee, if any, who replaced him/her shall either be transferred as though he/she were an unsuccessful bidder, as provided in Article XI, paragraph 82, or he/she shall be laid off from the plant in accordance with his/her plant seniority, whichever would be applicable. An employee with lesser plant seniority retained in this manner shall perform work only in this regular job classification and if there is no such work for him/her, he/she shall be laid off in accordance with his/her plant seniority.
60.	Any employee who has not served his/her probation period, as defined in Article VIII, with the Company, shall not be allowed to work in any job classification when regular employees are being laid off except by agreement between the Company and the Bargaining Committee or as provided in paragraphs 59 and 64 of this Article.
61.	If an employee is laid off from the working force or from his/her job classification, as the case may be, with seniority over any employee left on duty, the employee shall be recalled immediately. Also he/she shall receive full pay for hours lost, provided he/she filed a written grievance to the Company within four (4) workdays after receipt of notice of layoff and if he/she could not have known of the error before it became effective. This provision does not apply to probationary employees, nor does it in any way alter the provision of paragraph 52 (c) above.
28
62.	Supervisors will give out change notices the day they receive them.
Section 5 - Recall

(h)	An employee shall not be subject to recall to any job from which he/she is removed due to a reduction in force during his/her trial period following bid award or assignment in the absence of bids, unless he/she has worked in the job at least five (5) workdays and is recalled to said job within ninety (90) calendar days following the date of his/her removal from said job due to reduction in force. If he/she is recalled to the job within these limitations, die terms of Article XI shall continue in full force and effect.

64. The Company and the Union recognize that there may be instances when application of the seniority provisions of the Article with respect to layoff and recall would result in placement of an employee in a job which he/she would be unable to perform. If the Company believes that the employee should not be placed on the job in question, the employee will be so informed and allowed the opportunity to try the job if he/she believes he/she is able to do the work required.

32
assignment of an employee who has less seniority or by hire. If an employee returns to work from layoff on a trial basis and is unable to perform the regular duties of the job in question and therefore is again placed on a layoff status, his/her date of layoff should be die same as it would have been if he/she had not returned to work. This provision is not to be applied in the case of an employee who is unable to perform the duties of a job in which he/she has exercised his/her seniority privileges as provided in paragraph 56 above.
