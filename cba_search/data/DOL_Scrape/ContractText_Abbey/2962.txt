31
to make final assignments. If track assignment agreement is not reached during the process, the site administrator shall assign teachers using the following criteria:

ARTICLE XV - EVALUATION PROCEDURES
Section 1	- Principles of Evaluation and Assessment
This provision establishes a uniform and systematic procedure for assessing an employee’s work performance. The primary purpose of an employee evaluation is to improve the educational process for students and to develop the highest professional competence on the part of each employee.
The District retains the sole responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of performance of each employee, subject to the following procedural requirements. Any grievance brought under this Article shall be limited to a claim that the procedural requirements stated herein have been violated. Under normal circumstances, the site administrator (or his/her designee) shall have overall responsibility for the evaluation. If someone other than the site administrator (or designee) is the evaluator, or if the District changes the evaluator, the District shall, within a reasonable time, notify the employee. The District shall not request bargaining unit members to evaluate other bargaining unit members.
In compliance with law, discipline and discharge procedures may be undertaken independently of the evaluation procedures contained in this Article. This provision shall not, however, constitute a waiver of any right an employee may have to adequate notice of performance deficiencies and adequate opportunity to improve. Written evaluations shall be communicated using the observation, remediation, and evaluation forms shown in Appendix D, as applicable.
Section 2	- Procedures for Evaluation and Assessment
(a)	The District shall evaluate and assess employee competency as it reasonably relates to each of the following:
(1)	The progress of pupils toward the standards of expected student achievement at each grade level in each area of study.
(2)	The instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee.
(3)	The employee's adherence to curricular objectives.
36
(4)	The establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment within the scope of the employee’s responsibilities, including the performance of assigned adjunct duties.
(b)	The evaluation and assessment of employee competency shall not include the use of publishers’ norms established by standardized tests.
(c)	The District shall not require that lesson planning be done in any particular format or require lesson plans to be turned in on a regular (daily or weekly) basis unless the employee has received notice of "needs to improve" or "unsatisfactory" performance. The District may request a lesson plan to be provided prior to a prescheduled observation.
(d)	The District shall appoint an evaluator for each employee and inform each employee to be evaluated of his/her evaluator within forty-five (45) workdays from the beginning of the school year. The employee may request the District to assign an alternate evaluator. Each school shall hold a staff meeting prior to the beginning of each school year to discuss evaluation criteria and procedures. In the case of employees assigned after the beginning of the school year, such notification and meeting shall occur within thirty (30) calendar days of the assignment.
(e)	The evaluator shall conduct no fewer than three (3) classroom (or other site) observations for temporary and probationary employees (and permanent employees in less than satisfactory status), and no fewer than one (1) such observation for permanent employees in satisfactory status during the evaluation year, prorated appropriately for employees assigned after the beginning of the year. The first observation shall occur within the first quarter, except as to employees assigned after the beginning of the school year.
(1)	In the case of temporary and probationary employees and permanent employees in less than satisfactory status, at least one (1) of such observations shall be prescheduled at least three (3) workdays in advance. The classroom observations shall be no longer than sixty (60) minutes. This provision does not preclude non-scheduled classroom visitations and observations as an additional useful assessment technique, nor does it preclude classroom observations or visitations during a year in which the employee is not being evaluated. Any observation which impacts an employee evaluation shall be written up on the District observation report form. All observation reports shall be provided to the employee.
(2)	The evaluator shall provide the employee with a copy of the observation report within five (5) workdays after the classroom observation. Either the employee or the evaluator may request a conference to discuss the observation and/or observation report prepared by the evaluator within five (5) workdays. In such case, the conference shall be held within five (5) workdays from the request. The District and the Association acknowledge that unusual circumstances (such as illness of either the evaluator or the employee, or emergencies) may prevent compliance with the time limits set forth in this section.
37
(3)	Observations shall be reasonable in number and duration, and in no instance shall be used to harass an employee. It is understood between the District and the Association that this Section 2(e) is an evaluation procedural requirement. Comments on the final evaluation may include comments and information from previous observations or other written evidence of employee performance as related to Section 2 provided such information has been shared with the unit member prior to development of the written evaluation. In any event, the evaluation shall reflect and be consistent with the written documentation provided to the employee throughout the evaluation year,
(f)	Evaluations and assessments conducted pursuant to this procedure shall be reduced in writing on the form attached hereto as Appendix D, and a copy thereof shall be transmitted to the employee not later than thirty (30) calendar days before the last day of student attendance of the school year. A meeting shall be held between the employee and the evaluator to discuss the evaluation, and such meeting shall be held prior to the last week of the school year. If the evaluation is “needs to improve" or "unsatisfactory" in any area, the meeting will be held within ten (10) workdays from the date of the delivery of the evaluation form to the employee.
(g)	The District will evaluate probationary, temporary, and intern employees every year and permanent employees every other year, subject to the provisions of Section 3 below.
(h)	Adjunct duties shall be assigned by the District. Such duties shall be reasonable, equitably distributed, mutually scheduled (or assigned if mutual agreement has been attempted but has not been reached), and communicated to all unit members at each school site. Adjunct duties subject to evaluation shall be communicated within thirty (30) workdays from the beginning of each school year. Other adjunct duties which are subject to evaluation may be added, deleted, or modified by mutual agreement between the evaluator and the employee. The District may assign additional, necessary adjunct duties after thirty (30) workdays, by seniority, with the duties assigned first to the employee(s) with the least District seniority.
Section 3	- Remediation
(a)	If the employee’s final evaluation is "unsatisfactory" in any area, he or she shall be evaluated the following year in all areas. If an employee’s final evaluation is "needs to improve" in any area, he or she shall be evaluated the following year in the area(s) in which improvement is needed. In addition, at any time during the school year, the District may notify an employee in writing that his/her job performance is "unsatisfactory" or "needs to improve" and the reasons the evaluator has made such determination. In this event, the District and the employee shall meet as necessary to discuss specific recommendations for improvement of the employee’s performance. A remediation plan shall specifically address identified weaknesses and describe a process of improvement; shall have a term of no more than six (6) weeks; and will, if unsuccessful, be followed by additional remediation plan(s). There shall be a conference at the conclusion of each remediation plan. The District may recommend or require an employee who has received written notice of unsatisfactory performance or needed improvement to participate in a District provided program designed to improve appropriate areas of the employee’s performance. If the District requires such
38
participation on a non-workday, or after 5:00 p.m., it shall pay the employee the negotiated hourly rate for his/her actual time in attendance.
(b)	When an employee is rated "needs to improve”, such employee shall be observed no more than once per week. When an employee is rated “unsatisfactory," such limitations shall not apply. Each observation shall be written up. A conference between the employee and his/her evaluator shall take place within three (3) days.
(c)	Any permanent certificated employee who receives an “unsatisfactory” rating on a final evaluation shall participate in the Peer Assistance and Review Program (PAR) for teachers.
(d)	Upon the request of the employee who has been rated "unsatisfactory," the District will appoint a second evaluator.
(e)	If a first year probationary teacher ends the year in the "needs to improve" or "unsatisfactory" category and is reelected, he/she shall have two (2) observations prior to November 30. Each of these shall be followed by a conference with the observer and shall result in an updated evaluation form. Any second year probationary teacher who moves into the "unsatisfactory" category must be informed of unsatisfactory performance prior to February 15, except under extraordinary circumstances.
(f)	The Association shall be notified within ten (10) days of the assignment of a teacher to a remediation plan unless the teacher involved specifically requests that the Association not be notified.
Section 4	- Association Representation
(a)	The District recognizes the right of representation in employment relations provided under Government Code Section 3543.1 as that section is interpreted by PERB and courts of competent jurisdiction.
(b)	It is understood by the District and the Association that this right currently includes the right of an employee to have representation in any meeting with a person in a supervisory position which the unit member reasonably believes may lead to discipline or negative evaluation.. Unit members shall not request and shall not be afforded Association representation at any classroom (or other site) observation.
Section 5	- Rebuttal
(a)	The employee has the right to initiate a written reaction or response to the evaluation. Such response shall become a permanent attachment to the copy of the evaluation in the employee's personnel file. If such response is filed, the evaluation document may be modified at the District's discretion.
(b)	If a grievance relating to the evaluation procedures as set forth in this Article is filed, evaluation materials will be withheld from the personnel file until the grievance process is exhausted.
39

46
(2)	Permanent employees shall have first priority consideration in the selection process for filling vacancies.
(3)	If a unit member begins employment in the current school year in temporary status and is changed to probationary status during or at the end of that year, the position held by such unit member is a “vacant position” for the following school year, and the unit member shall be assigned a position as a new hire.
(d)	Selection for a vacant position shall include the following criteria:
(1)	Appropriate credential
(2)	Satisfactory evaluation
(3)	Specific site/program needs and/or related experience in desired position as specified on the job posting.

(2)	To accommodate a change in school enrollment necessitating either the addition or deletion of staff; and
(3)	Whenever such transfer will benefit the educational program (including lawful affirmative action considerations).
(f)	If there are two employees or more at a school who are to be considered for transfer based upon the factors listed above, and all other factors are equal, then the least senior employee (on a District seniority basis) shall be selected. However, the application of such seniority factor shall not operate so as to cause involuntary transfer of a unit member more than once in any two year period.
(g)	If a position opens at a site from which an involuntary transfer has occurred, the involuntarily transferred employee may have the first option of returning to the site.
(h)	The District shall not involuntarily transfer three (3) or more unit members from one site to another unless it first gives three (3) days written notice to the Association of such transfers.

ARTICLE XXII - LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 1 - Paid Leaves of Absence
(a)	The only leaves of absence for which compensation may be paid are set forth below.
(b)	All employees shall be entitled to sick leave benefits and such sick leave benefits shall be cumulative and transferable within the state of California pursuant to Section 44979 of the California Education Code. Such sick leave benefits may be used for personal illness and personal necessity as established in this Agreement.
48
(c)	Sick leave.
(1)	On the first day of every school year, every employee shall receive a sick leave allotment credit equal to the employee’s sick leave entitlement for the school year. Any employee may use such credited sick leave at any time during the school year. When an employee has used all or a portion of the sick leave allowable and subsequently fails to serve the District for the full school year, an appropriate dollar amount shall be deducted from the employee’s final salary warrant. The appropriate amount shall equal the employee’s daily rate of pay times the number of sick leave days used but unearned.
(2)	One day of sick leave will be earned for each 18.4 days of being on paid status during the regular school year but no less than ten (10) days for working the entire school year as set forth in Appendix C.
(3)	Sick leave may be earned for other than a full day of being on paid status during the regular school year as determined by the following formula: total hours worked divided by the number of hours in the established full day equals total days divided by 18.4 days equal sick leave earned. Thus, it will take 18.4 times the number of hours in a full day to earn one day of sick leave.
(4)	Sick leave shall be cumulative. Sick leave accrual and use shall be calculated on the basis of one (1) hour increments and not in any other portion.
(5)	An employee may use sick leave when quarantined by the County or City Health Department because of another's illness.
(6)	The District shall provide each employee with a written statement of the employee’s total accrued sick leave, including the sick leave entitlement for the school year. Such statement shall be provided no later than November 15 of each school year.
(7)	An employee absent in order to keep an appointment with a physician or dentist will have the time absent charged to sick leave.
(d)	An illness absence shall be an absence of the employee due to illness or disabling condition which prevents the employee from performing such employee’s professional functions including but not limited to the following: physical or mental illness, medical, dental or psychiatric appointments and any disabling condition which prevents the employee from performing professional functions.
(e)	A physician’s certificate or other proof of illness or disabling condition may be required by the District for any illness or disabling condition in which the absence is three (3) days or more or when the employee has been informed that verification for future absences will be required. The District agrees that it will not exercise its discretion to require verification for absences in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.
(f)	After an employee has exhausted available sick leave and continues to be absent on account of illness or accident, such employee shall be paid no less than the difference between regular salary and the daily rate of pay of a substitute, if one has not been
49
employed, or the difference between the absent employee’s regular salary and the rate paid to the substitute employee if one is employed to fill said absent employee’s position, for a period not to exceed five (5) school months within a school year. Only one five-school-month period of extended illness leave may be taken for the same illness or injury. At the expiration of the paid extended illness leave, the employee may request a non-paid extended illness leave pursuant to Section 2(h).
(g)	Maternity leave.
(1)	The District shall provide for leave of absence from duty for any certificated employee of the District who is required to be absent from duties because of pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, or recovery therefrom. The length of the leave of absence, including the date on which the leave shall commence and the date on which the employee shall resume duties, shall be determined by the employee and the employee’s physician.
(2)	Disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and recovery therefrom are, for all job-related purposes, temporary disabilities and shall be treated as such under any health or temporary disability insurance or sick leave plan available in connection with employment by the District.
(3)	Except as provided herein, written and unwritten employment policies and practices of the District shall be applied to disability due to pregnancy or childbirth on the same terms and conditions applied to other temporary disabilities.
(h)	Persona! necessity leave. Employees may use, at their election, accumulated sick leave (not to exceed seven (7) days per year) for cases of personal necessity for the following reasons using the procedures below.
(1)	Personal necessity not requiring advance permission to be absent from duty:
a.	Serious illness or death of the unit member’s immediate family or death of a member of the unit member’s family (not to exceed three (3) days) beyond that provided under subsection (i) below.
b.	Accident involving his/her person or property or the person and property of a member of his/her immediate family.
(2)	Personal necessity requiring advance permission before being absent from duty:
a.	Appearance in any court or before any administrative tribunal as a witness under subpoena or other agency order made with jurisdiction.
b.	Personal business not to exceed three (3) days per year. In order to take personal business leave, a written request must be made at least three (3) school days prior to the date of such leave. Such leave may not be taken the first five (5) and the last five (5) days of any school year or the day before or after a holiday or vacation without prior written approval of the Superintendent except in the situations set forth in the preceding sentence.
50
The District shall not require employees to state reasons for persona! business leave. The number of employees on personal business leave may not exceed ten percent (10%) of the employees at any work site who are covered by this Agreement.

d.	Religious holidays normally standardized by the religious denominations may be observed by personnel upon request as long as the total number of personal necessity days is not exceeded.
(i)	Employees shall be entitled to a leave of absence not to exceed five (5) days on account of the death of any member of the employee’s immediate family. Immediate family shall be defined as mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, grandchild of the employee or of the spouse of the employee, and the spouse, son-in-law, daughter, daughter-in-law, brother or sister, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law of the employee or any relative living in the immediate household of the employee.
(j)	Employees under this Agreement who are absent from duty because of industrial illness or injury qualifying for Workers’ Compensation are granted Industrial Accident and Illness Leave. Such leave shall apply from the first day of any such absence from duty to and including the last day of such absence from duty but not exceeding sixty (60) workdays in any fiscal year for the same industrial accident or illness.
(1)	The amount of the salary paid to personnel on Industrial Accident or Industrial Illness Leave shall be the same as the individual normally received prior to the accident. Any benefits received from the Workers’ Compensation fund shall be deducted from the amount paid to the employee by the District.
(2)	Upon termination of sixty (60) days of absence because of industrial accident or illness, whether they are receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits or not, personnel may use that portion of the accumulated sick leave as to maintain their income not to exceed their regular salary.
(3)	During the period of Industrial Accident or Illness Leave, the District shall issue personnel appropriate salary warrants and shall deduct retirement and other authorized contributions from such warrants.
(4)	Reporting industrial accidents and/or industrial illnesses shall be the responsibility of the employees so afflicted.

(m)	An employee who is duly subpoenaed to appear in court before an administrative agency in a matter related to the employee’s District employment shall be afforded up to two (2) days personal necessity leave, even if the employee has exhausted his/her entitlement to personal necessity leave. The District may afford an employee leave time not charged to personal necessity leave or sick leave under appropriate circumstances.
(n) All employee leaves under this section shall be considered leaves with pay, and a continuation of all job benefits shall be paid by the District.
Section 2	- Non-Paid Leaves of Absence
(a)	All leaves described under this section shall be without pay during the term of leave and shall be approved by the Board of Education. The regular pay received by the employee on leave and all benefits from employment shall be discontinued.
(b)	Whenever practically feasible, an employee returning from a non-paid leave of absence approved by the Board of Education will be returned to the job site to which the employee was assigned before his approved leave. If it is not practically feasible to return the employee to this exact job site, the District will attempt to return the employee to a position as nearly like the one the employee left as possible.
(c)	Personal leave of absence may be requested by the employee. Leaves of absence for personal reasons, five (5) days or less, may be approved by the Superintendent. All requests for personal leave greater than five (5) days shall be submitted to the Board of Education for its consideration.

(1)	“child” means a biological, adopted or foster child; a stepchild; a legal ward; or a child of a person standing “in loco parentis” who is either under 18 years of age or an adult dependent child,
(2)	“parent” means a biological, foster or adoptive parent, a stepparent, a legal guardian, or other person who stood in loco parentis to the unit member when the unit member was a child,
(3)	“serious health condition" means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves either in-patient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility, or continuing treatment or supervision by a health care provider,
(4)	“health care provider” means a doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the state in which
53
the doctor practices, or any other person determined by the United States Secretary of Labor to be capable of providing health care services.
(b)	An unpaid Family Care Leave (FCL) shall be granted, subject to the restrictions set forth below, to a unit member who has been employed by the District for at least one year and has provided at least 1,250 hours of service in the 12-month period prior to the FCL request. FCL may be granted for reason of:
(1)	the birth of a child of the unit member,
(2)	the adoption of a child by a unit member,
(3)	foster care placement of a child with the unit member,
(4)	the care of a child, parent, or spouse who has a serious health condition,
(5)	because of the unit member's own serious health condition.
FCL granted for the birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child must occur within one year of that birth, adoption, or foster care placement. Any FCL a unit member takes will be counted towards the unit member’s annual leave entitlements under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the California Family Rights Act of 1991, as amended. FCL runs concurrently with any other leave in this Agreement for which the unit member qualifies.
(c)	To the extent required by applicable federal and state laws only, the FCL may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule. The District reserves the right to place any lawful restrictions upon a unit member’s intermittent or reduced-schedule usage of FCL. The FCL shall not exceed a total of 12 work weeks within a 12-month period, as calculated from the first date on which the unit member utilizes FCL. A husband and wife employed by the District may each take 12 weeks of leave for birth of a child, adoption, foster care placement, or care of parent(s) with a serious health condition.
(d)	If the need for FCL is foreseeable, the unit member shall provide written notice and request for FCL at least 30 days prior to the commencement of any FCL. If the need for FCL is not known 30 days prior to the date the FCL must begin, the unit member shall provide a written notice and request for FCL within one or two business days of learning of the need for the leave. If the need for FCL is due to planned medical treatment, the unit member shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as to minimize disruption to the District, subject to the approval of the appropriate health care provider.
(e)	In conjunction with any notice and request for FCL due to a serious health condition of the unit member or to care for a child, a spouse or a parent who has a serious health condition, the unit member must submit to his/her immediate administrator a certification from the relevant health care provider that includes:
(1)	the date the serious health condition commenced,
(2)	the probable duration of the condition,
54
(3)	an estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes the unit member needs to care for the individual, if the FCL is due to the serious health condition of a child, a spouse, or a parent,
(4)	a statement that the serious health condition either warrants the participation of the family member to provide care or renders the unit member unable to perform his/her job functions.
If FCL is required beyond the initial estimated date provided by the health care provider, the unit member shall submit a new written notice and request for FCL before any additional FCL will be granted. In addition, the unit member must submit a new certification from the relevant health care provider. If the District has any reason to doubt the validity of any health care provider certification, the District may require, at its own expense, that the unit member obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated by the District. In the event the second health care provider's opinion differs from the original certification, the District may require, at its own expense, that the unit member obtain the opinion of a third health care provider approved jointly by the District and the unit member. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be final and binding on the District and the unit member.
(f)	As a condition of reinstatement for a unit member who has taken FCL because of his/her serious health condition, the unit member must provide the District with a certification from the unit member’s health care provider, certifying that the unit member is able to resume work.
(g)	A unit member returning from FCL shall be reinstated to the same position the unit member held when the FCL began or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. The District, however, shall not be required to reinstate a unit member returning from FCL if, during the unit member’s FCL, the same or comparable position ceases to exist because of legitimate business reasons and, had the unit member not taken FCL, the unit member would not otherwise have been employed at the time reinstatement is requested.
(h)	All FCL is unpaid. The exceptions are that:
(1)	a unit member may elect, or the District may require the unit member to utilize accrued vacation hours for FCL in lieu of unpaid status,
(2)	if the unit member is taking FCL due to his/her own illness, the unit member may elect, or the District may require the unit member to utilize accrued sick leave hours for FCL in lieu of unpaid status.
The period of the FCL shall not be considered a break in service. Upon return to service from FCL, the unit member shall have no less seniority than the unit member had when the FCL commenced. However, the period of FCL shall not be used to calculate increased seniority rights.
(i)	During any period that a unit member takes FCL, the District shall maintain coverage under any “group health plan’’ (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been
55
provided if the unit member had worked continuously for the duration of such FCL. The District may recover the premiums that it paid for maintaining coverage for the unit member and any of the unit member’s dependents during any period of unpaid FCL if:
(1)	the unit member fails to return from FCL after the period of FCL to which the unit member is entitled has expired,
(2)	the unit member’s failure to return to work is for a reason other than the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition that would entitle the unit member to FCL or because of circumstances beyond the control of the unit member.
The District may require any claim that a unit member is unable to return to work because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition to be supported by a medical certification which states that either the unit member is unabie to perform the functions of his/her position on the date that the FCL expired or that the unit member is needed to care for the child, spouse, or parent who has a serious health condition on the date that the FCL of the unit member expired.

SIDE LETTER REGARDING EFFECTIVE PLANNING IN INSTRUCTION
The District and the Association have engaged in lengthy discussions regarding effective planning and its role in classroom instruction. Article XIV* Section 2(c) of the 1983-91 Certificated Employees Collective Bargaining Agreement provides as follows: "The District shall not require that lesson planning be done in any particular format or require lesson plans to be turned in on a regular (daily or weekly) basis unless the employee has received notice of 'needs to improve' or 'unsatisfactory' performance. The District may request a lesson plan to be provided prior to a prescheduled observation."
In interpreting this language, the District and the Association have agreed as follows:
1.	The ^District, in evaluating the instructional techniques and strategies of a particular certificated bargaining unit member pursuant to the Evaluation Form, Appendix D(5)(Agreement, page 91), will evaluate whether the unit member plans on a weekly and long-range basis, as well as whether the unit member provides appropriate instruction in an observed classroom situation. When conducting a prescheduled or non-scheduled observation, the Di strict evaluator may require evi dence of weekly and 1ong-range planning. Such evidence need not be in lesson plan or any particular format, but must be sufficient to indicate that the required planning has been done and that the curriculum is being implemented.
2.	Whether or not a bargaining unit member has adequately planned a particular lesson will generally be evident from the observation of the lesson itself.
3.	The District will not require any unit member to provide a lesson plan for an individual lesson in any particular format unless the employee has received a notice of “needs to improve- or "unsatisfactory" performance.
4.	The District will not require lesson plans to be turned in on a daily or weekly basis unless the employee has received a notice of "needs to improve" or "unsatisfactory" performance.	.
5.	The District may request a lesson plan to be provided prior to a prescheduled observation.
6.	The District and the Association encourage all unit members to plan sufficiently on a daily, weekly, and long-term basis for the purpose of ensuring that instruction is appropriate and consistent with the needs of the students.
