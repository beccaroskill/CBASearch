Probationary Period
New employees shall be considered probationary employees for the first 90 calendar days of employment commencing with the first day of employment.

position, and there is no break in service between the period of temporary service and regular service, the new employee, upon successful completion of the probationary period, shall be credited for that time served as a temporary employee for the purposes of seniority calculation. Fall break, winter intersession and spring break shall not be considered as a break in service period for seniority purposes.
Any employee transferred from a position excluded from the bargaining unit shall have no seniority if transferred into the bargaining unit. Such an employee shall be considered a "new hire" for seniority purposes. Employees who transfer out of the bargaining unit to accept a supervisory position or other position not included in the bargaining unit shall have their seniority frozen as of the date of transfer. Should the University desire to return the employee to the bargaining unit, their seniority that accumulated prior to the transfer shall be restored and they will return to any available job to which their seniority entitles them. Any employee on layoff or absent due to work related illness or injury shall continue to accrue seniority.
Employees hired on the same date shall rank for seniority according to the last four (4) digits of their social security number with the employee having the highest number being given the highest rank.
Loss of Seniority

2.	The employee retires from Cornell University.
3.	The employee is laid off for a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months.
4.	The employee is absent from work for three consecutive working days without directly notifying the supervisor or the departmental administrator in keeping with departmental procedures and provided the failure to notify is not due to circumstances beyond the control of the employee.

ARTICLE 10
FILLING JOB VACANCIES
The University will post all job openings which may occur in the bargaining unit.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, posted positions shall be filled within a reasonable length of time. Upon request, the University will inform the union regarding the status of a position if it is not filled within a reasonable length of time.
The University shall regularly provide the job posting information to the Union office through the University's normal distribution routine. Whenever possible, each posting of a bargaining unit position shall indicate whether it is an endowed or statutory position, location, grade, classification, and work schedule.
Qualified employee candidates are to be given preferential consideration for any vacancy within the institution and, to that end, at least the two most senior applicants who, in management's judgment, meet the minimum qualifications for any vacant position, shall be interviewed and have their application reviewed.

employee’s pursuit of Cornell career opportunities. It is agreed that such openings should be filled by the person most qualified to perform the work. If all relevant factors such as experience and qualifications are equal, then the employee with the most bargaining unit seniority will be awarded the position.
If an employee has occupied a position for fewer than three (3) months, that employee may not apply for a promotion to a different department, unless invited by management to do so. Lateral transfers within a department shall not be considered a change of position for the purposes of this provision.
Any employee who has applied through normal Division of Human Resources application procedures to a posted bargaining unit position shall be notified in writing if he or she did not get the Job. Violation of this provision shall be grievable but not arbitrable.
Provisional Employment
On an ad-hoc basis, the parties may mutually agree to identify a posted position to which the most senior qualified employee applicant may be assigned to on a trial basis. The length of such trial period shall be mutually agreed to by both parties. These opportunities will not be unreasonably denied.
If the employer believes that the employee, as specifically demonstrated by his/her performance in the position, cannot perform the job duties, then such employee shall be returned to his/her former position from which he/ she was transferred. The employee also has the option to return to his/her former position during the trial period.
The employee will be paid during the trial period in accordance with the provisions outlined below.
Promotions, Demotions, Lateral Movements and Reclassifications
1.	Any employee hired after July 1, 1994 who is promoted or reclassified will be paid at the Hire Rate or Job Rate of the grade as appropriate. The reverse shall apply in the case of a demotion.
2.	Any employee hired before July 1, 1994 who is promoted or reclassified will remain in the same quad and year in quad in the higher grade

ARTICLE 11
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION
1.	"Grievance" within the meaning of the Agreement shall be defined as any matter involving the interpretation or application of this Agreement which alleges a violation of the rights of an employee or the Union under the terms of this Agreement.
2.	Whenever an employee refuses or fails to initiate a grievance upon occurrence of an alleged violation of the rights of that employee under the terms of this Agreement, the Union may file a grievance in the name of the employee at Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure.
3.	When the Union alleges that the University has applied or interpreted the terms of the Agreement so as to allegedly violate employee's rights under the terms of the Agreement, the Union may initiate the grievance at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.
4.	When a grievance arises from the alleged violation of a provision of this Agreement that specifically provides for the grievance to be initiated at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure, the grievance will be reduced to writing by the employee or a Union representative and submitted to the Office of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations.
5.	An employee grievant(s) (no more than three (3)) and/or one Union representative participating in the required meetings of the Grievance Procedure, Steps I through 4 inclusive, as set forth in Section l3 of this Article, during working hours shall suffer no loss of wages for the time spent in such meetings.

be scheduled during the grievant's normal working hours, at a mutually convenient time.
6.	In no instance shall a grievance be filed after ten (10) working days from the date of its occurrence or reoccurrence. Any grievance not processed at each level within the number of working days specified herein shall be regarded as settled on the basis of the University's most recent answer. If the University should fail to observe the time limits in a specific step, the grievance may be appealed to the next step or the Union may wait for the University's response. "Working Day" within the meaning of this Article shall be defined as Monday through Friday, excluding all paid holidays.
7.	Settlements through Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure shall not establish a precedent or practice for either party. The Union may amend a grievance at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure to correct inaccuracies such as incorrect Article citation or statements of remedy. The Union may withdraw a grievance at any step without prejudice or precedence.
8.	Initial steps and time limits in the Grievance Procedure may be waived by written mutual agreement of both the University and a Union representative.
9.	No employee shall be discriminated against for participating in the Grievance Procedure.
10.	Where an employee's presence as a witness is required during the adjustment of a grievance or during arbitration, the University shall excuse that employee from work. Neither party, however, shall be responsible for the expense of witnesses called by the other, including lost work time. Witnesses called by mutual agreement in advance of the witness appearance shall not lose pay.
11.	Employees who have filed a grievance shall have the right to be present personally at any stage of the Grievance Procedure. However, an employee may waive the right to be present. The employee may be accompanied by a Union representative. Union representatives may assist employees who wish to file grievances. The grievant(s) and Union representative(s) will be permitted a reasonable amount of time, normally not to exceed one-half (1/2) hour without loss of pay, to confer privately immediately prior to any scheduled grievance step meeting.

12.	At each step of the grievance procedure, each party shall present the facts and documents known to the party at the time to support its position on the grievance.
13.	All grievances shall be processed and settled in conformity with the following procedure:
Step 1. All grievances must first be discussed by the employee with his/her immediate supervisor with or without a Union representative present and the grievant or the Union representative must make known to the supervisor that such a discussion is intended as a Step 1 grievance. The supervisor shall respond to the employee and the Union representative when involved, as soon as possible, but no later than three (3) working days from the date the grievance was discussed.
Step 2. If the immediate supervisor's oral answer does not resolve the grievance and the employee chooses to pursue the matter further, it shall be reduced to writing setting forth the facts upon which the grievance is based, the section(s) of the Agreement pursuant to which the employee's rights are alleged to have been violated, the reason for disagreement of the Step 1 response, and the remedy or correction sought, and within five (5) consecutive working days from receipt of the oral answer be appealed to the department head or designated representative. The department head or designee shall within five (5) consecutive working days from the date the grievance is appealed meet and discuss the grievance with the employee and a Union representative. A written answer to the grievance shall be provided to the employee and the Union representative within five (5) working days after the date of the Step 2 meeting.
Step 3. If the grievance is not resolved in Step 2, the Union representative may appeal the grievance in writing within five (5) consecutive working days of receipt ofthe Step 2 answer. The appeal shall include the reason for disagreement of the Step 2 response. Within twenty (20) working days from the date the grievance was appealed to Step 3, a meeting shall be held between the Director of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations or a designee and three (3) persons the Director of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations determines may assist in the resolution of the grievance, and a designated International Representative, the Local President, a

Union representative and the aggrieved employee. The Director of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations shall provide the International Representative, the Local President, the grievant and the Union representative with a written answer on the appeal within ten (10) working days of the meeting.
Step 4. If the grievance remains unresolved after the Step 3 answer from the Director of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations, the designated International Representative or Local President may appeal the grievance to arbitration by submitting an official written notice to the Director of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations within ten (10) working days from receipt of the Step 3 answer. Such request for arbitration shall include the specific provision(s) of the Agreement alleged to be violated as stated in Step 3, as well as the reason for disagreeing with the prior step decision.
Arbitration
The selection of an arbitrator and arbitration proceedings shall be conducted under the then current Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
The jurisdictional authority of the arbitrator is defined and limited to the determination as to whether there have been violations of the provision or provisions of the Agreement as set forth in the written grievance; the arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based exclusively on evidence presented at the arbitration hearings and shall be final and binding on all involved parties.
Where the decision of the arbitrator includes an award for back pay, back wages shall be limited to the amount of wages that the employee otherwise would have earned less any unemployment compensation or other additional interim payments or compensation.
The parties shall bear their own expenses and share in the arbitrator's fee and expenses equally. Each party shall be responsible for the expenses of its witnesses and representatives, except as provided in Section 5 of this Article. Either party may be represented by counsel.
Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the University may temporarily fill any position pending the resolution of the grievance.

Grievance Mediation
Upon mutual agreement, the University and the Union will request a Federal Mediator from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for the purpose of grievance mediation. This process may be implemented with mutual agreement prior to filing for Arbitration, or in the time frame between the filing for Arbitration and the Arbitration proceedings. In the event Grievance Mediation is chosen prior to filing for Arbitration, the time limits for filing for Arbitration will be extended to accommodate the Grievance Mediation process. The decision/ recommendations of the Federal Mediator shall not be binding on either party and may not be introduced in any subsequent arbitration proceedings.
Grievance Reinstatement
In those instances where the International Union, UAW by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a union representative involved, the International Union may inform the University in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred. Grievants may also appeal their grievance disposition as outlined in the UAW Constitution, Article 33. In the event such appeal is upheld, the grievance will be reinstated the same as above. This process must be initiated within forty-five (45) days of the disposition of the original grievance and must be concluded within ninety (90) days thereafter. Grievances may only be appealed once.
ARTICLE 12
DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
The University and the Union agree to a procedure of progressive discipline. The parties adhere to the principle that discipline has the objective of improving the future performance of the employee.
The University and the Union recognize the sensitive nature of the disciplinary process and to that end, will strive whenever possible, to handle all disciplinary matters in a private setting with relevant personnel only.
An employee may be disciplined only for cause. Employees have the right to union representation during any meeting that might lead to discipline or during a disciplinary meeting.

The steps in the procedure of progressive discipline shall include oral warnings, written warnings, suspensions and discharges.
Referral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is not a required step of the disciplinary procedure.
Situations involving major infractions or offenses shall be exempted from progressive discipline and may subject an employee to discipline, including discharge, regardless of the employee's prior record.
Management shall use its best efforts in appropriate cases to have a union representative present during an investigatory meeting that could lead to discipline as well as when employees are issued a suspension or discharge. Failure to give advanced notice to the union shall not be an issue in any grievance related to the suspension or discharge. In all cases, however, the union shall receive a copy of the suspension or discharge as soon as possible after the issuance to the employee.
Suspension of a full day or longer shall be served in full day increments unless departmental needs require otherwise.
Any employee who has been given a written warning or disciplined in any manner or discharged may file a written grievance with or without the assistance of a specified union representative and initiate the grievance at Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure. The meeting with the department head shall take place within five working days from the date of the written grievance. Such grievances must be filed within ten working days from the date of the University's action.
An employee shall sign written disciplinary warnings indicating that he/ she has received a copy. Signing does not mean that the employee agrees or disagrees with the written disciplinary warning. If the employee is unable to sign the statement, a union representative for that department shall sign on behalf of the employee. The employee shall have a right to promptly respond in writing to any written discipline. This response will be kept with the written discipline.
In imposing discipline on a current charge, the University will not take into account any prior infractions that occurred more than twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of the current infraction. Periods of disability and workers’ compensation of greater than thirty (30) days shall extend the life of discipline.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
The University shall continue to comply with all applicable federal, state and local occupational health and safety laws for the protection of the health and safety of the employee. To this end, all employees shall receive paid health and safety training for all aspects of their job.
Employees shall comply with safety rules established by the University.
The University shall continue to supply and require the use of special health and safety equipment (except boots and shoes) without cost, where established by law or where a need is determined by the department, Life Safety or the Office of Environmental Health.
Employees are encouraged to report health and safety concerns to immediate supervisors. Issues will be forwarded to the appropriate office and a response will be provided within a reasonable time. No employee shall be punished or in any way adversely affected because he or she raises health and safety concerns.
Up to three (3) bargaining unit employees selected by the union shall participate in the Joint Health & Safety Committee. This committee shall meet periodically but at least quarterly with The Office of Environmental Health & Safety and others the University deems appropriate to discuss relevant health and safety concerns, to share educational information, ongoing and planned safety and training programs information, and to establish joint priorities for future safety and training programs. The agenda shall be set jointly in advance for each meeting, and at least once each year to establish future priorities. These three (3) employees shall suffer no loss of wages for time spent in such meetings or training sessions during working hours. Any alleged health and safety violations shall be reviewed by this committee, or discussed by the Union and the University, prior to involving any outside parties.
The University shall make reasonable efforts to notify the Union of serious work related accidents or illnesses that have come to the attention of Labor Relations or Environmental Health and Safety.

In addition, the Union and the University shall establish a joint ad hoc committee, three (3) to be designated by each party, to investigate the grievance after it has been filed at Step 3, unless the Union and University mutually agree to waive committee involvement. Should the Committee be unable to recommend an acceptable remedy to the grievance, the grievance shall be heard at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure. The Union may involve an International Health and Safety Representative who may investigate the matter and/or attend the hearing. If still unresolved, the grievance may be taken to arbitration.
Time spent by the Union's committee members shall be covered under the provisions of Section 5 of the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure Article.
ARTICLE 14

d.	When employees receive notice of layoff as provided for above, Division of Human Resources will give the employees special assistance throughout the layoff period in identifying other jobs the employees may be able to perform.
The about to be laid off seniority employee has the option of replacing probationary employees in any classification or department provided he/ she meets the necessary job prerequisites.
All layoffs shall be initiated at the department level in the following order:
a.	Employees shall be laid off in line with their seniority in their wage grade and classification within a department, provided the employee(s) to be laid off does not have specialized knowledge or abilities required in the classification which could not be met by the remaining work force.
b.	An employee laid off under (a) above may displace the least senior employee in a lower wage grade in the same classification within his/ her department, provided the employee who might be displaced does not have specialized knowledge or abilities required in that classification and not possessed by the laid off employee. An employee shall not be required to fill a position with fewer than their present standard hours of work.
When an employee moves into a new position, that employee shall be placed in their corresponding pay rate within the grade.
c.	An employee who is laid off in accordance with (a) and/or (b) of the paragraphs above and whose seniority is greater than another employee at the same grade or in a lower grade may make written application during the 30 days immediately following notice of layoff to the Director or Workforce Policy & Labor Relations listing the classifications the employee believes he/she may be able to perform. Such list of classifications shall be considered in the following order:
•	the least senior employee in the classification and grade from which the employee was laid off
•	the least senior employee in other classifications at the grade equal to that from which the employee was laid off
•	the least senior employee in the same classification at a lower grade than that from which the employee was laid off

•	the least senior employee in other classifications at a lower grade than that from which the employee was laid off
NOTE: Under the provision of section c. above:
An employee shall not be required to fill a position with fewer than their present standard hours of work. Contract College employees will not be required to fill an Endowed position and Endowed employees will not be required to fill a Contract College position.
As soon as possible but within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the employee's list, the University shall make the decision as to whether or not the employee is able to perform the work of the listed position either immediately or within one (1) week of appropriate familiarization, and notify him/her. Where the University determines that the employee is able to displace, the employee shall be placed in that position in keeping with the notice requirements of paragraph 2 of thisArticle. By mutual agreement of the parties, the time limits may be extended.
The parties agree that placement of a qualified laid off employee into an available vacancy is preferable to displacement of another employee. To that end, and in order to avoid displacing another employee, the parties agree that bargaining unit vacancies for which the laid off employee is qualified represent additional employment possibilities for consideration.
Return to work in formerly held classifications: When the work force increases after a layoff, employees shall be entitled to be placed in openings in accordance with their seniority provided they can perform the work. Employees who have not been returned to the highest rated wage grades and classifications worked in prior to layoff shall be returned to those wage grades and classifications as soon as an opening occurs in line with their seniority. Employees who have been placed in other departments or who have been laid off completely from the University must make a written request to initiate these rights to the Director of Workforce Policy & Labor Relations. Such rights will expire two (2) years from date of layoff. Employees who have been placed at a lower grade within the department from which they were laid off shall have such rights for three (3) years from date of layoff unless the employee fails to exercise his/her right to return to a known vacancy. Employees are presumed to be aware of positions posted in the Career Opportunities Bulletin distributed weekly by the University.

7.	Benefits During Layoff: An employee on layoff is entitled to a continuation of certain benefits for up to one year following the effective date of layoff, or until comparable non-Cornell employment has been accepted, whichever is sooner. The benefits are as follows:
•	Health Insurance shall continue provided the employee maintains his/ her applicable premium payments.
•	The basic amount of group life insurance coverage (1/2 the annual base salary) will continue. No employee contribution will be required. If enrolled in the Supplemental Plan, the employee may continue coverage by paying the cost of the insurance in advance.
•	Cornell Children's Tuition Scholarship benefit will continue for one (1) full academic term.
•	Accidental Death and Dismemberment benefits will continue provided the employee continues to make the same contributions required of regular full-time and regular part-time employees.

•	New York State Disability Benefits coverage will continue for a period of four (4) consecutive weeks from the effective date of layoff without any regular contributions.
8.	Layoff and recall of specified Union representatives and officers:
The Union shall identify sixteen (16) specified Union representatives and four (4) Union officers (Local Union President, Vice President, Financial Secretary/ Treasurer and Recording Secretary) who shall have preferential seniority. Accordingly, they shall be the last employees to be laid off within their respective classifications at their same grades or lower grades. In the event these specified representatives and officers are on layoff, they will be the first to be recalled to any unit position provided they are able to perform the work.
It shall be the responsibility of the Union to maintain and update the preferential seniority list and to provide a copy to the Director of Labor Relations at least semi-annually. Only those employees on the preferential seniority list shall be eligible for its conditions.

Whenever feasible the University shall provide one week advance written notice for a layoff in excess of thirty (30) days. A copy of the layoff letter will be sent to the Union. Senior employees may request such layoffs. Departments shall have sole discretion in granting such requests. Such requests shall be granted in order of seniority starting with the most senior employee except where specialized knowledge or abilities cannot be met by the remaining work force.
Temporary Employment - Winter Intersession
10.	The university agrees to make a good faith effort to locate temporary employment and to work with those employees who are not scheduled to work during the winter intersession who notifies the University in writing that they are seeking employment during this period.
The representatives of the University agree to meet with the Union prior to the winter intersession period to discuss temporary employment opportunities for employees laid off during this period. Both parties recognize that such opportunities will be limited.
Employees hired to work in a temporary position during winter intersession shall be paid their regular rate of pay, but no more than the maximum of the applicable bargaining unit wage grade.
Employees laid off during the winter intersession period in the Department of Campus Life and Statler Hotel may use one day of accrued sick leave during this period as leave with pay.
ARTICLE 15 PERSONNEL FILES
Division of Human Resources shall maintain the official personnel file for each employee. The University shall use personnel files for University-related activities. Information from the personnel files shall not be made available to anyone outside the University and shall be held in the strictest confidence unless the employee grants written permission or unless the University is required by law or subpoena, or unless the information in an employee's personnel

Sick leave cannot be taken before it is accrued.
Sick leave shall be available for only personal employee illness or employee dental or medical appointments which cannot be scheduled outside regular working hours.
Employees should submit, with as much advance notice as possible, a leave request to their supervisor for routine medical and dental appointments.
In the event of a medical emergency, the employee's supervisor should be notified as soon as possible. When there is a reason to suspect abuse, supervisors may request a physician's certificate as verification of an employee's illness before approving the payment of sick leave.
To be eligible to receive sick leave pay employees must abide by the call-in procedure set forth by their individual departments except when failure to notify is due to circumstances beyond the control of the employee.
Upon return to work from sick leave the University reserves the right to require the employee to submit medical proof of fitness for the resumption of duties.
On the first day of a job related injury (i.e., workers' compensation), time away from work to receive first aid treatment will be considered leave with pay. However, any other lost time from work on day one will be charged to the employee's sick leave.
Health Care Leave
Up to three (3) working days of accumulated sick leave may be taken within each fiscal year in the event that an employee's full attention is necessary to care for a member of the employee's immediate household, or who is a member of the immediate family or a dependent. Immediate family shall be restricted to those relationships identified in Article 28. Regular part-time employees may take the prorated equivalent. Health care leave that is not used by the end of the fiscal year will remain as unused sick leave.
Where health care leave is used for an emergency, the employee's supervisor must be notified as soon as possible. Health care leave for purposes other than an emergency requires advance permission of the employee's supervisor.

Personal Leave
Up to three (3) working days of accumulated sick leave may be taken for personal reasons or emergencies within each fiscal year. For employees with twenty (20) or more years of continuous service, up to five (5) working days of accumulated sick leave may be taken for personal reasons or emergencies within each fiscal year effective the beginning of the next fiscal year. Regular part-time employees may take the pro-rated equivalent. Personal leave may be taken only if an equal amount of sick leave has accrued. Personal leave that is not used by the end of the fiscal year will remain as unused sick leave.
Where personal leave is used for an emergency, the employee's supervisor must be notified as soon as possible. Personal leave for purposes other than an emergency requires advance permission of the employee's supervisor.
Sick leave and personal leave balances are canceled upon termination of the employee and may not be taken as terminal leave. An employee shall not earn or use sick/personal leave when the employee is on an unpaid leave from the University.
If there is reason to suspect abuse, supervisors may require verification of the personal reason or emergency causing an employee to request use of Personal Leave. Employees may choose to provide verification to their supervisor or a higher level of departmental supervision.
An employee shall not earn or use personal leave when the employee is on unpaid leave from the University.
ARTICLE 32 VACATION
Employees are eligible to use accrued vacation leave after twelve (12) months of continuous service at the University. However, with the supervisor's approval, employees may use accrued vacation after six (6) months. If the employee terminates prior to completing twelve (12) months of service, the amount of vacation paid will be deducted from the employee's final paycheck. Vacation shall accrue for each straight time hour worked, including paid personal leave,

If a scheduled University holiday falls within an employee's vacation period, the employee shall be given the holiday pay and shall not have to use vacation time for that day. If an employee is on vacation when the University declares an unscheduled day off (e.g., inclement weather) the employee shall continue to use vacation time for that day and will not be given an additional day off.
Upon termination, an employee shall have a right to receive payment for all unused vacation time, provided the employee has completed at least one year of continuous service.
When an employee retires, accrued vacation may be paid in normal payroll amounts and cycles until the current and accrued vacation is exhausted otherwise vacation will be paid in a lump sum. Employees who receive vacation pay following retirement will receive holiday pay for all holidays covered under Article 33 of this Agreement which fall within the period.
Except as provided in Short-Term Disability, vacation time cannot be substituted for sick leave. The supervisor has sole discretion to approve the use of vacation time when employees have exhausted their accrued sick leave.
Written requests for vacation time off shall be submitted as soon as reasonably possible to the employee's supervisor. The employee shall receive a copy of the approval or rejection within a two (2) week time period. Once approved, the vacation time off cannot be canceled or changed without the agreement of the employee.
The following procedure applies solely for the purpose of resolving conflicting vacation requests:
Employee requests for vacation between October 1 and March 31 shall be submitted in writing before September 23. Requests for the period of April 1 through September 30 shall be submitted before March 23. When multiple vacation requests for the same period are simultaneously received, approvals will be granted by length of seniority, with the highest seniority employee given first preference. Approval or denial of requests shall be returned to the employee no later than March 30 or September 30. All requests for vacation shall be considered by the department in keeping with business needs. An exception to this procedure may be made for an employee who must make a financial commitment to specific vacation plans more than four (4) months in advance of the vacation date. Such requests may be approved or denied based on business needs on a first

come first served basis. The employee may be required to demonstrate such financial commitment.
An employee’s request for vacation may be based on balances that could accrue after the cutoff dates identified above. Any approval of a vacation request will be contingent on the employee having a sufficient vacation balance at the time vacation is used.
When an employee has accrued vacation leave and dies, the corresponding payment for such shall be paid to the employee's duly appointed legal representative or any relative the University in its discretion may deem appropriate.
ARTICLE 33 HOLIDAYS
The University shall observe the holidays listed below for employees covered by this Agreement:
•	Memorial Day
•	Independence Day
•	Labor Day
•	Thanksgiving Day
•	Friday After Thanksgiving Day

Each year Division of Human Resources shall announce the specific calendar days on which the holidays shall be observed. Holidays which fall on Saturdays or Sundays shall be designated by the University for observance on a weekday.
Holiday Pay

on that holiday. In addition, the employee shall receive compensatory time off equal to the number of hours worked on that holiday, not to exceed the employee's standard workday. Unused compensatory time will be paid out at the end of the fiscal year.
At the discretion of the department, after advanced discussion with the employee, employees may receive holiday pay in lieu of holiday compensatory time off. Only time worked in this option shall be used for overtime purposes.
Eligibility
To be eligible to receive holiday pay the employee must work the employee's last scheduled work day prior to and the employee's next scheduled workday after a holiday, unless the employee is able to substantiate, in management's judgment, a reasonable cause for absence.
For each holiday period the employee must work the last scheduled workday prior to each holiday period and the next scheduled workday after each holiday period. Failure to do so shall disqualify the employee for pay for one holiday in the holiday period, unless the employee is able to substantiate, in management's judgment, a reasonable cause for absence.
The mid-year Intersession shall include the winter holiday period (6 working days).
When departments or dining units are not completely shut down during the mid-year Intersession period and less than the full complement of employees are scheduled to work, employees may apply to their immediate supervisor for time off during this period and it will be granted, in keeping with operational needs, in order of seniority. Employees who are on temporary layoff during this period may request any unpaid workdays be charged to personal or vacation leave time.
Laid off employees shall be eligible to receive holiday pay for all of the holidays in the mid-year Intersession period if they meet one of the following:
1.	They are laid off during the five (5) working days immediately prior to the last day of final exams prior to the start of the mid-year Intersession period.

employees to work overtime or report on their scheduled hours or days off.
When feasible departments shall give employees at least one (1) week notice prior to weekly work schedule changes or long-term changes in work location. Except in emergency situations, no schedule shall be changed for any single employee more than three (3) times in a fiscal year to avoid overtime without the employee’s consent. This does not apply to employees who are hired with the understanding that his/her position requires a variable schedule.
Employees will notify their supervisor if they desire a change in schedule within their department. Where feasible, departments will honor seniority in scheduling within job classification for open positions and will consider schedule change for other positions annually beginning in January 2010. If management cannot accommodate seniority, management will explain the reasons to the employee and the union, and will work with the employee to avert a similar situation in the future.
Irrespective of the days worked or the number of hours worked in any one day, employees shall be paid for all hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours in any given work week at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay. All hours paid in the work week as defined below shall be counted for the purpose of computing overtime in any work week. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime and/or premium pay.
Other than during emergency situations, seniority shall be respected when scheduling overtime.
The work week begins at 12:00 a.m. Thursday and ends at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week or as a limitation on the right of the University to require overtime.
Shift Differential
Employees who are regularly scheduled to work a shift which includes four or more hours between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. shall be paid ninety cents ($.90) per hour. Any employee who is involuntarily assigned to a shift on a temporary basis for three (3) days or more in a week shall be paid this shift differential. Shift differential shall be paid for the following paid leave situations: vacation, holiday, sick, personal family health care leave and bereavement leave.

Call-Back Pay
Employees required to return to work after leaving the University's premises following their work shifts shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours pay.
In the event an employee is called back a second time within eight (8) hours of leaving work, only actual hours worked during the call-back shall be counted toward the calculation of overtime.
Employees who report to work on a scheduled workday and are sent home due to a scheduling error on the part of management shall be guaranteed either four (4) hours of work or four (4) hours of pay.
ARTICLE 36 WAGES
It is the responsibility of management, the Union and the employee to insure the proper placement of employees in the wage step system.
When an error of placement or a pay rate comes to the attention of management, the error will be corrected. Retroactivity for an overpayment or an underpayment will be limited to the beginning of the fiscal year in which it was brought to management's attention, except if the error is brought to management's attention in July, the retroactivity may go back to the prior July.
All employees will be paid in accordance with the instructions indicated on the wage schedules below for the life of the agreement. In addition, in year one of the agreement a Lump Sum Payment was negotiated as outlined below.
2009-2010 Lump Sum Payment - Effective 07/01/2009

Letter of Understanding A Agricultural Seasonal Employees
Except for the provisions of Article 14, Layoff and Recall, employees hired to work in an agricultural seasonal position for a period of more than six (6) months are subject to the provisions of the agreement reached between Cornell University and the United Auto Workers. The employee's service will be terminated at the end of the seasonal employment.
For purposes of seeking other bargaining unit work, prior to or following termination, and for purposes of placement in the wage step system while in Plantations, the employee shall have seniority equal to the total time worked in that seasonal position. This seniority shall be frozen for a period equal to the length of the last period of seasonal employment.
Seasonal employees at Cornell Plantations are eligible to use accrued vacation leave after twelve (12) months of service at Cornell Plantations. Service does not need to be continuous but should be in blocks of at least six (6) months. With the supervisor's approval, after six (6) months of service employees may begin to use accrued vacation during the 2nd season of employment. If the employee terminates prior to completing twelve (12) months of service, the amount of vacation already paid will be deducted from the employees final paycheck.
Vacation time shall accrue according to the UAW contract.
Accrued vacation time may only be used during the employees scheduled employment period. Vacation time may not be used to extend the employment period past the scheduled termination date. If the employee terminates after twelve (12) months of service but prior to the scheduled end of the season, accrued vacation time will be paid through the end of the season or until vacation accrual is exhausted, whichever comes first.
If vacation time is not used up at the end of the season it may be carried forward to the next year's seasonal employment period at Cornell Plantations. If the employee does not return to Cornell Plantations the following year any accrued vacation time is lost.
This policy will take effect with the 1991 season and will apply to anyone who returned from the 1990 season and is working for Cornell Plantations in 1991.

However, employees may elect to remain in their current division (contract college or endowed) and turn down a full time offer for the other division, and not lose their spot on the seniority list, in order to wait for an opening in their current division. At that point, the employee will be placed in the next available full time position. This placement may result in a different work location for the employee.
•	The department agrees to notify the union president via telephone of any probation extensions before a decision is made.
•	When a full time need exists on a temporary basis, a reasonable effort will be made to place a regular part time employee in good standing in the same building into such temporary need based on seniority, prior to offering the hours to a temporary employee.
•	As discussed and clarified at sub council meetings, employees will be compensated for function set-up and tear-down duties in keeping with current practice.

•	If a current full time employee wishes to become part time, such request will be granted. However the employee may be assigned to a different work location. The change in appointment to part time status shall be in effect for a minimum of one (1) year. Exceptions to this shall be considered on a case-by-case basis, e.g., loss of day care, employee or family illness, etc and will be granted when possible. If the employee wishes to return to full time status, the request must be submitted in writing to the supervisor. The employee will be placed in the next available full time position. This may also result in placement for the employee in a different work location. The employee may elect to stay in the same division (i.e. contract colleges or endowed).
•	Bulletin boards are provided at all time clocks and the parties agree to jointly monitor the material on the boards. It is agreed that all postings shall be dated to indicate the "life" of such postings and that once the date expires the posting may be removed. If there is a question as to the "life" of a posting, the supervisor and steward shall discuss it prior to its removal.
•	Building Care will provide a clock list to the Union on a semi-annual basis unless otherwise requested by the UAW.
•	Efforts will be made by the Union to schedule union business leave to straddle the break or lunch period.
•	The Building Care managers agree to give as much notice as possible to employees who are moved to a different area. Additionally, the department agreed to communicate the reasons for a move to a different area whenever possible. Temporary or lower senior employees, when possible, will typically be first to regularly be assigned to another area. The department will also give consideration to employee requests to remain in an assigned area or be moved to another area. However, Building Care must retain the right to reassign employees to meet the needs of a large service department.
•	Building Care’s current policy is that our more relaxed policy (shorts permitted) is in effect between the end of reunion weekend and the start of Fall classes. There have and will be occasions of unusually hot weather in the Spring and Fall when we will make an exception to this policy. Employees may bring shorts to work on days when it is expected to be hot and will be allowed to change into them if Manage

ment deems it appropriate. Employees shall not be sent home for an initial violation of the Building Care’s dress code unless such violation is of a serious nature.
•	Building Overtime - Building overtime, other than special assignments and emergency situations, shall be assigned for business efficiency reasons, to the person who is regularly assigned to work the floor where the overtime is available. If that person is unavailable, such assignment shall be rotated by seniority within that building. If additional employees are needed to work the building assignment, the department shall offer the overtime to other employees in that building on a rotating basis by seniority.
•	Complex Overtime and Departmental Overtime - The department has then agreed to create the following overtime assignment lists: one for each complex and one for the entire department. When special assignment overtime work is available within a complex, names will be selected first from the complex list in which overtime is available. If no one is interested the department wide list shall be used. The initial lists shall be developed based on seniority and if you accept overtime, or if you are asked and reject the overtime, your name moves to the bottom of the list. Each manager shall maintain his/her own complex list. The department list shall be maintained centrally. Every six months, all Care of Buildings employees will be asked whether they are willing to work overtime and the lists will be updated accordingly. As new names are added to the lists they shall be slotted in order of seniority into the existing list without disrupting the rotation.
•	Building Care retains the right to assign head custodians to overtime assignments only when a lead person is needed, as determined by the department.
•	It is agreed that for planned overtime projects in a particular complex, the department may post a sign-up sheet at each clock for employees with an interest in the overtime assignment to sign. This is in lieu of the department asking each employee in the complex if they have an interest in the overtime assignment. For overtime assignments in Barton Hall or department-wide, the department will continue to distribute a signup list for all employees every six (6) months. Employees who refuse overtime assignments, do not show up or are late two (2) times during a six (6) month period will be dropped from the overtime list.

•	The department will continue to provide slip resistant boots to those employees who are required to maintain swimming pools, showers, locker rooms and employees required to strip floors. The department will consider recommendations for other types of slip resistant boots.
Statler Hotel
•	For the purpose of fostering good communications, we agree to conduct quarterly meetings of a small group of bargaining unit employees representing each of the Statler departments with the Hotel School’s Director of Human Resources and other invited Statler managers. The UAW will contact the Statler HR office to schedule these meetings.
•	The Statler will provide ongoing diversity/inclusiveness and health/ safety training and programming.
•	When bargaining unit employees must be called in on a day that they had not been scheduled to work, the supervisor shall start with the senior-most employee in the job title/grade, proceeding through the list in order of seniority.
•	Subject to availability and non-peak times, Statler Hotel bargaining unit employees may receive a ten percent (10%) discount on guest rooms, banquet functions and dinner/brunch in Banfi’s Restaurant. The Statler employee may extend this discount to his/her immediate family (parents and children), but the Statler employee must make the room reservation and be present for the food & beverage functions.
•	Statler Housekeeping room attendants are typically assigned 14 room credits per 8-hour work shift. A Tower Suite with two bathrooms will count as two credits. If someone calls off work, a room attendant might be assigned 15 room credits. Fewer rooms are assigned to room attendants who have to travel several floors to complete their rooms; or, they are assigned less “checkouts” and more “stay-overs”. Room attendants who are able to clean more than 15 room credits up to Statler Standards in an 8-hour work shift will be paid an additional five dollars ($5.00) per room credit for each room credit over 15.
•	The Statler will provide for or subsidize the expense (up to $57) of one pair of Statler-approved work shoes per year for our bargaining unit Housekeeping and Food & Beverage employees. This amount

shall increase by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) each year for the remainder of the agreement.
Plantations
•	Clothing & Outer Wear Allowance: All full-time and seasonal Plantations staff who are members of the collective bargaining unit will be provided with a clothing and shoe allowance of three-hundred-three dollars ($303) per year payable through the payroll system after the employee has completed probation. This total allowance shall be increased in subsequent contract years by the rate of inflation as determined by the CPI.
•	Uniforms: Plantations will contract with the University's preferred uniform supplier to provide vehicle mechanics with the standard package of 5 clean mechanic uniforms per week.
•	Grandfather Clause for Seasonal Terminations: Most Plantations seasonal staff are now employed on an "8+4" basis (8 months of fulltime work; 4 month of part-time work). This practice was developed at the request of the seasonal staff to ensure that year-round work could provide for year-round income, and that critical benefits coverage could be maintained year-round without interruption. Seasonal staff hired prior to January 1, 1999, may request to return permanently to the prior practice of being terminated after 10 months of full-time seasonal employment. Staff exercising this "grandfather clause" option must make this request in writing to the supervisor by September 1 of the year in which the permanent schedule change will occur. Subsequently, these staff will be provided with one opportunity to convert back permanently to the standard 8+4 schedule. Again, a request to convert back to the standard 8+4 schedule must be submitted in writing to the supervisor by September 1 of the year in which the schedule change will occur. However, it is important to note that once the conversation back to the standard 8+4 scheduled is granted, that staff member is no longer covered by this grandfather clause and may not request for a second time to be returned to the prior practice of working 10 months full-time followed by termination.
•	New employees will retain their original date of hire, irrespective of seasonal layoff.

•	If Plantations has a need to reduce staff during seasonal employment, employees shall be given a minimum of 14 calendar days notice or pay in lieu of notice.
•	Employees who are terminated or laid off at the end of a season are not eligible for continued health Insurance coverage other than those benefits covered under COBRA.
•	The Union agrees to allow Plantations to waive posting in those situations where employees are returning to the same grade and classification in subsequent seasons. However, all parties recognize that certain University procedures, such as waiver of posting policy, must be met.
Mechanical Shop
•	All mechanics who use their personal vehicles for related matters shall receive one-hundred-fifty-one dollars ($151) bi-weekly during the first year of this contract and this allowance will increase by the CPI for the following three years.
•	Clothing/Shoe allowance: the department agrees to provide clothing and shoe allowance of three-hundred-twenty-five dollars ($325) during the first year of the contract, and this allowance will increase by the CPI for the following three years.
•	Shift differential: all regular scheduled employees who work on weekends (6:00 PM Friday till 6:00 AM Monday) will be paid the following allowance: Employees scheduled to work four or more hours between the hours of 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM will get $1.72 an hour increase in pay. Any employee who works during the hours of 6:00 AM till 6:00 PM will receive $1.06 an hour increase. Employees who regularly work a shift from 6:00 AM Monday thru 6:00 PM Friday, which includes four or more hours between the hours of 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM, shall be paid an additional $1.06 an hour. These differentials will remain in effect for the duration of the agreement. If an employee receives this shift differential, then they will not be eligible for the shift differential which is covered under Article 35 of their contract. Management will entertain suggestions from the Union to change the present method of scheduling shift employees.

•	The UAW and Management will work toward an agreement on implementing an apprenticeship program that will give guidelines so an employee will receive the pay for the grade he is working. This program will give SO10 pay for any SO08’s that have completed the program.
•	When there is a business need to fill an SO10 and there are qualified SO08’s available to apply, the parties agree to discuss the waiving of posting for such internal shop candidates in keeping with Article 10, Filling Job Vacancies.
•	All job descriptions may be submitted for review under the provision of Article 40, Reclassifications.
•	Management will review the duties as they are currently being performed by the acting SO-12 Maintenance Mechanic. If management decides there is a continuing need for the position, it will be posted and filled.
Grounds
•	Full time employees shall be provided with a clothing and shoe allowance of two-hundred-seventy-five dollars ($275) after they have completed probation. Employees who do not choose to accept the coveralls provided by the department shall be paid two-hundred-ninety-seven dollars ($297). This allowance shall be increased in subsequent contract years by the rate of inflation as determined by the CPI.
•	Asphalt Worker Shoe Allowance: A shoe allowance for the purchase of flat-soled, rubber safety sneakers or shoes will be made to full time employees of our construction crew who, as determined by our Construction Manager, are designated to be regularly engaged in asphalt paving work causing premature demise of their work shoes. This shoe allowance will be three-hundred-fourteen dollars ($314) for the first year of the contract and will be adjusted for inflation by the CPI in subsequent contract years. Full time employees who have assignment changes eliminating their regular asphalt paving duties will receive the allowance indicated in bullet #1. Full time staff who are newly assigned to begin regular asphalt paving duties in subsequent contract years will receive the difference between their current allowance (under bullet #1) and the asphalt worker allowance.

CU Hospitals for Animals - Staff Coverage Procedures for Equine Farm Animal Hospital and Companion Animal Hospital
Procedures:
1.	Staffing Coverage
Background - The Cornell University Hospital for Animals consists of several 24/7 units, which requires coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by staff who support those units. To meet expectations of superior patient care, animal care staff may be asked to work weekends, holidays, or other shifts/days normally scheduled off in order to meet business/staffing needs.
a.	All regular union staff members will be on a rotation list, which will be based on seniority. The animal care supervisor is responsible for maintaining the rotation list.
• Two separate rotation lists will be maintained. One for holidays and one for regular (non-holiday) work days (Monday through Sunday).
b.	Individuals providing staffing coverage will receive the option of selecting either: a.) pay for the time worked or b.) time off (equivalent to the hours worked) within the same pay week.
• The staff member covering the shift will receive overtime pay if the total hours worked during that pay week exceed 40 hours.
2.	Rotation Process
a.	Union staff members will rotate on the list based on seniority. The initial list established will begin with the most senior union staff member and continue with the remaining staff members in order by seniority.
ii.	Should a staff member decline, the next staff member on the list will be offered the opportunity to work. The staff member who declined will be moved to the bottom of the list and contacted the next time the list rotates back to his/her name.
• Staff members have the right to refuse/decline the request to provide staff coverage.

iii.	If the scheduling effort is being done by phone, a no answer or busy signal equates to “not available” and the next staff member on the list will be called. The list will be noted that the attempt to contact was made. The staff member who was not available will be moved to the bottom of the list and contacted the next time the list rotates back to his/her name.
iv.	Continue down the list until required staffing is obtained.
v.	After required staffing is obtained, the next person on the list becomes the first person called for the next rotation process to cover staffing needs.
vi.	Casuals or temporary staff will be contacted only after exhausting all regular staff members on the rotation list.
b.	In the event that staff coverage becomes mandatory as a result of all staff declining the request to provide coverage, the least senior union staff member will be required to provide coverage. In this case, the individual will receive the option of selecting either: a.) pay for the time worked or b.) time off (equivalent to the hours worked) within the same pay week.
i.	The staff member covering the shift will receive overtime pay if the total hours worked during that pay week exceed 40 hours.
