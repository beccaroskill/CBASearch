Dear Mr. Haynes:
Pursuant to Section 9 of the 2000 IBT MEA, the parties agree that there shall be an increase in the welfare fund contribution of $200 per annum, effective on the last day of the 27th month.
For purposes of implementing this rate increase to the Retiree Welfare Funds, the following shall apply:
♦	The monthly contribution for February 2002, the 26th month, shall be $106.25
♦	The monthly contribution for March 2002, the 27th month, shall be $106.80

These contribution rates shall only apply to those unit agreements that cover the term January 1, 2000 through March 31, 2002, and whose current annual contribution rate is $1,275. For those unit agreements covering a different term and/or with a different annual contribution rate, the parties shall agree upon a similar cost-neutral rate schedule.

Re: 2000 Local 237, International Brotherhood of Teamsters Memorandum of Economic Agreement Funding Issues
Dear Mr. Haynes:
This is to confirm our mutual understanding and agreements regarding the above captioned Agreement.
1.	The Union has provided or shall provide the funding necessary to effectuate the application of the general increases to the additions to gross set forth in Section 4(c). The value of this advance is 0.03%, which is to be charged against the entire compensation package of the 2000 IBT MEA,
2.	Funding was not provided to permit the application of the general increases to the 15 year longevity increments provided in various separate unit agreements. Therefore, the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) of the 2000 IBT MEA shall not apply to such longevity increments.
3.	The three month delay of the effective date of the Additional Compensation Fund (from January 1, 2002 to March 31, 2002) generates a savings of 0.04%. This savings is credited to the entire compensation package of the 2000 IBT MEA.
