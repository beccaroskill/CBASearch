A Statement From the President of the Jefferson Federation of Teachers AFT/LFT/AFL-CIO Local 1559
Dear Colleague:
After surveying the members of the bargaining unit, conducting numerous meetings in schools with teachers and special interest groups, and negotiating many hours, I am proud to present you with a successor negotiated collective bargaining Agreement. This new three-year Agreement contains a number of revised and improved contract provisions that I believe will improve your teaching situation in our school system. In order to assist you with identifying the revisions and additions in the Agreement, all of the changes have been printed in bold type.
Although we did not attain all that you, the teachers we represent, directed us to attain, we were successful with most. This collective bargaining Agreement, just as those negotiated in the past, represent a bridge to the ideal working conditions, salaries and fringe benefits we seek. In addition, due to financial constraints faced in this school system, the salary increases negotiated were not of the caliber which reflects the outstanding teaching professionals in this school system.
An often slow and laborious process, the individuals involved must be given heartfelt thanks for a job well done. The members of the bargaining team should be commended for an outstanding job, after spending many long hours away from family and friends, at no additional compensation.
In closing, I would like to thank the members of the bargaining unit for their support and the JFT leadership for appointing a bargaining team which is one of the best that I have had the good fortune to work with.

A Statement From the Superintendent of Schools of the Jefferson Parish Public School System
Dear Teachers,
A period of intense and amicable negotiations between the Jefferson Parish Public School Board and the Jefferson Federation of Teachers has yielded yet another contract that continues to support the financial interests of the teachers as well as other amenities.
The new three-year contract provides for continuity and considerable stability for both teachers and administrators by encouraging shared responsibilities and cooperative decision-making, resulting in an environment conducive to teaching and learning. One significant change to help realize this result is increased planning time for elementary teachers.
The Jefferson Parish Public School System has been fortunate throughout the years to progress steadily as a result of the dedication and cooperation of many. This contract is the result of such dedication and cooperation on the parts of both of the negotiation teams. I commend their accomplishments and extend my appreciation to them both individually and in their combined efforts.
I

Sincerely,
Elton M. Lagasse Superintendent

Should a job classification be established or if a position in the bargaining unit is reclassified, and such newly established classification or reclassification does not require the recommending of the hiring, firing, disciplining and/or evaluating of members of the bargaining unit, the members of such job classification shall be part of the bargaining unit, provided this paragraph shall apply only to work performed by certified teachers whose functions are substantially similar to the functions of persons already in the bargaining unit.
B.	The Board agrees that during the term of this Agreement it will not recognize any other organization as a bargaining agent for teachers nor extend to any other organization representing teachers any of the rights extended within this Agreement to the Federation.
C.	The Board shall within a reasonable time, not to exceed ten (10) working days, furnish to the Federation upon the written request of the Federation President, or designee, a copy of all public information necessary for the proper administration of

If the requirements for a challenge have been met, the parties to the election (the Board, the Federation and the challenger) shall meet as soon as possible with the American Arbitration Association to establish the rules, date, time and conduct of a secret ballot election; establishing the responsibility for paying the costs and certifying the results of such election. The election shall be decided by a simple majority of the valid votes casts unless the parties otherwise agree.
