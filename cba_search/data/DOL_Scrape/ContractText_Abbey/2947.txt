All other individual grievances in process concerning the same issue shall be consolidated with the "group" grievance.
Section 6.
If a determination satisfactory to the Union at any level of the Grievance Procedure is not implemented within a reasonable time, the Union may re-institute the original grievance at STEP III of the Grievance Procedure; or if a satisfactory STEP III determination has not been so implemented, the Union may institute a grievance concerning such failure to implement at STEP IV of the Grievance Procedure.

An appeal from a determination of the Commissioner of Labor Relations may be taken to arbitration under procedures, if any, applicable to the non-Mayoral agency involved.
Section 11.

Re: 2000-2002 Doctors Council Agreement
Dear Dr. Liebowitz:
This letter will confirm the status of certain agreements reached prior to the negotiations for the 2000-2002 Doctors Council Agreement ("DCA") between the City of New York and the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and the Doctors Council.
UI. The following provisions (based on the letter attached to the 1984-1987 DCA dated October 2, 1986, captioned "Longevity Differential") concerning the proration of prior per-session service upon appointment to a per annum title eligible for longevity differentials pursuant to Article III, Section 8(c) of the 1995-2000 DCA shall be continued during the term of the 2000-2002 DCA.
a.	Incumbent employees who are members of the New York City Employees Retirement System ("NYCERS”) or per-session employees who were appointed to a per annum title between July 1, 1982 and June 30, 1987, shall have their per-session service pro-rated in accordance with the methodology employed by NYCERS in determining service credit for per-session employees.
b.	Any per-session employee who shall be appointed to a per annum position after June 30, 1987, and who is not a member of NYCERS shall have his/her per-session service pro-rated based on the ratio of hours worked in each year as a per-session versus the number of hours listed for the per annum title in Article III.
c.	Nothing contained in these provisions shall modify any previous agreements on pro-ration of per-session time, except as it applies to the application to Article III, Section 8(c).
U 2. The following terms and conditions (based on the letter attached to the 1984-1987 DCA dated October 2, 1986 and captioned ”1984-87 Doctors Council Agreement") shall be continued during the term of the 2000-2002 DCA. It is understood that the welfare fund payments described in paragraph 2(e) shall be continued solely for those Attending Physicians, if any, to whom payments were made during the term of said 1984-1987 DCA.
a.	The Employer shall make hepatitis B vaccine available at no cost to employees covered by the 2000-2002 DCA. In the event that the cost of such vaccine provided to said employees exceeds $25,000, the Doctors Council Welfare Fund shall reimburse the Employer for any such excess.
b.	The Employer shall provide the Doctors Council with list(s) of Employees and their addresses, insofar as such information is available.
c.	To the extent that the PMS and HHC payroll programs permit and when available to all employees paid via said payroll programs:

The City and the Doctors Council reserve all other rights and claims with respect to the definition or application for any other purpose of the number of hours in a tour for Medical Examiners.
e.	The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation will make welfare fund payments to the Doctors Council on behalf of Attending Physicians employed more than (10) hours but less than 18% hours per week in the amount equal to that paid other part-time per annum employees covered by 1984-1987 DCA. These payments shall be made annually, or pro-rated and paid on such other basis as the HHC makes welfare fund contributions in its normal course of business on behalf of employees on the payroll as of July 1, 1984, July 1, 1985, and/or July 1, 1986. There shall be no presumption that this shall continue beyond the term of the 1984-1987 DCA.
H 3. Based on the side letter captioned "Kings County Hospital Emergency Room” (dated February 13 1990), all Physicians and Attending Physicians assigned to the King County Hospital Emergency Room shall receive the salary rates set forth below in lieu of the hourly and annual rates, including any assignment differential(s), contained in the 2000-2002 DCA.
