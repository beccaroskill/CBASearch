ADDENDUM TO
MASTER LABOR AGREEMENTS

The undersigned parties listed below hereby agree to modify the terms and conditions in the Carpenters Master Labor Agreements dated July 15, 2016, which was negotiated with the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of Carpenters of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, to cover the period of time between July 15, 2016 and May 31, 2019.
In an effort to address an industry need for professional construction managers that have management experience in job site coordinator, and a basic working knowledge of the carpenter trade, the following programs have been developed. We agree to the following:
Field Engineer Internship
•	College students entering their second year (or above) or school will be eligible to apply for the Field Engineer Intership Program.
•	Field Engineer Interns generally will spend less than forty (40) hours weekly performing work deemed to fall under Carpenter jurisdiction.
•	The Field Engineer Intern will be paid a salary at no less than First-term Apprentice rate for the applicable agreement to which contractor is signatory.
•	Field Engineer Interns will be taken in by the Local Union as an Applicant, and will be required to pay three (3) months dues totaling ninety dollars ($90.00).
•	Proper apprentice ratios are to be maintained. Field Engineer Interns do not count as Apprentices.
122
•	Participating contractors are required to make only hourly Vacation contributions at the rate of the appropriate bargaining agreement to the Oregon Washington Carpenters Vacation Trust on behalf of the Intern.
•	Participating contractors will notify the Union of the names of Field Engineer Interns and the job sites the Field Engineer Intern is placed on.
Superintendent Management Training Programs
•	UBC Carpenters covered under the current bargaining agreement will be afforded every opportunity to develop management skills.
•	The Superintendent Management Training Programs will address the specific skill blocks needed to effectively manage a construction project.
•	The Superintendent Management Training Programs will be jointly developed by both the contractors and the Union.
Dated this 15th day of July, 2016.
