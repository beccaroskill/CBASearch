than ten (10) calendar days after the occurrence upon which the grievance is based or knowledge of the occurrence upon which the grievance is based, whichever is later.

Article VII - Seniority
Section 1	- Defined
The term "seniority" is defined as including the whole span of continuous service with predecessor contractors, the present contractor, and successor contractors in performance of any work at the same Federal facility from their first day of work on post. Seniority as defined above shall also apply to the continuous service requirements for accrual of vacation benefits. The term "unit seniority" is defined as continuous time spent as an employee from their first shift in an employment classification recognized as part of the bargaining unit Employees whom have entered into the recognized bargaining unit prior to the effective date of this agreement shall retain their current seniority rights and dates. Employees with identical dates of hire will have their seniority defined by a check of the last four (4) digits of their social security number with the lower number being the higher seniority date.
Section 2	- Probation
An employee who has been in the employment of the Company for less than ninety (90) consecutive calendar days shall be considered a probationary employee. During the probationary period the employee shall be subject to layoff, discipline, or discharge at the sole discretion of the Company, and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 3	- Shift Preference
Two weeks before the bid cycle begins, the company will post a schedule which will include all shifts for all members to bid. During the first two (2) weeks of January and July of each year, regular full time (defined as 30 or more hours a week) officers with at least ninety (90) days bargaining unit seniority will bid on the schedule posted on the briefing room Union Bulletin board. Officers will select their shift preference and days off.
The selections submitted will be valid until the next selection period. Days off will take effect during the first pay period of the month following the Selection period. Days off will be awarded by the most senior person getting first choice on each shift. Shift assignments will be awarded based on unit seniority. However, the Company may make certain assignments after a few shift
awards to maintain proper distribution of experience and to address potential employee conflicts. If such action is taken the affected employee(s) and the Union will be notified of the reasons and this should not occur two bids in a row (exclusions to the back-to-back cycle may be made only to accommodate Reserve Guard Scheduling).
Whenever a shift becomes available between shift bids, it should be offered in order of seniority to the entire bargaining unit. To avoid moving everyone's regular days off (RDOs), the officer moving to the open shift will take the vacated RDOs if those are the only RDOs available and keep them until the next shift bid.
Section 4	- Shift/Day Off Swaps
Any officer who desires a change in shift due to hardship circumstances must obtain a mutually acceptable shift trade or days off trade with another officer in his/her unit. The proposed shift change must be put in writing, submitted to the supervisor for his/her approval, shall not exceed a period of thirty (30) days, and shall not cause the Company to incur overtime as a result. A change in shift must be approved by management prior to its effective date Approval for a continuation of the change in shift beyond thirty (30) days will necessitate a repeat of the above process.
Section 5	- Lay Off-Recall
The Company will provide a minimum of two (2) weeks' notice of any anticipated reduction in force, except where circumstances beyond the Company's control prevent such timely notification. The Company may elect to pay two week's wages and benefits at normal rate and hours of pay in lieu of notice. This compensation does not preclude the company's obligation for severances pay. If a lay off is still required, Probationary employees shall be laid off first, followed by part time and then full-time employees, each according to lowest unit seniority first form within the classification. Recall shall be accomplished in inverse seniority order within the classification, with the most senior employee on layoff being recalled first to his/her classification or to any classification for which. he/she previously performed work and is qualified to perform work, provided such recall shall not displace an employee currently occupying the classification. Determining qualifications shall be the prerogative of the Company.
If an employee chooses to accept an optional layoff rather, he/she will remain on layoff status up to twenty-four (24) months with recall rights as set forth in this agreement.
Article 8 - Employee Classifications

•	The Company shall submit to the Union, for its approval, the job description and duties and proposed rate of pay for the new classification. In the event an agreement between the Company and the Union is not reached within five (5) calendar days from the date of submission, the Company may place into effect the new classification at the proposed rate of pay, subject to continued negotiations with the Union.
•	If agreement between the Company and the Union is not reached within ten (10) calendar days from the date of submission, either party may notify the other party, in writing, of its intent to appeal the matter to arbitration and shall request a panel of seven (7) arbitrators in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.

If due to mission requirements, unpaid breaks cannot be taken, the employee will be compensated for such time with proper reporting to supervision.
Article 10	- Overtime
Section 1
The provisions of this Article are intended only to provide the basis for the distribution and calculation of payment of overtime and shall not be construed as a guarantee of any specific overtime hours.
Section 2

Section 9
The Mandatory Overtime List shall be posted on the Union bulletin board and updated to reflect changes as they occur.
Article 11	- Working Assignments
Section 1

Goldwater Range and Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field requires that non-bargaining unit personnel may be required to perform a variety of duties which are similar in nature, and in some cases physically identical to those performed by bargaining unit personnel only when bargaining unit employees are not
available. The parties therefore agree that management may be permitted to perform the work of the bargaining unit for:

•	Covering positions for short notice leaves and terminations (voluntary or involuntary)
•	Assisting to ensure that the Company meets contractual and operational requirements

Section 2

Section 2
