ARTICLE 1 AGREEMENT
1.1	AGREEMENT
This Agreement is made and entered into between Stanford Hospital and Clinics (SHC) and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital (LPCH), both non-profit public benefit corporations, hereinafter sometimes referred to as “SHC/LPCH", Employer, or “management" and the Service Employees International Union, Local 715, AFL-CIO, CLC (hereinafter referred to as "Union”).
1.2	PURPOSE OF AGREEMENT
1.2.1	It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto that this Agreement constitutes an implementation of the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, with respect to collective bargaining, and provides for orderly and constructive employment relations in the public interest, in the interest of Stanford Hospital and Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, and the interests of the employees represented by the Union.
1.2.2	The parties hereby acknowledge that this Agreement represents the
understanding reached by the parties as a result of the unlimited right and opportunity of the parties to make any and all demands with respect to the employer-employee relationship that exists between them relative to the scope of bargaining.
1.3	RECOGNITION
1.3.1	Pursuant to the Certification of Representation issued by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in Case No. 32-RC-4504, as modified in Case No. 32-UC-363, the Employer recognizes the Union, as the sole and exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining for all full-time, part-time, and relief non-professional employees performing service and patient care functions employed at Stanford Hospital, Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, Welch Road and Blake Wilbur Drive locations in positions or classifications listed as included in Appendix A, excluding those positions or classifications listed as excluded in Appendix A, excluding all employees represented by any other labor organization, excluding all managerial, supervisory or confidential employees within the meaning of the NLRA, and excluding all other employees.
1.3.2	Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the term “employee" or "employees" as
used in this Agreement will refer to employees of Stanford Hospital and Clinics and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital employed in the positions or classifications listed as included in Appendix A and covered by this Agreement. Similarly, unless expressly indicated otherwise, “classification” or “classifications” refers to classifications listed in Appendix A as covered in their entirety, and “position" or “positions" refers to a specific job position or job positions listed in Appendix A, where the classification under which it falls is not included in the bargaining unit in its entirety (e.g., there are positions in the classification that are also listed in Appendix A as excluded).
1
1.4	NEW POSITIONS
1.4.1	When the Employer creates a new position and title which it believes is within a classification that is included in the bargaining unit, ihe Employer will notify the Union in writing of the bargaining unit assignment if any, of such position. The Union will have fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the notice is mailed to contest the Employer’s assignment. If the Union contests the assignment, the Employer will meet with the Union in an attempt to reach agreement on the bargaining unit assignment. If the j arties are unable to reach agreement, the dispute will be submitted to arbitration for resolution. If the Union does not contest the bargaining unit assignment within the fourteen (14) calendar day notice period, the unit assignment of the new position will be deemed agreeable to the parties. Bargaining unit assignments made by the Employer which are contested by the Union will Hi main as originally assigned by the Employer unless and until such time as the parties are in mutual agreement as to a different assignment or, if s uch assignment is referred to arbitration within the appeal period stated above, until resolution of the matter by arbitration. Any change in assignment by agreement of the parties or by an arbitrator’s decision will be prospective only.
1.4.2	If the inclusion of a new position within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement is agreed to by the parties or found apprc oriate in arbitration, the Employer will assign a pay rate to the position. Within fifteen (15) calendar days of the assignment of the pay rate, the Union me / request, in writing, that the Employer meet to discuss the pay rate for the classification. If such a request is made, the parties will meet within thirty (3C) calendar days of the request and discuss the pay rate for the classification. If the Employer agrees to make a change to the rate the change will ne prospective only.
1.5	RECLASSIFICATION FROM BARGAINING UNIT TO NON-UNIT POSITIONS
The Employer will not change the title of an existing classification or create a new classification with the same duties but a different title in order to remove the classification from the bargaining unit or to avoid its placement in the bargaining unit. This limitation is not, however, intended to apply to the creation nf new positions in a classification where only specific positions in the classification are listed as included in Appendix A. In the event the Employer determines that a position or classification should be reclassified with the result that the position or classification would be removed from the bargaining unit, it will notify the Union in writing. If the Union believes that the reclassification or designation is inconsistent with this Agreeme it, it may appeal the designation to arbitration within fourteen (14) calendar days of t ie date the notice is sent in accordance with the following procedures.
1.5.1	An arbitrator will be selected and the arbitration will I : e conducted in
accordance with the Arbitration provisions of this Ag eement.
1.5.2	The Union will have the burden of proof and of proceeding in arbitration under this Article.
2
1.5.3
The arbitrator’s decision will be limited to only the issue of whether the position or classification in dispute should remain within or be removed from the bargaining unit, and the arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding.
1.5.4	Standards to be used by the arbitrator in reaching a decision will include: that all managerial, supervisory, and confidential employees within the meaning of the NLRA are excluded; that employees who hold any managerial, supervisory, or confidential position, regardless of the percentage of time worked in such position, are excluded; and that all the Employer student employees whose employment is contingent upon their status as students are excluded.

1.6.1	The Employer may assign employees covered by this Agreement for full or partial shifts on a temporary or sporadic basis to perform services in a position not covered by this Agreement due to a temporary or unforeseen need, or to avoid a cancellation of the employee for the day, provided the employees are presently qualified to perform the work in question. Such an assignment will not affect the employee's pay, benefit accruals, seniority, or other benefits or status as an employee covered by this Agreement. The Union will not have any claim that the work or position to which the employee is assigned under this provision is covered by this Agreement. If an employee is utilized to fill a position not covered by this Agreement for more than five (5) consecutive work days, the Union will be provided with written notification. An employee will not be required to work involuntarily in a position not covered by this Agreement for more than five (5) consecutive work days.
1.6.2	The Employer may assign employees not covered by this Agreement for full or partial shifts on a temporary or sporadic basis to perform services in a position covered by this Agreement due to a temporary or unforeseen need to provide services, or in lieu of: the use of covered employees who are not in an on-call status under the callback provisions of this Agreement; the use of covered employees to work double shifts or “double backs"; or the use of registry or temporary agency personnel. Such assignments will not be made, if an employee in the classification and department/unit has been cancelled for the shift in question, provided the cancelled employee is available to return within the time needed. Employees not covered by this Agreement who are assigned to perform services under this provision are not subject to this Agreement during such assignment.

3.1.1	Join and maintain membership in the Union;
3.1.2	Choose not to join the Union but pay to the Union a monthly service fee charge equivalent to his/her share of the costs incurred by the Union related to collective bargaining, contract administration and grievance adjustment, as determined under applicable law. The Union will advise the Employer and the employees of the amount annually, or upon request.
3.1.3	Employees who hold good faith religious beliefs which oppose membership in and contributions to a labor organization may choose instead to contribute a monthly sum equal to the regular monthly service fee amount to one of the following three nonprofit charitable organizations, exempt from taxation under Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code: 1) the Lucile Packard Children's Foundation; 2) the United Way; or 3) the American Cancer Society. Such employees will be required to verify to the Union their payments to the charitable organization.
3.1.4	Any employee covered by this Agreement who fails to comply with the provisions of this Article will, upon notice of such failure in writing from the Union to the Employer and after counseling of such employee by SEIU, be discharged or allowed to resign no later than fifteen (15) days following receipt of written request from SEIU to terminate such employee. However, SEIU will not request the termination of any employee whose failure to pay periodic dues, service fee or charitable contribution is attributable to pay periods in which the employee’s paycheck, after all mandatory deductions and benefits contributions, is less than the sum of the dues or service fee. For purposes of this provision an employee will be deemed to be in compliance if the employee has duly tendered the specified monthly service fee, dues or charitable contribution.
3.1.5	This section (3.1) will not take effect until ninety (90) days after the effective date of this Agreement.
3.2	DUES DEDUCTION
3.2.1	Upon receipt of a written authorization by a Employee using a form which has been mutually agreed to by the parties, the Employer will deduct and remit to the Union no less frequently than once a month the periodic dues of the Union or service fees until such time as the Employee submits written notification to the Employer to discontinue the Employee's authorization. The Employer will not be responsible for deduction in any pay period in which the Employee's net earnings are insufficient to cover the deduction. The
5
Employer will also remit an alphabetical list showing the names of payees and the amounts deducted and remitted. Upon request of the Union, the Employer will meet to determine the appropriate mecianics for providing such information.
3.2.2	The Employer agrees to use its best efforts to administer this provision in an accurate and timely fashion. The Union will inform the Employer once a year of the amount of the monthly dues and the service fe? under this provision. Such notice will be sent sufficiently in advance of an\ change in the amount(s) to allow for payroll programming of the me nthly dues and service fee change. It will also be the Union’s responsibility lo notify the Employees of any change in the amounts the Employees are rec uired to pay to the Union under this provision. If, through inadvertence or erro1, the Employer fails to make authorized deductions, or any part thereof, the Employer wilt, upon receipt of written notice thereof correct such omission or error retroactively to a maximum of one (1) month's dues or fees, as appl cable. Once the funds are remitted to the designated representatives of the Union, their disposition thereafter will be the sole and exclusive responsibilit7 of the Union. It is expressly understood and agreed that the Union will refund to the Employee any deductions erroneously withheld from an Employee’s wages by the Employer and paid to the Union.
3.3	INDEMNIFICATION
It is specifically agreed that the Employer assumes no obligation other than that specified above, nor does it assume any liability, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article. To ensure this result, the Union agree s that the provisions of 3.1.4 notwithstanding, the Employer will not be obligated to terminate an employee whom the Union claims is not in compliance with financial or other requirements of Article 3.1, unless the Union agrees at the time of its request for the employee's termination that it will also indemnify the Employer for all reaso lable attorney’s fees and costs of its defense in any administrative and/or judicial proceedings that might arise out of such termination of employment, whether brought by the employee or former employee, governmental agency, or any other entity on the employee's behalf.

12.5.4	Calculation. Severance pay is based on years of Regular employment at the Employer without a break in employment as described in Article 10. Severance pay is calculated using the base monthly :»ay at time of indefinite layoff.
