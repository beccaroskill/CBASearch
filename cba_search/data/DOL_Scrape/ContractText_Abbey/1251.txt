a.) Introduction: The Employers have the responsi
32
6/18/98 to 6/1/2003
LRD/MRBA
TEAMSTERS
bility to provide their workers with a safe work place, reduce their liability from accidents, and promote public safety. This program is designed as an effective program to eliminate drugs and alcohol that would impair worker performance to the extent that these purposes are consistent with individual employee dignity and privacy.
In developing this Article, the parties attempted to be in compliance with applicable Federal and State laws. The parties agree that this drug and alcohol abuse program will be modified in the event Federal legislation or Department of Transportation regulations provide for revised testing methodologies or requirements.
b.) Applicable Work Rules: This program is based on the following work rules:
Employees are forbidden to possess alcohol, illegal drugs, or non-prescribed drugs while on duty or on Company or customer property. Employees are forbidden to use alcohol, illegal drugs, or non-prescribed drugs while on duty or on Company or customer property.
Employees are forbidden to report to work under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or non-prescribed drugs.
The Employer reserves the right to deny any employee permission to work if, in the opinion of the Employer, the employee’s condition will adversely affect his work performance or safety.
All Federal, State, local and
33
TEAMSTERS	6/18/98 to 6/1/2003	LRD/MRBA
Department of Transportation laws and regulations regarding drugs and alcohol are applicable.
c.) Employer Use of Drug and Alcohol Tests: The Employer may establish a uniform policy to require the employee to go to a medical clinic and provide for both blood and urine specimens for laboratory testing for any of the following reasons:
1.	Pre-employment screening;
2.	Department of Transportation and other periodical physical examinations;
3.	Return to work after a layoff in excess of thirty (30) continuous days, provided there is at least three (3) days notice before testing;
4.	In cases where the employee is acting in an abnor mal manner, in the opinion of the supervisor, or the employee’s condition will adversely affect his work performance and safety and the safety of others, in the opinion of the supervisor; or
5.	In accordance with Sections I and J of this Article.
Prior to the performance of any test under this Section, the Employer shall offer to the employee the opportunity to consult with his Union representative and/or Steward if possible. Also, a reasonable amount of time should be allowed for consultation if desired by the employee.
A refusal to provide either specimen will constitute a presumption of intoxication or drug influence and the employee will be subject to discharge without the receipt of a prior warning letter.
34
TEAMSTERS	6/16/96 to 6/1/2003	LRD/MRBA
d.) NIDA Accreditation: All laboratories used to perform testing pursuant to this Agreement must be accredited by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

e.) “Chain of Custody” Documentation: To protect employee dignity and ensure testing accuracy, specimen handling must be accompanied with thorough “claim of custody” documentation, which is a written record detailing the handling of the specimen from the time it is collected from the employee until the time that the test is done. The "chain of custody” form is initialed by the individual collecting the specimen and maintained by each successive individual who comes in contact with the specimen. Each individual involved in the chain must identify the specimen and when an exchange occurs, it is to be documented by the signatures of the receiver and deliverer. A single “chain of custody” form will accompany each specimen at all times and be used to record all of the previously described transactions.
f.) Testing: All confirmatory testing or drug screens must be done by the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method. The level of which tests results will be reported “positive,” in the case of alcohol testing, shall be the State of Michigan’s blood alcohol concentration level for intoxication while driving a motor vehicle. The level at which test results will be reported “positive” in the case of drug screening, shall be the level prescribed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).
In reporting a positive test result, the laboratory shall state the specific substance(s) for which the test is posi-
35
TEAMSTERS	6/18/98 to 6/1/2003	LRD/MRBA
tive and shall provide the quantitative results of both the screening and the GC/MS confirmation test, in terms of nanograms per milliliter. All positive test results must be reviewed by the certifying scientist or laboratory director and certified as accurate.
g.) Split Sample Safeguard: At the request of any employee tested under the drug and alcohol testing procedure contained in this Agreement, a portion of the original specimen(s) will be preserved for private testing by the employee at his or her own expense by an independent laboratory in the event questions are raised concerning the accuracy of the test administered at the request of the Employer. The additional test performed at the employee’s request will be admissible under the grievance and arbitration procedures in this Contract; however, if and only if the methodology employed is substantially identical and equivalent to the methodology authorized in this Article.
If the split sample is negative, lost or contaminated, the test shall be presumed negative.
h.) Prescription and Non-Prescriptlon Medications: The employee must notify the Employer of the use of any prescription or non-prescription medications before the test is given. The Employer may require the employee to provide evidence that a prescription medication has been lawfully prescribed by a physician.
If an employee is taking a prescription or non-prescription medication in the appropriate described manner and has noted such use, as provided above, he will not be disciplined. Medication prescribed for another individual, not the employee, shall be considered to be illegally used and subject the employee to discipline.
