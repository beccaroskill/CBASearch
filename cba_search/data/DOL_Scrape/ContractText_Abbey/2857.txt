ARTICLE 5 REPORTING PAY AND SCHEDULING OF WORK
Section 1	- Tardiness
A.	Reporting to work and being ready to work at the beginning of one’s shift is one of the essential responsibilities of employees. Occasional tardiness may be excused by the Employer, and the employee and the unit manager may agree to decrease the length of breaks or to extend the workday to make up for tardy time. Repeated and excessive tardiness are not acceptable and shall be defined as follows: Four (4) or more occurrences during a sixty (60) consecutive calendar day period of reporting late for work.
B.	Penalties for violating the provisions of A above shall be as follows: First Offense: Written Reprimand
Second Offense: Fine of one day’s pay or loss of one vacation day Third Offense: Fine of two days’ pay or loss of two vacation days Further Offense: Further disciplinary action including termination.
The levels of discipline stated above are permissive, and the Department Head or his designee may consider extenuating circumstances and impose a lesser penalty. If a period of twelve (12) months expires from the date of an offense as defined herein without the commission of an additional offense, the employee shall be considered to be at the First Offense level in the event of any further offense.
C.	If the employee reports for work after his regularly scheduled starting time, he shall be assigned work only if:
1.	The employee calls in at least fifteen (15) minutes prior to his starting time and indicates his expected time of arrival, which must be within one (1) hour of his starting time.
2.	The supervisor informs him that work will be available.
3.	The employee arrives at the time he indicated to the supervisor.
4.	If the employee is told that no work is available, his absence shall be considered authorized.
An employee who does not meet the above conditions, but who does call in, may be assigned work, at the discretion of his supervisor. If he is not assigned ।	work, he shall be deemed tardy.
11
|
D.	Nothing in this Article will relieve an employee of the responsibility to report to work in sufficient time before the start of the work day so that he can begin work at the start of his designated shift.
E.	In the event that a public or private transportation breakdown, act of God, strike (except a strike or concerted action by members of the bargaining unit) is responsible for an employee’s failure to report for work as provided above, then the employee will be excused, but not paid, for the time he has missed. Per diem workers will be paid for the portion of the work they have completed. Evidence of the transportation breakdown shall be provided to the employer, upon request, in order to excuse the tardiness.
F.	The provisions of this Section will not apply if notice had been given that no work is available.
Section 2	- Unreported Employee Absences
A.	Except as otherwise provided, employees are required to report all absences from work to a telephone number designated by the appropriate division no later than the beginning of their regularly assigned starting time. Employees failing to report an absence as required will be subject to disciplinary action as set forth in C below. Employees who report for work within one (1) hour of their regularly assigned starting time shall not be considered as having an unreported absence. Such employee shall be considered tardy.
B.	The City and Union recognize that unreported employee absences cause serious operational problems and place an undue burden upon fellow employees. In order to keep these situations to an absolute minimum, the parties agree that unreported absences will result in disciplinary action as prescribed in C.
C.	Penalties: Penalties for failing to report absences shall be as follows:
1.	First Offense:	Written Reprimand.
2.	Second Offense: A three (3) day suspension without pay, or the loss of one vacation day, or a fine of one day’s pay.
3.	Third Offense: A five (5) day suspension without pay or the loss of two vacation days, or a fine of two day’s pay.
4.	Fourth Offense: Further disciplinary action which may include termination.
The levels of discipline stated above are permissive, and the Department Head may consider extenuating circumstances and impose a lesser penalty. If a period of eighteen (18) months expires from the date of an offense as defined herein without the commission of an additional offense, the employee shall
12
move back to the next lower level of offense. Each additional continuous eighteen (18) month period without an offense of unreported absence shall move the employee back an additional level.
Section 3	- Employees on Overtime Shift
Employees scheduled to work an overtime shift will be subject to all attendance rules as if it were a regular work shift.
Section 4	- Reporting Pay for Incomplete Shifts
If, because of inclement weather or other reasons, an employee is excused from duty after the beginning of the shift by the Department Head or his authorized representative, he shall be paid one-half (%) day’s pay. If any part of the day is worked, the employee shall be paid for the time actually worked, but for no less than one-half (%) day’s pay. An employee so excused from duty shall be allowed to use accrued personal, vacation or sick leave credits to make up any difference for the hours provided for herein and his regularly scheduled work day. Sick pay can only be used when all personal and vacation credits have been exhausted.
Section 5	- Call Back Pay

B.	There shall be only one four (4) hour call back payment for each four (4) hour period, regardless of the number of times an employee is called back during such period.

Emergency overtime is that overtime which has less than one (1) day advance notice and is authorized by the Department Head or his authorized representative.
B.	An employee shall work scheduled or emergency overtime which he has accepted, unless the employee has a reason for not working such overtime which would constitute an excusable reason for not working regularly scheduled hours.
Section 8	- Distribution of Overtime
A.	Distribution of overtime opportunities shall be equalized over each three (3) month period beginning on the first day of January, April, July, and October. If any employee establishes that they did not receive overtime opportunities to which they were entitled under the provisions of this Section, such employee shall have preference to all future overtime opportunities until such situation is corrected.
14
B.	Overtime opportunities will be distributed equally among employees working within the same job title and within the same City facility and Bureau who can do the work. Employees not wishing to be considered for overtime opportunities under this subdivision may waive their rights under this Section, in writing. Said waiver may be withdrawn in writing at any time. However, there shall be no obligation to equalize overtime opportunities for such employees during the quarter in which the waiver is submitted or withdrawn.
C.	All offered overtime opportunities, whether worked, or refused by the employee or if the employee is deemed unavailable, shall be counted toward the balancing of overtime.
D.	On each occasion, the opportunity to work scheduled overtime and, whenever possible, the opportunity to work emergency overtime shall be offered to the employee in the job title and within the same City facility and bureau who can do the work and who has the least number of overtime hours to his credit at that time, except that the City shall not have to recall an employee when a unit employee in the same job title or a higher unit job title in the same job series is on the job site and is willing to work the overtime. If this employee is unable to work the overtime, the employee with the next fewest overtime hours to his credit will be offered the assignment. This procedure shall be followed until the required number of employees has been scheduled for the overtime work.
E.	When there is no volunteer for the required overtime work, whether scheduled or emergency, the Employer shall choose the employee(s) needed to do the work by selecting the least senior employee(s) within the same job title capable of performing the work, except that the City shall not have to recall an employee when a unit employee in the same job title is on duty. Overtime assignments of employees on the job site shall be rotated on the basis of inverse order of seniority. Such employees shall be deemed to have been offered and to have accepted the overtime work. In the event there are two or more employees with identical seniority, the employee with the least credited overtime shall be assigned the work.
F.	A record of the overtime hours credited to each employee shall be available to the Union upon request.
G.	Where an entire classification of employees within the same City facility and bureau is required to work overtime, all such employees notified shall be deemed to have been offered and to have accepted the overtime work.

15
I.	Overtime distribution method in the Division of Solid Waste shall continue unchanged, notwithstanding any contrary provision in this section.
Section 9	- Shift Preference
Shift preference will be granted on the basis of seniority within the same job title and the same division where a vacancy exists, provided the employee submits a written request to his Department Head for a shift change.
Section 10	- Exceptions to Special Pay

A.	Strikes, work stoppages in connection with labor disputes, or failure of utilities beyond the control of the Employer interfere with work being provided, or
B.	An employee is not put to work or is laid off after having been put to work, either at his own request or due to his own fault.
Section 11	- Interruptions Beyond City’s Control
Nothing in this Agreement or in this Article shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week when interruptions of normal City operations are beyond the control of the City.
Section 12	- Absence as Resignation

A.	Whenever an opportunity for promotion occurs because a job opens, in other than a temporary situation as defined elsewhere in this Article, in any existing job classification within the bargaining unit, or as a result of the development or establishment of a new job classification that has been added to
45
the bargaining unit, a notice of such openings shall be posted on all Union bulletin boards stating the job classification, rate of pay and the nature of the job requirements in order to qualify.

B.	In filling open jobs, applications submitted for transfers as provided in Section 10 of this Article, will be considered before the job is posted.
C.	During the posting period, employees who wish to apply for the open position, including employees on layoff, may do so.

In the event that an employee is determined to be unqualified for a position, he shall be informed of the disqualifying factor(s) and shall be allowed three (3) working days to resubmit his application.
D.	A notice listing those employees who have qualified for the position shall be posted by the Employer on all bulletin boards within two (2) working days of the establishment of the list by the Employer. This notice shall be posted >	for a period of at least ten (10) working days. The name of the employee or
p	employees selected for the position shall be sent to the Union Recording
!	Secretary.
[	E. 1. New postings are not required for vacancies in the same title that occur
J	within three (3) months of the last date of initial posting at the sole option
!	of the Employer. In these cases, while the vacancy will not have to be
posted, the City shall on the posting notice, as set forth in subdivision A ।	of this Section, state that the application from such posting may be used
for a period of three (3) months.
i	2. The City will notify the Union of the vacancy occurrence and the City’s
i	intention to fill the vacancy from the list established by the initial posting
?	and provide the Union President with a copy of the list being used to fill
|	the vacancy.
i	Section 3 - Promotion for Laboring, Non-Competitive, Provisional,
i	Temporary Appointments
J,	A. Bidders who respond to postings as specified in Section 2 of this Article, and
who meet the minimum qualifications for the job shall be ranked in order |	of seniority.
46
B.	If the appropriate appointing authority determines that a bidder lacks the ability to do the job or cannot learn to do the job within a reasonable amount of time, the appointing authority shall state the reasons for such determination in writing, the Bureau of Human Resource Management will submit them to the Union and the bidder shall be deemed not qualified for the appointment. Such reasons shall not be arbitrary and capricious.
C.	The appointing authority shall fill the vacancy by selecting one of the four qualified bidders standing highest on the list within thirty (30) days of the establishment of such list. If there are fewer than four (4) qualified bidders to select from, the appointing authority may, but shall not be required, to fill the vacancy among the remaining qualified bidders.
D.	The City may make an Affirmative Action Appointment upon:
1.	Written certification to the Union by the Director of Human Resource Management of the City’s desire to make an Affirmative Action Appointment, and

E.	Any employee selected in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section and Section 2E. shall undergo a probationary period of a minimum of two (2) months but not to exceed six (6) months. If it is found that such employee does not meet the requirements or responsibilities of the position to which he has been selected during the probationary period, then such employee shall be restored to his former position. This restoration shall not be considered a demotion. If work in his former position is not available, the layoff and seniority provisions of this Agreement shall apply.
F.	The provision of subdivision A above may be waived when directed by a court of competent jurisdiction or Federal or State agency having such authority under law, in order to bring about an equitable distribution of employees as provided by the Equal Employment Act of 1972, U.S. Public Law 92-261, or the New York Human Rights Law (Executive Law, Article 15). However, the application of this provision does not prohibit individuals from exercising any rights possessed by them by statute.
Section 4	- Promotion For Competitive Positions
A.	A promotional opportunity within the competitive class of the Civil Service which is to be filled shall be filled pursuant to the Civil Service Law and the rules of the Rochester Municipal Civil Service Commission. In the event that

B.	Where a vacancy occurs in a position classified as competitive, and where a Civil Service examination has been given, but no list has yet been established, the posting provisions of Sections 2 and 3 shall not apply. In the event the City desires to fill the vacancy on a provisional basis, the City shall canvas those employees who have taken the Civil Service examination and shall establish a list, ranked in order of seniority, of those employees who wish to be considered for the position. The City may then make an appointment from the top four (4) employees on the list. In the event that the list has less than four (4) employees the City shall not be required to use the list in making a provisional appointment.
Section 5	- Temporary Promotions
A.	Temporary job openings are defined as job vacancies that may periodically develop on any job classification because of illness, vacation, leave of absence, unexpected addition or increase of work, or other unusual circumstances requiring the temporary placement of an employee. Job openings that recur on a regular basis shall not be considered temporary job openings. It is the intent of this provision to prevent the repeated assignment of employees to job vacancies designated as temporary job openings when such job openings could be filled in another manner.
B.	Where the employer chooses to fill a position with a temporary promotion to a higher classification, it will be filled consistent with law, and as follows:
1.	Where the NYS Civil Service Law requires the use of a Civil Service list for the title, the employer will select from the list as allowed by law:'
2.	To fill an existing position (vacancy, leave of the incumbent, etc.) the most senior employee within the Bureau, division (where the Bureau is divided into divisions), and within the crew (where the workforce is organized into crews), in the next lower title will be offered the position, provided the employee meets the minimum qualifications for the position and can do the job. If that employee refuses, the employer may fill the position at its discretion.
3.	To fill a new position, where the term of the temporary position is greater than three months, and a list is not required, the employer shall post for the position in accordance with Section 2 of this Article, except that the posting shall be for 5 days only and no additions, corrections or modifications to the applications will be allowed.
48
4.	Employees assigned or reassigned to a higher title on a temporary basis will be paid according to Article 11, Section 5 (Out-of-title Pay).

A.	When an employee in the laboring or non-competitive class is laid off due to a reduction in the work force, he shall be permitted to exercise his seniority rights to bump or replace an employee with less seniority in an equal or lower job title under the following conditions:
1.	Seniority is the major factor; and the employee qualifies for the job, and
2.	He can learn to do the available work within thirty (30) working days. The Employer shall determine the bumping order in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision.
B.	At the time of layoff, an employee who is offered a bump down to a lower classification may elect instead to accept a layoff, and upon the exercise of such election shall have the rights of a laid off employee.
49
Section 8	- Recall
A.	All employees in Laboring and Non-Competitive classes who have been laid off shall be recalled within their former title before a new employee is hired in such title.
B.	An employee shall be recalled from layoff to the same title and salary step he was in at the time of his layoff. Such recall shall be in the reverse order of layoff and under the following conditions:
1.	Seniority is the major factor; and,
2.	He can do the available work; or
3.	He can learn to do the available work within thirty (30) working days.
C.	Notice of recall shall be sent to the employee at his last known address by registered or certified mail and a copy sent to the Recording Secretary of the Union. If any employee fails to report for work within ten (10) working days from the date .of mailing the notice of recall, he shall be considered a quit. Recall rights for any employee shall expire one (1) year from the date of layoff, or a period equal to that of his seniority, but never more than four (4) years. Written notice of expiration of recall rights shall be sent to the employee at his last known address by registered or certified mail. It shall be the responsibility of the Union to maintain the recall list from information supplied by the City.
Section 9	- Consolidation or Elimination of Jobs
A.	Employees displaced by the elimination of jobs through job consolidation (combining the duties of two or more jobs), the installation of new equipment or machinery, the curtailment or replacement of existing facilities, the development/of new facilities, or for any other reason, shall be permitted to exercise their layoff and bumping rights described above to transfer to another job in the bargaining unit for which they are qualified. An employee transferred as a result of the application of this provision shall be given a reasonable period of training needed to perform satisfactorily the job to which he is transferred. This reasonable period shall not be less than thirty (30) calendar days or exceed ninety (90) calendar days.
B.	In the event of a merger or consolidation between the City of Rochester and the County of Monroe, or any other governmental unit, and functions or services employing persons covered by this Agreement, then in such event, any City employee electing transfer to the County of Monroe or any other governmental unit, shall be deemed to have voluntarily quit his City employment. However, the City will make every effort to insure that any employee electing such transfer will not lose any benefits that the transferring employee is presently receiving that can be legally transferred.
50
Section 10	- Voluntary Transfer
A.	An employee desiring to transfer to another job shall submit a request on a form designed by the employer and an “Employment/Civil Service Application”, to his immediate supervisor.

The supervisor will forward the application to Human Resource Management for review and determination as to whether or not the employee meets the qualifications for the position to which transfer is desired.
B.	An employee requesting a transfer for reasons other than the elimination of his job or his imminent layoff may be transferred to an equal or lower paying job classification on the basis of seniority, provided a vacancy exists, and the employee can do the job or learn to do the job within thirty (30) working days, provided such transfer is permitted by Civil Service law and rules.
Section 11	- Involuntary Transfer or Relocation
A.	When an employee is subject to involuntary transfer or relocation outside the employee’s department, he shall be given written notice and the reason for the transfer, by the Employer, ten (10) working days prior to such proposed effective date.

A copy of this notice shall be sent to the Union Steward within the Bureau from which the employee is being transferred or relocated and to the Secretary of Local 1635. Notice of transfer or temporary relocation shall not be required if the transfer or relocation is due to the elimination of jobs or the establishment of a new City service or an emergency declared by the Department Head or due to a staffing problem directly related to the approval of an emergency leave of absence.
C.	If an employee feels such transfer within the Department or outside of the Department is unjust, unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, then the matter may be processed as a grievance under the grievance and arbitration procedure in this Agreement. This provision shall not apply to involuntary transfers or relocations that are due to elimination of jobs or establishment of a new City service.
51
ARTICLE 17 DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
Section 1	- Nature of Discipline and Discharge

Section 2	- Procedure
A.	Any disciplinary action imposed upon an employee may be processed as a grievance through the regular grievance procedure, including the arbitration step, if necessary.

Disciplinary arbitrators shall confine themselves to determinations of guilt or innocence and the appropriateness of the imposed penalties. Disciplinary arbitrators shall not add to, subtract from or modify the provisions of this Agreement. The disciplinary arbitrator’s decision with respect to guilt or innocence, penalty, or probable cause for suspension pursuant to subdivision D of this Section, shall be final and binding upon the parties and the employee, and the disciplinary arbitrator may approve, disapprove or take any other appropriate action warranted under the circumstances, including, but not limited to, ordering reinstatement and back pay for all or part of the period of suspension. If the disciplinary arbitrator, upon review, finds probable cause for the suspension under subdivision D of this Section, if any, he may consider such suspension in determining the penalty to be imposed.
D.	Prior to being issued a notice of discipline, an employee may be suspended without pay by his appointing authority only pursuant to paragraphs (1) or (2) below.
1.	The appointing authority or his designee may suspend without pay an employee when the appointing authority or his designee determines that there is probable cause that such employee’s continued presence on the job represents a potential danger to persons or property or would interfere with operations. Such determination shall be reviewable by a disciplinary arbitrator. A notice of discipline shall be served no later than seven (7) working days following any such suspension.
2.	The appointing authority or his designee may suspend without pay an employee charged with the commission of a crime which in the opinion of the appointing authority is directly related to the employee’s job duties.
