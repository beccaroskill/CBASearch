e)	The individual company may elect to have the employee finish his work day at the collection location. Overtime provisions of the Agreement shall apply.

All initial positive tests shall be confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or the appropriate industry standard confirmatory methodology appropriate for the type of specimen.
e)	Urine and/or oral fluids may be tested.

c)	Test results that are verified by the MRO as negative dilute shall allow for a new specimen collection and test at the company’s discretion. The second test result shall be considered the test of record and the first result disregarded.
d)	Test results that indicate misuse of prescription drugs shall be treated as a positive test result.
e)	A refusal to provide a sample shall be treated as a positive test result.
f)	Specimen samples that cannot be collected, or collected properly due to an uncooperative employee shall be treated as a positive test result and handled in accordance with the Agreement.
g)	In the case of a specimen sample that cannot be collected because an employee does not provide a sufficient amount of urine for the drug test (i.e., 45 ml of urine), the following procedures shall be followed:
i)	The collector must discard the insufficient specimen, except where the insufficient specimen was out of temperature range or showed evidence of adulteration or tampering, in which case the test is treated as a positive or positive dilute test result;
ii)	The employee shall be given the opportunity to drink fluids but shall not be forced to drink fluids. The employee shall be informed that he or she has up to three hours to produce an adequate urine specimen, and when that three hour period begins and ends.
iii)	If the employee refuses to attempt to provide a new urine specimen or leaves the collection site before the collection process is complete, it is treated as a refusal to test.
