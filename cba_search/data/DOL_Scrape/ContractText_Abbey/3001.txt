D.	Witnesses required by the school system to testify at a grievance hearing conducted during the employee’s normal working hours will be given time off without loss of pay.
E.	Grievance Process
Step 1. Informal Review
An educational support employee with a grievance shall first discuss it with the principal or immediate supervisor directly, the objective being an informal resolution of the matter. The employee shall request an informal meeting with the person who is the immediate supervisor within ten (10) working days, of the grievable event. The immediate supervisor must hold an informal meeting with the employee within three (3) working days of the request. The immediate supervisor shall respond to the employee within five (5) working days of the meeting.
Step 2. Formal Review
If the employee is not satisfied, or if no decision is rendered within five (5) working days of the meeting, the employee may obtain further formal review by filing a completed grievance form with the immediate supervisor. Such grievance must be in writing and must state specifically that this grievance procedure is being invoked. This filing must be received by the immediate supervisor within five (5) working days of the immediate supervisor’s response or, if there is no response from the immediate supervisor, within ten (10) working days of the initial request for an informal meeting. The immediate supervisor shall hold a hearing within five (5) working days of receipt of the written grievance and render a written decision within five (5) working days of the hearing. The educational support employee may appear alone or with a representative from the Association.
Step 3. Appeal
If the employee is not satisfied, or if no decision is rendered within five (5) working days of the hearing, the employee may obtain further review by appealing the matter to the manager/director of the division. The director will involve intermediate levels of supervisors not considered in step 1 or step 2, and the senior human resources manager. This appeal must be in writing and received by the director of the division within five (5) working days of the immediate supervisor’s response or, if there is no response from the immediate supervisor, within ten (10) working days of the date of the appeal filed under step 2. The director of the division shall hold a hearing within five (5) working days of receipt of the appeal and render a written decision within five (5) working days of the hearing.
12
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
Step 4. Final Appeal
If the employee is not satisfied, or if no decision is rendered within five (5) working days of the request, the employee may obtain further review by appealing the matter to the superintendent. This appeal must be in writing and received by the superintendent within five (5) working days of the step 3 response or, if there is no response within ten (10) working days of the appeal filed under step 3. The superintendent shall hold a hearing within ten (10) working days of receipt of the appeal and render a written decision within ten (10) working days of the hearing.
Step 5. Arbitration
If the aggrieved person is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at step 4, or if no decision has been rendered within ten (10) working days after the grievance was received by the superintendent, the unit member may, within fifteen (15) working days after receipt by the superintendent, request, in writing that the Association submit the grievance to arbitration. If the Association determines that the grievance has merit, it may submit the grievance to arbitration no later than forty (40) days after receipt by the superintendent. If the Association fails to serve such notice of its intention to arbitrate within this time limitation, the grievance shall be considered settled. No individual employee shall have the right to invoke this arbitration procedure.
Selection of Arbitrator
1.	If the Association and the Board are unable to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator within seven (7) calendar days after the Association’s notice of an appeal to arbitration, the Association shall submit the grievance to arbitration under the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
2.	The jurisdiction of the arbitrator shall be confined to the express provision(s) of this Agreement at issue between the Association and the Board. The arbitrator shall have no authority to modify any provision, or to hear or decide on more than one grievance without the mutual consent of the Board and Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on the grievant, the Association and the Board.
3.	The Association and the Board shall each bear their own expenses and share the cost of the arbitrator.
F.	The timeliness in this section for filing requests for informal meetings and appeals and for the convening of hearings and rendering decisions may be extended only at the mutual consent of the grievant, FASSE, and the Board designee.
G.	The Board and the Association will jointly schedule grievance hearings which are mutually convenient. No reprisals of any kind shall be taken by the Board or by any member of the administration against any aggrieved person, any representative, any
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
13
member of the Association, or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed in a separate grievance file and shall not be kept in the personnel file of any of the participants.
Forms for filing grievances, serving notices, making appeals, making reports and recommendations, and other necessary documents shall be prepared jointly by the superintendent or designee and the Association.
All meetings and hearings under this procedure shall not be conducted in public and shall include only the grievant(s), the principal or supervisor, the superintendent, their designated representatives and relevant witnesses.
3.4	PERSONNEL FILE
Material of a negative or derogatory nature must be shown personally to the educational support employee prior to placement in his or her personnel file. The file copy must be signed by the educational support employee to indicate that the employee has seen it.
An educational support employee shall have the right to place a signed, dated response to any derogatory material placed in his or her personnel file.
Educational support employees have the right, by appointment, to review materials in their personnel files. This review shall not include confidential material such as reference letters, or information received in the course of initial employment. Educational support employees can have an officer of FASSE present during the review.
Material related to the grievance procedure will not be placed in the educational support employee’s personnel file except as the grievance decisions affect the employee’s terms or conditions of employment or if agreed to by the employee.
When termination of an educational support employee occurs, no documents or other materials of a negative nature except those that relate to the reasons for termination shall be placed in the personnel file of said employee.
3.5	ANNOUNCEMENT OF VACANCIES
In the event there is an opening for a regular position within the unit, the Board will post notices of such vacancies for a period of at least five (5) workdays on appropriate bulletin boards.
The hiring process of all new and vacant positions shall be advertised for five (5) workdays. A unit member desiring to be considered for a vacancy must apply for the specific vacancy by the specific deadline. In determining the selection of the successful candidate, the Board will consider such qualifications as: skills, abilities, experience, length of service, and overall needs of the school system. The intent of this language is to insure a fair and consistent hiring practice in hiring the best qualified candidate and in no way is meant
14
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
to compromise the legal right of the superintendent to hire personnel as the needs of the school system may require.
The Board encourages qualified internal candidates to apply for vacancies.
3.6	VOLUNTARY TRANSFERS
A.	Unit members who desire a voluntary lateral transfer are required to submit a Transfer Request form to the Human Resources Support Office between January 1 and June 30 of each year to take effect the following school year. The transfer list will remain in effect for a period of one (1) school year or until exhausted.
B.	Eligibility
Non-probationary unit members are eligible for one (1) transfer during the identified school year.
Probationary employees hired during the identified school year may be placed on the following year’s transfer list provided they have completed at least one (1) year of service on or before June 30 and have satisfactory work performance.
C.	In determining the selection of the successful candidate, the Board will consider such qualifications as: skills, abilities, length of service, and the overall needs of the school system. The intent of this language is to insure a fair and consistent practice in transferring the best qualified candidate and is in no way meant to compromise the legal right of the superintendent to transfer personnel as the needs of the school system require.
D.	The increase in time of a part-time support employee to a full-time position on the same pay schedule at the same job site or transfer within the same department is not considered a transfer provided that the new position is essentially the same as the current assignment.
E.	Educational support employees who have been transferred involuntarily are not limited in their eligibility for a transfer or promotion.
F.	A support employee temporarily assigned to a higher paying position for more than ten (10) consecutive workdays will be paid for the eleventh day, and any subsequent consecutive day, in accordance with 4.3.A.
3.7	INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS
A.	The superintendent or designee may involuntarily transfer employees, as the needs of the schools require.
Generally, an employee will receive in writing ten (10) days in advance that they will be involuntarily transferred. If requested, the employee, within five (5) days, will be given the reasons for the transfer.
B.	Where it is necessary to select a unit member for transfer where a transfer has not been requested and the transfer results from a reduction in the number of employ
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
15
ees in a program or at a worksite, the following criteria may be considered. Such criteria are to insure a fair and consistent practice and is in no way meant to compromise the legal right of the superintendent to transfer personnel as the needs of the school system require.
1.	Volunteers may first be sought from that work location.
2.	Unless deemed essential to an assignment based on skills and abilities, any probationary unit member(s) assigned to that location in the unit member assignment affected may be selected, with the least senior probationary unit member being transferred first.
3.	Should the previous steps not satisfy the required number of transfers, the human resources officer may select individuals to be transferred and consider skills, abilities, and length of service.
4.	Unit members designated as involuntary transfers may be reassigned ahead of unit members requesting voluntary transfers, unit members returning from leaves of absence without pay, or new hires in the affected category.
3.8	PROMOTIONS
A promotion is a change to a higher hourly rate from the previous position. In determining the selection of the successful candidate, the Board will consider such qualifications as: skills, abilities, experience, length of service and overall needs of the school system. The intent of this language is to insure a fair and consistent promotional practice in promoting the best-qualified candidate and in no way is meant to compromise the legal right of a superintendent to promote educational support personnel.
When a position becomes available that would cause a promotional opportunity within a particular department, that position may be filled by a qualified regular employee in that particular department as determined by the manager.
Employees selected and interviewed for promotional positions shall receive notification of the outcome within ten (10) working days of when the job is accepted by the successful candidate.
3.9	BUS DRIVER TRANSFER REQUESTS
When bus drivers request to make a lateral move for route selection, the Board will consider such qualifications as skills, abilities, experience, seniority, a safe and suitable location to park the bus, which is within reasonable distance of the route, and the overall needs of the school system.
The intent of this language is to insure a fair and consistent practice in transferring the best-qualified candidate and in no way is meant to compromise the legal right of the superintendent to transfer educational support personnel.
3.10	REDUCTION IN FORCE
The Board decides which positions and budget category(ies) will be affected by a reduction in force.
16
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
Prior to any layoff or reduction in force, a seniority list will be developed.
Seniority as used in this section shall mean seniority based on continuous employment within the Frederick County Public School system.
If two (2) or more support employees have the same length of service, they shall be ranked in order of their first day of continuous regular employment and then, if necessary, by lot.
Temporary and probationary employees in the affected category will be separated before any regular employees are reduced.
The reduction of permanent employees within an affected category shall be made after consideration of an employee’s seniority, work performance, skills and abilities.
Interruption of service - Seniority shall continue to accumulate while an educational support employee is on an approved leave of absence or on layoff of less than one (1) year.
Regular food service employees employed prior to July 1, 1993, will not be reduced in hours or salary in the last three (3) years prior to retirement, as verified by the human resources Department. It is understood that it may be necessary to involuntarily transfer the food service employee in order to fulfill this commitment. This benefit applies only as long as the employee continues to maintain employment with the school system and does not impair or affect the school system’s authority to institute a reduction in force or terminate for other reasons such as performance or conduct.
When food service work hours must be reduced, volunteers willing to work fewer hours will be sought before support employees are transferred.
3.11	RECALL
Educational support employees who are laid off due to a reduction in force will be placed on a recall list and will be recalled based on the date of layoff. The most recently laid off employees will be the first to return. Only those persons who are qualified will be considered for a given vacancy.
Educational support employees who have been laid off will remain on the recall list for a period of one (1) year. If any of those on the list declines a job offer, he/she will be removed from the recall list.
An individual who is offered recall must indicate within seventy-two (72) hours after being notified by certified/registered mail at the last known address whether or not he/she accepts the position offered and must be available to return to work within thirty (30) days. FASSE will bear the expense of the postage.
During a period of layoff, no individual will be hired to fill a position of any grade and qualification of an individual on layoff unless such person declines the recall or is no longer on the recall list.
Unit members recalled under these provisions shall have restored to them all previously accrued sick leave and personal leave. Uncompensated annual leave will also be restored to twelve-month employees, if restored to a twelve-month position.
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
17
The Board and the Association recognize that appropriate governmental agencies which have jurisdiction may promulgate rulings and/or regulations that may impact this section. If such rulings or regulations cause any provisions to be in conflict, the parties shall meet within ten (10) days for the purpose of renegotiating only the provision(s) held to be contrary.

20
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
*NOTE: Exceptions may be granted if an employee presents verification of extenuating circumstances that prevent direct deposit of monies earned.
Pending authorization of funding, twelve-month support employees shall receive the annual increment on July 1 and ten-month employees shall receive the annual increment on September 1.
All ten-month unit members will have the option of being paid in either twenty (20) installments or twenty-four (24) installments. All twelve-month unit members will be paid in twenty-four (24) installments.
1.	In the event of unusual circumstances, a ten-month unit member who has elected to be paid the salary in twenty-four (24) installments may elect to have the balance due in the June paycheck. The request shall be submitted in writing fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled pay date.
2.	Distribution of paychecks shall be on the 15th, or the nearest preceding workday, and the last workday of each month.

In the event of emergency or unforeseen circumstances, when an educational support employee called to work outside his or her regular work day shall be compensated for a minimum of two (2) hours at the rate of time and one-half regardless of any leave taken that week if the time period for which he/she is called to work is not an extension of his/her regular work day or an extension of the beginning or ending time of his/her shift. This applies only to the first time called each day.
If additional work hours are necessary at the beginning or ending time of a regular shift when the educational support employee would normally work, he/she will be paid only for the actual time worked providing the hours do not exceed forty (40) hours per week.
Any work on a holiday shall be compensated at time and one-half the hourly rate of pay.
If an employee is scheduled to work on a Saturday or Sunday to provide support to an event scheduled by an outside organization, time and one-half will be paid if actual hours worked exceed 40 hours or if a holiday occurs during the regularly scheduled work week.
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
21
All employees who use a personal leave day or annual leave and are called out for emergency overtime, the time worked will be computed at time and one-half provided the forty (40) hour work week has been otherwise met.
If funding is available at the employee’s work site, the employee may request to receive time and one-half pay or compensatory time at time and one-half. Employees will have up to thirty (30) days to use any of their earned comp time from the day that they earned it.
Under the direction of the principal, custodial building checks will be assigned to custodial personnel first on a volunteer basis from custodians assigned to that facility. If there are no volunteers, assignment will then be on a rotational basis among the custodians, preserving the opportunity to exchange weekend assignments as needed.
4.2a ALLOCATION
Opportunities within a particular school or at a work site to work overtime will be offered among the employees in the classification who are qualified, so that each employee has as equal an opportunity as possible for earning overtime hours.
4.2b BUILDING CHECKS/OVERTIME COMPENSATION
Under the direction of the principal, custodial building checks will be assigned to custodial personnel first on a volunteer basis from custodians assigned to that facility. If there are no volunteers, assignment will then be on a rotational basis among the custodians, preserving the opportunity to exchange weekend assignments as needed.
All schools that have weekend activities occurring that require a custodian to be on duty, will use that designated custodian to be responsible as part of the building checks during the weekend activity.
It is the intent of the parties to implement the following recommendations of the subcommittee on the study of building checks:
1.	Building checks will be conducted one time per day on Saturday and Sunday of each week, and on holidays.
2.	When weekend activities are scheduled, the custodial staff member scheduled to cover those activities will also be assigned to complete the building check.
3.	Building checks will be assigned first on a volunteer basis from custodians assigned to the facility. If there are no volunteers, assignments will be on a rotational basis among the custodians, preserving the opportunity to exchange weekend assignments as needed.
4.	The time allotted for a building check will be considered paid overtime, unless the employee requests to be compensated in compensatory time.
4.3	SALARY ASSIGNMENT IN A PROMOTION
A.	When an employee is promoted to a higher grade, the employee will be placed on the new grade in accordance with the following:
1.	The employee shall be placed on the new grade at the next highest salary to
22
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
their current salary providing the increase is at least 6%.
2.	If the next highest step on the new grade does not equal at least 6%, the employee shall be placed at the next step on the new grade.
B.	Educational support employees who voluntarily seek a demotion to a lower grade shall first be granted a step on their current grade and then moved to the appropriate grade with that same step. For example, an employee on Grade 4, Step 5 going to a new Grade 3 position, will be moved to Grade 3, Step 6.
4.4	TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT IN HIGHER CLASSIFICATION
A support employee temporarily assigned to a higher paying position for more than ten (10) consecutive days will be paid the higher rate retroactive to day one (1) of the assignment until the temporary assignment ends. The employee will be placed on the new grade and step with a minimum increase of 6% to the overall hourly salary.
4.5	SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL
A.	FCPS benefited employees regularly scheduled to work during the hours of a qualifying shift shall be paid a shift differential.
B.	A qualifying shift means a permanent full-time or permanent part-time shift that starts between designated time periods of 2:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.
C.	A qualifying shift should not be confused with a benefited employee’s work schedule, which is defined as the actual hours a benefited employee is scheduled to work.
D.	The following work schedules are defined as qualifying for shift differential because they fall within the designated time periods of a qualifying shift.
— Benefited employees who work a second or third shift for ten (10) months but transfer to the first shift during the summer.
— Second shifts that start at or after 2:00 p.m. will be paid a shift differential of $420 per fiscal year divided into twenty-four (24) pay periods.
— Third shifts that start at or after 10:00 p.m. will be paid a shift differential of $504 per fiscal year divided into twenty-four (24) pay periods.
E.	A benefited employee who continues to work the second or third shift during the summer vacation months of June, July, and August will be compensated at a shift differential rate of $520 each fiscal year for second shift and $624 each fiscal year for third shift. The shift differential compensation will be annualized and divided over twenty-four (24) pay periods.
F.	FCPS will not pay a shift differential for a benefited employee whose work schedule does not start within the designated time periods of the qualifying shift unless otherwise approved by the building principal and human resource officer.
G.	A benefited employee who works the second shift and is paid a shift differential will continue to be paid the same shift differential even if the work schedule extends into the third shift, which is paid at a higher shift differential.
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
23
H.	If a benefited employee is assigned to second or third shift and it is not their regularly scheduled shift, in order to receive a shift differential, said benefited employee must work second or third shift ten (10) consecutive workdays and compensation will be retroactive to the first day of the assignment. This payment will be processed by the human resources office.
I.	If a benefited employee is permanently reassigned to a nonqualifying shift during the fiscal year, all shift differential payments will end beginning with the first pay period after the reassignment.

LEAVE PROVISIONS
6.1	NOTIFICATION
Normally, all leave will be requested and approved in advance. In the event that such notice is not practical, the employee shall notify his or her immediate supervisor one (1) hour in advance when he or she cannot be at work. Annual or personal leave must be approved in advance. Reasonable periods of restricted leave may be established by departments within the Frederick County Public School system. Notification of this restriction will be given to the employees within these departments in advance. The type of leave being requested should be stated when reporting an absence.
6.2	LEAVES WITH PAY
6.2	a SICK LEAVE
A.	During the first year of employment in the Frederick County Public Schools and during each successive year thereafter, each regular ten- month educational support employee of the Board shall be entitled to ten (10) days sick leave, the unused portion of which shall be accumulative. Twelve-month educational support employees shall be entitled to twelve (12) days sick leave, the unused portion of which shall be accumulative. Sick leave may be taken in one (1) hour increments. Such requests will not be unreasonably denied.
B.	Educational support employees who draw upon their accumulated sick leave will have the number of days used deducted from their total days accumulated. Educational support employees who draw upon all their accumulated days of sick leave will begin anew, provided the employee has five (5) or more years of experience in
26
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
the Frederick County Public Schools, and be granted a total of ten (10) days for the first year of employment immediately following the year in which they exhausted their cumulative leave and continue on schedule. The request for additional days must be made with the senior human resources manager and shall not be unreasonably denied.
Educational support employees will not be eligible to request and receive this grant more than once within a five (5) year period.
C.	Request for sick leave from educational support employees because of illness in the family shall be construed to mean the illness of a member of the immediate household. Immediate household is limited to the same principal, permanent residence as the employee requesting the leave. Educational support employees may request up to five (5) days of sick leave per year for the qualified illness of their parent or child not living in the immediate household. A qualified illness is a documented illness or infirmity that requires inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility. Additionally, the executive director of human resources shall authorize upon request and receipt of acceptable documentation, the one-time use, per eligible family member, by an educational support employee of accrued sick leave up to thirty (30) days, in the event that the educational support employee’s parent or child living out of the immediate household is diagnosed with a terminal condition. Other sick leave requests for members of the family not living in the immediate household or in excess of that permitted for a parent or child shall be processed as personal leave.

The Board will amend its written policies and take such other action as may be necessary in order to give full force and effect to the provisions of this Agreement. The Association agrees to abide by all provisions of this Agreement and to use every effort to inform and advise unit members in carrying out its provisions.
C.	If upon request of either party the state superintendent of schools determines from the facts that an impasse is reached in negotiations between a public school employer and an employee organization designated as an exclusive negotiating agent, the assistance and advice of the Maryland State Board of Education may be requested, with the consent of both parties.
In the absence of such consent, upon the request of either party, a panel shall be named to aid in the resolution of differences. Such panel shall contain three persons, one to be appointed by each party within three (3) days, and the third to be selected by the other two within ten (10) days from the date of such request. If the parties are unable to agree upon a third panel member or obtain a commitment to serve within the specified period, a request for a list of possible panel members may be made to the American Arbitration Association by either party. The parties will then be bound by the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association in the selection of a third panel member. The state board of education, or the panel selected, shall meet with the parties to aid in the resolution of differences and, if the matter is not otherwise resolved, shall make a written report and recommendation within thirty (30) days from the date of said request. Copies of such report shall be sent to representatives of both the public school employer and the employee organization. All costs of mediation shall be shared by the public school employer and the employee organization.
D.	Notwithstanding the provisions contained in paragraph A, the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland State Board of Education have made significant decisions concerning the legality of topics for negotiations and established criteria for determining the legality of these topics. The Board asserts its intention to comply with the laws and the decisions of the Maryland Court of Appeals and the Maryland State Board of Education. Therefore, in negotiating the provisions in this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event that any topics or provisions in this

2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
Agreement are determined to be illegal by the courts or the Maryland State Board of Education from issues raised in this Agreement or from other Agreements, then those topics and provisions of this Agreement related to those topics shall automatically be removed from this Agreement.
This Agreement shall remain in effect from July 1, 2008, to midnight June 30, 2011.
If the Board is unable to implement this contract because its budget request is not funded by the county commissioners in any year, the parties will meet to renegotiate monetary and language issues.
In addition, if the parties mutually identify a topic that warrants a modification to the existing contract prior to the June 30, 2011, expiration, the parties may mutually agree to open and discuss that particular article in the contract to address the matter.
The parties will meet on or before December 1, 2008, to negotiate on salary and insurance only and will begin negotiations on or before December 1, 2010, to negotiate a successor Agreement.

APPENDIX
MEMBERSHIP RULES AND PROCEDURES
FCPS EMPLOYEES SICK LEAVE BANK
Statement of Intent
The purpose of the Sick Leave Bank (the Bank) is to provide sick leave to Bank members after their accrued and current year projected sick leave have been used. The Bank is to provide sick leave only in cases of prolonged, catastrophic, incapacitating personal illness, injury, or quarantine of the member during the regularly scheduled duty day, which is not likely to permanently disable the member.
Membership
1.	New employees may become members of the Bank only after the completion of the probationary period.
2.	A new employee wishing to join the Bank must submit a completed enrollment form to the support personnel officer within ten (10) days of the end of the probationary period.
3.	Employees returning from extended leave may become members by donating one day of sick leave within thirty (30) days of the date of reinstatement to active service.
4.	Employees who fail to act within the specified enrollment eligibility period must wait until enrollment is open again (July 1 through October 1 of the next fiscal year).
5.	Forms to join the Bank and forms to request sick leave from the Bank should be submitted to the Bank committee chair at the FASSE office.
6.	Any regular FCPS employee whose work assignment is half-time or more, and who is not eligible to participate in the FCTA Sick Leave Bank, is eligible to participate in the Bank after. all other membership requirements are met.
7.	To remain a member of the Bank, an employee must contribute to the Bank at a rate
of one day per year.
8.	Membership in the Bank will remain in force and continue from year-to-year with a deduction made automatically as required, unless membership is canceled in writing by the member before October 1.
RULES
1.	The Bank may be used only by the individual contributor for his or her illness, injury, quarantine and must meet all of the following criteria:
a.	personal
b.	prolonged
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
45
c.	catastrophic
d.	incapacitating
2.	The Bank may NOT be used by the member to remain absent from work in order to assist a family member.
3.	Only sick leave may be contributed to the Bank — annual and personal leave may not be contributed.
4.	For the purposes of administration of the Bank, sick leave is defined as:
A designated amount of compensated sick leave granted to an employee whose absence is due to an illness, injury, or quarantine which meets the requirements of rule 1 (above).
5.	Sick leave may not be granted for any period of disability during which monies are paid to the member under workers’ compensation. If a member who has utilized sick leave days granted by the Bank thereafter receives benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act for those same days, pay will be administered in accordance with the handbook language on workers’ compensation and the Bank will be reimbursed for any days used.
6.	Elective (non-emergency, non-life threatening) surgery will not be covered during the school year for members who work less than twelve (12) months.
7.	A member must be absent for ten (10) consecutive work days before being eligible for a grant from the Bank for that same illness, injury, or quarantine. Those ten (10) days may be covered by the member’s accumulated sick leave, personal leave, annual leave, or leave without pay in accordance with the prevailing policy. Once the ten (10) consecutive work day eligibility requirement has been met, subsequent intermittent absences for the same condition will not cause ineligibility.
8.	Members must submit requests for the sick leave bank to the Bank committee chair at the FASSE office.
9.	Requests must be made within fifteen (15) calendar days of return to work.
10.	The Bank will request additional information if unable to reach a decision regarding the request.
11.	All requests to draw upon the Bank must be accompanied by a signed physician’s statement detailing the cause, nature, and prognosis for the illness, injury, or quarantine.
12.	The decision of the sick leave bank committee shall be approved by the support personnel officer unless the decision is inconsistent with sick leave bank regulations or is unsupported by documentation. Leave grants from the Bank will be made in units of not more than twenty (20) days (except in extreme cases as determined by the committee) and will not exceed one hundred (100) days in any fiscal year. The maximum number of sick leave days that will be granted during any two (2) con
46
2008-2011 FASSE/BOE NEGOTIATED AGREEMENT
secutive fiscal years is two hundred (200) days. Members who draw the maximum of one hundred (100) days in two (2) fiscal years are ineligible to participate for the next fiscal year. When medically verified, employees may be allowed to use leave in one-half (1/2) day increments.
13.	Members who want an extension of leave must submit another request form for additional leave before the expiration of the prior grant.
14.	In cases where the committee recommends denial of either a request for leave, or additional leave, the Bank will notify the member directly in writing with the reason for the denial. A member may appeal directly to the FASSE board of directors through the president within thirty (30) days of the denial.
15.	A contributor will lose the right to request leave from the Bank if one or more of the following occur:
a.	termination or suspension of employment by FCPS
b.	cancellation of participation which is effective only at the close of a fiscal year — June 30 of each year
c.	refusal to provide requested information upon request of the sick leave bank committee
d.	refusal to contribute leave in accordance with membership requirements
e.	use of one hundred (100) days during two (2) consecutive fiscal years
f.	refusal to apply for disability retirement benefits if the committee determines that the member may be eligible
16.	The existence of the Bank and participation by employees in the Bank does not negate or eliminate any other FCPS sick leave policies, nor does it in any way negate the rights of individual employees who participate in the Bank to other sick leave benefits included in the FASSE-Board of Education Agreement.
Administrative Procedures
1.	One day of sick leave will be deducted from the member’s sick leave account in the second pay period in October each year and will be placed in the Bank, unless written notice of cancellation is given prior to July 1. Contributions to the Bank must be authorized by the employee on the appropriate form, available in the department of human resources. The annual contribution of one day will be continued from year to year until canceled in writing by the member. Additional days may be assessed if the Bank has a negative balance at the end of the school year. Members will be notified prior to any additional deduction.
2.	The president of FASSE will select employees to serve on the sick leave bank committee, and shall submit their names to the FASSE board of directors for approval. FASSE will provide the names of the sick leave bank committee, in writing, to FCPS Human Resources Department by June 30 of each school year.

3.	The Bank will approve all donations before they are forwarded to the payroll department.
4.	The committee will review and recommend to the support personnel officer, approval or denial of all requests for leave from the Bank within fifteen (15) working days of receiving the request.
5.	All requests to draw upon the Bank must be made on the appropriate form.
6.	When the committee deems a second opinion is appropriate, any member requesting leave may be required to undergo a medical examination and consultation by a physician of the committee’s choice at the applicant’s expense. Any member not wishing to submit to this requirement may withdraw their request without affecting future membership.
7.	In the event a member is unable to personally complete the leave request form, an agent or family member may act on their behalf.
8.	An employee must use all sick leave that will be accrued for the current fiscal year before requesting leave from the Bank. An adjustment will be made on the final paycheck to reflect any negative balance in sick leave. If the amount on an employee’s paycheck is to be adjusted, said employee will be notified. In no case will the granting of leave from the Bank cause a member to receive more than his or her regular salary.
9.	The payroll department will maintain records of all member contributions, withdrawals, cancellations, and the status of the Bank.
10.	Any Bank member may review his/her membership application form, request for withdrawal of membership, and approved requests by contacting the Bank committee chair at the FASSE office.
11.	If, in the judgment of the committee, an applicant for leave, or an extension of leave, is eligible for disability retirement benefits, the committee may require the employee to apply for such benefits. Failure to apply as directed may result in disqualification from receipt of further benefits. The employee will continue to receive Bank benefits while waiting for a decision regarding the disability retirement. Bank benefits shall cease when disability retirement becomes effective. The member is required to notify the Bank of approval of any applications for disability retirement.
12.	If an applicant receives an initial grant or an extension of a grant, and he or she is found to be ineligible for disability retirement, the committee may refer the member to a doctor of its choice at the member’s expense for an evaluation as to whether the applicant is permanently disabled. If the doctor certifies that the applicant is so disabled, then the committee may deny the applicant’s request for a grant or an extension of a grant.
