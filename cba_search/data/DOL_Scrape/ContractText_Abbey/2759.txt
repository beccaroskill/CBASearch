ARTICLE 3 SALARIES AND COMPENSATION
3.1	Salary Parity for Unit 9
All employees in classifications in Unit 9 shall receive salaries no less than salaries received by their counterparts in California’s larger local agencies and the University of California. The determination of those salaries shall be based on DPA’s survey of Professional Engineer Benchmarks, utilizing the California public agencies and the University of California included in the department’s survey dated December 2002, updated annually, and the local agency classifications and salary range matches contained therein. The salary survey for those classifications and agencies shall be updated no less than once per year. The agencies and classifications included in the survey shall only be changed upon agreement between DPA and PECG.
The calculation of the salary lead or lag for Unit 9 employees shall be based on weighted average salaries of employees in the classifications in those surveyed agencies.
All steps in each salary range shall be increased by the same percentage. The salary for intermediate classifications in ranges between the Entry and Supervisory levels shall be based on prorating or interpolating the salaries.
All salary increases shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. In no event shall salaries be reduced as a result of this provision. DPA and PECG may negotiate salaries above the minimum level on any general, regional, specialty, classification, department, or other basis they choose to agree upon.
Salaries for Unit 9 employees shall be increased as appropriate to correspond to the timing of the salaries received by local agency employees included in the survey, with adjustments in the Unit 9 salaries occurring no less than once every 12 months, as follows:
Effective July 1, 2005, the salary increase for all Unit 9 employees shall be no less than 25% of the lag calculated from the December 2004 survey or later.
Effective July 1, 2006, the salary increase for all Unit 9 employees shall be no less than 50% of the lag calculated from the survey dated December 2005 or later.
Effective July 1, 2007, the salary increase for all Unit 9 employees shall be no less than 75% of the lag calculated from the survey dated December 2006 or later.
Effective July 1, 2008, and thereafter, the salaries for all Unit 9 employees shall be such that any lag calculated from the December 2007 or later DPA survey shall be entirely eliminated.

Civil Engineer/Civil Engineer (Registered) - This is a working-level professional engineer. Incumbents perform a wide variety of professional engineering work in either an office or field setting. As incumbents progress they are assigned more difficult work and may function as a lead person over the activities of engineering and technical personnel. The entry level requires graduation from a four-year curriculum in civil engineering accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering Technology or possession of a valid certificate as an Engineer-in-Training issued by the California State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors. At the journey level with registration, the engineer may be in a responsible charge capacity. Incumbents at the supervisory level are distinguished from lead engineers in that their role is predominately directing the work of subordinate professional engineers and registration is mandatory for these positions. Some positions may be titled supervising engineer.

11
BU 9
03-08
A.	Definition of bilingual positions for Bilingual Differential Pay
1.	A bilingual position for salary differential purposes requires the use of a bilingual skill on a continuing basis averaging ten percent (10%) of the time. Anyone using their bilingual skills ten percent (10%) or more of the time will be eligible whether they are using them in a conversational, interpretation, or translation setting. In order to receive bilingual differential pay, the position/employee must be certified by the using department and approved by the Department of Personnel Administration. (Time should be an average of the time spent on bilingual activities during a given fiscal year.)
2.	The position must be in a work setting that requires the use of bilingual skills to meet the needs of the public in either:
(a)	A direct public contact position;
(b)	A hospital or institutional setting dealing with patient or inmate needs;
(c)	A position utilized to perform interpretation, translation, or specialized bilingual activities for the department and its clients.
3.	Position(s) must be in a setting where there is a demonstrated client or correspondence flow where bilingual skills are clearly needed.
4.	Where organizationally feasible, departments should ensure that positions clearly meet the standards by centralizing the bilingual responsibility in as few positions as possible.
5.	Actual time spent conversing or interpreting in a second language and closely related activities performed directly in conjunction with the specific bilingual transaction will count toward the ten percent (10%) standard.
B.	Rate
1.	An employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria during the entire monthly pay period would receive a maximum $100.00 per monthly pay period, including holidays.
2.	A monthly employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria less than the entire pay period would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
3.	A fractional month employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
4.	An employee paid by the hour meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive a differential of $.58 per hour.
5.	An employee paid by the day meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria would receive a differential of $4.61 per day.
C.	Employees, regardless of the time base or tenure, who use their bilingual skills more than ten percent (10%) of the time on a continuing basis and are approved by the Department of Personnel Administration will receive the bilingual differential pay on a regular basis.
12
BU 9
03-08
D.	Bilingual differential payments will become earnings and subject to contributions to the State Retirement System, OASDI, levies, garnishments, Federal and State taxes.
E.	Employees working in positions which qualify for regular bilingual differential pay as authorized by the Department of Personnel Administration may receive the appropriate pay during periods of paid time off and absences (e.g., sick leave, vacation, holidays, etc.).
F.	Employees will be eligible to receive the bilingual differential payments on the date the Department of Personnel Administration approves the departmental pay request. The effective date shall be retroactive to the date of appointment, not to exceed one (1) year, and may be retroactive up to two (2) years, to a position requiring bilingual skills when the appointment documentation has been delayed. The effective date for bilingual pay differential shall coincide with the date qualified employees begin using their bilingual skills on a continuing basis averaging ten percent (10%) of the time, consistent with the other provisions of this section.
G.	Bilingual differential payments will be included in the calculation of lump sum vacation, sick leave and extra hour payments to employees terminating their State service appointment while on bilingual status.
H.	Effective October 31, 2002, qualifying employees in Work Week Group 2 shall receive bilingual compensation for overtime hours worked.
I.	Employees receiving regular bilingual differential pay will have their transfer rights determined from the maximum step of the salary range for their class. Incumbents receiving bilingual pay will have the same transfer opportunities that other class incumbents are provided.
J.	The bilingual differential pay shall be included in the rate used to calculate temporary disability; industrial disability and non-industrial disability leave benefits.
3.5	Overpayments/Payroll Errors
Overpayments/Payroll errors shall be administered in accordance with Government Code Section 19838 except as otherwise provided in Section 3.12 entitled Late Docks.
3.6	Timely Payment of Wages
A.	When a permanent full-time or probationary employee receives no pay warrant on payday, the State agrees to issue a salary advance, consistent with departmental policy and under the following conditions:
1.	When there are errors or delays in processing the payroll documents and the delay is through no fault of the employee, a salary advance will normally be issued within two (2) work days after payday for an amount close to the actual net pay (gross salary less deductions) in accordance with departmental policy.
2.	When a regular paycheck is late for reasons other than (1) above (e.g., AWOL, late dock), a salary advance of no less than 50% of the employee’s actual net pay will normally be issued within five work days after payday except as otherwise provided in Section 3.12 entitled Late Docks. No more than two salary advances per calendar year may be issued under these circumstances.
13
BU 9
03-08
3.	The difference between the employee’s net pay and the salary advance shall not be paid until after receipt of the Controller’s warrant for the pay period.
4.	The circumstances listed in (1), (2), and (3) are not applicable in remote areas where difficulties in the payroll process would not allow these timelines to be met. In these areas the State agrees to attempt to expeditiously correct payroll errors and issue salary advances.
B.	It will be the responsibility of the employee to make sure voluntary deductions (e.g., credit union deductions, union dues, etc.) are paid.
C.	This provision does not apply to those employees who have direct deposit. This provision does not preclude advances if they are provided for under any other rules or policies where direct deposit is involved.
D.	For overtime checks, an advance for an amount close to the actual net pay shall be issued by the end of the pay period following the actual month for which the overtime is submitted if the overtime check is not available at that time.
3.7	Long Term Differential
A.	This section applies to Caltrans employees who otherwise qualify for long term per diem pursuant to Section 7.1, Business and Travel Expenses. Employees receiving the differential provided for in this section shall not receive long term per diem.
B.	Caltrans employees who are assigned in writing to Long Term Assignments (LTA) for more than one year (365 days) at the outset of their assignment letter and who otherwise qualify for long term per diem shall receive a monthly pay differential in lieu of long term per diem for meals and receipted lodging.
C.	To qualify for the LTA monthly differential, affected employees shall be required to submit receipts as proof that actual lodging expenses were incurred.
D.	The LTA monthly differential will be paid for a period starting the first day of the actual assignment and will end the last day of the assignment. The monthly differential shall be pro-rated for months in which the LTA begins or ends in the middle of the month.
E.	The LTA monthly differential shall be $1,800.00. Effective October 31, 2002, this rate shall be the same for employees who maintain (and employees who do not maintain) a separate permanent residence at their headquarters location as otherwise described for purposes of long term travel reimbursement in subsection 7.1 of this agreement.
F.	Long Term Differential Pay shall not be added to base pay for purposes of calculating such things as overtime.

3.8	Prison Recruitment and Retention Bonus
A.	Effective July 1, 1998, Unit 9 employees who are employed at Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria, Centinella or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons, Department of Corrections, for twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, shall be eligible for a recruitment and retention bonus of $2,400, payable thirty (30) days following the completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods.
B.	If an employee voluntarily terminates, transfers, or is discharged prior to completing twelve (12) consecutive pay periods at Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria, Centinella or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons, there will be no pro rata payment for those months at either facility.
C.	If an employee is mandatorily transferred by the Department, he/she shall be eligible for a pro rata share for those months served.
D.	If an employee promotes to a different facility, or department other than Avenal, Ironwood, Calipatria, Centinella or Chuckawalla Valley State Prisons prior to completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, there shall be no pro rata of this recruitment and retention bonus. After completing the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, an employee who promotes within the Department will be entitled to a pro rata share of the existing retention bonus.
E.	Part-time and intermittent employees shall receive a pro rata share of the annual recruitment and retention differential based on the total number of hours worked excluding overtime during the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods.
F.	Annual recruitment and retention payments shall not be considered as compensation for purposes of retirement contributions.
G.	Employees on IDL shall continue to receive this stipend.
H.	If an employee is granted a leave of absence, the employee will not accrue time towards the twelve (12) qualifying pay periods, but the employee shall not be required to start the calculation of the twelve (12) qualifying pay periods all over.

3.12	Late Docks
Notwithstanding Section 3.5 (Overpayments/Payroll Errors) and Section 3.6 (Timely Payment of Wages), departments may elect to proceed as follows as it pertains to “late docks”.
A.	Whenever an employee is charged with a “late dock” as defined by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) for the purpose of issuing salary through the negative payroll system, departments may issue the employee’s paycheck for that period as if no late dock occurred. This means that:
1.	The employee will receive a regular pay warrant on pay day (unless it would have been withheld for purposes other than the late dock);
2.	The employee will be overpaid, since the dock time will not have been deducted from the employee’s pay check; and,
3.	The employee’s pay will be adjusted for any dock time occurring before the SCO cut off date, since late docks occur on or after the cut off date established by SCO.
B.	Employees who are overpaid because of paragraph a. above, will repay the State for their overpayment by an automatic payroll deduction of the total amount from their next month’s pay check/warrant (or successive warrants where needed to satisfy the debt). Departments shall notify employees about the overpayment and the automatic payroll deduction in writing. The absence of said notification before the overpayment is made will not preclude the department from automatically deducting overpayments as otherwise permitted by this section.

C.	Departments that elect to proceed under this section may do so on an employee-by-employee basis thereby reserving the right to issue salary advances in lieu of a regular paycheck in order to avoid an overpayment due to a late dock under such circumstances as when an employee has previous “late dock” situations or if there is reason to expect the employee to leave state service prior to the end of the next pay period.
D.	If an employee separates or retires from State service before satisfying late dock overpayments as a result of this section, the State shall deduct the total amount due from any other pay owing the employee at the time of his/her separation or retirement.

B.	The program shall operate in the following fashion:
1.	The State shall contribute $1500 per year on behalf of each bargaining unit member (employee) who lives in a defined rural area, as more definitely described in Government Code Section 22825.01.
a.	Payments shall be on a monthly basis.
b.	For permanent employees, as in the “Medical Reimbursement Account” situation, the employee does not have to wait for reimbursement of covered medical expenses until the full amount has been deposited.
2.	As to any employee who enters State service or leaves State service during a fiscal year, contributions for such employee shall be made on a pro rata basis. A similar computation shall be used for anyone entering or leaving the bargaining unit (e.g., promotion in mid-fiscal year).
3.	The money shall be available for use as defined in Government Code Section (GC) 22825.01.
4.	A Rural Healthcare Equity Program will be established with a separate account for Bargaining Unit 9 members, as one of several similar accounts.

6.	If an employee does not utilize the complete $1500 pursuant to the procedures and limitations described in GC section 22825.01, then the unused monies shall be put in a “same year pool.” That same year pool shall be utilized to pay those who have incurred eligible health care expenses in excess of the $1500, but again according to the procedures and limitations in GC section 22825.01. The monies in the same year pool would be distributed at the end, or even soon after, each fiscal year to that group of employees who had expenses in excess of $1500 in the relevant fiscal year. Those monies shall be distributed on a pro tanto (pro rata) basis.
a.	Any employee not in Bargaining Unit 9 all year shall receive credit under this paragraph utilizing the same pro rata formula as in Section 4.12.B.2 above.
b.	If an employee is entitled to less than twenty five dollars ($25) under Section 4.12.B.6, the money shall instead go into next year’s fund pursuant to Section 4.12.B.7 hereafter.
7.	If monies still remain after a distribution to such employees (i.e., all employees who spent more than $1500 as provided in GC section 22825.01 were completely reimbursed), then those surplus monies shall be rolled over into the next fiscal year’s funds available for distribution to employees whose expenses pursuant to the statute exceed $1500 in such subsequent year. Similar “rollovers” would occur in any years where all employees were completely reimbursed (or had payments made on their behalf) pursuant to GC section 22825.01 and monies still remained in the pool.

In exchange 8 hours of leave will be credited to the employee’s PLP monthly.
C.	Personal leave shall be requested and used by the employee in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Requests to use personal leave must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on vacation and annual leave balances pursuant to Article 5 (Leaves) and Sections 5.4 (Vacation Leave) and 5.12 (Annual Leave).
D.	At the discretion of the State, all or a portion of unused personal leave credits may be cashed out at the employee’s salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. It is understood by both parties that the application of this cash out provision may differ from department to department and from employee to employee. Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave. Cash out or lump sum payment for any Personal Leave credits shall not be considered as “compensation” for purposes of retirement. If funds become available, as determined by the Department of Finance, for the Personal Leave program, departments will offer employees the opportunity to cash out accrued personal leave.

C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the 23rd work day with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave, or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee’s full net pay.

E.	If the employee remains disabled after the IDL benefit is exhausted, then the employee will be eligible to receive Temporary Disability benefits as provided for in Government Code Section 19863.
F.	In the event that an employee is determined to be “permanent and stationary” by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	An employee may elect to supplement Vocational Rehabilitation Maintenance Allowance, which is provided pursuant to Section 10125.1, Title 8, California Code of Regulations, with leave credits.

A.	Eligible Unit 9 employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of “mentoring leave” per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. “Mentoring leave” is paid leave time which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. “Mentoring leave” may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his or her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the work day and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting “mentoring leave.” For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of “mentoring leave,” he/she must have used two (2) verified hours of his/her personal time prior to receiving approval for the “mentoring leave.” “Mentoring leave” does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his/her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this agreement and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.

1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and

A.	If a department head or designee requires an employee in writing to work in a higher classification for more than 15 consecutive calendar days, the employee shall receive a pay differential of 5% over his/her normal daily rate of the class to which he/she is appointed for that period in excess of 15 calendar days. If a department head or designee requires an employee in writing to work in a higher classification for 30 consecutive calendar days or more, the employee shall receive a pay differential of 5% over his/her normal daily rate of the class to which he/she is appointed from the first day of the assignment. If the assignment to a higher classification is not terminated before it exceeds 120 consecutive calendar days, the employee shall be entitled to receive the difference between his/her salary and the salary of the higher class at the same step the employee would receive if the employee were to be promoted to that class, for that period in excess of 120 consecutive calendar days. The 5% differential shall not be considered as part of the base pay in computing the promotional step in the higher class. In accordance with the provisions of this subsection, no employee may be compensated for more than one (1) year of out-of-class work for any one assignment.
B.	The State shall not rotate employees in and out of out-of-class assignments for the sole purpose of avoiding payment of an out-of-class differential.

Upon request, DPA shall furnish PECG with drafts of the proposed classification specifications.
B.	The DPA shall notify and submit to PECG the final classification proposal at least 20 work days prior to the date the SPB is scheduled to adopt it.

If PECG does not respond to the notice, or if PECG does not meet with DPA within five (5) workdays from their date of request, the classification proposal shall be deemed agreeable to PECG and be placed on SPB’s consent calendar.
D.	The DPA shall meet and confer, if requested in writing by PECG, within ten (10) working days from the date the SPB approved the classification change, regarding the compensation of the classification.

If the Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) informs the parties in writing that it has determined that the recent temporary arrangement whereby state employees were relieved of paying into their retirement fund may be extended for 12 months and that such an extension would be fiduciarily sound and meet the Board’s established actuarial standards, which in turn provides temporary cash flow relief to the State, the parties will agree to the following:

D.	Transfer or Demotion in Lieu of Layoff
The State may offer affected employees a transfer or a demotion in lieu of layoff pursuant to Government Code Sections 19997.8 through 19997.10 and applicable Department of Personnel Administration rules. If an employee refuses a transfer or demotion, the employee shall be laid off.

BU 9
03-08
and reallocate appropriations in the Budget Act in order to ensure the integrity of the 2003 Budget.
The savings achieved in employee compensation for fiscal year (FY) 03/04 that have been agreed to by the parties shall first be applied to mitigate layoffs during FY 03/04 for Bargaining Unit 9, consistent with the provisions of Section 4.10 of the Budget Act of 2003.

Effective one-month following ratification of this agreement by both parties, the State will no longer use an Employee Action Request form that provides Unit 9 employees who perform non-law enforcement related functions with the option of having their home address withheld from PECG. Instead, employees who perform non-law enforcement related functions will, upon request on their own initiative, be given a separate form by their appointing power that permits two choices: (1) withhold their address from PECG, or (2) to cancel a previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to PECG.

Within one month following ratification of this agreement by both parties, the State will send a letter to all existing Unit 9 employees who perform non-law enforcement related functions that have previously requested their home address remain confidential.

F.	Address Confidentiality
Employee work and home addresses shall be maintained as confidential by PECG. PECG shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of work and home addresses, and shall not disclose or otherwise make them available to any person, entity or organization. Employee addresses shall only be used by PECG for representational purposes.
G.	Nature of Material
PECG agrees that any of its literature mailed to employees by the State will not be libelous, obscene, defamatory or of a partisan political nature or constitute a solicitation of any product or service unrelated to representation by PECG.

PECG agrees to pay necessary and reasonable costs incurred by the State Controller’s Office to produce the necessary name/home/work address tape file on a monthly basis.

The co-chairpersons may determine that subcommittees are necessary or preparatory work other than at committee meetings is necessary. If this occurs, the management co-chairperson may request that additional release time be granted for this purpose. Approval of release time is subject to operational need.
D.	The committee shall meet regularly and shall begin meeting after the ratification of this contract.

An involuntary transfer which reasonably requires an employee to change his/her residence may be grieved under Section 12.2.a only if the employee believes it was made for the purpose of harassing or disciplining the employee. If the appointing authority or the Department of Personnel Administration disapproves the transfer, the employee shall be returned to his or her former position; shall be paid the regular travel allowance for the period of time he/she was away from his/her original headquarters; and his/her moving costs both from and back to the original headquarters shall be paid in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration law and rules.

ARTICLE 23	STATE-OWNED HOUSING RENTAL AND UTILITY RATES
23.1	State-Owned Housing Rental and Utility Rates
A.	Rent
Effective July 1, 1989, and annually thereafter for the duration of this contract, current rental rates for all types of State-owned employee housing, including trailers and/or trailer pads, may with 60-day notice be increased by the State as follows:
1.	Where employees are currently occupying State-owned housing, the State may raise such rates paid by employees up to 25 percent each year, not to exceed Fair Market value.
2.	During the term of this contract, where no rent is being charged, the State may raise rents up to $75 per month or when an employee vacates State-owned housing, including trailers and/or trailer pads, the State may raise rents for such housing up to the Fair Market value.
3.	Employee rental of State housing shall not ordinarily be a condition of employment. In any instance after July 1, 1989 and annually thereafter, when the rental of State housing is made a condition of employment, the State may charge the employee 10 percent less than the regular rate of rent.
4.	Employees renting State-owned housing occupy them at the discretion of the State employer. If the State decides to vacate a State-owned housing unit currently occupied by a State employee, it shall give the employee a minimum of 30 days’ advance notice.

ARTICLE 24	CONTRACTING OUT
A.	Purpose
PECG has presented evidence that State departments are presently contracting out work appropriately done by Unit 9 employees, and that said contracting results in unnecessary additional costs to the State. Thus, the purpose of this section is to guarantee that the State does not incur unnecessary, additional costs by contracting out work appropriately performed at less expense to the State by Unit 9 employees, consistent with the terms of this section. In achieving this purpose the parties do not intend this section to expand the State’s ability to contract out for personal services. The parties agree that this section shall not be interpreted or applied in a manner which results in a disruption of services provided by State departments.
B.	Policy Regarding Personal Services Contracts and Cost Savings
Except in extremely unusual or urgent, time-limited circumstances, or under other circumstances where contracting out is recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders, the State must make every effort to hire, utilize and retain Unit 9 employees before resorting to the use of private contractors. Contracting may also occur for reasons other than cost savings as recognized or required by law, Federal mandate, or court decisions/orders.
C.	Information Regarding Contracts To Be Let
Departments will provide PECG’s designated representative with copies of Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and Invitations for Bid (IFBs) for personal services contracts when released for publication if they call for services found in Unit 9 class specifications. The purpose of this subsection C. is to provide PECG with notice and an opportunity to present alternatives which mitigate or avoid the need for contracting out, while still satisfying the needs of the State to provide services. Directors (or their designee) shall therefore meet with PECG for this purpose, if requested by PECG.
D.	Labor/Management Committee To Review Personal Service Contracts In Existence
1.	A State joint Labor/Management Committee shall be established. It shall consist of representatives of PECG, the Department of Personnel Administration, the Department of Finance and affected departments. Half of the Committee members shall be PECG representatives. The first meeting of this Committee shall occur no later than 10 working days from ratification of the MOU, and shall be for purposes of determining the procedures by which the Committee will operate. An initial review of all currently existing contracts as requested by the Committee shall be completed within six (6) months from ratification of this agreement. However, if this deadline cannot be met due to the number or complexity of existing contracts for review, the Committee may mutually agree to extend this deadline.
85
BU 9
03-08
2.	Upon request of the Committee (or either party on the committee) each department shall submit copies of any or all personal services contracts that call for services found in Unit 9 class specifications. For each contract, departments shall provide additional documents establishing the number, scope, duration, justification, total costs of all such contracts, and payment of all overhead and administrative costs paid through each contract, provided it does not disclose confidential or proprietary information, in which case it shall be redacted as discussed below. The requested contract and related information shall be provided as soon as reasonably possible. The parties expect that this shall be provided no more than 21 calendar days following the request by the joint Labor/Management Committee, or longer if approved by the Committee. This shall include contracts that may otherwise be protected from public disclosure, if they provide for services found in Unit 9 class specifications. However, the State may redact those portions of protected contract(s) that are proprietary, necessary to protect the competitive nature of the bid process, and that which does not pertain to the costing of personnel services found in Unit 9 classes. The goal shall be to protect against disclosure of information which should remain confidential, while at the same time providing the Committee with sufficient information to determine whether unnecessary, additional costs are being incurred by contracting out work found in Unit 9 class specifications. Costing information provided to the Committee for protected contracts shall include total personnel costs for personnel services found in Unit 9 classifications plus any overhead charges paid to the contractor for these services, provided such disclosure does not breach confidentiality requirements or include proprietary information.
3.	Within 10 workdays after receipt of the personal service contracts and associated documents as provided for in paragraph D.2. above, the Committee shall begin reviewing the contracts. The Committee shall examine the contracts based on the purpose of this section, the terms of the contracts, all applicable laws, Federal mandates and court decisions/orders. In this regard, the Committee will consider which contracts should and can be terminated immediately, which contracts will take additional time to terminate, which contracts may continue (for how long and under what conditions) and how (if necessary and cost effective) to transition contract employees or positions into civil service. All determinations shall be through express mutual agreement of the Committee. Committee determinations regarding contracts let by the Department of Corrections shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in subsection F below.
4.	The Committee will continue to meet as necessary to examine personal services contracts which have been let.
5.	If savings are generated by the termination of personal service contracts under this provision, it is the intent of the State to implement findings of the Committee for utilization of said savings. Such findings may include:
(a)	Contributing toward position reductions which would otherwise be accomplished by the layoff, salary reduction or displacement of Unit 9 employees.
(b)	Enabling the employment of Unit 9 employees for services currently performed by contractors.
86
BU 9
03-08
(c)	Enabling the conversion to Unit 9 civil service employment of qualified contract employees who wish to become State employees, as otherwise permitted by law, regulations, provisions of the contracts and resolutions by the State Personnel Board.
(d)	Providing timely, adequate and necessary recruitment and retention efforts. These efforts may include focused recruitment, publicizing in professional journals, use of the media, job fairs, expedited hiring, expedited background checks, spot testing authorized by the SPB, State employee registries, and recruitment and retention incentives.
(e)	Such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon by the joint Labor/Management Committee.
E.	Displacement Avoidance
1.	The objective of this subsection is to ensure that Unit 9 employees have preference over contract employees consistent with, but not limited to the following principles.
(a)	The duties at issue are consistent with the Unit 9 employee’s classification;
(b)	The Unit 9 employee is qualified to perform the job; and,
(c)	There is no disruption in services.
2.	To avoid or mitigate Unit 9 employee displacement for lack of work, the appointing power shall review all existing personal services contracts to determine if work consistent with the affected employee’s classification is being performed by a contractor. Displacement includes layoff, involuntary demotion, involuntary transfer to a new class, involuntary transfer to a new location requiring a change of residence, and time base reductions. If the joint Labor/Management Committee that reviews personal services contracts determines that the terms and purpose of the contract permit the State to assign the work to a Unit 9 employee who would otherwise be displaced, this shall be implemented consistent with the other terms of this section. The State and PECG shall meet and confer for purposes of entering into an agreement about the means by which qualified employees are notified and provided with such assignments. This shall include developing a process that ensures that savings realized by terminating the contract and reassigning the work to a Unit 9 employee to avoid displacement, are utilized to offset that employee’s moving and relocation costs, the amount of which shall be consistent with Section 7.8 Moving and Relocation of the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.
F.	Department of Corrections
1.	This section shall not be applicable to the Department of Corrections until such time as it has been approved by the Federal court special master(s). Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or applied in such a manner as to interfere with Federal court orders, the authority of the Federal court or the authority of the special masters.
87
BU 9
03-08
2.	The Department of Corrections shall present this section to the special master(s) immediately in writing upon ratification of this agreement. The parties agree to make themselves immediately available to meet with the special master, on a schedule determined by the special master.
3.	No contract for services by the Department of Corrections shall be prohibited, modified, restricted or terminated by virtue of this Memorandum of Understanding or by operation of the joint Labor/Management Committee established by this Memorandum of Understanding without approval of the Special Masters in Madrid v. Alameida et al (as it pertains to contracts affecting Pelican Bay State Prison), and/or the Special Master in the Coleman litigation (as it pertains to contacts affecting Coleman class members), and/or counsel for the parties in the Plata litigation or the Plata court (as it pertains to contracts affecting medical care for Plata class members).
4.	If this section is not approved by the special master the parties agree to reopen negotiations for the purpose of agreeing on an alternative contracting out provision, with the goal of satisfying the concerns of the Federal court and PECG.
G.	Relationship Between This Section And Related Statutes
The State is mindful of the constitutional and statutory obligations (e.g., Government Code § 19130) as it pertains to restriction on contracting out. Thus, nothing in this section is intended to interfere with pursuit of remedies for violation of these obligations as provided by law (e.g. Public Contract Code § 10337.
ARTICLE 25	ON-CALL/STANDBY TIME
On-Call/Standby is time during which an employee is required to restrict activities and be available for return to work. An employee is not considered to be in On-Call/Standby status unless he or she has previously been informed by the employer of the assignment.
A PUC Unit 9 employee who is notified that he/she is being placed On-Call/Standby as defined below, shall receive On-Call/Standby pay. On-Call/Standby hours will be accumulated during the term of the pay period and shall be compensated at the rate of two (2) hours of pay (cash or CTO at the employer’s discretion), for each eight (8) hours of On-Call/Standby in accordance with the chart below. Employees may only accrue up to six (6) hours of pay for each twenty-four (24) hour period of On-Call/Standby. An employee placed on On-Call/Standby shall respond by phone within fifteen (15) minutes of the call and report for work, if so required, within one (1) hour from initial contact or within a reasonable time frame as agreed to by the supervisor, for employees living beyond one (1) hour from the work site.
On-Call/Standby exists under the following conditions:
1.	The employee must be readily accessible by phone or pager, and
2.	The employee is obligated to return to work in a fit and able condition to assume his/her duties.
88
BU 9
03-08
An employee who is actually called into work while On-Call/Standby, shall be compensated in accordance with the call-back provisions of this agreement. Compensation earned as a result of On-Call/Standby shall not be considered time worked for purposes of qualifying for overtime.
