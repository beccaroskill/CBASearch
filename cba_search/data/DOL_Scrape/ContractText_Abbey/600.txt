Subj ect:	New Store Opening in Vermont
Dear (Local President)
In the event that the Company opens a Super Stop & Shop store in Vermont and the jurisdictional issue is resolved to the satisfaction of the Company, the Company agrees that it would recognize the Union as the bargaining agent provided the necessary verifiable authorization cards were presented which indicate that the union represented a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit.
The Union also agrees to accept a contract that recognizes local conditions, is consistent with the framework of the contract negotiated and ratified for Stop & Shop’s New Hampshire and Maine stores, and permits interchangeability such that on an as-needed basis, employees can work across department lines, outside of their classifications, and across jurisdictional lines.
