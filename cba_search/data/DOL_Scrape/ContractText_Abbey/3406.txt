The meeting shall be held and a written decision shall be sent to the UNION within forty (40) days after receipt of the Step 2 referral.

E.	Time spent by Employees adjusting grievances and/or pursuing arbitration is not working time and shall not be compensated. However, if a Step 1 grievance hearing is held during the Employee’s normal working hours, the Employee will not suffer a loss in compensation. Grievances shall be heard during management’s normal working hours unless stipulated otherwise by both parties.
SECTION 2	- ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
A.	If any grievance, including discharge, cannot be amicably resolved in accordance with the provisions of the grievance procedure defined in Section 1, it may be submitted to the Arbitration Board. The Arbitration Board shall consist of one (1) member appointed by the UNION Business Representative, one (1) member appointed by METRO’s Transit Human Resources, and an impartial arbitrator selected using the following procedure:
1.	METRO and the UNION shall mutually agree upon a list of six (6) impartial arbitrators as soon as possible after the execution of this AGREEMENT.
2.	The names on such list of arbitrators shall rotate and the next arbitrator starting from the top of the list shall be scheduled to hear a grievance, unless METRO and the UNION agree to select another arbitrator on the list. The UNION will contact the arbitrator to determine his/her availability and will be responsible to schedule all requested arbitrations. The selected arbitrator will then be placed at the bottom of the list.
3.	The selected impartial arbitrator may hear more than one (1) case, if mutually agreed by both parties, provided said arbitrator hears and decides each case independently before proceeding to the next case.
ARTICLE 5: GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
31
4.	If METRO and the UNION determine that an arbitrator is unacceptable and should be removed from the list, that arbitrator shall issue any outstanding decisions, but shall not be scheduled for more arbitrations.
5.	When the rotating list of arbitrators is reduced below six (6) names, the parties must mutually select, within ten (10) calendar days after receipt of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service’s arbitrators list, the new arbitrator(s) to bring the total list to six (6) before additional arbitrations are scheduled. The names of the newly appointed arbitrator(s) shall be placed at the bottom of the list.
B.	The submission of a grievance to the Arbitration Board shall be based on the original written grievance.
C.	No more than one (1) grievance shall be submitted before the same arbitrator at one (1) hearing, unless agreed upon in writing by both parties prior to the scheduling of the arbitration.
D.	The Arbitration Board shall settle or decide a grievance submitted for arbitration within thirty (30) days after the date of the submission of post-hearing briefs, or after the date of the arbitration hearing if no briefs are submitted.
E.	The power and authority of the Arbitration Board shall be to hear and decide each grievance and shall be limited strictly to determining the meaning and interpretation of the terms of this AGREEMENT.
1.	The Arbitration Board shall not have the authority to add to, subtract from, or modify this AGREEMENT, nor to limit or impair any common law right of METRO or the UNION. The Arbitration Board’s decision, including upholding, modifying or setting aside any disciplinary action or the award of lost wages and benefits, shall be in accordance with federal and state laws, and shall be final and binding on all parties.
2.	The decision of the Arbitration Board shall be based solely on the evidence and arguments presented by the parties in the presence of each other.
F.	The parties agree that the power and jurisdiction of any arbitrator who is chosen shall be limited to deciding whether there has been a violation of a provision of this AGREEMENT.
G.	If the arbitrator upholds the grievance, METRO shall pay the cost of the arbitrator. If the grievance is denied, the UNION shall pay the cost of the arbitrator. Each party shall be responsible for the cost of its own attorney fees. If both parties agree to cancel an arbitration, prior to the decision of the arbitrator, the cancellation fee shall be split by both parties.
32
H.	METRO and the UNION agree to attend a pre-arbitration conference not later than fourteen (14) days before each scheduled arbitration. The purpose of such conference shall be to discuss and narrow issues, to explore settlement, and to treat other matters relevant to the arbitration proceeding.
I.	The arbitration hearing shall be conducted under the rules and regulations set forth by the American Arbitration Association.
SECTION 3	- MEDICAL ARBITRATION
A grievance from an Employee who is removed from service or refused permission to return to work from sick leave or a leave of absence due to a physical or mental disability, which prevents the Employee from performing all of his/her duties, will be handled in the following manner:
Step 1: The Employee shall present to METRO a medical release from his/her physician, which authorizes the Employee to perform, without restriction, all duties of his/her position. In the absence of such medical release, the parties agree that no grievance exists. If METRO does not accept the medical release, METRO will, at its expense, refer the Employee to a physician of METRO’S choice for a medical examination. If METRO’S physician authorizes the Employee’s return to work, the Employee will be allowed to work and METRO will pay all back wages and benefits from the date of the Employee’s original medical release. If METRO’s physician does not authorize the Employee’s return to work and the Employee still wishes to work, the Union Business Representative or designee may within forty-five (45) days from notification refer the grievance to Step 2. Such referral must be in writing.
ARTICLE 5: GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
33
Step 2: If the Employee’s physician and METRO’S physician disagree on whether the Employee may return to work, the two physicians shall discuss the issue. If these physicians cannot resolve the issue, it shall be referred to the Arbitration Board in accordance with Section 2. The Arbitration Board will determine whether the Employee can perform his/her duties without restriction. The decision of the Arbitration Board shall be final and binding on the parties. Should the Arbitration Board rule in favor of the Employee, the Employee shall be returned to work without loss of seniority. The Arbitration Board shall determine the date upon which the Employee, in the Arbitration Board’s opinion, was able to fully perform the duties of his/her position. The Employee shall receive all back pay and benefits from that date. Should the Arbitration Board rule in favor of METRO, the Employee (excluding entry level probationary Employees) will be given priority consideration for obtaining another King County job for which the Employee meets minimum requirements and in which he/she can be placed in accordance with METRO’s Merit System. The power and the authority of the Arbitration Board shall be limited strictly to determining whether the Employee can perform his/her duties. The Arbitration Board shall not have the authority to add to, subtract from, or modify METRO’s job descriptions.
SECTION 4	- EXPEDITED ARBITRATION

ARTICLE 5: GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
35
ARTICLE 6:	SENIORITY
SECTION 1	- CALCULATING SENIORITY
Seniority will be calculated in the following manner:
A.	In the case of two (2) or more Employees newly hired within the same job classification on the same date, seniority will be calculated by order of their respective application dates with METRO during the current recruitment period, including hours and minutes.
B.	If two (2) or more Employees are promoted/transferred at the same time to the same job classification, the date of current continuous hire or qualification date, if applicable, will determine seniority. This also applies to Employees who start work in the new position on different days due to different RDO combinations.
C.	Unless otherwise provided in this AGREEMENT, selection of vacation, RDOs, and assignments will be determined by seniority earned in a specific job classification. METRO date of hire/qualification will be used to determine the amount of vacation and benefits earned; however, for a Part-Time Operator who is reclassified as a Full-Time Operator, the date of reclassification shall be determinant, except as noted in Article 9, Section 1. For the purposes of this Paragraph, Supervisors, as listed in Article 22, Section 1 shall be considered one (1) classification.
D.	A Part-Time Operator who moves to full-time status shall accrue full-time seniority from the date of qualification as a Full-Time Operator. A FullTime Operator who moves to part-time status shall forfeit seniority as a Full-Time Operator, and shall be accorded seniority based on calendar days spent as a Part-Time Operator immediately prior to reclassification as a Full-Time Operator, if any, except as otherwise provided herein.
E.	An Employee who retires and then rehires as a Part-Time Operator will be placed at the bottom of the Part-Time Operator seniority list.
SECTION 2	- PROMOTION, TRANSFER, DEMOTION, AND LAYOFF
A.	Unless otherwise specified in this AGREEMENT, an Employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in METRO outside of the Bargaining Unit shall retain his/her Bargaining Unit seniority for one (1) year from the date of promotion or transfer; however, such employee shall retain his/her Bargaining Unit seniority for purpose of layoff.
B.	Any King County employee not represented by the UNION who previously has attained permanent status in a Bargaining Unit job classification, and who voluntarily demotes or is involuntarily demoted back to such classification after one (1) year will not be eligible for reinstatement of seniority in such classification. In no case shall such a demotion displace any Bargaining Unit Employee.
36
C.	Any Employee who voluntarily demotes or is involuntarily demoted, other than demotion caused by layoff, will forfeit all rights to the classification from which the Employee was demoted. Due to poor health or for other compelling reasons, an Employee may request a voluntary demotion to a classification within his/her division in which the Employee has attained permanent status. If an Employee is involuntarily demoted or is granted a voluntary demotion, he/she will be reinstated to the position in seniority which he/she had formerly achieved in the classification to which he/she has been demoted.
SECTION 3	- DETAILS/SPECIAL PROJECTS
A.	METRO and the UNION recognize the value provided to Employees by having detail opportunities available. METRO and the UNION also agree that detail opportunities should balance the desire of many Employees to prepare for promotional opportunities with the need to have an Employee accumulate experience in a detail position in order to be effective in that position.
B.	An Employee who is detailed to a capital improvement project shall return to his/her regular position on a date mutually agreed by the UNION and METRO at the beginning of the project. An Employee who is detailed to a position outside the Bargaining Unit for work other than an agreed project will not exceed one (1) year in the detail position.
C.	Any Employee who is in a detail position for at least ninety (90) days shall be required to spend at least ninety (90) days in his/her regular position before being detailed to another position.
D.	An Employee who exceeds the time limits (project end date or one (1) year) may lose his/her Bargaining Unit seniority for the purpose of pick, but shall retain seniority for the purpose of layoff.
SECTION 4	- SENIORITY LISTS
A.	Seniority for all Employees shall be recorded on lists certified by the UNION and on file with METRO. Seniority shall be under the jurisdiction of the UNION. All questions or grievances pertaining to seniority shall be settled by the UNION.
B.	The UNION agrees to provide METRO with certified seniority lists by job classification showing name(s) and seniority for picks, move-ups, promotions, and layoffs; provided that METRO gives the UNION at least fourteen (14) calendar days advance notice and provides an up-to-date list of all new hires, showing their application times and dates, and job classifications. The UNION will provide, as a courtesy to METRO, an explanation of any changes appearing on these lists.
ARTICLE 6: SENIORITY
37
ARTICLE 7:	LAYOFF AND RECALL
SECTION 1	- REASON FOR LAYOFF
METRO will not lay off any Employee except due to reduction in service, lack of work, lack of funds, or improvement in efficiency. METRO will inform the UNION of potential layoffs forty-five (45) days or more in advance in order to allow METRO and the UNION to investigate whether Employees scheduled for layoff may continue to be employed by METRO. If a reduction in the work force should prove unavoidable and provisions cannot be made to retain affected Employees at different job classifications within METRO, then METRO and the UNION will form a relocation task force to seek alternate gainful employment for affected Employees.
SECTION 2	- METHOD OF REDUCTION
A.	METRO shall determine the positions to be eliminated. Layoffs shall occur by inverse seniority, within the affected job classification, within the division.
B.	A laid-off Employee who has attained regular status in another job classification may displace a less senior Employee in said classification. A position in the highest paying classification, in which there is a less senior Employee and in which the Employee previously has attained regular status, will be offered, except that an Employee shall not be placed into a classification from which the Employee has demoted or failed to complete the probationary period. For such purpose, seniority shall be calculated to include all time spent in the classification in which the Employee is placed, plus any continuous time spent in other Bargaining Unit classifications with higher top step wage rates, in which the Employee had attained regular status.
SECTION 3	- RECALLING LAID-OFF EMPLOYEES
A.	An Employee shall be eligible for reinstatement for twenty-four (24) months following layoff and shall be recalled to service in the order of his/her seniority within a division, and by job classification. To be eligible for reinstatement, a laid-off Employee must keep METRO informed of his/her current address. METRO’S obligation to offer reinstatement shall be fulfilled by mailing a notice by registered mail to the most recent address supplied by the laid-off Employee. A laid-off Employee must notify METRO within fifteen (15) days after such reinstatement offer has been mailed by METRO and report for work at the time and place stipulated in the notice.
B.	An Employee, who fails to respond to the reinstatement offer or who fails to report to work when and where notified, shall be deleted from the recall list.

Alternatively, he/she may retain credit for all accumulated vacation, to be used after the leave of absence, in accordance with the procedures contained in Article 10, Section 3. However, should such UNION Officer not resume his/her employment with METRO, he/she will be paid at the rate in effect when the leave of absence began.
ARTICLE 9: VACATION
45
ARTICLE 10:	LEAVES OF ABSENCE
SECTION 1	- GENERAL
The decision to grant an unpaid leave of absence shall be the decision of METRO, except as limited by this AGREEMENT.

For UNION business leave in excess of the thirty (30) calendar days, no benefits shall accrue (i.e., vacation and sick leave) and costs of benefit premiums (i.e., medical, dental, optical, and disability) shall be the responsibility of the UNION. For purpose of calculating the thirty (30) day limitation, RDOs and holidays shall be included only if the Employee was on UNION business leave the day preceding and the day after the RDO/holiday.
B.	The thirty (30) day limitation for determining payment and accrual of benefits shall not include UNION Executive Board members while attending the regularly scheduled monthly Executive Board meeting, while attending membership meetings, while working on picks, while participating on a UNION negotiating committee, or while replacing the full-time UNION Officers during contract negotiations.

SECTION 10	- OVERTIME
All hours worked in excess of ten (10) hours in the scheduled workday or work on any of the three (3) RDOs shall be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the existing straight-time rate of pay for actual overtime hours worked, except where otherwise specified in this AGREEMENT.

ARTICLE 14: RATES OF PAY
65
4.	Part-Time Transit Operators and On-Call Conductors will have five (5) step increments as follows: first step will be seventy percent (70%) of the top rate of the classification; upon completion of twenty-four (24) months, the second step will be eighty percent (80%); upon completion of the next twenty-four (24) months, the third step will be ninety percent (90%); upon completion of the next twelve (12) months, the fourth step will be ninety-five percent (95%); and upon completion of the next twelve (12) months, the fifth step will be one hundred percent (100%).
5.	A Part-Time Operator who is selected for a Full-Time Operator position, or an On-Call Conductor who is selected for a Full-Time Conductor position, will retain his/her part-time or on-call wage step and will be given appropriate wage progression credit for part-time or on-call service, provided there is no more than a two (2) day break in service. Such credit shall be calculated by giving one-half (1/2) credit for the period of time worked in that step, rounding upward to the nearest one-half (1/2) month and applying that period to the full-time qualification date.
C.	An Employee who is promoted or upgraded into a classification with a higher top-step hourly rate shall be placed at the lowest step in the salary schedule for the new classification which results in an increase of at least two and one-half percent (2-1/2%). Thereafter, a promoted Employee shall progress to any subsequent wage steps based on completion of the required service periods. Service in the new classification on a temporary upgrade status prior to promotion shall not be counted toward progression on the schedule.
SECTION 2	- COST OF LIVING
A.	There will be two (2) full percentage cost-of-living adjustments payable on the start of the pay period that includes November 1, 2005, and November 1, 2006.
B.	All cost-of-living adjustments will be based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (All Cities figure: 1982-1984=100), or subsequent revisions of this index. These adjustments will be based on the following formula:
(index published for	(index published for
the ending month of period)	_ the base month of period)
= %
index published for the base month of period
66
C.	The adjustments paid on November 1 shall be for the twelve (12) month period reported in October. The base month for the adjustments paid on November 1 shall be September of the previous year.
D.	The cost-of-living adjustment for the top step of each job classification shall be ninety percent (90%) of the number determined by the formula in Paragraph B times the base wage for such classification and shall be at least two percent (2%) and not more than six percent (6%). Such adjustment shall never result in a wage reduction. The base wage for each classification shall increase by at least three percent (3%) on the start of the first pay periods that include November 1, 2005 and November 1, 2006. The base wage for each classification for the cost of living adjustments, shall be the top step wage in effect October 1, each year, for that classification. Other steps in the wage progression for each classification will be recalculated according to Section 1, based on the adjusted top step.
E.	Computations of all wage rates will be carried out to the tenth of a cent ($.001). Amounts less than five-tenths of a cent ($.005) will be rounded down to the nearest cent ($.01); and amounts greater or equal to five-tenths of a cent ($.005) will be rounded up to the nearest cent ($.01).
SECTION 3	- WORK OUTSIDE OF CLASSIFICATION
A.	All assigned work performed in a higher paid classification will be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at the rate of the higher paid classification. When an Employee is assigned such work for more than two (2) hours up to and including four (4) hours, he/she will be paid at such rate for four (4) hours. When an Employee is assigned such work for more than four (4) hours, he/she will be paid at such rate for eight (8) hours and will be paid at the overtime rate for such classification, if applicable, for time in excess of eight (8) hours.
B.	If an Employee is assigned work in a lower paid classification, such Employee shall not suffer any reduction in wages. However, an Employee who accepts a temporary appointment to a lower paid position shall receive the wage rate for such lower paid position.
SECTION 4	- FLSA REQUIREMENTS
A.	All applicable non-overtime premiums received (e.g., spread pay and student pay) will be added into an Employee’s total compensation for the calculation of the “regular rate of pay”.
ARTICLE 14: RATES OF PAY
67
B.	A Rover, extra person, or a Relief Supervisor who has his/her RDOs changed, resulting in a workweek of over forty (40) hours, will be paid overtime for all hours in excess of forty (40). METRO will attempt, whenever possible, to provide such Employee with two (2) days off during each scheduled workweek.
SECTION 5	- VOLUNTARY DEMOTION
Employees who accept a voluntary demotion into a lower paid bargaining unit position because of poor health or other compelling reasons, as mutually agreed upon by the parties, will be placed at a salary step within the new position’s salary range which most closely matches the Employee’s salary in his or her former salary range, but does not exceed the rate of pay received by the Employee in his/her former classification.

See MOA page 187
ARTICLE 15:	FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
SECTION 1	- DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEES
A.	A Full-Time Transit Operator shall mean a person employed by METRO on a continuing basis who receives an eight (8) hour minimum guarantee of straight-time pay per day, not to exceed five (5) days per week, or a ten (10) hour minimum guarantee of straight-time pay per day not to exceed four (4) days per week, provided he/she has accepted all work assigned as specified in the remainder of this Article. For each regularly scheduled workday or portion thereof on which a Regular or Extra Board Operator does not perform his/her assignment, he/she shall lose his/her guarantee for that day and he/she shall be paid only for actual time worked, unless otherwise provided in this AGREEMENT. A regularly scheduled workday shall be defined as a day on which an Employee is normally required to work.
B.	There will be two (2) kinds of Full-Time Transit Operators: Regular Operators and Extra Board Operators. A Regular Operator shall mean a Full-Time Transit Operator who picks runs as a work assignment for his/her eight (8) or ten (10) hour guarantee. An Extra Board Operator shall mean a Full-Time Transit Operator who picks the Extra Board or Report and works all assignments placed on the Extra Board for his/her eight (8) hour guarantee.
C.	A Regular or Extra Board Operator who desires to work on a less than full-time basis while attending school or for compassionate reasons may, with METRO’s approval, be transferred to Group D status, provided he/she has completed one (1) continuous year of service as a Regular or Extra Board Operator immediately preceding transfer to this group. Group D Operators will be subject to the following:
1.	A Group D Operator will be paid his/her normal hourly rate. A Group D Operator may select either a part-time assignment or a position on the Extra Board with restricted availability of days and times.
2.	Group D Operators will be eligible for the benefits and conditions of regular Part-Time Operators.
3.	Group D Operators will be paid at the overtime rate for all work in excess of eight (8) hours in a workday. All time worked in excess of forty (40) straight-time hours in a workweek shall be paid at the overtime rate.
4.	A Group D Operator, who so desires, may be assigned additional work on his/her off days after overtime has been assigned to Regular and Extra-Board Operators.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
69
5.	A Group D Operator who works a weekday tripper:
a.	Will have the same guarantees as a Part-Time Operator for each tripper assignment worked.
b.	Will work on holidays when his/her picked assignment is scheduled to be in service. On Sunday-schedule holidays, he/ she will be limited to working his/her picked assignment only.
6.	Group D Operators will pick their vacations as Full-Time Operators with the amount of vacation taken in accordance with Article 9.
7.	A Group D Operator who selects a position on the Extra Board:
a.	Must pick either: 1) a run combination on Saturday and at least two (2) peak-time weekday periods as defined by METRO, or 2) at least five (5) peak-time weekday periods as defined by METRO.
b.	Will have an eight (8) hour guarantee on Saturday, if picked, and will be guaranteed the part-time minimum tripper guarantee for each weekday peak period picked.
c.	Must declare his/her intention to pick a Group D Extra Board position fourteen (14) days prior to the first day of Full-Time Operator pick.
d.	Must meet Extra Board Operator qualification requirements.
e.	Shall be assigned from surplus work by Group D seniority before any ATL or overtime assignments are made.
8.	Group D will be administered according to guidelines mutually developed and agreed to by METRO and the UNION.
D.	“Loader” shall refer to a Regular or Extra Board Operator who picks, or is assigned on the Extra Board, the task of selling passage; but who does not drive the conveyance for which the passage is sold.
SECTION 2	- FULL-TIME GUARANTEES
A.	Full-Time Operators will not be required to accept Part-Time Operator status.
See MOA page 187
70
B.	METRO will not reduce the number of Full-Time Transit Operators below one thousand two hundred twenty-three (1,223). In the event of a layoff, all Part-Time Transit Operators shall be laid off prior to the layoff of any Full-Time Transit Operator, provided that for every two (2) Part-Time Transit Operators laid off due to a substantial reduction of funds or ridership, METRO may, at its discretion, reduce the daily guarantee of one (1) Full-Time Transit Operator position to five (5) hours. Full-Time Operators will pick such reduced-guarantee positions by seniority. Full-Time Operators selecting a reduced-guarantee position will have two (2) consecutive off days and will pick an assignment with a guaranteed paid time of five (5) hours for each of their regular work days. Operators selecting a reduced guarantee position will be paid at the overtime rate for all time work in excess of eight (8) hours in a day and for all time worked in excess of forty (40) straight-time hours in a workweek. Nothing herein shall be construed as giving METRO the authority to reduce any other right or benefit of affected Full-Time Transit Operators. Reinstatement of the eight (8) hour daily guarantee shall be in seniority order on the same one (1) for two (2) basis as the reduction, when the Part-Time Operator positions vacated by the layoff are filled.
C.	Assignment of specials and extras will be made to Full-Time Operators only, except as otherwise provided in this AGREEMENT
D.	The number of Part-Time Transit Operators, with each dual tripper Operator counted as two (2) Operators, shall not exceed forty-five percent (45%) of the total number of Transit Operators.
E.	All runs and reports will be worked by Full-Time Operators.
F.	All full-time vacation reliefs will be worked by Full-Time Operators.
G.	Work left vacant because of the absence of a Full-Time Operator will be worked by a Full-Time Operator, unless otherwise specified in this AGREEMENT.
H.	For five hundred (500) day base units, the minimum number of fulltime runs shall be eight hundred forty-three (843). For every day base unit above or below five hundred (500), the minimum number of full-time runs will increase or decrease by one (1) respectively. Day base units are defined as the number of coaches operating regularly scheduled service at noon each weekday or Saturday.
I.	The Extra Board will be worked only by Full-Time Operators.
SECTION 3	- GENERAL CONDITIONS
A.	Each Operator will sign in for his/her work. When an Operator does not sign in on time, the Supervisor on duty will notify the appropriate Report Operator to take the assignment.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
71
B.	The Base Dispatcher/Planner may use his/her judgment as to which Operator to use in an emergency.
C.	Any Operator not being relieved when arriving at the relief point will call the Coordinator and inform him/her that no relief Operator is present. If the Operator does not wish to continue working, he/she shall follow the procedures set forth herein. If the coach is inbound the Operator will operate to Pine Street going northbound, to Main Street going southbound, or to Third Avenue going west-bound or eastbound, then return to the base. If the coach is outbound with passengers, the Operator will continue to the terminal if the round trip back to the relief point is less than one and one-half (1-1/2) hours. If the round trip back to the relief point is more than one and one-half (1-1/2) hours, METRO must dispatch a car with a relief Operator and must return the relieved Operator to the base. Coaches which do not operate through the Seattle central business district will be governed by the one and one-half (11/2) hour rule.
D.	An assignment shall be defined as any work or duties that the Employee is required to perform.
E.	If an Operator loses an RDO because of a change in schedule, he/she will be given time off to compensate for such day. No Operator may have more RDOs in any pay period than he/she would have received had no change of schedule been made.
F.	The cutoff time for calling to be removed from the sick list, and for signing the layoff book for time off, is 10:00 a.m. Should an Operator report sick after 10:00 a.m., he/she may retain his/her following day’s full assignment by calling off the sick list at least one (1) hour prior to the start of the next day’s full assignment, or prior to 10:00 a.m., whichever comes first.
G.	At each pick, an Operator may indicate his/her preference regarding training assignments. METRO will attempt to accommodate an Operator’s preference when assigning students; however, any Operator may be given a training assignment if necessary. Trainees shall drive during all training assignments unless METRO or the instructing Operator determines that safety would be jeopardized.
H.	METRO shall provide a minimum five (5) minute scheduled layover after each revenue trip, except when:
1.	The revenue trip is less than fifteen (15) minutes long, or
2.	The revenue trip is the last revenue trip before the coach returns to the base, or
3.	The revenue trip is live-looped or through-routed, or
72
4.	The layover has been reduced by mutual agreement of METRO and the UNION.
When circumstances beyond the Operator’s control result in less than five (5) minutes layover in the previous two (2) hours, the Operator shall be entitled to a five (5) minute layover at the next outer terminal, except on his/her last trip, provided the Operator attempts to notify the Coordinator. METRO agrees to review routes or assignments identified by the UNION as having insufficient layover time.
I.	In order to provide reasonable breaks, METRO shall endeavor to schedule at least one (1) fifteen (15) minute layover in assignments over five (5) hours in length. When an Operator working an assignment finds it does not provide reasonable break time, the Operator should notify METRO of such by filing a service report.
J.	An Operator may voluntarily install/remove chains if needed.
K.	When a Sunday schedule is operated on a holiday, an Operator who has picked a Sunday run and whose regular workday falls on the holiday will work his/her Sunday run. A Regular Operator on a regular workday without a Sunday run shall have the day off at holiday pay.
L.	Each day at each base, METRO guarantees that for every forty-five (45) Full-Time Operators normally scheduled to work on that day at that base, rounded to the nearest forty-five (45), one (1) Full-Time Operator shall be excused from his/her assignment. However, the guarantee shall be a minimum of one (1) each day for any base with Full-Time Operators. These guarantees shall not apply in the case of an extreme emergency.
M.	Separate layoff books for Full-Time and Part-Time Operators will be maintained at each base. Once the minimum guarantees are met, the number of additional Part-Time Operators excused on a particular day shall not be greater than the number of additional Full-Time Operators excused on that same day. However, if excusing additional a.m. or p.m. Part-Time Operators or Full-Time Operators wanting a portion of the day off would balance the open work, METRO may excuse such Operators. After all Full-Time Operators who have so requested are excused, there shall be no limit to the number of Part-Time Operators excused.
N.	Candidates for Supervisor-in-Training positions shall be selected from METRO Full-Time Transit Operators who have at least three (3) years of current, full-time driving service.
O.	All assignments shall be completed within a maximum sixteen (16) hour spread. Such spread will begin with the start time of the first assignment following at least eight (8) continuous hours off.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
73
P.	When an Operator presents a valid medical restriction which prevents operation of the equipment or in the facility of his/her assignment, METRO will work with the UNION to find a mutually agreeable alternate assignment for the remainder of the shake-up. If METRO wishes to change the coach type on a picked assignment to a type that a Regular Operator of that assignment is restricted from operating, METRO must find an alternate assignment that is agreeable to both the Operator and the UNION. In cases where no agreement can be reached, METRO will not change the coach type.
Q.	A Regular or Report Operator on his/her regular day to work may, with at least one day advance notice, trade his/her regular assignment for an available float combo, as defined in Section 5 Paragraph E, for the purpose of scheduling a personal appointment during the float combo’s split; an Extra Board Operator may request an out-of-rotation assignment to the float combo for the same reason. Except as provided in Section 8 Paragraph E, an Operator may be assigned to a float combo no more than once in each calendar month.
SECTION 4	- RUNS
A.	There shall be two types of Full-Time Operator runs.
1.	A straight run or “straight” will consist of straight-through work which is at least seven hours and eleven minutes (7:11) including platform, report and travel time.
2.	A run combination or “combo” will consist of two (2) or three (3) pieces of work which are at least seven hours and eleven minutes (7:11) in total work time, including platform, report and travel time, and which are within a spread time of twelve and one-half (12 ^) hours. Combos with more than one (1) split will be paid straight-through for the lesser split. Any combo with a split of twenty-nine (29) minutes or less will be paid straight-through and classified as a straight. Combos which quit after 8:00 p.m. shall be paid straight-through.
B.	A day run shall be defined as any run which is completed by 8:00 p.m.
C.	A night run shall be defined as any run that is completed after 8:00 p.m.
D.	At the discretion of METRO, “frags”, defined as assignments less than seven hours and eleven minutes (7:11), including platform, report and travel time, may be posted and selected at the pick. Frags will be guaranteed eight (8) hours pay. All other contract provisions relating to runs shall apply to frags.
E.	The total number of straight-through day runs for the system on weekdays or Saturdays shall be equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of the day base units on weekdays or Saturdays, respectively.
74
F.	Straight-through day runs shall comprise at least fifty-eight percent (58%) of all straight-through runs.
G.	At least seventy percent (70%) of all Saturday runs shall be straight-through runs. There shall be no combos on Sunday.
H.	Runs and trippers on a route may be assigned to more than one (1) base.
I.	Runs shall be determined by METRO in accordance with the provisions in this Section. Any portion of a run, or any other service work not meeting the definition of a run, shall be defined as a tripper.
J.	Any Extra Board Operator working a regularly scheduled run shall be paid the regularly scheduled run pay.
K.	In the event of a vacancy, runs and combos may be broken into trippers on the same day in order to allow METRO to fill all work.
SECTION 5	- OPERATOR PICKS
A.	At pick, seniority for all Full-Time Operators shall prevail in the selection of runs, reports and/or board positions, vacations, overtime trippers, bases, and RDOs.
B.	A system shake-up shall occur three (3) times a year. Shake-ups shall be a minimum of sixteen (16) weeks and a maximum of twenty (20) weeks, unless the UNION and METRO mutually agree otherwise. All established practices and procedures for the Operator picks shall be observed through this AGREEMENT. Work assignments will be selected at the pick for the following shake-up period.
C.	Copies of the pick schedule will be posted in each base and in the UNION office at least two (2) weeks prior to the first day of the pick. The UNION will supply METRO with a signed, certified Operator seniority list three (3) weeks prior to the first day of the pick.
D.	A Full-Time Operator who wishes to select an assignment must select an assignment according to the seniority list certified for the pick, unless the UNION and METRO mutually agree otherwise.
E.	METRO will determine the work, possible RDO combinations and the base from which work will originate. METRO and the UNION will select one combo at each base that will be withheld from pick, which will be available for daily assignment to Operators wanting to schedule personal appointments during the combo split; such combos will be called float combos. Copies of all assignment sheets showing the runs, reports, Extra Board positions, and available RDO combinations will be posted in the pick room six (6) days prior to the start of assignment selection. The UNION agrees to staff the pick room on weekend days.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
75
F.	The UNION shall be supplied a copy of the final work assignments to be used for the pick at least two (2) weeks prior to the first day of the pick.
G.	A Regular Operator who has Sunday off may pick a vacant Sunday assignment, by seniority, for work on any Sunday-schedule holiday. This selection will take place at the base after the Operator pick and after Report and vacation relief Operators have made their selections. If vacant Sunday assignments are still available, they may be offered for pick by seniority to all Full-Time Operators at the base whose RDO falls on the holiday.
H.	Each Operator shall have two (2) consecutive RDOs, or in case of a 4/40 Operator three (3) consecutive RDOs, in every seven (7) day period, except when Operator shake-ups or move-ups make this impossible.
I.	A Full-Time Operator who selects Regular or Report Operator status shall select five (5) consecutive workday assignments. Each Operator’s selections must be all runs or all reports and must be exclusively day assignments or exclusively night assignments. If an Operator selects runs, there must be at least eight (8) hours off between assignments on consecutive days. If an Operator selects reports, there must be at least eight (8) hours off between assignments on consecutive workdays in addition to the spread time. No Operator will be forced to pick an assignment of runs or reports which would result in less than ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off between consecutive workday assignments, or less than fifty-six (56) hours off on his/her two (2) consecutive RDOs.
J.	An Operator shall report to the pick room at least twenty (20) minutes before his/her pick time, receive instructions and use this time to examine available work assignments. No Operator shall be compensated for time spent in the selection process, unless it is during his/her regular work hours.
K.	A UNION representative shall be present during picks.
L.	An Operator, who fails to appear at his/her scheduled pick time and who does not notify the UNION of his/her choices via an absentee pick form, shall have an assignment selected for him/her by the UNION representative. The UNION representative shall make an effort to select an assignment comparable to the assignment last selected at a pick. Selections made by the UNION will not be subject to the grievance/arbitration procedure.
M.	When a new operating base opens or an existing operating base closes and that base has/had Operator assignments, a system-wide pick will occur.
76
See MOA page 189
N.	In order to pick a Group D assignment, an Operator must request a transfer at least fourteen (14) days prior to the first day of the pick. Group D Operator vacations will be selected at the Full-Time Operator pick. A Group D Operator working a Part-Time Operator assignment shall 1) waive his/her right to select assignments at the Full-Time Operator pick; 2) shall select his/her assignment, by seniority, after all regular Part-Time Operators have picked and may exercise the right to submit a work restriction form. A Group D Operator returning to assignment as a Full-Time Operator shall be assigned to the bottom of the Day Board at the base currently picked until the next shake-up.
O.	Each Operator must pick work which is compatible with any existing medical restrictions s/he has on file with METRO. Failure to do so will result in forfeiture of the Operator’s daily or assignment guarantee for each day on which the Operator has picked an incompatible assignment, unless no work is available within the Operator’s restriction.
SECTION 6	- MOVE-UPS
A.	If regular or report assignments become vacant, less senior Operators at the base may request a move-up. An Operator who moves up must pick the entire assignment of the Operator who vacated the run or report. If a Regular Operator moves up to a report assignment, such Operator will be placed at the bottom of the day board. An Extra Board Operator who moves up to a report assignment will remain on his/her picked board position. If new Extra Board RDO combinations become available, Extra Board Operators at the base who could not have picked these RDO combinations may choose the new RDO combinations. Operator move-ups will be conducted only when they can be implemented at least twenty-eight (28) days prior to a shake-up.
B.	Move-ups will be conducted by Shop Stewards at the affected base at the direction of the UNION. An assignment selected at a move-up via absentee pick will not be subject to the grievance/arbitration procedure.
SECTION 7	- SELECTING VACATIONS
A.	Vacations may be split into periods of one (1) or more full weeks. If an Employee’s vacation is not evenly divisible into full weeks, the odd number of days must be taken as a block in one (1) period.
B.	Operators may pick only one (1) prime time vacation per year. METRO shall determine the number of vacations offered in each period. Each year, METRO shall furnish the UNION with a list of vacation periods.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
77
C.	The UNION shall determine the prime periods for the following year and inform METRO of their determination in writing in advance of the first day of the fall pick of the current year.
D.	Future pick and shake-up dates occurring during the vacation periods that Operators can select at the current pick shall be posted in the pick room by METRO.
E.	After a vacation relief has been assigned to an Extra Board Operator, there shall be no changes in vacation unless agreed upon by the Operator who is assigned the vacation relief.
F.	An Operator may, with METRO approval, change his/her vacation at the base to a period which he/she did not have the seniority to pick provided the available period(s) are posted at least one (1) week in advance.
SECTION 8	- EXTRA BOARD
A.	Each base having Operators shall have a Day Extra Board to fill those assignments left open, to fill any special work, and to fill overtime assignments according to the overtime assignment process. In addition, bases having night work shall also have a Night Extra Board for the same purposes. Day and Night Boards shall be open for selection at the pick by all Full-Time Operators by seniority. Operators may select any available position on either Extra Board.
B.	During a shake-up, any newly hired Operators shall be placed at the bottom of the Day Board. Selection of position shall be by seniority.
C.	All work assigned to an Extra Board Operator as part of his/her regular workday assignment will be within a spread of thirteen (13) hours unless voluntarily waived by the Operator or in the case of an extreme emergency.
D.	The Extra Boards shall be posted by 2:00 p.m. No Extra Board assignment will be final until 2:00 p.m. If the Extra Board is not posted by 4:00 p.m., each Extra Board Operator who is available the following day will receive one (1) hour of straight-time pay, except in case of extreme emergency.
78
E.	The Extra Boards shall be assigned according to the following rules:
1.	All available work will be sorted into two (2) categories as follows:
a.	Category A shall include:
1)	Straight-through day runs which quit at 8:00 p.m. or earlier.
2)	Day reports which have a quit time of 10:00 p.m. or earlier as determined by a 13-hour spread.

2.	Category B assignments shall be assigned first, beginning with the Night Board, from the bottom of the board, according to quit time, latest quit time assigned first.
a.	If there are more available Operators on the Night Board than assignments in Category B, then the remaining Night Board Operators shall be assigned Category A work with the latest start time assigned first.
b.	If there are fewer available Operators on the Night Board than available assignments in Category B, then remaining Category B assignments shall be assigned to the Day Board, latest quit first, from the bottom up.
3.	Category A work shall be assigned next to the Day Board, from the top of the board down, according to quit time, with the earliest quit assigned first.
4.	Quit time of special work shall be estimated by METRO for the purpose of establishing assignment sequence. There is no guarantee that special work will quit at the estimated time.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
79
5.	If two (2) or more Operator assignments within the same category quit at the same time, they shall be assigned as follows:
a.	A run will be assigned before a report.
b.	An assignment with more pay will be assigned before an assignment with less pay.
c.	If two (2) assignments pay the same, the assignment with the lesser amount of work including report time and travel time will be assigned first.
d.	If two (2) assignments pay the same and have the same amount of work including report time and travel time, they will be assigned at the discretion of METRO.
6.	If the number of Extra Board Operators available for work on a regular workday is greater than the number of available runs, reports and special work which fits the definition of a run, then tripper combinations may be inserted in the assignment sequence according to their quit times. Tripper combinations will be made with trippers, pieces of work and special work under seven hours and eleven minutes (7:11) at METRO’s discretion. Tripper combinations with more than one (1) split will be paid straight-through for the lesser split. Any tripper combination split of twenty-nine (29) minutes or less will be paid straight-through.
7.	If the number of Extra Board Operators available for work on a regular workday is less than the number of available runs, reports and special work which fits the definition of a run, runs may be taken out of the assignment sequence. The runs to be removed from the assignment sequence will be combos, late day runs with a quit time from 6:01 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., and early quit relief runs with a quit time of 8:01 p.m. to 9:59 p.m., in that order.
8.	All weekday pieces of work open before the Extra Board’s 10:00 a.m. cutoff will be assigned to Full-Time Extra Board Operators, who are qualified and available, as a regular assignment. Any remaining work, except work left vacant by Part-Time Operators, will be assigned first according to the overtime assignment sequence, then to Part-Time Operators on the Additional Tripper List, except as prohibited in this AGREEMENT. Work left vacant by Part-Time Operators will be assigned first to the Additional Tripper List, then to Full-Time Operators according to the overtime assignment sequence in accordance with this AGREEMENT.
9.	On holidays, an Operator left without an assignment shall receive the day off at holiday pay. All Operators in a base who request the holiday off via the layoff book will be excused before any Operator in the same base is forced to take the day off.
See MOA page 189
80
See MOA page 190
10.	An Operator who is qualified in accordance with Section 12, but who is not qualified on the specific assignment he/she would normally receive, shall be passed over until the first assignment for which he/she is qualified becomes available. If work is not available to match an Operator’s qualifications, the Operator shall be placed on report and may be sent out to qualify. The eight (8) hour guarantee shall apply for that day. If the last Operator available does not qualify for the last assignment available in the assignment sequence, then the next latest quit assignment for which that Operator qualifies shall become his/her assignment for the day and the remaining Operators shall be assigned in the normal sequence. This process may be repeated until the last available Operator is qualified on the last available assignment.
11.	Any Extra Board Operator who receives an assignment out of sequence, except as provided for elsewhere in this AGREEMENT, shall receive one (1) hour of straight-time pay, except in case of extreme emergency. Any Operator who receives an overtime assignment out of sequence, except as provided for elsewhere in this AGREEMENT, shall receive pay to equal the assignment he/ she should have had or the assignment he/she received, whichever is greater.
12.	The following provisions shall apply to Extra Board Operators who choose vacation reliefs:
a.	Extra Board Operators, except Report Operators, may request to work the runs or reports of Operators who are on vacation, sick leave, industrial injury, disability leave, or unpaid leave of absence of one (1) week or more. Vacant runs or reports may be picked as vacation reliefs until they are filled by a move-up. An Operator will be allowed to pick vacation reliefs only on assignments that have the same RDOs as the Operator. Operators will pick this work by seniority.
b.	An Extra Board Operator shall be qualified prior to the effective starting date of the vacation relief.
c.	For a Sunday-schedule holiday, all Extra Board Operators who regularly work that day, and who are working vacation reliefs which have no Sunday assignment, shall pick from all vacant Sunday assignments available after Report Operators have picked.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
81
d.	When a vacation relief assignment ends, the Extra Board Operator shall revert to his/her regular picked position on the Extra Board without any penalty to METRO. This Operator then becomes eligible for the next available vacation relief, or remainder of an unpicked vacation relief, according to seniority.
e.	Extra Board overtime policies remain unchanged.
f.	An Extra Board Operator picking a vacation assignment must work the entire vacation assignment, except as provided in Paragraph d.
13.	If an Extra Board Operator’s normal sequence assignment conflicts with his/her partial absence or non-driving assignment, then such Operator will be given an assignment which is not a straight-through run and which has a quit time within one (1) hour of his/her normal sequence assignment. METRO will attempt to maximize straight-time paid work hours for such Operator.
F.	No Operator’s RDO shall be cancelled or changed without the consent of the Operator, except in extreme emergency. Each Extra Board Operator shall have a minimum of fifty-six (56) hours off for his/her two (2) consecutive RDOs.
G.	Any Extra Board Operator may request to add or remove a guarantee of ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off between consecutive days’ assignments, provided this is requested in writing at the pick, or prior to 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, to be effective Saturday. Any Extra Board Operator requesting the ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off between consecutive days’ assignments and who would not receive ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off in the normal assignment sequence will fall out of the normal assignment sequence, and will receive the first available assignment after his/her ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off.
H.	An Extra Board Operator who, for any reason, does not receive his/ her requested ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off, may elect to “pass up” by submitting a written statement at the completion of the day’s assignment. An Operator electing to pass up will report to the base after his/her ten and one-half (10-1/2) hours off, unless notified to report later.
I.	An Extra Board Operator may be assigned work at other bases, when
necessary to balance available work, subject to the following:
1.	On Sunday-scheduled holidays, Bellevue Base Extra Board Operators may be assigned to other bases as needed.
2.	At each pick, a volunteer list of Extra Board Operators willing to accept interbase transfers will be established.
See MOA page 190
82
3.	In addition to the volunteer list, METRO may designate Interbase Transfer Extra Board positions with varying RDO combinations at each operating base. Such positions will be selected at Operator pick by seniority. An Operator who picks an Interbase Transfer position must choose to be on either the “volunteer list” or “force list”. Bellevue Base will be limited to two (2) Inter-base Transfer positions which shall have Saturday-Sunday as their RDO combination. At all other operating bases, there shall be no more than five (5) Inter-base Transfer RDO combinations posted. Regardless of the number of positions posted, there will be no more than one (1) Saturday-Sunday combination, no more than one (1) Sunday-Monday combination, no more than two (2) Tuesday-Wednesday combinations, and no more than two (2) Thursday-Friday combinations posted at each operating base. There will be no Inter-base Transfer positions with Monday-Tuesday, Wednesday-Thursday or Friday-Saturday RDO combinations.
4.	An inter-base transfer assignment will not adversely affect the quit time sequence of the Extra Board for the following day.
5.	Within each base, inter-base transfer work will be assigned in the following order:
a.	Inter-base transfer work will be assigned first, in seniority order, to those Inter-base Transfer Operators who choose to be on the Inter-base Transfer volunteer list.
b.	Next, inter-base transfer work will be assigned, in inverse seniority order, to those Inter-base Transfer Operators who choose to be on the Inter-base Transfer force list.
c.	Next, to Extra Board Operators who volunteer for inter-base transfers who did not pick an Inter-base Transfer position. Such transfers will not be subject to the premium in Paragraph 6.
6.	If an Inter-base Transfer Operator is assigned an inter-base transfer assignment and either works the entire assignment, works an alternative assignment at METRO’S direction, or is on a full-day Union Leave, he/she will receive a daily premium of one (1) hour of straight time pay.
7.	At METRO’s discretion, Inter-base Transfer Operators may be assigned to qualify on routes and equipment operating out of a different base. Each Inter-base Transfer Operator may select one suburban location (North, East/Bellevue or South) for which he/ she will not be assigned to qualify.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
83
8.	With thirty (30) days notice, METRO may require an Inter-base Transfer Operator to qualify on up to three (3) major routes out of a base other than his/her picked base. Each Inter-base Transfer Operator may select one suburban location (North, East/Bellevue or South) for which he/she will not be required to qualify.
9.	An Inter-base Transfer Operator may qualify on any major route and will be paid at the applicable rate.
10.	Each Inter-base Transfer Operator will be assigned overtime according to his/her pick option, at his/her home base.
J.	Except as provided in Paragraph I, no Extra Board Operator will be required to qualify on routes not regularly assigned to his/her operating base.
SECTION 9	- REPORT OPERATORS
A.	Report times will be posted and selected at the Operator pick.
B.	Operators shall pick reports according to the open pick system.
C.	An Operator picking reports must be qualified on seventy-five percent (75%) of all routes from the selected base by the first day of the shakeup. He/she must be qualified on all routes and foreign routes from that base, except for Center Park and/or Waterfront Streetcar, thirty (30) days after the effective date of the shake-up. METRO shall determine which report positions at the applicable base shall be required to qualify on Center Park and/or Waterfront Streetcar and will post this information in the pick room. An Operator who picks such a position and fails to qualify on this service will remain on his/her picked report for the shake-up, but will be required to qualify on such service before again picking such a report. If an Operator fails to qualify on this service, he/she will be given an additional opportunity to qualify prior to the next Operator pick. No Report Operator will be required to qualify on routes not regularly assigned to his/her picked operating base.
D.	Report Operators will be available for a spread of thirteen (13) hours and must accept all work according to Report Operator work rules set forth in this AGREEMENT.
E.	For a Sunday-schedule holiday, a Report Operator having a Sunday report and who regularly works on that day will work his/her Sunday report. A Report Operator on his/her regular workday without a Sunday report may choose to pick from all vacant Sunday assignments, by seniority, or to revert to his/her position on the Extra Board for assignment.
See MOA page 190
84
See MOA page 191
F.	METRO may adjust picked report times by a maximum of thirty (30) minutes when a change is needed. METRO shall give five (5) days notice to an Operator whose report will be affected. When changes adversely affect an Operator’s personal life or impose serious hardship in reporting to work, the Operator may request that the base supervisor and the UNION review the matter.
G.	An Operator may voluntarily waive his/her 13-hour spread. An Operator may not waive the eight (8) continuous hours off. The maximum spread will be sixteen (16) hours. A Report Operator who waives his/her 13-hour spread must still be available for his/her regular shift the next day.
H.	Except as otherwise provided in this AGREEMENT, all time served on report shall be paid. Any Operator required to report shall receive a minimum of two and one-half (2-1/2) hours pay. However, an Operator serving on report shall be considered on report, regardless of assignment, until released. Two and one-half (2-1/2) hours shall be paid when released from report and assigned work starting more than two and one-half (2-1/2) hours after reporting. At the completion of an assignment, an Operator may be released or assigned to further duties. If report time and tripper time are consecutive, report time will be used to make up the tripper guarantee. Report time will stop at the beginning of pay time.
I.	At the beginning of each shake-up, METRO shall define the number of report positions and the report time of each position. Additional report assignments may be added at the discretion of METRO, provided that any assigned or picked report shall not share the same report time. If METRO determines that it is necessary to continue these additional report times for the remainder of the shake-up, they will be subject to a move-up.
J.	The Operator with the earliest first report time gets the first piece of work that is or becomes available within his/her spread, except in cases of emergency. If the assignment is less than eight (8) hours work time, the Operator may be assigned additional work within the terms of this AGREEMENT. When assignments have the same quit time, the rules of Section 8, Paragraph E.5 also apply to Operators on report. Operators on late report follow the last Report Operator and the last Operator on pass-up. When necessary for a Report Operator to be assigned work at another base, he/she shall be paid straight through until the start of the assignment and shall be paid actual travel time back to the original base.
K.	At the discretion of the Base Dispatcher/Planner, assignments that become available for Report Operators may be broken up if necessary to keep service in operation.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
85
L.	Work available at the time a Report Operator is released from an a.m. assignment may be assigned at that time for the remainder of the day at the discretion of the Base Dispatcher/Planner.
M.	An Operator on paid report who is not qualified but who has met the qualification requirements contained in Paragraph C will be passed over and, if no further work opens for which he/she is qualified, will not lose his/her eight (8) hour guarantee for that day.
N.	An Operator required to serve on report on a Sunday or Sundayschedule holiday, shall serve continuous report until given work or released for the day. An Operator who has picked a Saturday report shall serve continuous report until given work or released for the day.
O.	Should an Operator who has picked a regular report, and another Operator who has a non-regular report share the same initial report time, the Operator who must be off earliest will be first up. If both Operators must be off at the same time, the Operator with the regular report will have first right of refusal for the assignment. Should two (2) or more Extra Board Operators have the same initial report time, the most senior Operator will have first right of refusal on an available assignment.
P.	No Report Operator will be required to work prior to report time.
Q.	A Report Operator with a partial absence or non-driving work assignment that is within his/her 13-hour spread will be removed from his/her report and given an assignment that starts no earlier than the start time of his/her report assignment and has a scheduled quit time within his/her normal spread or within thirteen (13) hours of his/her non-driving work assignment, whichever is earlier. METRO will attempt to maximize straight-time paid work hours for such Operator.
SECTION 10	- OVERTIME
A.	All hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in the scheduled workday or work on a RDO in the scheduled workweek shall be paid at the overtime rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the existing straighttime rate of pay for actual overtime hours worked, except where otherwise specified in this AGREEMENT.
B.	Any Operator working a regular run on his/her RDO shall be paid for eight (8) hours at the overtime rate or for actual overtime hours worked, whichever is greater. An Operator who works two (2) separate and complete runs on the same day will be paid such guarantee for each run. An Operator assigned overtime on his/her RDO, per Paragraph D.2 and D.4, shall be guaranteed a minimum for the day of two hours and forty minutes (2:40) pay at the overtime rate.
C.	All runs shall be assigned and every available Operator shall have work before any overtime assignment is made.

4.	Regular Operators on an RDO.
5.	Extra Board Operators on regular workday voluntarily exceeding their spread time, except as provided in Section 3, Paragraph O.
6.	Extra Board Operators on regular workday forced in inverse order of seniority.
E.	No Operator shall be required to work on his/her RDO. No Regular Operator shall be assigned overtime work unless he/she volunteers for such work.
F.	Any Operator volunteering for overtime shall be required to work the overtime assigned.
G.	An Extra Board Operator may request to add or remove overtime availability for regular workdays at the pick or prior to 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, to be effective Saturday. Operators who remove overtime availability may be assigned overtime only in accordance with Paragraph D.6.
H.	A Regular Operator may request to be added to or removed from the overtime list by submitting a request in writing at the pick or prior to 10:00 a.m. on Thursday, to be effective Saturday.
I.	Any Operator, having completed a scheduled run of less than eight (8) hours, who is used for any purpose whatsoever, not in connection with his/her completed run, shall be paid his/her eight (8) hours and shall be paid at the overtime rate for all additional time worked. This shall apply also to time worked due to failure of a road relief or to additional work assigned by a Supervisor. Such time will not reduce the spread pay of the run.
J.	METRO shall post 275 weekday and Saturday overtime trippers each week, for selection at pick according to the following:
1.	A Regular Operator may select one (1) overtime tripper per day, including his/her RDO. An Extra Board Operator may select one (1) overtime tripper for each RDO.
2.	METRO shall determine the location of the trippers and the numbers allocated to each base for the pick after consultation with the UNION Part-Time Pick Coordinator.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
87
3.	If all posted trippers are not picked, the balance shall be offered for pick at the base to all Full-Time Operators, including Group D Operators, by Full-Time Operator seniority. An Operator may pick a second tripper per day at this time. An Extra Board Operator may not pick a tripper on his/her regular day to work. Any remaining trippers shall be assigned according to the work rules.
4.	An Operator who has picked an overtime tripper will be assigned that tripper on the day(s) picked unless excused.
5.	An Operator may pick overtime trippers only at the base he/she picked.
SECTION 11	- SPECIAL ALLOWANCES
A.	Ten (10) minutes report time shall be paid at the applicable rate.
B.	Thirty (30) minutes straight-time pay shall be paid for the first report of each accident. If an Operator is required to fill out a report by the State of Washington or a local police department in addition to his/her regular accident report, an additional thirty (30) minutes straight-time pay shall be paid for filling out that report of the accident. If the Safety Officer approves the first accident report and the Operator is called in to fill out an additional report other than those for the State of Washington or local police departments, an additional thirty (30) minutes straighttime pay shall be paid for filling out each additional report. Forty-five (45) minutes straight-time pay shall be paid for the first report of each accident involving a collision with another vehicle in which both vehicles are moving or in any collision with a pedestrian.

SECTION 12	- QUALIFICATION
A.	The Training Section will determine the standards and procedures required for qualification on routes. The Training Section will determine the amount of time paid to qualify on routes. A list will be posted at each base in the Operators’ reporting area showing the amount of time that will be paid for qualifying. When an Operator is assigned to qualify in a car or bus, he/she will receive pay for actual time spent qualifying. The Training Section will determine what constitutes a major route change that would necessitate requalification. The Training Section will keep a permanent record of all route changes and whether such changes were minor or major. The most recent major change and the three (3) most recent minor changes on each route will be identified by date in The Book. Pay for qualifying will be at the applicable rate. If the UNION disagrees with the amount of qualification time, the parties shall meet to resolve the issue.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
89
B.	An Extra Board Operator must be qualified on six (6) major routes by the effective date of shake-up and on all major routes at his/her picked base within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the shake-up. A major route is defined as a route or route group which has at least forty (40) hours per weekday of scheduled platform time at a specific base. After being given seven (7) days notice, an Operator not qualified on routes, as required in this AGREEMENT, may lose his/her daily guarantee and may not be permitted to work until he/she complies with the qualification requirements specified in this AGREEMENT. If a base does not have six (6) major routes, then any Extra Board Operator at that base must qualify on at least six (6) routes, including all major routes by the effective date of the shake-up. If the base does not have six (6) routes he/she must qualify on all routes at the base.
C.	An Extra Board Operator also may qualify on any minor routes scheduled out of his/her picked base. In addition, METRO may assign Operators to qualify on minor routes. A minor route is defined as a route or route group which has fewer than forty (40) hours per weekday of scheduled platform time at a specific base.

Having provided two (2) days notice, such Operator will not be required to drive in such facility/equipment until he/she has completed the refresher course. At each Operator pick, an Operator seeking coach qualification other than the Waterfront Streetcar or Center Park may sign a list indicating his/her desire to qualify on equipment operating from his/her picked base. METRO will schedule training for such Operators within a reasonable length of time. METRO also will provide training within a reasonable length of time on new equipment introduced to a base for those Operators desiring such training.
E.	The date an Operator qualifies on a route shall be recorded and shall be updated for any shake-up in which that Operator has driven that route. An Operator may request disqualification, with two (2) days notice, on any route he/she has not driven in the previous five (5) years or on any route which has undergone three (3) minor changes since he/she last drove it. All Operators will be disqualified when a route undergoes a major change.
F.	At the discretion of the Base Dispatcher/Planner, an Extra Board Operator may be assigned to qualify in addition to a straight-through run.
G.	An Extra Board Operator who would receive a combo or tripper assignment in his/her normal sequence may be taken out of sequence and given an assignment which allows time for qualifying on routes. Such Operator will not be assigned a straight-through run when taken out of sequence to qualify.
90
See MOA page 192
H.	An Extra Board Operator who is qualified on the least number of routes in a base may be pulled out of assignment sequence and assigned to qualify.
I.	Minor changes affecting routes in a base shall be posted in an appropriate accessible location in the Operator reporting area. All Operators shall be responsible for being familiar with those changes affecting routes on which they have qualified.
J.	A Regular Operator desiring to qualify on routes in order to be eligible for overtime on those routes may qualify at the applicable rate of pay on any major or minor routes at his/her picked base. An Operator will be paid for qualifying on a route only if he/she is qualified on the equipment/facility necessary to operate that route.
K.	Any Operator picking a run/base which requires coach/tunnel qualification must have successfully completed the appropriate training before the effective date of shake-up, unless METRO is unable to provide training. The appropriate training will be scheduled by METRO to meet the requirement. Operators will be responsible for requesting this training.
L.	Trainees on Center Park and the Waterfront Streetcar will be selected by the base supervisor/designee from Extra Board Operators on a volunteer basis. A person who has not operated the Waterfront Streetcar for a period of six (6) months must take a paid refresher course before being assigned to Waterfront Streetcar duty. The Training Section shall determine the amount of time necessary to requalify.
M.	An Operator who fails to qualify on his/her picked assignment or equipment will be placed on an assignment or Extra Board position mutually agreed to by the UNION and METRO, to be consistent with his/her seniority, until the next shakeup.
SECTION 13	- UNIFORMS
A.	Upon completion of training and after qualification, a newly hired Operator shall be issued four (4) shirts, three (3) pairs of pants/shorts, one (1) sweater, and one (1) parka. Thereafter, the uniform allowance shall be available annually on the Operator’s anniversary date.
B.	A uniform allowance of twelve (12) times the top step Transit Operator wage rate on January 1 of each year shall be available annually on each Operator’s qualification date. The uniform allowance may be used only to purchase authorized uniform items. An Operator who does not pick an assignment and who is not required to be in uniform will have his/her uniform allowance for the following year reduced by one-third (1/3) of the annual allowance for each shake-up on such status.
ARTICLE 15: FULL-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
91
C.	An Operator who moves from part-time to full-time status, or vice versa, will continue to receive his/her uniform allowance on his/her original qualification date.
D.	Uniform allowance balances may be carried over if unused. An Operator’s accrued allowance may not exceed twenty-five (25) times the top step Transit Operator wage rate as shown in Exhibit A.
E.	Operators are required to be in uniform while on duty. When uniform garments are not available, an out of uniform slip will be given to the Operator by the Supervisor before the Operator goes on duty. Uniforms shall be worn only to and from work and while on duty.
F.	Footwear designated by METRO may be purchased with the uniform allowance. Shoes and boots must be plain brown or black leather and, for safety reasons, may not have a heel over two (2) inches high.
G.	All uniform items will be union made, unless mutually agreed between METRO and the UNION.
See MOA page 192

ARTICLE 16:	PART-TIME TRANSIT OPERATORS
See MOA page 194
SECTION 1	- DEFINITION OF EMPLOYEES
A Part-Time Transit Operator shall mean a person employed by METRO on a continuing basis, whose regularly scheduled assignment is a tripper which is guaranteed a minimum of two (2) hours and thirty minutes (2:30) straight-time pay or a dual tripper assignment which is guaranteed a minimum of four hours and forty minutes (4:40) straight-time pay.
SECTION 2	- SPECIAL CONDITIONS
A.	METRO shall offer all new Full-Time Operator positions to qualified Part-Time Operators, provided there are sufficient qualified applicants. Seniority shall determine the order of selection, provided the Part-Time Operator’s most recent twelve-month work record does not exceed METRO’s probationary standards for Part-Time Operators, with the exception that a minor infraction that does not result in discipline as defined in this AGREEMENT will not be used in determining the Operator’s qualification. Part-Time Operators with less than one (1) year of service will be evaluated on a pro-rated probationary standard. A major infraction within the twenty-four (24) months preceding the offer may result in disqualification.

There will be no restriction, except as provided elsewhere in this Article, on the number of Supervisors picking in or out of a particular classification except that the number of nonqualified Supervisors, or Supervisors who have not worked within a classification for ten (10) years, picking into the Transit Instructor, or Communications Coordinator classifications will be limited to two (2) in each classification. No more than one (1) nonqualified Supervisor may pick into the Schedule Maker or Tunnel Controller classifications. However, the supervisor of a work unit may exceed this number at his/ her discretion. For picks due to the opening or closing of a facility, or changes in facility hours, nonqualified Supervisors will not be allowed to pick into the Transit Instructor, Schedule Maker, Tunnel Controller or Communications Coordinator classifications without prior approval of the supervisor of the work unit.
I.	If a sufficient number of qualified Supervisors do not wish to pick into a particular classification, qualified Supervisors will be required to fill the shifts in inverse order of seniority in that classification. When any Supervisor is forced into a classification because of the language in this Paragraph, vacant shifts will be picked by seniority, starting with the forced Supervisor.
J.	If a nonqualified Supervisor picks the Schedule Maker, Transit Instructor, Tunnel Controller, or Communications Coordinator classification and fails to qualify, his/her vacant shift will be filled by the next most senior Supervisor who desires it. The Supervisor who fails to qualify will fill the resulting vacancy if he/she is qualified to do so. If not, this process will be repeated until there is a vacancy in a classification in which he/she is qualified. He/she may repick the classification in which he/she failed to qualify after a period of two (2) years or with the approval of the supervisor of the work unit.
K.	At each pick, Supervisors may volunteer in writing to work over-time. An overtime list will be posted at the pick.
L.	To be considered qualified as a Communications Coordinator or Tunnel Controller, a Supervisor must successfully complete a qualification process consisting of a training period and two (2) weeks of independent performance of the duties of the position. METRO will determine qualification based on job performance. Supervisors who fail to qualify in this classification will not participate in the qualification process for a period of two (2) years without permission of the supervisor of the work unit.
ARTICLE 22: SUPERVISORS
143
M.	Supervisors picking the Service Quality or Training Sections must have a valid CDL at the time of the pick. Licenses and endorsements will be checked at the pick. A joint UNION/METRO support system will be developed to assist Supervisors who are having difficulty obtaining a CDL.
N.	A Supervisor picking the Transit Instructor classification will pick his/ her work location by seniority.
O.	All block assignments shall have ten (10) hours off between consecutive days assignments except that in one (1) instance per week per blocked assignment, there may be a minimum of eight (8) hours off. Each Supervisor who chooses a block assignment shall choose no more than three (3) separate assignments to place in the blocks. Blocks must be picked in a way that does not jeopardize time off or RDO guarantees found elsewhere in this AGREEMENT. Each Supervisor picking block assignments shall select one (1) set of the same posted assignment for two (2) consecutive days, a different set of the same posted assignment for another two (2) consecutive days, and a third posted assignment for a single day. Supervisors’ selection of blocks may require inclusion of a one (1) day floating assignment. Should either party be adversely affected by this Paragraph, METRO and the UNION agree to meet and negotiate necessary changes.
SECTION 5	- MOVE-UPS
A.	When a vacancy occurs during a shake-up in any Supervisor classification, a system-wide seniority move-up will be held within fourteen (14) days if METRO elects to fill the vacant shift. If there is a remaining vacancy in the Tunnel Controller or Communications Coordinator classifications not filled by a move-up, METRO may fill the vacancy with the lowest seniority Supervisor who is qualified in the classification and who is not already assigned to either the Tunnel Controller or Communications Coordinator classifications. Once a Supervisor is forced into the classification because of the language of this Paragraph, shifts will be picked by seniority starting with the forced Supervisor.
B.	Move-ups may not be requested within eight (8) weeks of the effective date of a shake-up.
SECTION 6	- WORK ASSIGNMENTS
A.	All job classifications except for Supervisor-in-Training and Schedule Maker shall have regular shifts and relief shifts. All shifts will be available for pick according to the pick guidelines.

RDOs will not be changed or cancelled without the consent of the affected Supervisor, except in an emergency. The RDOs for Relief Supervisors may change each pay period as a result of the availability of assignments.
ARTICLE 22: SUPERVISORS
145
F.	Prior to the end of each pay period, each Relief Supervisor will pick his/her assignment for the next pay period from the known available assignments and available RDOs, by seniority. Assignments with four (4) or five (5) days of the same shift number available in one (1) pay week (Saturday through Friday) must be picked in their entirety with their RDOs. Each pay week will be picked separately. Assignments selected the first week will not affect selections in the second week, except where minimum time off between shifts and/or fifty-four (54) hours off for RDOs would be compromised. Block assignments may be broken up with shifts selected individually by the Relief Supervisor.
G.	In the event that there are not enough work assignments for all Relief Supervisors to choose from, extra assignments may be created. METRO may change a Relief Supervisor’s extra assignment by up to four (4) hours, provided the change is made at least twelve (12) hours before the start time of the Supervisor’s extra assignment. In the event of an emergency, or with the Relief Supervisor’s consent, a Relief Supervisor’s extra assignment may be changed by more than four (4) hours and with less than twelve (12) hours notice. Relief Supervisors who have picked extra assignments must check in between twelve (12) and eight (8) hours prior to the scheduled start of the extra assignment to find out if there is a change.
H.	Relief Supervisors will be allowed to pick vacation assignments and long-term unavailability assignments for the shake-up, within thirty (30) days of the start of the shake-up. Such picks will be by seniority, and can only be made by Supervisors within the classification. Once the assignment has been made, the Relief Supervisor is obligated to work that assignment unless it is canceled. If the vacation relief or long-term unavailability assignment is canceled the affected Supervisor will revert to his/her relief position.
I.	Scheduled Transit Instructor work will be selected by seniority by qualified Transit Instructors at the worksite. Selected assignments will be worked in their entirety unless a requested change is approved by the unit supervisor. METRO may modify an Instructor’s work assignments to meet training needs.
J.	All Supervisors shall have at least fifty-four (54) hours off for their two (2) consecutive RDOs.
K.	METRO will determine the number of relief shifts in each classification, but the number of relief shifts in each Supervisor classification will not exceed one-third (1/3) of the total of all shifts in that classification; however, not less than three (3) at METRO’s option.
See MOA page 209
146
See MOA page 209
L.	METRO agrees to assign all special assignments, tasks and projects by giving equal consideration to the Supervisor’s education, ability, and experience as it applies to each assignment. Special assignments, tasks and projects will be posted for regular Supervisors to apply for and selection shall be based on the above criteria if the special assignment, task or project is to exist for thirty (30) days or more. If the special assignment, task or project is in excess of ninety (90) days, the special assignment, task or project will be rotated among those Supervisors who applied and who meet the above criteria, provided the rotation does not result in project delay. METRO also recognizes the need for ongoing optional training programs which will allow Supervisors to become better qualified for their present work assignments or for advancement.
M.	Any work that has been historically or traditionally performed by Supervisors will not be performed by any other Employee or individual.
N.	Relief Supervisors picking the Tunnel Controller classification who are qualified as Communications Coordinators may be assigned a Communications Coordinator assignment only after all available Coordinators have been offered the work, including Coordinators available for overtime. Relief Supervisors picking the Communications Coordinator classification, who are qualified as Tunnel Controllers, may be assigned a Tunnel Controller assignment only after all available Tunnel Controllers have been offered the work, including Tunnel Controllers available for overtime.
O.	On a Holiday when METRO operates a Sunday schedule, Base Operations Utility and Planner/Utility shifts will be, at METRO’s sole discretion, either canceled or operated as scheduled. The decision to cancel a shift or operate that shift as scheduled will be specific to each shift and each holiday. If a Utility or Planner/Utility shift is canceled, the regularly scheduled Supervisor for that shift will be off with Holiday pay. If a Utility or Planner/Utility shift is not canceled, the regularly scheduled Supervisor for that shift will have the option of working the shift or taking the day off with Holiday pay. If the regularly scheduled Supervisor chooses not to work that shift, the shift will be filled by the normal Relief Supervisor assignment and overtime assignment processes.
ARTICLE 22: SUPERVISORS
147
P.	When a shift remains unfilled within one (1) hour of the start time of the shift and METRO determines that the shift cannot be canceled, a Supervisor working a different shift with hours overlapping the vacant shift may be required to fill any portion of the designated shift. The hours worked by the Supervisor cannot be changed more than thirty (30) minutes except by mutual agreement. When determining which Supervisor will fill the shift, METRO will consider seniority, Supervisor qualification, business requirements and the Supervisor’s desire to change work assignments.

AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION, LOCAL 587
SUBJECT: CONTRIBUTIONS AND SOLICITATIONS
BACKGROUND:
1.	On November 1, 2002, King County and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 587 (together, the “Parties”) entered into a Memorandum of Agreement that effectively eliminated the language in Article 3, Section 5, Subpart B of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties, due to the decision in what is known as the Averill case.
2.	The parties agreed to negotiate new Contributions and Solicitation language to replace the invalid language that was excised as part of the November 1, 2002 MOA, but were unable to complete this task before agreeing on a successor CBA to take effect on November 1, 2004.
3.	The Parties have now negotiated new contractual language on the subject of Contributions and Solicitations that they believe is consistent with the Averill case.
AGREEMENT:
1. Effective upon the execution of this Memorandum of Agreement, the Parties agree to replace the language that appears in Article 3, Section 5, Subpart B of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the following two paragraphs:
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT

SECTION 12 - PROBATIONARY PERIOD
Each full-time Employee, except as modified by Article 26, Section 2, shall have a six (6) month probationary period commencing with his/her date of employment and/or date of qualification, where required. A Part-Time Transit Operator, an Assigned Rider Information Specialist, an On-Call Customer Assistance Representative, and an On-Call Waterfront Streetcar Conductor who has completed probation and who becomes either a Full-Time Transit Operator, a Rider Information Specialist, a Customer Assistance Representative, or a Waterfront Streetcar Conductor will not serve a second probationary period.

MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT
171
SECTION 14 - VACATION AND AC DONATION
A.	Each calendar year, an Employee may donate up to fifty percent (50%) of his/her available vacation leave and up to one-hundred percent (100%) of his/her AC time, in eight (8) hour increments, to individuals employed by King County. Donated vacation and AC become the property of the recipient. Donated vacation may not be cashed out by the recipient upon retirement. Vacation and AC time may be donated only to an individual employed by King County who has exhausted, or will have exhausted within five (5) calendar days following receipt of the donation request in the Payroll Section, his/her sick leave, vacation and AC time.
B.	A UNION Employee who donates leave to another UNION Employee does so on an hour-for-hour basis, meaning that one (1) hour of donated leave becomes one (1) hour of received leave, regardless of the pay rates of the donor or the recipient.
C.	If a UNION Employee donates leave to a King County employee who is not represented by the UNION, the receipt of the leave will be governed by the rules that normally apply to the recipient of the leave. If a King County employee who is not represented by the UNION donates leave to a UNION Employee, then the UNION Employee’s receipt of the leave is administered by the terms of this Section.

F.	Prior to the end of each pay period, each Relief Supervisor will pick his/her assignment for the next pay period from the known available assignments and available RDOs, by seniority. Assignments with four (4) or five (5) days of the same shift number available in one (1) pay week (Saturday through Friday) must be picked in their entirety with their RDOs. Each pay week will be picked separately. Assignments selected the first week will not affect selections in the second week, except where minimum time off between shifts and/or fifty-four (54) hours off for RDOs would be compromised. Block assignments may be broken up with shifts selected individually by the Relief Supervisor.
G.	In the event that there are not enough work assignments for all Relief Supervisors to choose from, extra assignments may be created. METRO may change a Relief Supervisor’s extra assignment by up to four (4) hours, provided the change is made at least twelve (12) hours before the start time of the Supervisor’s extra assignment. In the event of an emergency, or with the Relief Supervisor’s consent, a Relief Supervisor’s extra assignment may be changed by more than four (4) hours and with less than twelve (12) hours notice. Relief Supervisors who have picked extra assignments must check in between twelve (12) and eight (8) hours prior to the scheduled start of the extra assignment to find out if there is a change.
H—Relief Supervisors will be allowed to pick vacation assignments and long-term unavailability assignments for the shake-up, within thirty (30) days of the start of the shake-up. Such picks will be by seniority, and can only be made by Supervisors within the classification.

N.	M. On a Holiday when METRO operates a Sunday schedule, Base Operations Utility and Planner/Utility shifts will be, at METRO’s sole discretion, either canceled or operated as scheduled. The decision to cancel a shift or operate that shift as scheduled will be specific to each shift and each holiday. If a Utility or Planner/Utility shift is canceled, the regularly scheduled Supervisor for that shift will be off with Holiday pay. If a Utility or Planner/Utility shift is not canceled, the regularly scheduled Supervisor for that shift will have the option of working the shift or taking the day off with Holiday pay. If the regularly scheduled Supervisor chooses not to work that shift, the shift will be filled by the normal Relief Supervisor assignment and overtime assignment processes.
N.—Relief Supervisors picking the Tunnel Controller classification who are qualified as Communications Coordinators may be assigned a Communications Coordinator assignment only after all available Coordinators have been offered the work, including Coordinators available for overtime. Relief Supervisors picking the Communications Coordinator classification, who are qualified as Tunnel Controllers, may be assigned a Tunnel Controller assignment only after all available Tunnel Controllers have been offered the work, including Tunnel Controllers available for overtime.
MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT

Volunteers, in seniority order, will be selected for the training. If there are not enough volunteers to fill designated training requirements, Supervisors may be required to qualifytrain. If a Supervisor is required to qualify train as a Communications Coordinator, he/she will be selected in inverse seniority order from Supervisors who have four (4) or more years of seniority, calculated from the date of appointment as an SIT, and who have not had a previous opportunity to qualify train as a Communications Coordinator. If a Supervisor is required to qualify as a Transit Instructor, he/she will be selected in inverse seniority order from Supervisors who have had two (2) or more years of seniority, calculated from the date of appointment as an SIT and who have not had a previous opportunity to qualify as a Transit Instructor.
