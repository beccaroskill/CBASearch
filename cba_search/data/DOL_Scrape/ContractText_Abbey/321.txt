ARTICLE THREE JOB CLASSIFICATIONS AND WAGE RATES
Job Classifications and Wage Rate Schedules
Section 1. The job descriptions, job evaluations, job evaluation plan, rate ranges and the Glossary of Terms used for the job descriptions agreed upon between the parties and made a part of this Agreement shall remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement, except as new occupations or job classifications may be added under the provisions of Section 2 below.
New Job Classifications
Section 2, It is recognized that changing conditions and circumstances may require the establishment of new occupations or job classifications within the collective bargaining unit heretofore defined because of the introduction of new products, changes in equipment, or tooling, or in methods of manufacturing or materials processed. Under such circumstances, the Company and Union shall negotiate the descriptions, evaluations and appropriate rate ranges for such new job classifications. Failing to agree, the Union shall have the right to file a grievance general in character over any alleged improper description, evaluation, or rate range of such
io
job classification. Any change in description, evaluation, or rate range determined as a result of the grievance procedure shall be retroactive to the date of filing of such grievance. If the Union does not file a grievance within thirty days after the failure of the parties to agree, the description, evaluation and rate range established by the Company shall remain in effect.
Job Classification
Section 3-A. The occupational summary in each of the "A" job descriptions shall be construed to be a brief description of the occupation. Such occupational summary is descriptive of the occupation as a whole and is intended to distinguish that occupation from other occupations. Each occupation is, in turn divided into one or more classifications designated by letters "A", "B", or "C". The statement of the operations, i.e., work requirements in each job description, provides the basis for determining the classification within the occupation when interpreted and applied as hereinafter provided:
(1)	In determining the proper job classification for an individual employee under the job descriptions and wage rates, the determination of whether the employee is performing the work requirements or work operations set forth in the job description

shall be the controlling consideration. Each job description of a classification is to be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a specification of job standards which are definitive of or illustrative of the job requirements. Assignment of job classifications shall be made with due regard to work assigned to an employee with the objective of attaining, as far as possible, equal pay for equal work.
(2)	Where work assignments are not adequately nor specifically described, such work assignments shall be appraised and accordingly classified under the most appropriate job description by considering the relative degree of complexity or level of difficulty of said work assignments in comparison with,
(a)	Those assignments described in the Work Performed section of the job descriptions;
(b)	The knowledge and ability required as expressed in the job descriptions.
(3)	Unless otherwise expressly mentioned in the job description, an employee shall not | be required to perform all of the work operations described in a job description in m order to be eligible for classification H thereunder. However, an employee shall
12
not be eligible for classification under a job description by reason of performing an isolated or singular duty described in a job description.
(4)	The normal duties of any employee may include some of the work of related jobs when required.
(5)	An employee is required to perform the work operations, duties and other distinguishing characteristics described in a job description under that degree or amount of supervision or instruction which is considered usual and normal in order to qualify for classification thereunder.
Section 3-B. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, an employee who subsequently is regularly assigned to an occupation carrying a lower evaluation may receive no more than the maximum rate established for that job classification during the period of such assignment.
Section 3-C. An employee will not refuse to perform work assigned to him/her for the reason that such work is not specifically described in the job description of the employee's job classification.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN WRITING JOB DESCRIPTIONS
The following terms and words are given definition and meaning to indicate the common and consistent interpretation to be placed in them by all persons using the descriptions:
1. ADAPT TOOLING
Means to modify, alter or change furnished tooling to fit it for a specific need without altering its basic design.
2. AND/OR
Means that the employee is to perform one or the other of the work operations or may perform both.
3. ANGLE, COMPOUND
Means the angle between the two noncoinciding sides of two oblique angles which are in different planes and have a vertex and one side in common. Making
198
a compound angle usually presents a coordinating tolerance problem since it results from the holding within tolerances of two adjoining component angles. After the compound angle is formed, its measurement with protractor square or sine bar is exactly the same as for any other angle and no more difficult.
AS DIRECTED
Means that determinations connected with the work operation described are usually and normally made by others and are given or made known to the worker directly concerned with the assignment. Use of this term does not mean that the details and determinations involved need be repeated each time an identical or very similar work assignment is made or work operation performed.
AS REQUIRED
Means that the work operation function or job duty is usually and normally performed after or as direct result of an order, work assignment or request from recognized supervisory personnel and/or has been used in some instances to mean an occasional or incidental job requirement. The intended meaning is evident from the level of difficulty defined

different lengths all of which are in the I" same plane. The surface of a cone or section thereon, a typical airfoil surface, the curved edge of a profiled plate and the ® curved layout line guiding the making of a router block are examples. Contour H| surfaces composed of sections of cylinders and edges whose profile is a section of a circle are excluded since the radii are the same length.
19.	CONTOUR, COMPLEX	|
Means a curved surface of unusual intricacy and variability.
20.	CONTOUR, COMPOUND
Means a curved surface having radii of different lengths which lie in nonparallel ■■ planes. Compound contours are typical of stretch press and drop hammer dies. The surface of a sphere or section thereon ■■ would be a regular compound contour and was meant to be excluded.
21.	CONTOUR, REVERSE	■
Means a compound contour that reverses its curvature so that it has both concave
and convex portions.
204
22.	CONTOUR, SEVERE
Means a contour which necessitates a high degree of care or skill to properly perform the work operations referred to as compared to the same work operations on flat or slightly contoured surfaces.
23.	COORDINATED TOLERANCES, COORDINATED DIMENSIONS
. These expressions are used only when exacting tolerances are implied, i.e., exacting tolerances are to be associated always with "coordinated dimensions" "coordinated tolerances" unless modified expressly. It should be understood that the mere location of a point by two or more reference dimensions may not in itself mean that the dimensions'themselves are coordinated. An example of coordinated dimensions is shown in the following: The precision dimensions between two holes must be held while at the same time the precision dimensions locating each of the holes must also be held with respect to another reference point or lines.
24.	DRAW, DEEP

35.	LAYOUT (n), LAYS OUT (v)
Means the actual marking of locating and/or reference points and lines on material, parts, tool or assembly worked on. Layout in itself does not imply a high level of difficulty or skill since it can be a simple work operation such as measuring a length on a piece of lumber and marking a line or point at which it is to be sawed, marking lines on pavement with a chalk line preparatory to painting, or scribing around a furnished template laid on flat stock. On the other hand, layout can be a difficult work operation which requires much skill, knowledge and experience to make the necessary computations, part setup, precise measurements and marking, and interpretation of complex blueprints such as on a complex die or casting requiring layout to establish locations for coordinated hole patterns, compound angles and/or irregular contours.

44.	REPAIR
Means to restore a part or assembly to its original state or utility after it has been damaged by accident or by wear. It does not have the same meaning as "Rework."
45.	REWORK
Means to undo and then do over work previously accomplished by the same or by other workers in order to correct errors or make it conform to specifications. Rework can be simple or difficult according to its nature and variety; therefore, the level of difficulty intended is to be determined from the composite job description. (See Repair.)
46.	SETUP (n), SETS UP (v)
Is a broad term which becomes specific only according to its usage and application to machines and/or operations concerned. It includes the various necessary physical work operations or steps (other than layout) which must be accomplished before actual fabrication can proceed. Setup of a
212
machine might include securing material to machine bed at the proper angle for cutting, selecting, aligning and setting cutting tool, setting speeds and feeds, adjusting coolant flow, or perhaps oiling the machine itself. In most assembly operations, setup (e.g., positioning parts, obtaining parts) is so closely intermingled with fitting and joining together that setup is not customarily designated as such, this is generally true of operations where machine operation is not the primary job factor.
47.	SHOP PRACTICE
Means the generally accepted method of performing a basic, common or usual operation under specified conditions. It covers the knowledge which is common to the classification itself. Besides knowledge and ability to use required handtools and equipment, it includes knowledge of general safety practices, good housekeeping and care of equipment.
