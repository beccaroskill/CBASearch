(f)	Apprentices shall be hired and transferred in accordance with the Apprenticeship provisions of this Agreement.
(g)	If during the term of this Agreement, the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, shall be further amended to so permit, or the decision of a court of competent jurisdiction so permits, then the restrictive provisions of this Article IV, by which the Union may be required to refer nonmembers to employment, shall be immediately ineffective.
(h)	The Union agrees that it shall be the sole administrator of the hiring hall arrangement and shall not be considered to act as the agent of the Employer, and thereby, the Union assumes responsibility for any violations of the law committed by it in connection with its administration of the hiring hall arrangement.

Section 3.	The Union hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Employer from and against any and all costs, expenses (including attorneys’ fees), and damages that may be incurred in connection with any action, suit, claim or proceed
ing that may be brought against the Employer which arises from or relates to obligations or responsibilities set forth in Article IV, Section 2.
Section 4.	No Employee working in an architectural shop or dry job will be replaced by an Employee who was unable to work due to inclement weather.

ARTICLE V
Hours of Work
Section 1.	The regular working day shall consist of eight (8) hours labor in the shop or on the job site starting between seven (7:00) A.M. and eight (8:00) A.M. and ending between three-thirty (3:30) P.M. and four-thirty (4:30) PM., with % hour for lunch period. The regular working week shall consist of five (5) consecutive eight (8) hour day’s labor in the shop or on the job site, beginning with Monday and ending with Friday of each week. All full time or part time labor performed during the hours specified herein shall be recognized as regular time and paid for at not less than the regular hourly rates specified in this Agreement.
(a)	Exception may also be made to Section 1 of this Article V in that Journeypersons and Apprentices may work from six (6:00) A.M. to two-thirty (2:30) P.M. with a one-half (1/z) hour lunch period, with the sole permission of the Union.
(b)	The Employer agrees that when there are more than four hundred (400) Building Trades personnel on a particular job site, the Union shall have the right to stagger work hours with other trades, between the hours of seven (7:00) A.M. and four-thirty (4:30) P.M. in order to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the Sheet Metal Workers on said job site.
Section 2.

All tools shall be put away, in a place provided by the Employer, during the established working period.
Section 3.	It shall be an established policy that when work falls off and reaches a point considered to be of serious importance, the Employer will negotiate with the Union’s representative to divide work among all Employees to the extent reasonably possible, by establishment of “week on/week off”, a shorter work day or week with due consideration of conditions existing at the time.
ARTICLE VI
Overtime
Section 1.	Except as provided in this Article VI, Section 2, and Article VII, Section 1(a) and Article VIII of this Agreement, it is agreed that all work performed outside of regular working hours during the regular work week and on holidays shall be performed only upon notification by the Employer to the Union, in advance of scheduling such work.

The Employer will include as many Journeypersons as possible from the list of unemployed on scheduled overtime projects lasting eight (8) hours or more provided these Journeypersons possess the required skills to perform the work.
It is further understood that members who are out of unemployment compensation benefits will be given priority to these jobs.
(b)	On an Architectural job only, Journeypersons and Apprentices may work on Saturday, at straight time, as a makeup-day. This make-up-day shall be by mutual consent of the employer and the union and shall be implemented in the event of inclement weather which causes the employee to work less than forty (40) hours in that same week. When Saturday is used as a make-up-day this will not affect the employee’s eligibility to collect S.U.B. Fund benefits.
(c)	Apprentices shall be permitted to work overtime pursuant to the Journeyperson: Apprentice ratio contained in Article XIII, Section 3 of this Agreement.
(d)	It shall not be a violation of this Agreement nor a cause for discharge if any Employee declines to work overtime.

However, Sundays and holidays will be double time and when work is performed on Election Day, the holiday pay shall be paid in addition thereto.
(a)	“In-Plant Industrial Maintenance” shall be defined as any work performed of a renovation, repair, or maintenance character within the limits of a plant property, or other locations related directly thereto.

(c)	The word “renovation”, as used within the terms of this Agreement and in connection with in-plant maintenance, is work required to improve and/or restore by replacement or by revamping parts of existing facilities to efficient operating conditions.
(d)	The term “existing facilities”, used within the terms of this Agreement is limited to a constructed facility already completed and shall not apply to any new facility to be constructed in the future, even though the new facility is constructed on the same property or premises.
(e)	The Employer will notify the Union prior to implementing the In-Plant Maintenance provisions outlined in this Article VI, Section 2 of this Agreement.

(a)	The site must be an existing completed building where the current operations of the owner or tenant may be interfered with if the work is performed during the regular working hours except, that by mutual agreement between Employer and the Union, the shift work provisions of this Article VIII may be applied to work on a new building being constructed or existing facilities if conditions or circumstances make it advantageous to both parties. Whenever this exception is agreed upon, said work shall be distributed among all Employees on site as evenly as is reasonably possible.
(b)	Mutual agreement has been reached by both parties hereto as to what shift hours may be worked.
(c)	Each location where shifts are established shall be considered as entirely new and separate from any other shift job and all conditions herein established for shift work shall apply separately.
(d)	Employees working on night shifts shall neither be permitted nor required to perform any other work during the period beginning at eight (8:00) A.M. previous to a night shift and ending at the beginning of the shift on the following night.
(e)	When only one night shift (second shift) is established in either the shop or in the field by Sheet Metal Workers or any other trade, such second shift shall work eight (8) hours and be paid a shift premium of fifteen percent (15%) above the Journeypersons’ hourly wage rate. When two night shifts are established in either the shop or in the field by Sheet Metal Workers or another trade (second and third shifts), the second shift shall work seven and one-half (7%) hours and be paid for eight (8) hours plus a shift premium of fifteen percent (15%) above the Journeypersons’ hourly wage rate. The third shift shall work seven (7) hours and be paid for eight (8) hours plus
-5-
a shift premium of fifteen percent (15%) above the Journeypersons’ hourly wage rate.
In order to equalize shift compensation between the shop and field, the Employer agrees that when two night shifts (second and third shifts) have been established in the field, and only one night shift is established in the shop (second shift), the second shift in the shop shall work seven and one-half (7%) hours and be paid for eight (8) hours plus a shift premium of fifteen percent (15%) above the Journeypersons’ hourly wage rate. This same equalization shall apply should two night shifts be established in the shop and a single night shift is established in the field.
(f)	Work performed by night shift Employees outside the established shift hours shall be paid for at time and one half (1%) for the first two (2) hours and at double the regular rate of wages thereafter. All work performed by night shift Employees on Saturday will be paid at time and one-half (1%) for the first ten (10) hours and at double the regular wage rate thereafter.
(g)	Time and one half (1%) shall be paid for all night shift work performed between the hours of two-thirty (2:30) A.M. Saturday and midnight Saturday. Double time shall be paid for all night shift work performed between midnight Saturday and the beginning of the first shift on Monday. Double time shall be paid for all night shift work performed between midnight before a holiday and the beginning of the first shift on the day following the holiday.
(h)	When night shifts are established each Employee assigned to such work shall be paid not less than wages equal to five (5) nights of shift wages whether or not they work the five (5) nights or they shall be paid double time for the shift hours worked whichever is the lesser, unless the Employee is unwilling or unable to work the five (5) nights, in which event, they shall be paid only the shift rate for the shift hours worked.
(i)	The President/Business Manager of the Union at his/her sole may discretion reduce the shift premium to ten percent (10%) or five percent (5%) above the scale and waive the mandatory five (5) consecutive days for a shift in order to gain employment for members of the Union.
(j)	As practiced by Local #19 Signatory Employers, all shift work will have at least one sheet metal worker from Local #19.

The bond and/or irrevocable letter of credit shall be issued by a reputable bonding company and/or bank and shall be acceptable to the Union and the Trustees of the Funds, and shall be at all times in an amount meeting the requirements of the following schedule or formula:
If the total of two (2) weeks of gross wages (before vacation) plus nine (9) weeks of contributions and payments due the Funds (excluding payments to the Vacation Fund) (hereinafter referred to as the “Bond Amount”) equals or is less than $10,000 the employer’s bond shall be for $10,000, Each Employer’s bond shall increase in increments of $10,000 as its Bonded Amount exceeds the prior amount of the Employer’s bond by One Dollar ($1.00). For example if the Bonded Amount becomes $10,001 the bond shall be for $20,000, when the Bonded Amount becomes $20,001 the bond shall be for $30,000, and so forth.
(a) Effective July 1, 2009 the maximum bond required shall be $440,000
Section 16.	Bonds shall be provided for a period of not less than one (1) year and may be renewable or continuous until revision of the amount necessary to satisfy the herein schedule or formula as required, at which time, the new bond shall be furnished for a like period.
The amount of the bond required shall be determined by the application of the above formula to annual payments made or due for the annual period ending with April 30th of any year. If a change in the amount is required, the change shall take place immediately.
If the Employer has no record of previous employment or contributions to the Funds and is required to furnish a bond, it shall be for not less than $5,000.00 or an amount established by the Union to adequately cover payments expected or estimated to be required in view of anticipated employment. Such estimates
shall be related to the amount of money expected to be due for wages and contributions on a basis of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) per Employee and the resulting figure shall be related to the bond coverage formula as described in Section 16 of this Article XII.
Section 17.	Bonds shall be written to provide for payments covering wages and the several Funds in the following order. When money remains after satisfying the requirements of the first, then the balance shall be allocated to each of the others in the order shown, to the extent possible:
First, the full amount due for wages. (wages include credit union deductions, work assessments and PAL check-off).

Seventh, the full amount due to the Apprenticeship and Training Fund.
Eighth, the full amount due to the Industry Fund.
Ninth, the full amount due to the International Training Institute for the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Industry.
Section 18.	The posting of the bond with the Funds shall not exempt the Employer from liability to make reports and full payment of amount due all Funds, if the bond does not meet full amounts due or the bonding company does not pay, or, if the Union and the Trustees are required to sue the bonding company. Nor does it exempt the Employer from meeting and complying with all other requirements and provisions of this Agreement relating to the Funds and Wages.
Section 19.	The Employer agrees to have the required bonds, in duplicate, in the possession of the Funds within thirty (30) days immediately following the effective date of this Agreement.
Should the Employer fail to produce the required bond within the prescribed time period, said Employer shall be required to make all reports and/or payments or contributions on a weekly basis. These reports and/or payments or contributions shall be paid on the same day that wages are paid and shall cover the same payroll period. Should the Employer fail to meet the requirements of this Section, the Union may resort to the remedies set forth in this Article XII, Section 14 (e) on the first working day following the day on which all reports and/or payments or contributions are due.
(a)	Employers who must report on a weekly basis and fail to mail the benefits on the day that wages are paid, shall be assessed liquidated damages at the rate of one and one quarter percent (1%%) of the gross amount due each Fund for each week thereafter during which they remain unpaid.
(b)	Where Employers are required to pay weekly because they do not have a bond, and have not maintained 12 consecutive months of on time fringe benefit payments, there shall be an administrative fee charged not greater than 0.0025 (one quarter of one percent) of the value of the fringe benefit contributions due weekly as determined by the Trustees. The fee is to be paid with the weekly contributions until they maintain 12 consecutive months of on time payments. New Employers will be considered on time.

(a)	Deposit with each Fund cash or certified check in an amount ranging from a minimum of five hundred dollars ($500.00) to three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) to guarantee reports and payments due the Funds and Wages. The actual amounts to be deposited shall be those required by the Union, and shall be related to the number of Employees employed and the anticipated length of the job. Upon completion of the job, should the Employer fail to meet the requirements and provisions of this Agreement, the amount due and unpaid shall be deducted and kept by the Funds and the balance, if any, shall be returned to the depositor or, if the Employer has complied in full, the amount deposited shall be returned, upon request, at the earliest opportunity, following the satisfaction of all requirements.
(b)	Make payments or contributions to all Funds each time wages are paid to Employees on the job, but separate from wages, in a manner prescribed by the Union.
Section 21.	The Employer agrees that, when performing work in the territory of other Local Unions of the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association, the terms, conditions, and requirements of the then existing Agreement between the appropriate Local Union and Employers in that area related to Funds and as established therein shall be complied with and that failure to do so will permit the Union to take whatever action it deems appropriate to assure compliance.
Section 22.	The Employer agrees that the Trustees of any and all Funds herein provided for may, at their discretion, enter into reciprocal agreements with other similar Funds, in any manner they may determine to protect and advance the interest of Employees covered by these or other Funds of similar nature.

Apprentice & Training
Section 1.	All duly qualified Apprentices shall be under the supervision and control of a Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) composed of ten (10) members, five (5) of whom shall be selected by the Employer and five (5) by the Union. Said JATC shall formulate and make operative such rules and regulations as they deem necessary and which do not conflict with the specific terms of this Agreement, to govern eligibility, registration, education, transfer, wages, hours, working conditions of duly qualified Apprentices and the operation of an adequate Apprentice system to meet the needs and requirements of the trade. Said rules and regulations, when formulated and adopted by the parties hereto, shall be recognized as a part of this Agreement.
Section 2.	The JATC designated herein, shall serve for the life of this Agreement, except that vacancies in said JATC, caused by resignation or otherwise, may be filled by either party and it is hereby mutually agreed by both parties that they will individually and collectively cooperate to the extent that duly qualified and Registered Apprentices be given every opportunity to secure proper technical and practical education and experience in the trade, under the supervision of the JATC.
Section 3.	It is hereby agreed that the Employer shall be entitled to apply to the JATC on the basis of one (1) Apprentice for each four (4) Journeypersons regularly employed throughout the year, not to exceed fifteen (15) Apprentices, and said ratio shall govern the consideration and granting of Apprentices by the Committee; however, the Employer may petition the JATC for authorization to exceed the fifteen (15) Apprentice limit and the Committee shall consider such requests on an individual company basis and may in their judgment agree to permit a firm to exceed the limit
Section 4.	All applicants for Apprenticeship shall have attained a minimum age of eighteen (18) years. Each Registered Apprentice shall serve an Apprenticeship of four (4) years and such Apprentices shall not be put in charge of work on any job and shall work under the supervision of a Journeyperson until their Apprenticeship term has been completed and they have qualified as Journeypersons.

No contributions shall be made to the section 401(h) component of the Pension Fund on
behalf of Apprentices and the Annuity Fund contributions for all Apprentices shall be frozen for the term of this Agreement at $2.00 per hour. This Agreement is made with the understanding that, except for previously grandfathered Philadelphia Apprentices and Limited Apprentices, service covered by a reduced pension contribution rate as compared to the Philadelphia area commercial journeyperson’s contribution rate will earn a pro rata share of a journeyperson’s pension credit, determined by multiplying the Philadelphia area commercial journeyperson’s pension credit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the reduced contribution rate and the denominator of which is the Philadelphia area journeyperson’s contribution rate.
Section 6.	Registered Apprentices shall be rotated from one kind of work to another in the shop or on the job site, so that training shall be fully integrated. The Employer agrees that failure to comply with proper application of the Apprentice Standards, if such is so decided by the JATC, shall be sufficient cause for removal of any or all Apprentices in their employ.
Section 7.	The parties hereto agree that the Employer shall pay directly, each Apprentice in their employ, for time spent in attendance at day-time school in the same manner as if they were employed at work.
(a)	The Employer shall be eligible for reimbursement, from the Industry Fund of the Sheet Metal Contractors Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity, of the direct payroll expenses up to the limits defined by the Trustees of the Industry Fund, incurred for the Apprentice’s attendance at daytime school provided:
1.	The Employer makes application for reimbursement using the forms provided by the Industry Fund within thirty (30) days of the school day to be reimbursed;
2.	The Employer is obligated to contribute to the Industry Fund of the Sheet Metal Contractors Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity for all hours worked by each Employee covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement and is not delinquent in their payments to this Fund;

Section 11.	The parties agree that an Apprentice, prior to entering into his/her third year, shall be given a mandatory unpaid leave of absence to participate in programs sponsored by the Union.
Section 12.	It is the understanding of the parties to this Agreement that the funds contributed by signatory Employers to the International Training Institute for the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Industry (ITI) and any Local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Fund (local JATF) will not be used to train Apprentices or Journeypersons who will be employed by Employers in the Sheet Metal Industry not signatory to a Collective Bargaining Agreement providing for contributions to the ITI and a local JATF. Therefore, the Trustees of the ITI and local JATF shall adopt and implement a Scholarship Loan Agreement Program which will require Apprentices and Journeypersons employed by signatory Employers to repay the cost of training either by service following training within the Union sector of the industry or by actual repayment of the cost of training if the individual goes to work for a non-signatory Employer in the Sheet Metal Industry. The cost of training shall include the reasonable value of all ITI and local JATF materials, facilities and personnel utilized in training.
