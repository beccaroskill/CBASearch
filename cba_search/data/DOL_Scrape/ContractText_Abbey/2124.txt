APPENDIX B MANNING AGREEMENT
The parties recognise that existing narrow job descriptions necessarily limit the scope of employees' work activity; the need to revise manning procedures to permit more flexibility in job assignment is evident. To this end, the parties agree that job combinations will occur and employee utilisation will be broadened. In order to realize this expansion of work function and overlapping of assignments, the parties will address jobs performed by CP Industries employees. As those employees terminate (defined as quit, retire, die),Functions may be combined with other Jobs as determined by management, however the company will make this decision within 5 months from the time of termination. Input from the Union representatives with respect to the most efficient manning arrangement will be sought prior to a pending combination. It is understood that the ability to combine work functions is at the discretion of Management; however, should Management decide that a replacement in kind is needed, those other employees on layoff who still retain recall rights will be considered prior to seeking new hires.
It is agreed and understood that for a given week. Management will develop a schedule, placing recognized incumbents on a job if it is reasonably anticipated that performance of such work functions will be required. It is expected that these identified employees will work on scheduled jobs during the week as well as be available for reassignment as the need exists. This mobility Is not subject to question during the week and only an appropriate challenge may be lodged alleging a continuing violation or abuse of the intent of the system after initial discussion by the parties to air the concern.
Management will, in the course of reviewing anticipated work and related manning, consider the respective seniority status of a department's employees: however, it is recognized that where junior-in-service employees bold incumbency on certain primary, critical jobs, those individuals may work a portion of the time on the scheduled job and then may be reassigned for the duration while senior employees are on layoff.
The parties agree that for purposes stated herein, there shall exist three (3) departments: (A) Production Engineering Planning, (B) Accounting, and (C) Maintenance. The Production Engineering Planning Department will still retain two (2) separate units. The Company's intention is to reassign within the department as the needs dictate, avoiding the crossing of departmental lines. There could be exceptions, however, depending on the circumstances; e.g. should a given work situation arise during a week where a need exists to get a particular job done and available departmental employees are being fully utilized, the options may be several: (1) A Management decision to postpone the job; (2) Use overtime to complete within the week; (3) With the approval of the chairman or Secretary of the Grievance Committee, use employees from other departments; (4) Some combination of above.
