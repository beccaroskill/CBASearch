WORKING CONDITIONS
14.	Employees shall be free to select the Contractor for whom they desire to work, and the Contractor shall be free to select the employees whom he desires to employ, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
15.	Employees are to be paid the wages applicable to the work performed without any discount and in return the Contractors are to receive a fair and honest day’s work.
16.	(a) The Contractor is to be the sole judge as to the satisfactory performance of work by an employee and may discharge for just cause any employee whose work is unsatisfactory or who fails to observe the safety precautions, substance abuse policies, or other rules and regulations prescribed by the Contractor for health, safety and protection of his employees. However, no employee shall be discharged for defending the rights of any employee under the terms of this Agreement.

DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE PROGRAMS
(c)	The parties recognize the problems that drug and alcohol abuse have created within the construction industry and agree on implementing drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs, that will work toward maintaining a safe workplace, free of drugs and alcohol.

Within two (2) weeks of reporting to the job site, each new employee may be scheduled for a drug test. Employees using a prescription drug which may impair mental or motor function shall inform their supervisor in writing of such drug use.
Employees’ involvement with drugs and alcohol can adversly affect job performance and employee morale. In the construction industry the consequences of drug or alcohol use or influence while on the job site can be disastrous. The Contractor and Union, therefore, agree to the following policy to insure all employees of a safe and efficient job site free from the effect of drug and alcohol use or influence.
All job sites or work areas are subject to massive drug screening or random drug screening. Any employee who is involved in an on-the-job accident resulting in injury to a person or property, or whose observed behavior raises a reasonable suspicion of probable cause of illegal drug or alcohol use impairment while on the job site, may be required as a condition of continued employment to submit to a test for alcohol and/or illegal drug use which impaired the employee’s ability to safely perform his/her duties on the job site. Such tests usually involve a sampling of the employee’s blood, urine, or breath. Any employee who is asked to submit to such a test will be required to sign a consent form. If an employee who is asked to submit to a test refuses to do so, or refuses to sign the necessary consent form, that employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
All testing will be done by a reliable, established laboratory. If this initial test screen result indicates positive findings, further testing of the same sample must be done to confirm the original findings before the laboratory can report positive findings. The confirmation test will be conducted by an independent, accredited National Institute of Drug Abuse or College of American Pathology Laboratory and utilize the more scientific Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry examination (GC/MS). The results of all tests will be kept confidential between the employee and the Contractor.
10
heavy-highway2010.indd 10
7/29/10 8:57 AM
The employee shall be paid his/her regular hourly wages and fringes for the time required for drug testing provided results are negative.
If the GC/MS test results are positive, the employee may be granted a leave of absence for the purpose of drug and alcohol rehabilitation. If the employee is eligible, such rehabilitation programs are covered under the Laborers’ International Union of North America Health and Welfare Program providing the employee confines himself/herself to a twenty-four (24) hour licensed rehabilitation medical facility.
The employee shall be removed from the Contractor’s job site. Upon presentation of certification of the employee’s successful completion of the drug/alcohol rehabilitation program, the employee may be restored to his/her original job with the Contractor.
If the employee was reinstated he/she shall for the next succeeding twelve (12) month period, present to the company representative monthly certification of negative drug/alcohol test results; failure to do so will result in denying the employee the right to maintain his/her availability to be sent to a job site or if working, to be removed from work.
OSHA AND SAFETY
(d)	In accordance with applicable OSHA safety & health standards requiring safety training and education, the Union shall make available to each Union member the 16-hour STP “Safety Training Program” certified by the U.S. Department of Labor in its training and apprenticeship program. The Contractors shall by company policy encourage or require the employee to obtain all training available.

Verification or valid, updated training must be presented to the employer upon dispatch, hire, or request. The Union and Contractors are in mutual agreement that should application of this provision cause an unreasonable financial or scheduling burden on the Laborers' Training & Apprenticeship Center, as determined by the Director, the provision shall be temporarily waived.
17.	The number of men to be employed is at the sole discretion of the Contractor, and the fact that certain classifications and rates are established does not mean that the Contractor must employ employees for any one or all such classifications or to man any particular piece of equipment that happens to be on the worksite, unless the Contractor has need for such employee. However, this does not relieve the Contractors from the responsibility of properly manning any piece of equipment that is placed in operation.

The Laborers’ District Council of Ohio may inform the OCA-LRD that they consider an OCA-LRD member delinquent in Fringe Benefit contributions, initiation fees, dues, legal assessments and/ or deductions and therefore subject to the bond requirement. If the OCA-LRD questions that said OCA-LRD member is delinquent for payment of fringes, the two parties shall meet and resolve the problems by checking payments made to the Fringe Benefit programs.
The amount of bond required for a Contractor will be determined by the number of Laborers employed and the following formula:

GRIEVANCES AND ARBITRATION
60.	The parties agree that all differences that arise during the life of this Agreement between any Contractor and any Union or members thereof, except as otherwise limited herein, are to be settled in accordance with the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth.
All employee or Union initiated grievances must be reported to the Local Union office as soon as possible. Grievances must be filed in writing. Members who fail to report grievances to the Business Manager within fourteen (14) days shall forfeit their grievance. The Business Manager will report the grievance to the Contractor within three (3) days after receipt. All Contractor initiated grievances must be reported to the Local Union office within fourteen (14) days after occurrence. Failure of the employee or the Contractor to meet the time limits set forth above shall cause the grievance to be deemed waived and not subject to arbitration.
61.	In the event that differences arise during the term of this Agreement concerning its interpretation or application, a prompt effort shall be made to settle employee or Union initiated differences at the site of the dispute, first between the Contractor and the Local Union and its members involved in the dispute. In case of the Contractor initiated grievance, the effort to settle such difference shall be made between the Contractor and the Local Union Business Manager. In the case of either an employee, Union or Contractor grievance, the Contractor and the Union have three (3) days to settle the difference.
62.	In the event that the first step of the above process does not result in settlement after the first meeting between the Local Union and the Contractor, either party may then refer the matter in writing within five (5) days to the Business Manager of the Laborers’ District Council and to the representative of the Ohio Contractors Association, Labor Relations Division. They shall meet within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice to consider and resolve the dispute.

In the event that the parties named in Step 2 are unable to settle the dispute within the ten (10) days, either party may refer the matter to arbitration by written notice to the other party within ten (10) days thereafter, for final and binding decision by a single qualified arbitrator. The Union and Contractor shall have five (5) days to agree upon an arbitrator to hear and determine the dispute, failing which it shall be submitted by either party, by written request to the American Arbitration Association for the submission of a list of names of seven (7) qualified arbitrators from which list the parties will select a sole, qualified arbitrator. After receipt of such a list the parties shall within five (5) days meet to select the arbitrator, and proceeding by lot alternately strike names from the list of arbitrators until one (1) name remains. The name of the person last remaining shall be deemed acceptable to both parties and shall serve as the arbitrator to hear and decide the dispute which has been certified to arbitration. Each party shall have the right to exercise once within the five (5) day period in the case of each dispute, to reject the list submitted, in which event an immediate request will be made for another list of seven (7) arbitrators.
64.	The arbitrator selected in the manner above indicated shall not add to, subtract from or modify any of the terms of the Agreement. He shall not change existing wage rates established in this Agreement. His authority is limited to matters of dispute, differences, disagreement or controversy arising concerning the interpretation, construction or application of the terms of this Agreement. Any decision of an arbitrator involving an award for back pay shall be limited to the amount of wages that the employee involved should properly have earned in the employ of the Contractor, less any wage received for employment accepted in place of his former employment, and unemployment compensation benefits received. The arbitrator shall decide the grievance or dispute in writing and deliver a copy to each party within thirty (30) days from the close of the arbitration hearing. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and of any technical assistance required by the arbitrator and all costs of the hearing shall be divided equally between the parties.

EXHIBIT C
USE OF APPRENTICES
1.	The OCA-LRD and the Union amend the Laborers’ Training and Upgrading Fund Trust to provide for Apprenticeship training. The amended Fund is now known as the Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship Trust Fund which will establish a program for the training and utilization of registered apprentices on construction sites. The program and contributions to it shall be in compliance with the Labor Management Relations Act and the federal and state Management requirements for approved apprenticeship programs. The trust agreement provisions and the rules for eligibility and regulations created by the Trustees overseeing the Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship Committee are incorporated by reference and will be made available upon request by any contributing Contractor.
2.	The OCA-LRD and the Union shall each appoint or re-appoint four trustees to constitute the Board of Trustees of the Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship Trust Fund. All registered apprentices shall be under the direction and control of the committee.
3.	The Contractor contribution to the amended Fund shall remain unchanged and be in the amount of contribution required for the Laborers’ Training and Upgrading Fund set forth in this Agreement.
4.	The ratio of apprentices to Laborers shall be no less than one competent and qualified Laborer to one apprentice for the first apprentice on the job, and four competent and qualified Laborers to one apprentice thereafter. There shall be no commingling of apprentices onto one or more specific jobsites, as the ratio must be maintained for each project.
5.	Every employee of the Contractor who comes within the scope of the Agreement shall be considered a Laborer unless registered as an apprentice under the Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship fund.
6.	Apprentices shall work under the supervision of competent and qualified workers on the job. Instruction in safety and safe work practices will be part of job instruction in addition to that included in related off-job instruction.
57
heavy-highway2010.indd 57
7/29/10 8:57 AM
7.	Any person entering but failing to maintain and complete his or her apprenticeship, as determined by the JTAC shall not be employed by the Contractor as a journeyworker under this Agreement for the duration of the remaining apprenticeship period.
8.	The amount of wages to be paid the apprentice shall be at a percentage or graduated wage scale of the Laborer for the class of work and work location set forth in the agreement, as follows:
Apprenticeship Hours Accumulated Percent of Wage Scale 0 -	1000....................60	percent
1001 -	2000....................70	percent
2001 -	3000....................80	percent
3001 -	4000....................90	percent
The above percentages are calculated on the base wage rate only. The apprentice shall receive full payment on his or her behalf into the fringe benefit programs at the rate called for in the Agreement. In no instance shall the starting rate be less than the hourly minimum of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
9.	The Ohio Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship Trust Fund shall formulate rules and regulations necessary to administer the apprenticeship program to govern eligibility, registration, and education to meet the needs and requirements of the program and in compliance with federal and state apprentice guidelines. The purpose of the program is to supply apprentices to Contractors signatory to the Agreement and the program will require Apprentices trained under the program to continue in the employ of signatory contractors during and after completion of the program. Any registered apprentice who goes to work for a non-signatory Contractor shall no longer be eligible for the program and shall repay to the Ohio Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship Fund the cost of any schooling or training in an amount established by the Fund. The cost of training shall be repaid to the Fund if the individual who completes apprentice training goes to work for a non-signatory Contractor within the number of years following completion of the training as established by the Ohio Laborers’ Training and Apprenticeship Trust Fund.
58
heavy-highway2010.indd 58
7/29/10 8:57 AM
10.	A signatory Contractor to this Agreement may refer applicants to the Ohio Laborers’ Training and ApprenticeshipTrust Fund for proposed inclusion in the apprentice program provided it has no registered apprentice on layoff. Unless and until accepted, the referred applicant shall not be eligible for an apprentice rate.
11.	A signatory Contractor may request the local union having jurisdiction over the work area covered by the specific project for apprentice referrals who, if referred, will serve as the employee hired through the local union.
12.	For each employee whose Local Union has established or participates in a local joint apprenticeship fund, the Contractor, upon written notification from the Local Union, shall divert five cents ($.05) per hour for each hour worked from each employee’s wages and transmit said monies to the local joint apprenticeship committee. Contributions shall be due and owing on the 15th of the month following the month for which contributions are made. Upon written notice to the Contractor, the local joint apprenticeship fund, or its agent, shall be authorized to conduct a payroll audit to determine compliance with the provision.
