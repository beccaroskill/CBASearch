The District requires that an employee's request for an unpaid family care and medical leave for the purpose of caring for a child, spouse or parent who has a serious health condition or for the employee's own serious health condition be supported by a written certification issued by the health care provider of the family member requiring care. This written certification must include the date on which the serious health condition commenced and the probable duration of the condition. For a leave based upon caring for a child, spouse or parent who has a serious health condition the written certification must have an estimate of the amount of time the health care provider believes the employee needs to care for the individual requiring care, and a statement that the serious health condition warrants the participation of a family member to provide care during a period of the treatment or supervision of the individual requiring care.
For a leave based on the employee's own serious health condition, the written certification must include a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his or her position.
If additional leave is required upon the expiration of the time estimated by the health care provider, the employee must request such additional leave again supported by a written certification consistent with the requirements for an initial certification.

The second health care provider may not be employed on a regular basis by the District.
