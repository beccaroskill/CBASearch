In consideration of the Union's execution of this Agreement, each Employer promises that its operations covered by this Agreement shall not be sold, conveyed, or otherwise transferred or assigned to any successor without first securing the
1
Art. I
agreement of the successor to assume the Employer’s obligations under this Agreement. Immediately upon the conclusion of such sale, conveyance, assignment or transfer of its operations, the Employer shall notify the Union of the transaction. Such notification shall be by certified mail to the Secretary-Treasurer of the International Union and shall be accompanied by documentation that the successor obligation has been satisfied. Provided that the Employer shall not be a guarantor or be held liable for any breach by the successor or assignee of its obligations, and the UMWA will look exclusively to the successor or assignee for compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

•'I	I
Section (b) Exemptions Clause	!
It is the intention of this Agreement to reserve to the Employers and except from this Agreement an adequate force of supervisory employees to effectively conduct the safe and efficient operation of the mines and at the same time, to provide against the abuse of such exemptions by excepting more such employees than are reasonably required for that purpose.

All other Employees working in or about the mine shall be included in this Agreement except essential supervisors in fact such as mine foremen, assistant mine foremen who, in the usual performance of their duties, may make examinations for gas as prescribed by law, and such other supervisors as are in charge of any class of labor inside or outside the mines and who perform no production work.
The Union will not seek to organize or ask recognition for such excepted supervisory employees during the life of this contract.
The Employers shall not use this provision to ex-
4
Art. IA
empt from the provisions of this Agreement as supervisors, more men than are necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the mine, taking into consideration the area covered by the workings, roof conditions, drainage conditions, explosion hazards, and the ability of supervisors, due to thickness of the seam, to make the essential number of visits to the working faces as required by law and safety regulations.
Section (c) Supervisors Shall Not Perform Classified Work
Supervisory employees shall perform no classified work covered by this Agreement except in emergencies and except if such work is necessary for the purpose of training or instructing classified Employees.

The Employer further agrees to provide, .to the extent practicable, space on mine property for the holding of Union elections and the ratification of collective bargaining agreements.
Section (f) Application of This Contract to the Employer’s Coal Lands
As part of the consideration for this Agreement, the Employers agree that this Agreement covers the operation of all the coal lands, coal producing and coal preparation facilities owned or held under lease by them, or any of them, or by any subsidiary or affiliate at the date of this Agreement, or acquired during its term which may hereafter (during the term of this Agreement) be put into production or use. This section will immediately apply to any new operations upon the Union’s recognition, certification, or otherwise properly obtaining bargaining rights.

Section (g) Contracting and Subcontracting

6
coal as defined in paragraph (a) may be contracted out under the Agreement only where contracting out such work is consistent with the prior practice and custom of the Employer at the mine; provided that such work shall not be contracted out at any time when any Employees at the mine who customarily perform such work are laid off. •
(2)	Repair and Maintenance Work—Repair and maintenance work of the type customarily performed by classified Employees at the mine or central shop shall not be contracted out except (a) where the work is being performed by a manufacturer or supplier under warranty, in which case, upon written request on a job-by-job basis, the Employer will provide to the Chairman of the Mine Committee a copy of the applicable warranty or, if such copy is not reasonably available, written evidence from a manufacturer or a supplier that the work is being performed pursuant to warranty; or (b) where the Employer does not have available equipment or regular Employees (including laid-off Employees at the mine or central shop) with necessary skills available to perform the work at the mine or central shop.
(3)	The Employer may not contract out the rough grading in mine reclamation work.
(4)	Where contracting out is permitted under this section, prior custom and practice shall not be construed to limit in any way the Employer’s choice of contractors.
7
Art. II
Art. IA
Section (h) Leasing, Subleasing and Licensing Out of Coal Lands k
(I) The Employers agree that they will not .lease, sublease or license put any coal lands, coal producing or coal preparation facilities where the purpose thereof is to avoid the application of this Agreement or any section, paragraph or clause thereof. I

(2)-(7) These sections have been incorporated into the JOBS Program, Article II, Section (B).
Section (i) Construction Work
All construction of mine or mine related facilities including the erection of mine tipples and sinking of mine shafts or slopes customarily performed by classified Employees of the Employer normally performing construction work in or about the mine in accordance with prior practice and custom, shall not be contracted out at any time unless all such Employees with necessary skills to perform the work are working no less than 5 days per week, or its equivalent for Employees working on alternative schedules.
Provided further that where contracting out of such construction work customarily performed by classified Employees at the mine is permitted under this
8
Agreement, such contracting shall be in accordance with prior practice and custom. Where contracting out is permitted under this section, prior practice and custom shall not be construed to limit the Employer’s choice of contractors.	..
Article II
JOB OPPORTUNITY AND BENEFIT SECURITY (JOBS)
The parties hereto recognize and agree that the production of bituminous cool involves, by its very nature, the depletion of resources at work locations. The parties agree further that varied mining arrangements and technological advances can adversely impact on job security and that their mutual goals of mining coal safely and efficiently can best be achieved by the use of experienced miners who are knowledgeable of the Employer’s standards of operation.
As a result of the special nature of the bituminous coal mining industry and the parties* desire to develop a relationship in which the Employees as well as the Employers gain from a growth in productivity, the parties agree to establish the Job Opportunity and Benefit Security (JOBS) Program. The JOBS Program is designed to achieve, to the fullest extent allowed by law, job security for classified employees through extended panel rights and new training opportunities. Nothing in the JOBS Program shall be
9
Art. II
construed to diminish any rights of the Employees or the Union established in any other provision of this Agreement including, but not limited to, the successorship clause, Article IA(h) and Article XVII.
I	i
A.	Non-Signatory Operations of the Signatory Employer j j	■ ।
1.	Except as modified in Section C, the first three out of every five new job openings for work of a nature covered by this Agreement at any existing, new, or newly acquired non-signatory bituminous coal operation of the Employer shall be filled by classified laid-off Employees on the panels of the Employer’s operations covered by this Agreement, or by classified active Employees of the Employer who have provided notice indicating their interest in such job openings. It shall be the obligation of the signatory Employer to provide reasonable notice to its classified active Employees of the operations at which such job openings may be available. If the newly acquired or non-signatory operation has a panel of laid-off employees established pursuant to a valid collective bargaining agreement, those individuals shall first be recalled before this section applies.
2.	Selection of employees for the above three out of every five new job openings shall be made from the senior Employee among the classified laid-off Employees on the Employer’s panels and classified active Employees of the Employer who have notified the
10
Art. II

G.	UMWA-BCOA Labor Management Positive Change Process (“LMPCP”)
Section (1)	Establishment and Purpose
The parties recognize that, just as the coal industry has changed, and continues to change, so too must a new and different relationship be fostered between labor and management. The parties recognize that the Union’s goal of increased job and employment
26
Art.n
opportunity and security for its members goes hand-in-hand with, and indeed depends upon, the increased and continuous competitiveness and financial stability of the Employers. It is further recognized that the mutual objectives of the parties can best be attained by a joint commitment of continuous improvement to working relationships, productivity, health, safety, training, education, and investment in technology and, most importantly, human resources. In this light, the parties must discard old, ways of dealing with each other in an atmosphere of mistrust, and foster a new environment of mutual trust and a good faith acceptance of their respective institutions. For, in truth, the parties have a major responsibility to the same resource: the Union, to its members, and the Employers, to their Employees. (
In order to achieve these objectives, the parties recognize the need for new and creative approaches to labor-management relations, to the increasing involvement of Employees in the success of mining operations, and for changes to be made at the mine sites to allow the Employers to better compete in today’s global marketplace. Accordingly, to promote joint efforts addressing those needs, and to enhance existing efforts to improve labor-management cooperation, the parties hereby establish the UMWA-BCOA Labor Management Positive Change Process (LMPCP).

(i)	To augment the ability of the operation to meet or exceed customer requirements;
28
Art. II
(j)	To further develop mutually acceptable (agreement between local union and local management) ways to reduce the number of job grades and job titles set forth in Appendices A and B of this Agreement, and to further develop mutually acceptable alternative schedules and continuous operations in addition to those set forth in this Agreement; and
(k)	To explore non-adversarial processes, including mediation, for settling disputes at the mine.

H.	UMWA-BCOA Labor Management Policy
Committee
The parties recognize that the coal industry is at a critical juncture. It operates in a global economy and faces the challenges of environmental legislation as well as fierce domestic and foreign competition. These challenges are likely to increase rather than subside during the next several years. Mutual cooperation at the highest levels and a sincere commitment to communication and problem solving are therefore critical for the industry to maintain and enhance its competitive position.
To address these concerns, the parties hereby establish a “UMWA-BCOA Labor Management Policy Committee.” This Committee shall operate as a labor management committee within the meaning of Section 302(c)(9) of the LMRA, as amended, established and functioning so as to fulfill one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 6(b) of the Labor Manage-t
1	36	I
i Art. II
meat Cooperation Act of 1978. The .Committee shall have the full support and commitment of both the UMWA and the BCOA in the Committee’s efforts to identify problems, formulate plans to solve those problems and, where appropriate, conduct joint activities designed to implement the plans.
The Committee shall be comprised of four high-level representatives of the UMWA, four high-level representatives designated by the BCOA, and one neutral Chairman who shall be selected' by- the other members of the Committee. The Chairman will have authority to assist the Committee in carrying out its purposes, which shall include: (a) opening lines of communication that will serve to support and promote the objectives outlined in this Agreement, and (b) seeking to identify and addressing major issues facing the industry, such as legislation, the environment, technological changes, and similar issues. The Chairman shall have the authority, upon consultation with the Committee, to invite individuals who can contribute to matters under discussion.

Art. XI initially not more than fifteen (15) acceptable insurance carriers, based upon scrutiny of model plans provided by the respective careers and such other criteria as the Trustees may deem pertinent. Subsequent thereto, the Trustees may add additional carriers to the list at their discretion. Upon the approval of the Employers, this list shall be distributed to all signatory Employers. Each Employer shall be solely and individually responsible for provision of the benefits set forth in this Article, either directly or through such of the acceptable insurance carriers as he may designate.

tency of coverage and of the awarding of claims and benefits. Based, upon such investigation, the Trustees shall, at the end of the first 12 months experience with this Plan, prepare a report to die Employers and the Union and shall, pursuant to such report, prepare a revised list of acceptable insurance carriers, based upon the experience of the preceding year. The list may be further revised thereafter at the discretion of the Trustees. The Trustees shall have the power to remove any insurance carrier from the list for failure to provide the benefits described in this Article in a manner consistent with the terms of the Plan, and, in the event that an insurance carrier is so removed, it shall be the responsibility of any affected Employer to cancel any policy or policies he may have with any such disqualified insurance carrier, and to replace such policy or policies with a policy or policies provided by an acceptable insurance carrier, not less than 30 days after notification by the Trustees.
If, on the basis of their investigation of disputed claims, the Trustees find evidence that an Employer who elects to provide benefits directly has done so in a manner inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, the Trustees shall first inform such Employer and shall request that he establish coverage through any of the acceptable insurance carriers that he may designate. If the Employer fails to do so, and if the Trustees find that he is continuing to provide benefits in a manner inconsistent with । the terms of the Plan, the Trustees !	86

In the event that a carrier makes available additional or extended coverage based upon Employee payment of premiums, or an Employee chooses to seek such coverage from another carrier, nothing in this Article shall be construed as prohibiting such voluntary expansion of coverage. At the request of the Employee, and in accordance with the terms of Article XV (Checkoff), the Employer shall deduct such premium payments. '

However, if and only if by the end of the meeting required by Section (c) of this Article XVII, the Union informs the Employer in writing that any such displaced Employee wishes to waive the opportunity for the greatest standard daily .wage rate in favor of a particular shift, that preference shall be followed to the extent the Employee's seniority permits. In order to be prepared to so inform the Employer of such preference at any such meeting called by the Employer, it is the responsibility of the Union to predetermine Employee preferences.	1
(ii)	Assignment of classifications and job titles within a job grade is within the exclusive discretion of the Employer. However, where there is more than one available job within that job grade, such assignments to the Employees to . be assigned within that grade will be made on the basis of retaining in that grade the maximum number of Employees being so assigned who have the ability to step in and perform the available work at that time.

Article XX—HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Section (a) General Purpose	*
This Article makes provision for pension, health and other benefits for Employees covered by this Agreement, and for former Employees who were covered under the United Mine Workers of America Welfare arjd Retirement Fund of 1950 (“1950 Fund’’), and for the spouses and dependents of such Employees? The benefits to be provided are as set forth under' separate plans and trusts referred to in Sections (b)’ and (c) of this Article. ,
A general description of the benefits to be provided appears immediately following this Article. The specific provisions of the plans will govern in the event of any inconsistencies between the general description and the plans.
Pursuant to the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act of 1992 (the “Coal Act’’), the health benefits (and in some cases the death benefits) provided to retirees who were age and service eligible as of February 1, 1993,
140
Art XX
and who actually retired by September 30, 1994, are guaranteed by an Act of Congress. The Coal Act, which was enacted with the active support of the United Mine Workers of America and the BCOA, requires responsible employers to provide and pay for these benefits for life. Although, under certain circumstances, employers are permitted to adopt cost containment and managed care programs, the levels of benefits provided to retirees and dependents covered by the Coal Act are fixed by law, and may not be changed by any employer.
Benefits under the Coal Act are provided either by the employer who was providing those benefits on February 1, 1993, or by two newly-created Funds: the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund and the United Mine Workers of America 1992 Benefit Plan.’ Those benefits are not governed by this Agreement.
For purposes of this Article, the 1950 Pension Plan and Trust and the 1974 Pension Plan and Trust shall be a continuation of the benefit program established under the UMWA Welfare and Retirement Fund of 1950 (hereinafter the 1950 Fund).
Each participant and beneficiary shall be entitled only to the pension benefits provided in and paid from either the 1950 Pension Plan and Trust or the 1974 Pension Plan and Trust and each participant, beneficiary and dependent shall be entitled only to the benefits provided in and paid from the 1993 Benefit Trust, or the individual benefit plans referred to in Section
141
Art. XX
(c). An individual that is entitled to health benefits from a plan maintained pursuant to the Coal Act will receive benefits from such plan, and not from a plan maintained pursuant to this Article. In addition, an individual that is entitled to death benefit coverage from the United Mine Workers of America Combined Benefit Fund shall not be entitled to death benefit coverage from any plan maintained pursuant to this Article.
The general purpose of the plans referred to in this Article shall be to provide health care for working and retired miners and their dependents; pensions for miners upon their retirement; health care and financial support for eligible disabled miners; and financial support for surviving spouses and surviving dependents provided by each of the Trusts and Plans referred to in this Article.
Except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Article, it is agreed that the Trusts referred to in this Article are irrevocable Trusts created pursuant to, and within the scope of, Section 302(c) of the Labor-Management1 Relations Act, 1947, and shall endure as long as the purposes for their creation shall exist.

as set forth in the United Mine Workers of America 1974 Pension Plan (“1974 Pension Plan”), which is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. This Plan is a continuation of the pension program of the 1950 Fund and was effective December 6, 1974.
(2)	The United Mine Workers of America 1993 Benefit Trust (“1993 Benefit Trust”) is incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. The 1993 Benefit Trust provides certain health benefits, not including pension benefits, and the terms and conditions under which those benefits will be provided are as set forth in the plan under the 1993 Benefit Trust and under the terms of this Article.
(3)(i) Each signatory Employer shall establish and maintain an Employee benefit plan to provide, implemented through an insurance carrier(s), health and other non-pension benefits for its Employees covered by this Agreement as well as pensioners under the 1974 Pension Plan and Trust whose last signatory classified employment was with such Employer and who are not eligible to receive benefits from a plan maintained pursuant to the Coal Act. The benefits provided by the Employer to its eligible Participants pursuant to such plan shall be guaranteed during the term of this Agreement by that Employer at levels set forth in such plan. The plans established pursuant to this subsection are incorporated by reference and made a part of 'this Agreement, and the terms and
r	Art. XX
conditions under which the health and other non-pension benefits will be provided under such plans are as to be set forth in such plans.
(ii)	The 1993 Benefit Plan and Trust provides health and other non-pension benefits during the term of this Agreement, to any retired miner (or the eligible dependent of such retired or deceased miner) who meets the conditions of one of the following:
(a)	The retired miner is described in Section (b)(2).
(b)	The retired miner separated from classified employment prior to December 16, 1993, would be eligible to receive benefits from the 1974 Benefit Plan but for the passage of the Coal Act, is not entitled to benefits under the Coal Act, and(whose last signatory employer was no longer deriving, revenue from the production of coal on December) 16,1993.
(c)	The miner is retired under the 1974 Pension Plan or any successor plan(s) thereto, last worked in signatory classified employment for an Employer who was obligated to contribute and contributed to the 1993 Benefit Trust at the rates specified in Section (d) and would otherwise cease to receive the health and other non-pension benefits provided herein because such last signatory Employer (including successors and assigns) is no longer in business. An Employer's obligation to contribute at the rates specified in Section (d) must be in effect on the date the Employer is first considered to be “no longer in business.” For purposes of determining eligibility
145 ’

Art. XX
under the 1993 Benefit Plan and Trust, the Employer is considered to be “no longer in business” only if the Employer meets the conditions of (I) and (II) below. The parties expressly intend that each of the requirements of (I) and (II) be met.
(I)	The Employer has ceased all mining operations and has ceased employing persons under this Wage Agreement, with no ’reasonable expectation that such operations will start up again; and
(II)	The Employer is financially unable (through either the business entity that has ceased operations as described in subparagraph (a) above, including such company’s successors or assigns, if any, or any other related division, subsidiary, or parent corporation, regardless of j whether covered by this Wage Agreement or not) to provide health and other nonpension benefits to its retired miners and surviving spouses.
In the case of an otherwise qualifying last signatory Employer that first became obligated to contribute to the 1993 Trust after December 31, 2001, within the meaning of Section (d)(l)(iii) of this Article, and that did not contribute to the 1993 Benefit Trust substantially all amounts owed and at the rates specified in Section (d), eligible retired miners and dependents shall receive only limited coverage under a separate program of benefits designed by the Plan’s Trustees. The Trustees shall design the program taking into account the need for the Plan to remain sol-
146
Art.XX
vent throughout the term of this Agreement, while providing more complete benefits for individuals whose last signatory Employer met the “substantially all” contribution requirement of this Article.
Each Employer is required to maintain, and make available to the Trustees, those business and financial records that may be necessary to determine whether the eligibility requirements of the 1993 Benefit Trust have been satisfied. If a miner’s last signatory Employer ceases to provide health benefits as required under Section (c)(3)(i) of this .Article, and the Trustees are investigating whether the Employer is “no longer in business” within the meaning of Section (c)(3)(ii)(c) of this Article, the Employer shall make available to the Trustees those business and financial records that may be necessary to the “no longer in business” determination, including but not limited to financial statements, tax returns, bank statements, coal production and sales data, and information on equipment and other property and assets of the signatory Employer. The Trustees shall make their initial determination of whether an Employer is “no longer in business” no later than 90 days following receipt of such business and financial records, as practicable.
(d) The retired miner worked under the terms of the 1974 NBCWA (but not under the terms of the 1978 NBCWA), has been or would have been denied a benefit by the UMWA 1974 Benefit Plan solely because the miner did not work under the terms of a

The Union and Trustees shall assist and fully cooperate with the Employers in obtaining all necessary opinion letters,.exemptions, or rulings from the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or other applicable federal agencies, in order to implement the provisions of this subsection so as to ensure compliance with all applicable federal laws and regulations and ensure the deductibility for income tax purposes of any and all contributions made by signatory Employers to the 1993 Benefit Trust and the individual health plans referred to in this Section.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The following is a general description of certain information contained in the UMWA 1950 Pension Plan and Trust, the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan and Trust, and the individual Employer’s benefit plan. This description is intended merely to highlight certain information; it is not a complete statement of all of the provisions of the Plans and Trusts, nor is it intended to be a Summary Plan Description as defined in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and is qualified in its entirety by, and subject to the more detailed information contained in the Plans and Trusts, copies of which are .on file and available for inspection at the offices of the UMWA Health & Retirement Funds, 2121 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20037. The specific provisions of the plans will govern in the event of any inconsistencies between the general description and the plans.
The benefits provided by the 1993 Benefit Trust may be amended from time to time, as determined by the 1993 Benefit Plan Trustees, subject to the following restrictions, and to the terms of the Trust:
Art. XX
(a)	Benefits under the 1993 Benefit Trust shall only be those that can be provided from the assets of the Trust, but there shall be no benefit improvements during the term of this Agreement, and the total package of benefits under the Plan shall not exceed the value of the benefits provided under the individual Employer Plan pursuant to this Article.
(b)	All 1950 and 1974 Pension Plan Pensioners, disabled miners not yet eligible for immediate pension benefits, and surviving spouses, who are eligible for benefits from the 1993 Plan as of January 1,2002, will receive a $2,250 payment from their respective Pension Plans on or before April 1,2002, and on or about January 1 of each successive year of this Agreement All 1950 and 1974 Pension Plan Pensioners, disabled miners not yet eligible for immediate pension benefits, and surviving spouses, who are determined to be eligible for benefits from the 1993 Plan during the term of this Agreement will receive a $2,250 payment from their respective Pension Plans on or about the later of April 1,2002, or the first day of the second month following the month in which they are determined to be eligible for benefits from the 1993 Plan, and on or about January 1 of each successive year of this Agreement The $2,250 payment set forth in this paragraph is not in-tended as an ongoing feature of either the 1950 or 1974 Pension Plan, and the Plans shall have no obligation to provide payments of this type other than those expressly provided for in this Article and in the Plans.
165 \
Art. XX
Any 1950 or 1974 Pension Plan Pensioner, disabled miner not yet eligible for immediate pension benefits,0 or surviving spouse, who would otherwise be eligible for coverage from the 1993 Plan shall elect whether to have coverage under the 1993 Plan. If such individual so elects, he or she may direct that $2,000 of the $2,250 pension payment for the year be made directly to the 1993 Plan. Coverage under the 1993 Plan shall permanently cease; for any family that does not elect coverage and make a payment under this paragraph once each year (either by direct payment from the 1950 or 1974 Pension Plan or otherwise) within 30 days of the date such pension payment is made. A family shall not be required to make any payment under this paragraph for any calendar year in which it has not received the $2,250 pension payment.
(c)	No beneficiary shall be eligible for any benefit that is more generous than the retiree medical benefit contractually required to be provided under the individual employer benefit plan maintained by the last signatory Employer.
(d)	The assets of the 1993 Benefit Trust shall be subject to semi-annual valuations in January and July of each year. Effective January 31, 2004, if any such valuation shows that the net assets available for plan benefits is equal to less than $2 million ($2,000,000), the Trustees must, within 90 days, reduce Plan benefits to the extent necessary to assure that the Trust continues to be solvent and able to provide benefits.
i
>	166	;
Art. XX
For purposes of this paragraph; “net assets available for plan benefits” is the amount shown as such on the 1993 Benefit Plan monthly financial statements, under “Statements of Net Assets Available for Plan Benefits.” In the event that any valuation shows that the net assets available for plan benefits is equal to or less than $2 million ($2,000,000), and the Trustees do not act within 90 days to reduce Plan benefits as required, then the Executive Director of the UMWA Health & Retirement Funds (or if such position is vacant, the highest ranking staff member working exclusively on health benefit plan matters) shall adopt such benefit reductions effective immediately.
The parties expressly agree that the language references to “for life” and “until de^th” that are retained in this General Description are intended to mean that each Employer will provide, for life, only the benefits of its own eligible retirees who retire during the term of this Agreement. A retiree shall be considered to be a retiree of an Employer if his last signatory classified employment was with such Employer. The benefits and benefit levels provided by an Employer under its Employer Plan are established for the term of this Agreement only, and may be jointly amended or modified in any manner at any time after the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
However, under no circumstances will an Employer be responsible to provide benefits or to contribute toward the provision of benefits, through the
167
Art. XX
Art. XX ;
1993 Benefit Trust or any other plan, trust or mechanism, to former employees and retirees (or their spouses, surviving spouses or dependents) of any other Employer beyond the term of this Agreement.

i
Active miners and their surviving spouses and dependents, and pensioners, their dependents, and surviving spouses receiving pensions from the 1974 Pension Plan, will receive health care provided1 by their Employer through insurance carriers. A Health Services card identifying the Participant’s eligibility for benefits under the health plan shall be provided by the Employer
The Trustees of the UMWA Health and Retirement Funds shall resolve any disputes, as provided in Section (e)(5), including excessive fee disputes, to assure consistent application of the health plan provisions in the Employer Benefit Plans and of the managed care programs authorized by this Agreement.
Enhanced Cost Containment Program
In an effort to address the problems generated by the ever-increasing cost of health care, while maintaining a high level of benefits, the parties have mutually agreed to adopt managed care and cost containment programs
a.	Coordination of Benefits
If an individual is covered as A dependent under both the Employer Benefit Plan and under a plan
197
maintained by a different employer, the benefits of the two plans will be coordinated so that no more than the total charges for covered medical goods and services will be paid. In no event will the Employer Benefit Plan be required to pay more than it otherwise would have paid without regard to this) provision. The health plan shall coordinate benefits in accordance with the“birthday rule” adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
b.	Generic Drug Substitution
If a Beneficiary uses a brand name drug when a generic equivalent is available, the Beneficiary is responsible for the difference in cost between the generic drug and the brand name drug, in addition to the normal copayment. A generic drug will not be considered “available” unless it has been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration. In addition, if the prescribing physician determines that use of a brand name drug is medically necessary, the generic drug will not be considered "available,” and there will be no additional payment by the beneficiary for the use of the brand name drug.
c.	Health Care Payment/Deductible
On January 1 of each year during the term of this Agreement (or such' later date an individual first becomes an eligible Participant), each eligible participant will receive a lump sum health care payment of $ 1,000.
198
For purposes of this provision, “eligible participants” means active Employees, laid-off Employees, and disabled Employees prior to eligibility for Medicare benefits, who are participants in the Employer Plan maintained pursuant to this Article. .Notwithstanding the foregoing, a laid-off Employee shall receive a pro-rata health care payment that reflects the number of calendar quarters during which he is entitled to Employer-provided health care under the plan during the calendar year. A health care payment shall not be paid to any individual who is not then entitled to Employer-provided benefits under the Employer Plan.
During the term of this Agreement, 1974 Pension Plan Pensioners who are not eligible for unreduced Social Security benefits, and surviving spouses who are not eligible for unreduced Social Security benefits, whose last signatory employer is signatory to this Agreement (or to an Agreement with identical employee benefit obligations) will receive the $1,000 payment described in the preceding paragraph from the 1974 Pension Plan. Each pensioner and surviving spouse shall receive a prorata payment for the calendar year in which he or she will attain eligibility for Medicare that reflects the number of calendar quarters during such year prior to the month in which he or she attains such eligibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payment shall be made to any individual who is not then entitled to Employer-provided benefits under the Employer Plan or to any disabled individual eligible for Medicare benefits.
199
All health benefits provided under the Employer Plan will be subject to a $750 deductible per family per calendar year. The first $750 of all covered medical expenses incurred by any covered family member will be counted toward satisfying the deductible. Vision care and prescription drug expenses are not subject to the deductible. The deductible requirement only applies to benefits provided to covered active, laid-off, disabled and retired employees (and spouses, surviving spouses and dependents)' under the Employer Plans maintained pursuant to this Article. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) the deductible for a laid-off employee for a calendar year shall be the pro-rata portion of $750 that reflects the number of calendar quarters during which he is entitled to Employer-provided health care under the plan during such year; (ii) the deductible for a pensioner or a surviving spouse for the calendar year in which he or she will attain eligibility for unreduced Social Security benefits shall be the pro-rata portion of $750 that reflects the number of calendar quarters during such year prior to the month in which he or she attains such eligibility; (iii) the deductible for a disabled employee, or a disabled pensioner under age 65, will cease to be in effect beginning with the first calendar year following his dr her eligibility for Medicare benefits; and (iv) a newly-hired Employee, an Employee recalled from layoff, or any other individual subject to a health care payment and deductible who com
mences coverage after January 1 of a year, shall receive a pro-rata health care payment, and be subject to an annual deductible, that reflects the number of calendar quarters remaining in the year. A family shall not be required to pay a deductible in any calendar year that exceeds 75 percent of the amount of the Health Care payment paid for that year.
d.	Health Care Participating Provider Lists (PPL)

13.	Transition—Out of PPL—If a Beneficiary has begun to undergo a course of treatment .
203
with a non-PPL provider prior to the establishment of the PPL (or with a PPL provider that leaves the PPL), completion of that course of treatment will not be considered “out of PPL” as follows:
a.	for an acute condition (including pregnancy, treatment for cancer, etc.), for the duration of the specific course of treatment.
b.	for a chronic condition, for up to six months.
14.	Viability—A PPL must be viable, both financially and otherwise, in order to ensure that it will continue to be able to appropriately serve the [participant population.

Generally, nothing more is required than signing the forms authorizing the hospital, clinic, or physician to bill the insurance carrier for the services rendered. The insurance carrier will keep individual records for each Participant and dependent and will notify the Participant of the co-payments credited to his account. The hospital, clinic, or physician will bill the Participant for the co-payment amount until the maximum is reached. In some instances, when the Employee pays for services or drugs, the bills should be obtained and submitted with the claim form according to the instructions on the form. If the annual co-payment maximum has been reached, the carrier will remit to the Participant the full payment for covered benefits.
Where possible, for in-PPL services, no claim forms will be required. The PPL provider will generally be responsible for the submission of claims and other paperwork to the insurance carrier. However, Beneficiary may be required to submit claim forms and bills paid to verify that the annual deductible has been satisfied. Although a PPL provider may require
207

Art. XX i

(12)	HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT:
The Union arid the Employers recognize that rapidly escalatin'g health care costs, including the costs of medically unnecessary services and inappropriate treatment,: have a detrimental impact on the health benefit program. The Union and the Employers agree that a solution to this mutual problem requires the cooperation of both parties, at all levels, to control costs and to work with the health care com-
208
Art. XX
munity to provide quality health care at reasonable costs. The Union and the Employers are, therefore, committed to fully support appropriate programs designed to accomplish this objective. This statement of purpose in no way implies a reduction of benefits or additional costs for covered services provided miners, pensioners and their families.
In any case in which a provider attempts to collect excessive charges or charges for services not medically necessary, as defined in the Plan; from a Beneficiary, the Plan Administrator or its agent shall, with the written consent of the Beneficiary, attempt to resolve the matter, either by negotiating a resolution or defending any legal action commenced by the provider. Whether the Plan Administrator or its agent negotiates a resolution of a matter or defends a legal action on a Beneficiary’s behalf, the Beneficiary shall not be responsible for any legal fees, settlements, judgments or other expenses in connection with the case, but may be liable for any services of the provider which are not provided under the Plan. The Plan Administrator or its agent shall have sole control over the conduct of the defense, including the determination of whether the claim should be settled or an adverse determination should.be appealed. ■The protections of this paragraph shall not apply until the deductible is met in full for the year, and shall not apply in the case of any service or supply obtained from a non-PPL source, until the out-of-pocket maximum is reached.

Dear Mr. Roberts:
This letter will confirm BCOA’s understanding with you concerning the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 2002 as it relates to settlement of disputes. The terms of the Agreement do not prohibit an Employer from entering into an arrangement with the Union which; provides that disputes between the Employer and its UMWA represented Employees may be submitted to a mediation procedure.
BCOA does not agree, however, that the mediation procedure replaces the contractual resolution of dispute procedures, i.e., Article XXIII, Article XXIV, and Article XX, Section (e)(5). It is BCOA’s understanding that, the mediation procedure is a supplement to the contractual procedures.
Sincerely, j

Re: Special Permanent Layoff Pension Special 30-and-Out Layoff Pension
Dear Mr. Roberts:
This is to confirm our understanding regarding the effect of an election to receive the Special Permanent Layoff Pension or a Special 30-and-Out Layoff Pension from the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan (Special Layoff Pensions) as provided under Sections (7)(e) and (7)(f) of the General Description of the Health and Retirement Benefits in Article XX of the 2002 National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement (“NBCWA”). The language included by the parties in Section (10)(c) of the General Description is intended to assure that a miner who elects to receive a Special Layoff Pension does not forfeit or otherwise lose his right to receive the continued health coverage and life insurance benefits to which he would have been entitled under the NBCWA or his Employer’s benefit plan as the result of the layoff had he not elected to receive his pension.
Sincerely,
J. Brett Harvey, Chairman BCOA Negotiating Committee

MEMORANDUM Of UNDERSTANDING REGARDING JOB' OPPORTUNITIES
This Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) is between the United Mine Workers of America (hereinafter referred to as “UMWA”) and [name of signatory Employer] (hereinafter referred to as “the signatory Employer”), which is a member of the Bituminous Coal Operators’ Association, Inc., signatory to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 2002, and, solely for purposes of negotiating and executing this MOU and no other purposes, the limited agent of [name of nonsignatory Parent] and its nonsignatory coal mining subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as “the nonsignatory Companies”). A list of all nonsignatory Companies covered by this MOU that have existing nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operations and the names of those operations are attached as Appendix A.
1.	The parties enter into this MOU in order to provide job opportunities for work of a classified nature to certain laid-off and active miners of the signatory Employer and to provide the nonsignatory Companies with an experienced pool of miners to fill available new job openings for work of a classified nature. Such job opportunities for work of a classified nature shall be at .existing, new, or newly acquired nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operations of the nonsignatory Companies. Any nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operation
(289
f
opened, reopened, .or newly acquired after the date ) of execution of this' MOU by the nonsignatory Com- > panies shall be deemed a new or newly acquired bituminous coal mining operation for purposes of this MOU, provided that the nonsignatory Company 11 owns 50 percent or more of the applicable bituminous coal mining operation or operates the applica- | ble bituminous coal mining operation with exclusive * right to control of the hiring of miners for work of a I classified nature.	*
2.	The nonsignatory Companies agree that they I will not engage in any transaction, restructuring or f reorganization for the purpose of evading the obliga- j tions of this MOU.	1
3.	This MOU shall be subject to any valid legal I obligation, including but not limited to any collective I bargaining agreement, Native American preference । right, applicable statute or regulation, affecting the hiring obligations of the nonsignatory Companies or ’' the lessees, licensees, contractors or subcontractors of the nonsignatory Companies as set forth in para- ,, graph 10 below.
4.	Nothing in this MOU, its execution, the discussions leading to its execution, or the negotiations for the NBCWA of 2002, shall affect, or be used as evidence in any forum to affect, any bargaining unit de- 1 ’ termination or any duty of the nonsignatory Companies to recognize or bargain with the UMWA. The parties agree that the nonsignatory bituminous coal
: I	I
• I 290	:
mining operations referred to in this MOU are separate from and not included in {any bargaining unit heretofore or currently existing in the coal industry.
5.	Nothing in this MOU, its implementation, its execution, the discussions leading to its execution, or the negotiations for the NBCWA of 2002, shall create, or be used or offered as evidence in any forum to create, a joint employer, single employer, alter ego, agency, successor, or other type of relationship between or among the signatory Employer and the nonsignatory Companies.
6.	At existing, new, or newly acquired nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operations of the nonsignatory Companies, job openings for work of a classified nature shall be filled by mine management as follows. The first three (3) out of every five (5) new job openings for work of a classified nature shall be offered to laid-off miners on the panels of the signatory Employer, or to active Employees of the signatory Employer who have provided notice indicating their interest in such openings. The first two of these new job openings shall be filled from among the senior laid-off and active miners of the signatory Employer who have the ability to step into and perform the work of the job at the time the job is awarded. Every third such new job opening shall be filled by mine management with the senior laid-off or active miner of the signatory Employer who has the ability to step into and perform the work of the
291
job at the time the job is awarded and who must have actually performed the tasks required for the job within the last three years. The last two (2) out of every five (5) new job openings for work of a classified nature shall be filled by mine management at its sole discretion from any source, without regard to prior employment or layoff status, although mine management may also consider laid-off or active miners of the signatory Employer for these openings.
Selection of laid-off and active miners for the first three (3) out of every five (5) new job openings described above shall be made (a) from laid-off panel members of the signatory Employer, and (b) from active miners who have notified the signatory Employer, as a limited agent, of their interest in and qualifications for any such job openings at the specific operation involved. Offers of employment made to laid-off panel members of the signatory Employer shall be made without regard to the listing of the particular job or operation on the miner’s panel form. It shall be the obligation of the signatory Employer to provide notice to its active miners of new job openings of a classified nature as they become available at the nonsignatory operation. The parties have attached to this MOU in Appendix B the contents of the form by which active miners may provide notice indicating their interest and qualifications for [any such job openings at/nonsignatory Company bitumi-
i
nous coal mining operations. /This notice shall be posted by the signatory Employer at the time job openings of a classified nature become available at the nonsignatory operations covered by this MOU. For laid-off miners, the order of selection shall be: selecting first from laid-off miners who were last employed at a coal mining operation within the geographic district where the nonsignatory operation is located, next from geographically contiguous districts, and then from geographically non-contiguous districts.. For active miners, the order of selection shall be: selecting first from active miners who are employed at a coal mining operation within the geographic district where the nonsignatory operation is located, next from geographically contiguous districts, and then from geographically non-contiguous districts.
7.	An offer of employment shall be made to a laid-off or an active miner pursuant to this MOU by certified mail, return receipt requested. A miner has three (3) days to accept or reject the offer. If no response is received by mine management within three (3) days of receipt of the offer, the offer shall be deemed to be rejected. If a laid-off or an active miner rejects or is deemed to have rejected a job offer made pursuant to this MOU, mine management has no obligation to make any additional job offers to that miner at that specific nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operation pursuant to this MOU. ■

Nothing in this MOU, its implementation, its execution, the discussions leading to its execution, or the negotiations for the NBCWA of 2002, shall require, or be used as evidence in any forum to require, the nonsignatory Companies to execute or be bound in any manner by any collective bargaining agreement with the UMWA.
9.	This MOU provides job opportunities for work of a classified nature only at existing, new, or newly acquired nonsignatory bituminous coal mining operations of the nonsignatory Companies, as defined in this MOU. This MOU does not constitute a covenant running with the land and does not apply to the sale of nonsignatory coal lands, coal reserves or coal operations (either asset sales or stock sales) of the nonsignatory Companies. Nothing herein shall encumber or limit in any way the rights of the nonsignatory Companies to sell, exchange, release, or otherwise similarly convey (either through asset or stock sales) any of their nonsignatory coal lands, coal reserves or coal operations to third parties.
10.	The three-of-five selection procedure contained in this MOU shall apply to leases, licenses, contracts and subcontracts of the nonsignatory Companies entered into after the date of execution of this MOU where the coal produced from the leased, licensed, contracted or subcontracted bituminous lands or bituminous coal mining operations is produced or processed for, and sold by the nonsignatory Compa-

nies. In the event any existing lessee, licensee, contractor or subcontractor performs work on a continuous basis for the nonsignatoryl Company, this MOU shall not require the lessee, licensee, contractor or subcontractor to displace employees currently working when the lessee, licensee, contractor or subcontractor enters into a new lease, license, contract or subcontract with the nonsignatory Company. In the event bituminous coal lands or bituminous coal mining operations subject to this MOU are leased, subleased, licensed, contracted out, or subcontracted to any non-related entity and the coal that is produced from those lands or operations is not produced or processed for, and sold by the nonsignatory Companies, then the terms of this MOU shall not apply to that entity. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in this MOU, if the nonsignatoiy Companies retain only a royalty in the coal, the terms of the MOU shall not apply. The parties further agree that this MOU shall not apply to any existing lease, license, contract or subcontract of the nonsignatory Companies entered into prior to the date of this MOU (including then existing leases, licenses, contracts or subcontracts of an entity subsequently acquired by the nonsignatory Companies).

13.	This MOU is not intended to discriminate against any person on the basis of union membership or the lack thereof. All job offers made pursuant to this MOU shall be made on a nondiscriminatory basis.
14.	In order to effectuate the implementation of these job opportunity provisions, the UMWA and the nonsignatory Companies subject to this MOU agree that the impartial Jobs Monitor jointly selected by the UMWA and BCOA under Article II.D-3 of the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 2002 shall serve as the monitor under this MOU. I The monitor shall review the job selections pursuant to these provisions and investigate any alleged violations herein. The monitor shall have the authority to request such information which may be reasonably necessary in order to secure compliance with the job selection provisions. The parties have the obligation to comply with such requests. In that regard, the monitor shall be provided, on a regular basis at the end of each calendar quarter, with re
296	i;
ports of all jobs filled pursuant to the job opportunity provisions. The report shall state the name of the mine, its location, the total number of jobs of a classified nature filled and the names and number of persons selected for jobs pursuant to this MOU from among either active Employees or laid-off miners. The report shall be treated as confidential; however, at the monitor’s discretion, the report may be provided to the UMWA. The monitor shall also be provided with a 60-day notice prior to the startup of production at any new operation covered by this MOU. A copy of this 60-day notice shall also be sent to the Secretary-Treasurer of the UMWA. The 60-day notice shall state the name of the operation, location, approximate start-up date; and projected number of jobs of a classified nature available.
Any dispute alleging a breach of this MOU shall first be presented in writing to the applicable nonsignatory Company. This written charge shall concisely explain the basis for the dispute.

297	.
solve the dispute.! The monitor shall have the authority to reach a decision on written submissions. The monitor shall also have the authority to conduct a hearing (formal or informal), request position statements, request additional information or briefs, and take any such steps as may be reasonably necessary to investigate and resolve the dispute. If the monitor conducts a hearing and is unable to reach a decision within thirty (30) days of the close of the hearing (or the close of the record if no hearing shall be conducted), the monitor shall promptly advise the parties of the reasons for the delay and the date when a decision will be submitted. Any decision rendered by the monitor shall be in writing and shall be final and binding on all parties to that decision. The monitor shall not have authority to alter, amend, modify, add to or subtract from, or change in any way the provisions of this MOU. All expenses and fees incurred by the monitor in the resolution of disputes pursuant to this MOU shall be bome equally by the appropriate District and the applicable nonsignatory Company. Nothing in this MOU shall authorize the nonsignatory Company, the UMWA or any miner affected by this MOU to utilize any existing or future contractual grievance procedure, including but not limited to the grievance procedure in the NBCWA of 2002, to resolve any dispute that may arise concerning the interpretation or application of this MOU.	।

Age 62 Pension
To estimate the amount of your pension when you retire, use Tables I-A, I-B, or I-C on pages 303-305 and the worksheet below.
1.	Using Column A, enter the monthly benefit for your years of signatory service earned prior to February 1, 1989 (“Pre-89 signatory service’’).
$___________________
2.	Using Column B, enter the monthly benefit for signatory service earned between February 1, 1989 and January 31, 1990 (“89 signatory service”).
$___________________
3.	Using Column C, enter the monthly benefit for signatory service earned between February 1, 1990 and December 15, 1993 (“ ’90-’93 signatory service”).
$___________________
4.	Using Column D, enter the monthly benefit for your expected years of signatory service earned on or after December 16, 1993 (“Post-’93 signatory service”).
$___________________
Add the four amounts. This is an estimate of your monthly pension amount if you retire at age 62 or older.
I 306	I
If you plan to retire before age 62, estimate your early retirement benefit by using Table D. First, calculate your pension at age 62, as set forth above, using Tables I-A - I-C. Next, fihd the amount closest to your age 62 pension under “Approximate Age 62 Benefit Amount” on Table II. Move across the table from left to right to the dollar amount beneath the age at which you plan to retire. This is your approximate monthly early retirement benefit.

APPENDIX C—ALTERNATIVE SCHEDULES
Part 1. Alternative Schedules. The Parties recognize that greater flexibility at some operations may be needed to promote greater efficiency in production, and to increase Employee choice in work schedules. Accordingly, and notwithstanding the Traditional Work Schedule set forth in Article IV of this Agreement, the Parties have agreed to the establishment of alternative scheduling at the operations covered by this Agreement, including underground mines, surface mines, and all related facilities, in order to provide continuous operations seven (7) days a week. The Employer may establish seven day continuous operations consistent with the schedules set forth in this Appendix, provided the overall employment level at the operation is increased and mandatory overtime is eliminated. The provisions in this Appendix regarding the elimination of mandatory overtime and increased employment levels are applicable only at the operations where alternative schedules are established. The obligation to increase employment levels shall be subject to an exception for conditions beyond the control of the Employer, e.g„ loss or cutback of coal orders, exhaustion of coal reserves, change in geology, and other similar conditions. The determination of whether employment levels have been increased shall be based on the employment level at the time any alternative schedule is established; provided, however, the Employer shall not
layoff prior to implementation for the purpose of evading its obligation to increase employment thereafter. Further provided, any layoff more than 6 months before the date of implementation shall not be considered to be for the purpose of evading the obligations to increase employment after implementation. In the event of any conflict between the provisions in this Appendix and other provisions in this Agreement, the provisions in this Appendix shall control with respect to alternative schedules. Where an Employer establishes alternative schedules, the following shall apply:
(a)	Weekend/Hollday Schedules. The Employer may establish weekend/holiday schedules for any inside and/or any outside (including outside continuous) Employees for work on Friday or Monday, and Saturday and Sunday, and all holidays except as provided in subpart (c) below, so long as such positions are filled by Employees who bid for the job either from the active workforce or from the panel. Selection and bidding procedures shall be governed by Article XVII except the provisions of Article XVII, Section (e) concerning acceptance or rejection of available jobs shall not apply to Employees who bid the weekend/holiday crew from the panel. On a onetime basis, to initially implement the weekend/holiday crew at any operation, an Employee who bids to a weekend/holiday job that carries the same or lower straight time rate will not have such awarded bid






count as one of the two occasions under Article XVII, Section (i)(8). Where the weekend/holiday schedule is established, the workday for inside Employees is twelve (12) hours (on Saturday, Sunday and Holidays) and ten (10) hours (on Friday or Monday) from portal to portal, which means collar-to-col-lar or bank-to-bank, including a staggered thirty (30) minutes for lunch, and without any intermission or suspension of operation throughout the day. The workday for outside Employees on the weekend/holiday schedule is twelve (12) hours (on Saturday, Sunday and Holidays) and ten (10) hours (on Monday or Friday), including a staggered thirty (30) minutes for lunch, and without any intermission or suspension of operation throughout the day. Employees assigned to the weekend/holiday crew will be regularly, scheduled for twelve (12) hours per shift on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, and will be compensated at a premium rate for Saturday, Sunday and holiday work. The premium rate for Saturday, Sunday, and holiday work shall be twenty (20) hours of pay at the straight time rate for twelve (12) hours of work or the applicable pro rata number of hours based on the hours actually worked. On Friday or Monday, Employees will be regularly scheduled for ten (10) hours per shift and will be compensated at the straight time rate for ten (10) hours of work. Where a weekend/holiday schedule is established, the Employer shall have the right to operate multiple shifts with different crews. The

Overtime work shall be defined as any work performed outside of the Employee’s regular schedule (i.e., work in excess of twelve (12) hours on Saturday, Sunday and holidays and in excess of ten (10) hours on Friday or Monday). All overtime work for the weekend/holiday crew is voluntary. For work on Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, overtime in excess of the regular scheduled shift of twelve (12) hours shall be compensated at double the straight time rate, with no pyramiding of overtime. For work on Friday or Monday, overtime in excess of the regular scheduled shift of ten (10) hours shall be compensated at one and one-half times the straight time rate, with no pyramiding of overtime. Notwithstanding the above, if an Employee on the weekend/holiday crew voluntarily works on a weekday outside of his regular schedule, he shall be paid the straight time rate.
(c)	Holidays For Weekend/Holiday Crew. An Employee on the weekend/holiday crew must work all scheduled holidays set forth in Article XH, except
339
Thanksgiving Day, the Friday after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.

(d)	Paid Time Off For Weekend/Holiday Crew. Except as otherwise provided in this Appendix, Employees assigned to the weekend/holiday crew will receive as paid time off the hourly equivalent (based on eight (8) hours per day) of the number of days they otherwise would have received if they were on a traditional schedule. Employees assigned to the weekend/holiday crew will be eligible to receive up to a maximum of 360 hours of paid time off each calendar year at the Employee’s straight time rate, of which 280 hours shall be treated as discretionary time provided all of the conditions and rules of this subpart are met. The 360 hours shall be the maximum annual total paid time off for regular vacation, gradu

All rules governing the eligibility and qualifications for, and the accrual, scheduling and taking of such days set forth in this Agreement shall apply to Employees on the weekend/holiday crew, except where such rules conflict with the provisions in this Appendix, in which case the provisions of this Appendix shall control. Employees who are not eligible for the maximum number of paid days off in this Agreement shall receive the number of days to which they are eligible, converted to hours based on an 8-hour day. For example, if an Employee is eligible for five (5) days of graduated vacation under Article XIV(a), he shall receive a maximum of forty (40) hours of graduated vacation under this Appendix. The 360-hour maximum (or an individual Employee’s lower maximum, where applicable) shall operate as a cap and shall not be exceeded for any reason, unless the Employee has carried over up to 40 hours of personal or sick leave consistent with the requirements of Article IX, Section (e), or has carried over up to 32 hours of floating vacation for use under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, consistent with the requirements of Article XIII, Section (e). Except where such time is carried over, once the 360-hour maximum (or the lower individual maximum) is reached, no additional paid time off will be provided. For Employees on the weekend/holiday crew, paid time off will be allocated
341
as follows: (i) For every Saturday, Sunday, or holiday taken as a paid day off (i.e., Thanksgiving, the day after Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day), the Employee will be paid for 20 hours at the straight time rate; (ii) for every scheduled Friday or Monday taken as a paid day off, the Employee shall be paid for the total number of hours in his regular scheduled shift of ten (10) hours for that day at the straight time rate, until the maximum number of hours of paid time off for the Employee is reached. All time off shall be subject to the 15% rule as set forth in Part 6 bclow with the exception of personal or sick leave. Ah Employee shall have five (5) personal or sick leave days per calendar year, however, a maximum of two (2) personal or sick leave days may be taken on a scheduled holiday. Paid time off for Employees on the weekend/holiday crew shall be paid at the Employee’s straight time rate, including regular scheduled overtime where applicable, but not including premiums for Saturday, Sunday, holidays or birthday work.
(e)	Modified Weekday Schedules. The Employer may establish, in conjunction with the weekend/holiday schedule, a modified weekday schedule that provides for shifts of ten (10) hours per day, either Monday through Thursday, or Tuesday through Friday, at the straight time rate, provided there are minimal or no disruptions caused by any realignment that results from the implementation of such a schedule. In the
342
event an Employee is not assigned to work within his classification after the implementation of this schedule, any job openings in that job title which may occur shall be filled by the most senior Employee previously so classified. The modified weekday schedule may be established for any inside and/or any outside (including outside continuous) Employees. Where the modified weekday schedule is established, mandatory overtime will be eliminated. Where the modified weekday schedule is established, the workday for inside Employees is ten (10) hours from portal to portal, which means collar-to-collar or bank-to-bank, including a staggered thirty (30) minutes for lunch, and without any intermission or suspension of operation throughout the day. The workday for outside Employees on the modified weekday schedule is ten (10) hours, including a staggered thirty (30) minutes for lunch, and without any intermission or suspension of operation throughout the day. The modified weekday schedule of ten (10) hours per day for both inside and outside Employees shall be paid for at the straight time rate. Where the modified weekday schedule is established, the Employer shall have the right to operate multiple shifts with different crews.
(f)	Overtime For Modified Weekday Crew. Overtime for any Employee assigned to the modified weekday crew shall be paid for actual hours worked in excess of the regular scheduled shift of ten (10)
343
hours and for actual hours worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week, and shall be paid at one and one-half times the applicable straight time rate with no pyramiding of overtime. Notwithstanding the above, an Employee assigned to the modified weekday crew who works on a Saturday or Sunday shall be paid the premium rate of twenty (20) hours of pay at the straight time rate for twelve (12) hours of work, or the applicable pro rata number of hours based on the hours actually worked for all work on Saturday or Sunday. If an Employee assigned to the modified weekday crew works a holiday, the provisions of Article XII, Section (d) shall apply (i.e., he shall be paid triple time). If an Employee works on a day in which a premium applies, only the actual hours worked on that day are counted as “hours worked” for purposes of overtime. For example, if an Employee on the modified weekday crew works twelve (12) hours on a Saturday and gets paid for twenty (20) hours, only twelve (12) hours are counted as “hours worked” for purposes of overtime. If an Employee on the modified weekday crew is off for any regular scheduled work day due to a contractually provided for regular vacation, floating vacation, graduated vacation, personal or sick leave, bereavement, jury duty, military duty, or holiday, that time shall be counted as “hours worked” for purposes of overtime calculation only.

Except as otherwise provided in this Appendix, Em
344
ployees assigned to the modified weekday crew will receive as paid time off the hourly equivalent (based on eight (8) hours per day) of the number of days they would have received if they were on a traditional schedule. Employees assigned to the modified weekday crew will be eligible to receive up to a maximum of 360 hours of paid time off each calendar year at the Employee’s straight time rate, of which 250 hours shall be considered discretionary time off provided all of the conditions and rules of this subpart are met. The 360 hours shall be the* maximum annual total paid time off for regular vacation, graduated vacation, floating vacation, personal or sick leave, and holidays (including the birthday holiday). All rules governing the eligibility and qualifications for, and the accrual, scheduling and (taking of such days set forth in this Agreement shall apply to Employees on the modified weekday crew, except where such rules conflict with the provisions in this Appendix, in which case the provisions in this Appendix shall control. For Employees working on the modified weekday crew, the provisions of Article XU, Sections (b) Sunday Holidays, and (c) Monday Holidays,'shall not apply. Employees who are not eligible for the maximum number of paid days off in this Agreement shall receive the number of days to which they are eligible, converted to hours based on an 8-hour day. For example, if an Employee is eligible for five (5) days of graduated vacation under Article XIV(a), he shall
345
receive a maximum of forty (40) hours of graduated vacation under this Appendix. The 360-hour maximum (or an individual Employee’s lower maximum where applicable) shall operate as a cap and shall not be exceeded for any reason, unless the Employee has carried over up to 40 hours of personal or sick leave consistent with the requirements of Article IX, Section (e), or has carried over up to 32 hours of floating vacation for use under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, consistent with the requirements of Article XIII, Section (e). Except where such time is carried over, once the 360-hour maximum (or the lower individual maximum) is reached, no additional paid time off will %e provided.
