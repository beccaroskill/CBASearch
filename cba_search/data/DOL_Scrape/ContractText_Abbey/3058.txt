of this AGREEMENT and the conditions the EMPLOYER established in approving the leave.

such cases shall be in order of the date of acquisition of permanent status in the class from which layoff is to occur
or has occurred. If the tie cannot be broken by this method, seniority shall be determined by the last four digits of
the employee's Social Security Number, with the employee having the highest such number being the more senior.

established shall be furnished to the UNION'S designated representative.

list within thirty (30) days of the date the seniority list is furnished to the UNION'S designated representative. Within
thirty (30) days of notification of errors, the EMPLOYER shall correct errors in the seniority list and furnish the
corrected list to the UNION'S designated representative. If no error is reported within thirty (30) days after the date
the seniority list is furnished or within thirty (30) days after the date a correction in such list is furnished to the
UNION'S designated representative, the list will stand correct as posted.
Section 4.	Except in those instances where senior employees are not qualified to perform remaining work duties, seniority shall determine the order of:
A.	Layoff which shall be in inverse order of seniority within each work classification and department*, provided that
any employee who is to be laid off and has previously served in a lower work classification covered by this
AGREEMENT may request to exercise seniority rights in such lower classification or its designated equivalent.
B.	Recall from layoff which shall be in order of seniority within each work classification and department*, provided that
if an employee does not return to work upon recall, as directed by the EMPLOYER or on an extended date
mutually acceptable to the employee and EMPLOYER, he/she shall automatically have terminated his/her
employment.
C.	If a senior employee requests exercise of seniority rights over a less senior employee for purposes of layoff, the senior employee, as a condition of the EMPLOYER granting such a request, must accept the work schedule (days
of week, work shift, and number of hours per shift) and work location of the least senior employee. The senior
employee, as an alternative to replacing the least senior employee in the department may, if such least senior
employee's work location is outside the senior employee's geographical work area, request exercise of seniority
rights over the least senior employee in the senior employee's geographical work area. Geographical work areas
for the purposes of this section shall be as contained in Attachment A. In situations when more than one (1)
employee in a job class is simultaneously requesting to exercise seniority rights to positions in the same lower job
class, the EMPLOYER will make reasonable efforts to match scheduled hours by seniority.
Section 5.	The EMPLOYER shall issue written notice of layoff or recall from layoff to affected employees at least ten (10) calendar
days in advance of the effective date. Such notice shall be made by certified mail to the employee's last known address
as shown by the EMPLOYER'S records except when the employees are present at the work site to receive notice.
‘Certain departments are treated as a single department for purposes of layoff and recall from layoff; see Attachment B.
Section 6.	Assignment of employees to designated departments shall be at the discretion of the EMPLOYER. When it is necessary
for the EMPLOYER to assign/re-assign an employee to a different work assignment, the EMPLOYER will provide such
employee with two (2) weeks advance notice when practicable.
Section 7.	The UNION will reimburse the EMPLOYER the expense of furnishing seniority lists required by this AGREEMENT in an
amount equal to $25.00 per list or $.05 per employee on each list, whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $50.00.
When more than one copy of the list is requested or required by this AGREEMENT, the UNION shall reimburse the
EMPLOYER for such copies at the rate $.20 per page.
Section 8.	The above provisions shall not apply to the seniority list established by the EMPLOYER and provided to the UNION prior
to the effective date of a layoff as provided in Section 3A herein.
AFSCME Council No. 5, Social Service Unit, Local 34 - 2006-2007 9 of 46
Section 9.	Employees on layoff will be recalled to fill vacancies in other classes and departments for which qualified, provided they
may not exercise seniority rights to create such vacancies. Such employees may waive the recall if the salary rate
offered by the EMPLOYER for the position to which recalled is more than twenty (20%) percent below the salary rate of
the employee when laid off. The name of an employee so recalled will remain on the layoff list for the class from which
laid off, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this AGREEMENT.
The parties agree to provide employees who are laid off and in the “Alternative Placement Process” the opportunity to
state their preference when there is more than one placement opportunity available to them. (The County would be
obligated to take the employee’s preference into consideration but would not be required to grant the employee’s
preference).
The parties agree that if there are alternative placement opportunities available and placement is not accomplished within
2 weeks of the layoff notice, the UNION may appeal the matter to the County Ombudsperson. If placement is not
accomplished within 3 weeks of the layoff notice, and if there is an alternative placement opportunity available, the
employee will be compensated at the rate of the available position subject to offset by any County derived earnings (i.e.
temporary or intermittent wages, or Reemployment Insurance).
Section 10.	For purposes of layoff and recall, the job classes of Financial Worker and Senior Financial Worker shall be considered a single job class, subject to continuation of the "junior/senior" plan forthose two classes through the completion of the
Financial Worker redesign implementation. For purposes of layoff and recall, the Financial Worker series is equivalent to the Human Services Representative series.
Section 11.	For purposes of layoff and recall, Social Worker and Senior Social Worker shall be considered a single job class; this includes reclassifications filed through September 2001 in Child Services, Adult Mental Health, and Adult Protection.
ARTICLE 7 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1. A grievance shall be defined as a dispute or disagreement raised by an employee against the EMPLOYER involving the interpretation or application of the specific provisions of this AGREEMENT.
Section 2. It is specifically understood that any matters governed by statutory provisions, County Human Resources Rules, or departmental personnel rules, except as expressly provided for in this AGREEMENT, shall not be considered grievances under this AGREEMENT. If by law an appeal procedure, other than the grievance procedure contained herein, is available for resolution of a dispute arising from any provision covered by this AGREEMENT and the aggrieved party pursues the dispute through such appeal procedure provided by law, the aggrieved employee(s) shall be precluded from making an appeal under this grievance procedure.
Except that with respect to statutes under the jurisdiction of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission or Minn. Stat. §§ 363.01 - .20, an employee pursuing a statutory remedy is not precluded from also pursuing an appeal under this grievance procedure.
Section 3. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: Grievances, as herein defined, shall be processed in the following manner:
Step 1: INFORMAL. An employee claiming a violation concerning the interpretation or application of the express provisions of this AGREEMENT shall:

B.	The supervisor shall give his/her oral or written answer within fourteen (14) calendar days after such presentation to the employee and his/her steward.
AFSCME Council No. 5, Social Service Unit, Local 34 - 2006-2007 10 of 46
Step 2: FORMAL. If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved in Step 1 and the UNION wishes to appeal the grievance to Step 2 of the grievance procedure, it shall be referred, in writing, to the Department Head or his/her designated representative and to the Labor Relations Director or his/her designee within fourteen (14) calendar days after the designated supervisor's answer as provided for in Section 3, Step 1-B. The grievance appeal shall be initiated by means
of a written grievance to be signed by the employee and the union representative. The written grievance shall set forth the nature of the grievance, the facts on which it is based, the provisions of the AGREEMENT allegedly violated, and the relief requested. The Department Head and/or his/her designated representative shall discuss the grievance with the UNION within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date presented at a time agreeable to the parties. If the grievance is resolved as a result of such a meeting, the settlement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the Department Head or his/her designated representative and the union representative. If no settlement is reached, the Department Head or his/her designated representative shall give written answer to the union representative within fourteen (14) calendar days following their meeting.
Step 3: MEDIATION. If the grievance is not settled in accordance with the procedure set forth in Step 1 or Step 2, it may be submitted to mediation provided that the UNION and the Labor Relations Director or his/her designee, by mutual agreement, jointly petition the Minnesota BMS for assistance in resolving the grievance within ten (10) working days after the employee and UNION’S receipt of the EMPLOYER’S written answer in Step 2. The parties shall have thirty (30) calendar days in which to resolve the grievance through mediation.
Section 4. ARBITRATION: If the grievance is not settled in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the UNION may refer the grievance to arbitration within fourteen (14) calendar days after the employee and UNION'S receipt of the EMPLOYER'S written answer in Step 2. The parties shall mutually agree upon an arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, the selection of an arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the "Rules Governing the Arbitration of Grievances" as established by the Public Employment Relations Act and administered by the State of Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services. The arbitrator shall hear the grievance at a scheduled meeting subject to the availability of the EMPLOYER and the union representatives. The arbitrator shall notify the union representative and the EMPLOYER of his/her decision within thirty (30) calendar days following the close of the hearing or submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties agree to an extension thereof. The fees and expenses for the arbitrator's services and proceedings shall be borne equally by the EMPLOYER and the UNION, provided that each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. Employees who serve as such representatives or witnesses shall not be compensated at a rate in excess of their base pay rate. If either party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it may cause such a record to be made, provided it pays for the record. If both parties desire a verbatim record of the proceedings, the cost shall be shared equally. The arbitrator shall not have the right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this AGREEMENT. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the specific issue(s) submitted, in writing, by the EMPLOYER and the UNION, and shall have no authority to make a

this AGREEMENT and on the facts of the grievance presented. If the arbitrator determines that the grievance is covered
by law or statute, or not covered by the express provisions of this AGREEMENT, the arbitrator shall refer the grievance
back to the parties without decision or recommendation. The parties may, by written agreement, agree to submit more
than one grievance to the arbitrator provided that each grievance will be considered as a separate issue and each on its own merits.
Section 5.	If a grievance is not presented within the time limits set forth above, it shall be considered waived. If a grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limit or any agreed extension thereof, it shall be considered settled on
the basis of the EMPLOYER'S last answer. If the EMPLOYER does not answer a grievance or an appeal thereof within
the specified time limits, the employee/UNION may elect to treat the grievance as denied at that step. The UNION may
then immediately appeal the grievance to the next step. The time limit in each step may be extended by mutual written
agreement of the EMPLOYER and union representatives involved in each step.

ATTACHMENTC
FUNERAL LEAVE ADMINISTRATION UNDER THE AFSCME CONTRACT
The "Funeral Leave" Article (Article 16) of the labor agreement between Hennepin County and AFSCME Council
#14 provides that employees can receive paid leave to make necessary funeral arrangements and to attend funeral services in the event of a death in the employee's "immediate family." Article 16 defines "immediate family" for this purpose as comprising the following family members: "...spouse, parent, step-parent, parent-in-law, children, stepchildren, brothers, brothers-in-law, sisters, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, grandparents, grandparents-in-law grandchildren, or person regarded as a member of the employee's immediate family." (Emphasis added.) The bolded part of the provision cited above first appeared in the 1994-95 labor agreement. The intent of this new provision was to recognize "non-traditional" family relationships that employees might have with persons who do not meet the literal definitions enumerated above, but who fulfill the same roles for the employee. For example, the funeral of an employee's domestic partner would qualify for paid leave under this language, if the domestic partner's relationship to an unmarried employee is comparable to that of a married employee's spouse. Similarly, such a domestic partner's parents would be analogous to parents-in-law, and the domestic partner's children would be analogous to the employee's children or stepchildren. Another type of qualifying relationship could be the parent of the employee's children (if the parents are not married).
Because the criteria relate to the definition of "immediate family" found in the labor agreement, application of the term must be consistent with the definition found in the agreement. An employee's qualifying "non-traditional" family relationship should virtually be the equivalent of a qualifying "traditional" relationship. There should be a history to the relationship that establishes such equivalency.
It would be inappropriate, for example, for an employee to decide that any funeral qualifies for paid leave under this article, because all humanity is a "family." It would also be inconsistent with the intent of the language for the employee to decide that a friend is the equivalent of a brother or sister (although a friend might qualify as a "brother" if he and the employee grew up together in the same household). Friendship alone is not a defining characteristic of either traditional or nontraditional relationships.

Letter - Local 34 Issues
November 22, 1999 Rita During
AFSCME Council 14
300 Hardman Ave So, Suite 2 South St. Paul, MN 55075 RE: Local 34 Issue Dear Ms. During:
In the current labor contract negotiations for the Social Service Bargaining Unit (Local 34), the Union has proposed that “If the Employer hires new employees above the entry rate, the Employer will immediately raise all employees, in the same classification and at a lower rate, to the rate of the newly hired employee.”
In principal, the County agrees that hiring new employees at a higher rate than paid to existing employees in the same class who are equally or better qualified has the potential to create perceptions of inequity and generally should be avoided. However, the County does not consider paying employees, whether new or existing, above the entry rate of the negotiated pay range to be a violation of the labor agreement and is not agreeable to, in effect, imposing financial penalties on itself fordoing so.
The County understands and appreciates the Union’s concerns on this matter and intends to be responsive in any future incidents as it has been in the past. To ensure that the Union has a means to address any concerns it does not feel are being properly addressed through normal channels, the Union many refer such concerns to the Deputy County Administrator or his/her designee. The Deputy County Administrator will serve as an “ombudsperson” on these matters in the same way he/she serves as the County “ombudsperson” on health and safety matters.
Sincerely,
Rolland C. Toenges

AND
AFSCME COUNCIL NO. 14, LOCALS 34 and 552
In the above-referenced labor agreements, the provision set forth below is found in Article 31, Meet and Confer:
"In addition, the parties mutually agree to conduct additional meet and confer sessions within individual
departments or divisions. The number, frequency, length, scope and size of such meetings shall be
determined by mutual agreement."
The parties have reached the following understanding with respect to the interpretation and application of this language:
1.	The Employer agrees to meet and confer with Union representatives on issues related to workloads/caseloads in specific departments and divisions.
2.	The objective of such meet and confer processes is to identify ideal workload or caseload sizes and methods of achieving or working towards ideal workloads/caseloads. It is specifically understood that actual assigned workloads may differ from ideal workloads. The goal of the parties is to conclude this meet and confer process within nine months of the Union's contract ratification date.
3.	The Employer agrees that ideal or appropriate workloads/caseloads will be a significant consideration when assessing employee work performance.

BETWEEN

AND
AFSCME COUNCIL #14
LOCALS 34, 552, 977, 1719, 2822, 2938
Hennepin County understands AFSCME’s concern that classification studies requested by employees it represents be processed in a timely manner. Further, that AFSCME has an interest in periodically knowing the status of such studies.
In order to provide AFSCME with information regarding the status of particular classification studies, Hennepin
County agrees to meet and confer once each calendar quarter for this purpose. Upon making a request for such meet and confer sessions AFSCME agrees to identify the particular classification studies of interest at least two weeks in advance of the meet and confer sessions. Such advance notice will enable Hennepin County to arrange for the presence of staff who possess the knowledge sought by AFSCME.

Clarification of Health Insurance Article
December 1, 1995
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
This letter is to clarify the interpretation of Section 7 of Article 22, Insurance, contained in the collectively bargained agreement between Hennepin County and AFSCME Council 14 for the period January 1996 through December 1997.
The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that there is a mutual duty to bargain regarding a change in the level of health insurance benefits unless such change occurs as a result of a change in insurance carriers or self insurance.
The parties further acknowledge that, pursuant to existing Minnesota Statutes, the aggregate level of benefits provided by a group insurance contract may not be reduced unless the parties to the collective bargaining agreement agree to the reduction in benefits. Under existing statutes, therefore, if a change in insurance carriers or self insurance will result in a reduction in the aggregate level of benefits for employees, such change may not occur without agreement of the parties to the collective bargaining agreement.

Transfer to Another Jurisdiction Letter
November 15, 2005
Steve Marincel
AFSCME Council 5
300 Hardman Ave. S., Suite 2
South St. Paul, MN 55075-2469
Dear Mr. Marincel:
This letter modifies the letter dated November 2, 1995 from Rolland Toenges and is intended to clarify the procedures which would be followed in the event that the Minnesota Legislature transfers positions occupied by bargaining unit employees to the State of Minnesota or to another political subdivision.
If the legislature were to mandate such a transfer of positions (or of bargaining unit work), Hennepin County would find itself confronted with a lack of work for employees, and/or a lack of funds. This would be a potential layoff situation as defined by Article 3 of the labor agreement. The procedures set forth in Article 6, Section 4, would therefore apply.
This means that such layoffs (or transfers to another jurisdiction) would take place in order of inverse seniority as provided in the contract. Senior employees would be able to exercise seniority rights over less senior employees, subject to the conditions and limitations found in the labor agreement, except that layoff rights granted under this letter will terminate two years after the employee is transferred to the new jurisdiction or for a period equal to an employee’s length of employment with Hennepin County, whichever is lesser.
The only additional qualifications is that if the legislation mandating the transfer of positions specifically identifies
the employees to be transferred, the County would be required to follow the provisions of the law. This
requirement is found in both the labor agreement (Article 36) and the Public Employment Labor Relations Act
(M.S. 179A.20, Subd. 2).

William P. Peters

Clarification of Seniority Letter
March 8, 1994
Mr. Steve Marincel
Business Representative AFSCME Council #14 267 Lafayette Frontage Road South St Paul, MN 55107-1683
Dear Mr. Marincel:
The purpose of this letter is to clarify how the parties shall interpret and administer Article 6, Seniority, Section 9 of our Clerical and Related Labor Agreement. Section 9 reads as follows: "Employees on layoff will be recalled to fill vacancies in other classes and departments for which
qualified, provided they may not exercise seniority rights to create such vacancies. Such employees
may waive the recall if the salary rate offered by the EMPLOYER for the position to which recalled is
more than twenty (20%) percent below the salary rate of the employee when laid off. The name of an employee so recalled will remain on the layoff list for the class from which laid off, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this AGREEMENT."
An employee laid off pursuant to Article 6, Section 4 will be recalled via Section 9 to fill vacancies in other classes and departments for which qualified. The employee must accept such recall unless the pay for the job class to which he/she is recalled is more than 20% below that of the job class from which laid off. The Employer will first recall such laid off employees to vacancies covered by the Clerical and Related Bargaining
Unit. If no vacancy is available within the bargaining unit, the Employer will recall such employees to a vacancy outside the bargaining unit, if available.
If the vacancy to which an employee is recalled via Section 9 is in a different class than that from which he/she was laid off (either within bargaining unit or outside bargaining unit), the employee will remain on a layoff list for the job class and bargaining unit from which laid off. When a vacancy occurs anywhere in the bargaining unit in the job class from which the employee was laid off, the employee shall be recalled to fill such vacancy subject to seniority provisions. Upon such recall, the employee will be removed from the layoff list.
If after recalling an employee to a vacancy in a different job class from which laid off (via Section 9), a vacancy becomes available in the job class from which the employee was laid off, but such vacancy is outside the bargaining unit, it shall be the Employer's option to assign the employee to such vacancy. If the employee is so assigned, he/she shall remain on a layoff list for the job class from which laid off in the bargaining unit.
If this interpretation is consistent with your understanding of Article 6, Section 9, please so signify by signing below.
Sincerely,
William P. Peters

Improved Benefits for Military Reservists Called to Active Duty
The undersigned have agreed to modify the terms of our labor agreement so as to apply the attached Improved Benefits for

improved benefits for employees who have been called to active duty on or after May 29, 2003.
SALARY DIFFERENTIAL
Employees called to active military duty on or after May 29, 2003 are eligible to receive the difference between their County

rate, and it will include PERA contributions. The payment will be separate from any regular paycheck the employee
receives during his/her absence.
4.	Basic military pay does not include the following: basic combat training, advanced individual training, annual training,
periodic inactive duty training, voluntary active service not legally required, or service performed under M.S.190.08

military pay records.
EXTENDED EMPLOYER-PAID HEALTH COVERAGE
