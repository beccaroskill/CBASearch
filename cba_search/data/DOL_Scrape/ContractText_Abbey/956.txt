INSIDE CONSTRUCTION AGREEMENT
Agreement by and between the Southern Nevada Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., and Local Union 357, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. It shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term “Chapter” shall mean Southern Nevada Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., and term “Union” shall mean Local Union 357, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The term “Employer” shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an assent to this Agreement.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
The Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry; therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the Employer, the Union and the public. Progress in the industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Employer and the Union. All will benefit by continuous peace and by adjusting any differences by rational, common sense methods. Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
I
ARTICLE 1
Effective Date - Changes - Grievances - Disputes
Section 1.01
This Agreement shall take effect June 1, 2003, and shall remain in effect until May 31, 2006, unless otherwise specifically provided for herein. It shall continue in effect from year to year, from June 1 through May 31 of each year, unless changed or terminated in the way later provided herein.
Section 1.02
(a)	Either party or an Employer withdrawing representation from the Chapter, or not represented by the Chapter, desiring to change or terminate this Agreement must provide written notification at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the Agreement or any anniversary date occurring thereafter.
(b)	Whenever notice is given for changes, the nature of the changes desired must be specified in the notice, or no later than the first negotiating meeting unless mutually agreed otherwise.
(c)	The existing provisions of the Agreement, including this Article, shall remain in full force and effect until a conclusion is reached in the matter of proposed changes.
(d)	Unresolved issues or disputes arising out of the failure to negotiate a renewal or modification of this Agreement that remain on the 20th of the month preceding the next regular meeting of the Council
2
on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Contracting Industry (CIR) may be submitted jointly or unilaterally to the Council for adjudication. Such unresolved issues or disputes shall be submitted no later than the next regular meeting of the Council following the expiration date of this Agreement or any subsequent anniversary date. The Council’s decisions shall be final and binding.
(e)	When a case has been submitted to the Council, it shall be the responsibility of the negotiating committee to continue to meet weekly in an effort to reach a settlement on the local level prior to the meeting of the Council.
(f)	Notice of a desire to terminate this Agreement shall be handled in the same manner as a proposed change.
Section 1.03
This Agreement shall be subject to change or supplement at any time by mutual consent of the parties hereto. Any such change or supplement agreed upon shall be reduced to writing, signed by the parties hereto, and submitted to the International Office of the IBEW for approval the same as this Agreement.
Section 1.04
There shall be no stoppage of work either by strike or lockout because of any proposed changes in this Agreement or dispute over matters relating to this Agreement. All such matters must be handled as stated herein.

The Local Union shall select the Union representatives and the Chapter shall select the management representatives.
Section 1.06

4
Contracting Industry for adjudication. The Council’s decisions shall be final and binding.

When any matter in dispute has been referred to conciliation or arbitration for adjustment, the provisions and conditions prevailing prior to the time such matters arose shall not be changed or abrogated until agreement has been reached or a ruling has been made.
ARTICLE 2
Employers Rights-Union Rights
Section 2.01
The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall, therefore, have no restrictions except those specifically provided for in the collective bargaining agreement, in planning, directing and controlling the operation of all his work, in deciding the number and kind of employees to properly perform the work, in hiring and laying off employees, in transferring employees from job to job within the Local Union’s geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as foreman, in requiring all employees to observe the employer’s and/or owner’s rules and regulations not inconsistent with this agreement, in requiring all employees to observe all safety regulations, and in discharging employees for proper cause.
Section 2.02
The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole col
5
lective bargaining agency between itself and employees covered under the scope of this Agreement.
Section 2.03
Members of the FBEW, except those meeting the requirements of an “Employer” as defined herein, shall not contract for any electrical work. Person or persons taking out licenses as contractors shall not be allowed to work back and forth as contractor or journeyman as the occasion arises.
Section 2.04
The Union agrees that if, during the life of this Agreement, it grants to any other employer in the Electrical Contracting Industry on work covered by this Agreement, any better terms or conditions shall be made available to the Employer under this Agreement and the Union shall immediately notify the Employer of any such concession.
Section 2.05
Certain qualifications, knowledge, experience, and financial responsibility are required of everyone desiring to be an employer in the electrical industry. Therefore, an employer who contracts for electrical work is a person, firm, or corporation having these qualifications, a suitable financial status to meet payroll requirements and, where required, must be in possession of a valid Nevada State License as an electrical contractor, and employ at least one (1) journeyman regularly.
6
Section 2.06
For all employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall carry Workman’s Compensation Insurance with a company authorized to do business in this state, and shall furnish satisfactory proof of such to the Union; he shall also make contributions to the Nevada Unemployment Compensation Commission.
Section 2.07
The Union reserves the right to discipline its members for violations of its laws, rules and agreements.
Section 2.08

Section 2.09
Any employee exercising such right shall carefully put away all tools, materials, equipment or any other property of the Employer in a safe manner. Each employee will be responsible for any loss to the Employer for neglect in carrying out this provision but only when a safe place is provided for by the Employer.
Section 2.10
The Employer shall not work with the tools (except
7

Section 2.11
The Employer shall not loan or cause to be loaned the workmen in his employ to any other employer without first securing permission of the Union and then only when applicants possessing the required skills are not available under the referral procedure.
Section 2.12
The Union shall have the right to appoint a steward at any shop or job where workmen are employed under the terms of this Agreement. At any time on any one project the Employer and the Union through written mutual consent may choose to have additional stewards appointed. If a second steward has not been previously agreed by written mutual consent, the Union shall have the right to appoint an additional steward without written mutual consent after 125 workmen, as described above, are so employed. Such stewards shall be allowed sufficient time during the regular working hours, without loss of pay to see that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are enforced. Under no circumstances shall the Employer dismiss or otherwise discriminate against an employee for making a complaint or giving evidence with respect to an alleged violation of any provision of this Agreement. An additional working steward shall be appointed for each one hundred and twenty-five (125) workmen thereafter.
8
Steward Qualifications
(a)	The Union will appoint only individuals who meet minimal or greater qualifications and certifications as required to serve as a steward. Qualifications shall include: Demonstrated understanding of the Inside Construction Agreement, effective communication and conflict resolution skills.
(b)	The steward will notify his immediate supervisor of the duties that would cause him to be away from his assigned work before he performs said duties provided the said supervisor is immediately available and on the job. No steward will interfere with the work of any other employer.
(c)	A steward will not be laid off or fired (except for a gross misconduct such as intoxication or drinking of intoxicating beverages, fighting or stealing, on the job) until the matter has first been discussed with the Union. If no agreement is reached within twenty-four (24) hours, the matter will then be referred to the Business Manager and the Chapter Manager, and in the event they cannot agree within an additional twenty-four (24) hours, either party may then request a hearing before the Labor Management Committee. It is understood that the steward will be comparable to other workmen on the job and will not have preference over regular foremen in the reduction of force.
(d)	The steward’s appointment will become effective upon notification in writing to the individual employer and the chapter office.
9
(e)	No steward will be authorized to cause a stoppage of work on any job and in the event he is unable to adjust any matter, the Business Manager of the Local Union will be notified immediately.

Section 2.18
The subletting, assigning, or transfer by an individual employer of any work in connection with electrical work to any person, firm or corporation not recognizing the IBEW or one of its Local Unions as the collective bargaining representative of his employees on any electrical work in the jurisdiction of this or any other Local Union to be performed at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure or other work, will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
11
Section 2.19
All charges of violations of Section 2.18 of this Article shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering the procedure for the handling of grievances and the final and binding resolution of disputes.
Section 2.20	- Substance Abuse Policy
The dangers and cost which alcohol and other chemical abuses can create in the electrical contracting industry in terms of safety and productivity are significant. The parties to this Agreement resolve to combat chemical abuse in any form and agree that to be effective, programs to eliminate substance impairment should contain a strong rehabilitation component. The parties recognize the Employer’s right to adopt and implement a drug and alcohol policy subject to all applicable laws and regulations, procedural safeguards, scientific principles, and legitimate interests of privacy and confidentiality. However, the Union reserves the right to negotiate regarding the terms of the Employer’s policy before the policy is implemented by the Employer.

Section 5.01
There shall be a local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) consisting of a total of eight (8) members who shall also serve as trustees to the local apprenticeship and training trust. An equal number of members four (4) shall be appointed, in writing, by the local chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) and the Local Union of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
The local apprenticeship standards shall be in conformance with national guideline standards and policies. All apprenticeship standards shall be registered with the NJATC and thereafter submitted to the appropriate registration agency.
The JATC shall be responsible for the training of apprentices, journeymen, installers, technicians, and all others (unindentured, intermediate journeymen, etc.)
Section 5.02
All JATC member appointments, re-appointments and acceptance of appointments shall be in writing. Each member shall be appointed for a three (3) year term, unless being appointed for a lesser period of time to complete an unexpired term. The terms shall be staggered, with one (1) term from each side expiring each year. JATC members shall complete their appointed term unless removed for cause by the party they repre
48
sent or they voluntarily resign. All vacancies shall be filled immediately.
The JATC shall select from its membership, but not both from the same party, a Chairman and a Secretary who shall retain voting privileges. The JATC will maintain one (1) set of minutes for JATC Committee meetings and a separate set of minutes for Trust meetings.
The JATC should meet on a monthly basis, and also upon the call of the Chairman.
Section 5.03
Any issue concerning an apprentice or an apprenticeship matter shall be referred to the JATC for its review, evaluation and resolve; as per standards and policies. If the JATC deadlocks on any issue, the matter shall be referred to the Labor-Management Committee for resolution as outlined in Article One of this Agreement; except for trust fund matters, which shall be resolved as stipulated in the local trust instrument.
Section 5.04
There shall be only one (1) JATC and one (1) local apprenticeship and training trust. The JATC may, however, establish joint subcommittees to meet specific needs, such as residential or telecommunications apprenticeship. The JATC may also establish a subcommittee to oversee an apprenticeship program within a specified area of the jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
All subcommittee members shall be appointed, in writing, by the party they represent. A subcommittee
49
member may or may not be a member of the JATC.
Section 5.05
The JATC may select and employ a part-time or full-time Training Director and other support staff, as it deems necessary. In considering the qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the Training Director, the JATC should review the Training Director’s job description provided by the NJATC. All employees of the JATC shall serve at the pleasure and discretion of the JATC.
Section 5.06
To help ensure diversity of training, provide reasonable continuous employment opportunities and comply with apprenticeship rules and regulations, the JATC, as the program sponsor, shall have full authority for issuing all job training assignments and for transferring apprentices from one Employer to another. The Employer shall cooperate in providing apprentices with needed work experiences. The Local Union Referral Office shall be notified, in writing, of all job training assignments. If the Employer is unable to provide reasonable continuous employment for apprentices, the JATC is to be so notified.
Section 5.07
All apprentices shall enter the program through the JATC as provided for in the registered Apprenticeship Standards and Selection Procedures.
An apprentice may have their indenture canceled by the JATC at any time prior to completion as stipulated in the registered standards. Time worked and accumulated in apprenticeship shall not be considered for local union
50
referral purposes until the apprentice has satisfied all conditions of apprenticeship. Individuals terminated from apprenticeship shall not be assigned to any job in any classification, or participate in a related training, unless they are reinstated in apprenticeship as per the standards, or they qualify through means other than apprenticeship, at sometime in the future, but no sooner than two (2) years after their class has completed apprenticeship, and they have gained related knowledge and job skills to warrant such classification.
Section 5.08
The JATC shall select and indenture a sufficient number of apprentices to meet local manpower needs. The JATC is authorized to indenture a total number of apprentices not to exceed a ratio of one (1) apprentice to three (3) Journeyman Wiremen normally employed under a collective bargaining agreement. The JATC shall indenture a larger number of apprentices provided the individuals are entering the program as the result of direct entry through organizing; as provided for in the registered apprenticeship standards.
Section 5.09
Though the JATC cannot guarantee any number of apprentices; if a qualified Employer requests an apprentice, the JATC shall make reasonable efforts to honor the request. If the JATC is unable to fill the request within ten (10) working days, and if the JATC has fewer indentured apprentices than permitted by its allowable ratio, they shall select and indenture the next available person from the active list of qualified applicants. An active list of qualified applicants shall be maintained by the JATC as per the selection procedures.
51
Section 5.10
To accommodate short-term needs when apprentices are unavailable, the JATC shall assign unindentured workers who meet the basic qualifications for apprenticeship. Unindentured workers shall not remain employed if apprentices become available for OJT assignment. Unindentured workers shall be used to meet job site ratios except on wage-and-hour (prevailing wage) job sites.
Before being employed, the unindentured person must sign a letter of understanding with the JATC and the Employer - agreeing that they are not to accumulate more than two thousand (2,000) hours as an unindentured, that they are subject to replacement by indentured apprentices and that they are not to work on wage-and-hour (prevailing wage) job sites.
Should an unindentured worker be selected for apprenticeship, the JATC will determine, as provided for in the apprenticeship standards, if some credit for hours worked as an unindentured will be applied toward the minimum OJT hours of apprenticeship.
The JATC may elect to offer voluntary related training to unindentured; such as Math Review, English, Safety, Orientation/Awareness, Introductions to OSHA, First-Aid and CPR. Participation shall be voluntary.
Section 5.11
The Employer shall contribute to the local health and welfare plans and to the National Electrical Benefit Fund (NEBF) on behalf of all apprentices and uninden
52
tured. Contributions to other benefit plans may be addressed in other sections of this Agreement.
Section 5.12
Each job site shall be allowed a ratio of one (1) apprentice for every three (3) Journeyman Wiremen or a fraction thereof as illustrated below.
One Journeyman Two Journeymen Three Journeymen Four Journeymen Five Journeymen Six Journeymen Seven Journeymen Eight Journeymen Nine Journeymen Ten Journeymen
One Apprentice Two Apprentices Two Apprentices Two Apprentices Three Apprentices Three Apprentices Three Apprentices Four Apprentices Four Apprentices Four Apprentices
The first person assigned to any job site shall be a Journeyman Wireman.
A job site is considered to be the physical location where employees report for their work assignments. The Employer’s shop (service center) is considered to be a separate, single job site. All other physical locations where workers report for work are each considered to be a single, separate job site.
Section 5.13
An apprentice is to be under the supervision of a Journeyman Wireman at all times. This does not imply that the apprentice must always be in-sight-of a Journeyman Wireman. Journeymen are not required to
53
constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative. Work may be laid out by the Employer’s designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice’s skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
Apprentices who have satisfactorily completed the first four (4) years of related classroom training using the NJATC curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site and receive work assignments in the same manner as a Journeyman Wireman. An apprentice shall not be the first person assigned to a job site and apprentices shall not supervise the work of others.
Section 5.14
Upon satisfactory completion of apprenticeship, the JATC shall issue all graduating apprentices an appropriate diploma from the NJATC. The JATC shall encourage each graduating apprentice to apply for college credit through the NJATC. The JATC may also require each apprentice to acquire any electrical license required for a journeymen to work in the jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
Section 5.15
The parties to this Agreement shall be bound by the Local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Trust Fund
54
Agreement which shall conform to Section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended, ERISA and other applicable regulations.
The Trustees authorized under this Trust Agreement are hereby empowered to determine the reasonable value of any facilities, materials or services furnished by either party. All funds shall be handled and disbursed in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
Section 5.16
All Employers subject to the terms of this Agreement shall contribute the amount of funds specified by the parties signatory to the local Apprenticeship and Training Trust Agreement. The current rate of contribution is fifteen cents ($.15) per hour for each hour worked. This sum shall be due the Trust Fund by the same date as is their payment to the NEBF under the terms of the Restated Employees Benefit Agreement and Trust.

56
stitute a debt due and owing to the NEBF or its assignee. The payment and the payroll report shall be mailed to reach the office of the appropriate local collection agent not later than fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of each calendar month.

A Board of Trustees for the Pension Trust Fund is hereby established and shall consist of an equal number of members selected by the Union and the Employers. The Board of Trustees is hereby authorized to establish and implement such Trust Fund Pension Plan, Trust Agreement and reporting forms as they consider necessary to the finalization of the Pension Plan.
