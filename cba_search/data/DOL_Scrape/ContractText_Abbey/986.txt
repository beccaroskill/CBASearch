This letter concerns the meaning and application of the term “dismantle” under Article ID, Trade Jurisdiction of the proposed collective bargaining agreement to be effective May 1, 2002 through April 30, 2006.

Six state agreement	- -
This letter concerns the meaning and application of Article IV, Territorial Application, Section. 1 of the Agreement, to be effective May 1,2002 through April 30,2005, which requires that all applicable work, that is to say building work, performed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,,effective April 1, 1999 and in Maine,' Vermont and New Hampshire'effective October'1, 1999 “shall be performed in,: accordance with the terms and conditions of the local' area'agreement.”	'
, .■‘•i.	■ i'?	bi >.
It was explicitly agreed ^during negotiations for. this Agreement that contractors signatoiy to the statewide Connecticut agreement would be bound only by the duration and termination provisions of the Connecticut agreement and would not be bound by the duration and termination proyisionsof the local union agreements in the other New England states. That is. to say, if a contractor bound to this Agreement through its membership in the multi-employer bargaining group'properly terminates its participation in this Agreement, the contractor is not still bound by the local union'agreements in the other New. England states?because he had been signatory to this Agreement. ‘	'
It was further agreed that contractors signatory to, this Agreement were, not thereby signatory to any of the local union agreements in the other New England states and .that .contractors signatory to this Agreement, when working in those other states, did not have to sign a Iqcal union agreement in those other states'in order to make the’ fringe benefit contributions required by any such local union agreement.	- r	1	1
ArticleXXII, Section (c)	.
If the National Labor Relations Board declines to defer the processing of an unfair labor practice charge due to the fact that the Union can engage in a work stoppage in response to an Employer’s failure to comply with an arbitration award, die Union and Employer will request jointly in writing that the right to engage in a work stoppage not be the basis for the Board declining to defer to arbitration. .	; 7	< > , .	..	- • 7 **•*' ' ■ ■
