If necessary a bump session will be held at which time limits will be.waived.on postings and all jobs will be filled at that session.
Management will make final determination of whether an. employee is qualified per job de-'■ scription, If dispute 'arises as to qualifications fora’higher classification Management will make the final determination of. qualifications per the appropriate job .description, Uriioh Tmay appeal to .arbitration within fifteen (15) work days .of the grievance?

Additionally, job accommodation, alternate -duty assignments,.and transitional work, are meant to be temporary, not permanent work assignments. ■	■ ■ .
Goals& Objectives
Managed return to work allows employees who are temporarily or partially disabled due
126
to work-related injuries or illnesses to return to the> workplace in a restricted or rnodified capacity and be productive before they are able to return to their normally assigned duties at full capacity. The goals and objectives for the Toledo Public Schools Return to Work/ Transitional Work program include, but.are not limited to:
•	Develop a plan to return injured employees to, work safely and in a meaningful capacity, without risk of re-injury, aggravation of the injury, or risk to others.
•	Ensure that-managed return-to-work develops within the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and applicable state laws.
•	Coordinate with Human Resources representatives.	'■
•	Create an effective process for monitoring injured employees from the date of injury or illness until the injury is resolved or the injured worker is maximum medically improved (MMI).
•	Focus on what the employee can do, not on what he or she cannot do.
•	Focus on the temporary nature of the modified work assignment or job accommodation.
.• Enlist the support and commitment of management, labor, and co-workers.
•	Perform detailed job assessment/analysis for each job classification identifying the physical demands and requirements of each job, especially for jobs or classifications that have a high accident rate, to include:
(a)	the essential and nonessential tasks,
(b)	the tools, machines, and equipment used,

\	4127 '
and physical requirements) , to help medical care; providers and1.medical, care reviewers understand the physical and mental demands of. each job. .
Return to.Work Options
When an injury occurs. Management intent is to return the employees to work as quickly as circumstances permit as determined by the provider of record. -Instead of waiting until an injured,employee, reaches-maximum medical improvement (MMI), or 100 percent recovery, to bring the emplqyee back to work, the focus should be on what the employee can do during recovery, to accommo-date_the injury or disability,. (One hundred percent recovery, means the employee has regained his or her-pre-injury physical ca-. pacity., MMI means the employee has recovered as much as possible'.)
Managed return to work options include job accommodation,., temporary alternate or modified duty assignments, and transitional work.. Positions identified, for such assignments are not intended to replace vacant positions. Return to work positions are recognized as- temporary, supplemental positions and are not considered, to be regular bid jobs or to become regular bid jobs. Such positions within the. AFSCME bargaining units are. intended for AFSCME employees and not employees of any other bargaining unit unless specifically agreed to by the TPS-AFSCME Workers’ Compensation Committee.

The first choice is to bring the employee back to his/her regular job through a process called job accommodation, which is intended to allow employees to return to their regular jobs while recovering from an injury. Accommodation may require some modification of the injured employee’s regular assignment. For example, it may be possible for,the employee to return to his/her regular job ‘with instructions not to perform specific activities dr to complete only a limited number of - the tasks' usually performed in a day’s time. This, type of job modification is often most desirable-because it enables injured workers to perform familiar work. It also helps avoid injuries that could result from performing unfamiliar tasks.
128
Temporary alternate duty assignments. If job accommodations are not possible, another option is to place the disabled employee in temporary alternate duty assignments. In sortie cases, provisions shall be made to allow employees to temporarily perform work in a different-job classification or even a different department. If a transitional work assignment results- in a dispute regarding work'r assignment between bargaining units, the' matter will ..be resolved • through the TPS-AFSCME Workers’ Compensation Committee. Alternate duty as-' signrrients shall be.' integrated into mainstream- operations • as much as possible. Jobs dr tasks for alternate duty assignment shall'be identified in advance and reviewed by both management and'labor for approval. Each alternate- duty job ■ shall be as-sessed/analyzed and' 'its physical requirements documented. Returning injured employees will be- matched with suitable alternate work; given his/her medical restrictions. Alternate duty assignments shall keep pace with the injured workers improvement and shall not be considered either long-term or permanent; -
Transitional work; An important part of both job accommodation and temporary duty ' assignments is a concept known as transitional work (work hardening)., With work hardening, injured employees may return to their regular job or an alternate job on a reduced schedule (in, keeping with their medical, restrictions), possibly working only a two-to three-hour work-day during early recovery. The number of hours gradually increases to keep pace, with the employee’s recovery and rehabilitation and is tailored' to the employee’s changing medical restrictions. Other'work hardening activities could include exercise programs to rebuild strength, and these iCouid be obtained off-site’in. a hospital or rehabilitation center setting. .
Coordinating with Treating Physician
A Toledo Pubjic Schools program physician^) and -medical facility(s) shall be se-• lected from submitted proposals and approved by the TPS-AFSCME Workers’ Compensation Committee;
Empioyeessustairiing-a .work related injury that requires; medical attention at a medical treatment facility (i.e., spfainsfisimple fractures,-etc.) will- receive; treatment' by a program physician 01; medical fadility. The pro-gram physician, along with rendering a diagnosis and prognosis,. will determine if the employee ;is» capable of returning to work, and under .which';,optjoh; as described above. This',plan will . include .any necessary reha-. bilitation plan to be followed, ■ the approximate-duration^ of any* returns«fo work assign-. ment, and indicate any physical .therapy the injured; emplqyee'may'require., The program physiciah(s) may . require follow-up medical evaluations. >	:	.
. Employees sustaining a work’related emer-gency/trauma injury (i.e , life threatening, severe body injury) may be treated at any medical. treatment facility, to, which emergency- medical personnel transport them. The employee, will subsequently ;be exam-. ined by the. program physician. The designated program, physician will determine if the employee is capable of returning to regular duties; or, if .restricted; returning to work under the. options as described,. above. This plan will include any necessary rehabilitation plan to be followed, the approximate duration of any return ;td. work •assignment, and indicate any physical; therapy, the injured employee may require. The program physicians) may ■ require follow-up medical evaluations.
An employee may, afterthe initial evaluation by the program; physician,, elect, to continue treatment with their personal physician providedthe program. physician’s'recommendations are followed. .The employee will sign, any necessary waivers to allow their per-. sohal physician(s) to release .information to the- pro-gram physician. The; employee’s personal physician will. be. the physician of
• record for Workers’ Compensation purposes.
Upon the program physician’s determination that an injury requires'the empjqyee to be off work,, wherein the employee reports said injury within fwentyifour.f?^).hours of the incident of illness or- injury, paid leave shall be granted by Management: . .
130
If the opinion of the employee’streating physician conflicts with that of the program physician and such opinion is presented to Management in three (3) work days of the program physician’s evaluation, and if the physicians cannot agree after consultation, the employee will be referred for a third opinion. A'panel of occupational health specialists for third opinions shall be established by the TPS-AFSCME Workers’ Compensation Committee. The third-opinion shall be determinative of the employee’s injury pay status under the Contract and shall not be subject to further appeal or review. If the third opinion is consistent with the program physician’s plan and the employee enters and later drops out of the plan, then Management can recoup injury wage continuation pay from the employee’s sick time accumulation. If the employee does not have a sufficient sick time balance, Management shall recoup the injury pay by reducing future sick leave eamings by one-half (1/2) until the injury pay is fully recouped.
Employees in' an alternate work assignment shall be evaluated at least once a week and any appropriate' modifications and upgrades shall be discussed with the program physician. A medical release from either the program or personal treating physician of an injured worker is required prior to returning an employee in an alternate work assignment to his/her original position.
Employees who sustain injury in the course of and arising out of their employment under such’ circumstances as would cause such injury or disability to be compensable under the Workers’ Compensation Laws of the State of Ohio who choose NOT to be evaluated by the .program physician or who choose NOT to follow that physician’s recommended program and go only to the physician of their choice are NOT entitled to any paid wage continuation benefits contained in this program.
Compensation
An employee working in the return to work/transitional work program will be compensated at their regular rate of pay. The employee will not be' entitled to bid rights
(except bus drivers.and bus aides), overtime
(unless the employee is performing within his/her bid. position and overtime does not violate'work restrictions), etc., since the employee is not fit to perform all of the duties of the classification. With regard to the rights of pther; employees, the .employee in the return to work/ transitional work program will be ■ deemed not to be working out of classification.
An employee shall be given up to two (2) hours release time, if heeded, to attend workers’ compensation hearings.
An injured employee will make every effort to schedule follow-up examinations and/or physical therapy during non-working hours. ■ These appointments shall be coordinated with the Toledo Public Schools’ Managed Care Organization. If scheduling during nonworking hours is not possible; an employee shall be given up to two (2). hours release time, if needed, for follow-up appointments and/or physical therapy appointments.
PermanentRestrictions/Disability
In the event that an employee cannot be returned to work due to permanent restrictions in their regular job or alternate position, or is applying for a disability retirement, and if the employee has followed the wage continuation program, Management will continue wage .continuation for a period of forty-five (45) days in addition to the two (2) years of wage continuation for-which the employee is eligible under Article 11.04 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Human Resources will continue to review the vacancy list every two (2) weeks for a position for which the employee would qualify. Where appropriate, if. the employee qualifies for BWC rehabilita-. tion, Management will cooperate with the BWC in allowing on-the-job training to help quajify the injured, worker for a position.
