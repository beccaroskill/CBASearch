Carpenters Reach Three-Year Contract With Seattle Dry wall Contractors for 2,000
Following a brief strike, dry wall trades in Seattle are working under new three-year agreements negotiated with the Northwest Wall and Ceiling Contractors Association covering some 2,000 tradesmen, according to union and contractor association reports.
Contracts providing increases of $5.40 per hour over term were approved by members of the Carpenters and Joiners of America.
The Carpenters struck June 12 and returned to work after a tentative agreement was reached. Pickets were honored by all crafts on projects where drywall work was being performed.
A federal mediator, who sat in on one bargaining session June 18, helped broker a Carpenters settlement June 19 that was ratified June 24. The union ended up with 35 cents more in wages and benefits in the economic settlement over a previously rejected contractor proposal. The employers agreed to withdraw a training requirement and related tiered-wage proposal that had been under contention.
Ed Charles, executive director of the Northwest Wall and Ceiling Contractors Association, said with regard to the negotiations, "labor-management relations probably were set back. We thought we had a better relationship."
Under drywall jurisdiction agreements, Carpenters install steel studs and hang drywall.
Carpenters Get 16.2 Percent Over Term
A three-year, $5.40 per hour settlement was approved by the Pacific Northwest Regional Council of Carpenters for about 2,000 dry wall hangers in western Washington, according to Robert Elliott, business representative for the council in Everett. The over-term increase was 16.2 percent, according to union data. The agreement applies to members of Lathing, Acoustical, Drywall Systems Carpenters Local 1144 headquartered in Seattle.
The settlement provides annual increases of $1.60 in the first year, $1.85 in the second year, and $1.95 in the third year but allows for reallocation between wages and benefits at six-month intervals throughout the contract term. The contract gives the union an option to move money between wages and health and welfare to anticipate what Elliott said was concern over higher health insurance costs.
Effective June 1, journeyman wages increased $1.35 to $27.82 per hour, plus increased employer payments of 20 cents to the health and welfare fund increase, now $2.90, and 5 cents more to the pension fund, now $3.87. Continued unchanged are employer payments

of 35 cents to the apprentice training fund. On Dec. 1 this year, the wage rate drops 25 cents to $27.57 per hour and the health and welfare fund advances 25 cents to $3.15.
On June 1,2002, the wage rate increases $1.60 to $29.17 per hour and the health-welfare payment increases 25 cents to $3.40. Under a Dec. 1,2002, contract adjustment, a 25 cent wage reduction is allocated to health and welfare, bringing the payment to $3.65.
On June 1,2003, the wage rate increases $1.95 to $30.87 per hour. No reallocation is scheduled for 2003.
