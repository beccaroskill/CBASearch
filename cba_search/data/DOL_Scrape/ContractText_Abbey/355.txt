8.3(d)(1) Application. When a workforce reduction is determined by management to be necessary within one or more job classification(s) and SMC(s) in a Major Organization, management will follow the applicable provisions of Article 9 and designate for layoff the required number of employees within such job classification(s) and SMC(s), beginning with the lowest retention rating. Exceptions to the designation for layoff may be made by the Company where it desires to retain by level a maximum of 20% or three employees, whichever number is greater, within an affected job family and SMC in the Major Organization as of the time of the most recent retention index review.

8.4(a)(4) Laid off employees who are prevented from meeting the conditions described in 8.4(a)(2)a, 8.4(a)(2)b, 8.4(a)(2)c, or 8.4(b)(4) solely due to medical disability, verified to the Company’s satisfaction by their personal physician, shall upon request be granted a waiver for rhe missed requiremeny(s).
8.4(b) Return to Active Employment.
8.4(b)(1) It is a mutual objective of the Company and the Union that laid off employees who have not been determined ineligible under 8.4(b)(3), 21.3(a), or the Letter of Understanding entitled “Designated Employees” be recalled to active employment, and a mutual desire that such recall into the Major Organization from which the employee was laid off be offered in approximate reverse order of layoff, with the objective of matching employee skills to job requirements as defined in 8.4(b)(l)c. Accordingly, employees on file for recall pursuant to 8.4(b)(4) will be offered return to active employment within the applicable job classification and SMC in approximate reverse order of layoff, prior to workforce additions from sources external to the Company, subject to the following limitations:
8.4(b)(l)a Eligible employees must set up and maintain a profile in the Company’s Employment Staffing System.
8.4(b)(l)b Nothing in 8.4 will preclude the Company from hiring from sources outside the Company when projected requirements exceed the number of employees in applicable job classification(si) and SMC(s) on file pursuant to 8.4(b)(4) who are eligible for an offer of recall.
8.4(b)(l)c In making recall and hiring decisions, the Company will review the specific qualifications of individuals on the basis of product familiarity, specialized experience or education, customer requirements, and the need to achieve the most efficient and accurate match of individual capabilities to job requirements. Consequently, not all Company decisions relating to recall and hiring can promote the mutual objective and desire stated above. Such decisions will not be subject to Article 3.
8.4(b)(2) The Company periodically will review with the Union the operation of 8.4(b)(1) in order to facilitate achievement of the mutual objective and desire stated above.
8.4(b)(3) Prior to layoff the Company will review employees to determine eligibility for reemployment consideration under 8.4(b)(1). The review will be limited to those employees for whom there is supporting documentation of performance deficiencies and/or a pattern of unacceptable conduct. The review will be performed by the cognizant Skill Team Captain for rhe employee’s job classification and SMC. Based on the review, the employee will be advised no later than the time the layoff notice is issued as to his or her eligibility for reemployment consideration under 8.4(b)(1). An employee determined ineligible may appeal such determination to the cognizant Skill Team Captain. If rhe appeal does not resolve the matter, the employee may then file a grievance in accordance with Article 3. Such grievance shall be limited to the first three (3) steps of the grievance procedure and shall not be subject to arbitration.
8.4(b)(4) Within forty-five (45) days of layoff, the employee must file for priority consideration for return to active employment. The Company will maintain a list of the names of all laid off employees, except those determined ineligible under 8.4(b)(3), those who have received layoff benefits as a lump sum under 21.3(a), and those identified under the Letter of Understanding entitled "Designated Employees.” In order to maintain such recall status, the employee must keep the Company informed of his or her interest in returning to active employment by submitting
18
a letter so stating. The employee must register by letter once each consec .itive calendar half-year	1
period (January through June; July through December) during the three-yv.ir period from the date	2
of layoff. Registration letters must be received within forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration	3
of the current half-year period and contain the individuals name, BEMS ID, address, and	4
telephone number. Individuals who do not properly register in each c.ilendar period will be	5
removed from the priority consideration eligibility list. Failure to register properly will result	6
in priority consideration being revoked for the remainder of the three-year period. Eligible	7
employees on file for return to active employment are subject to the prov dons of 8.4(a).	8
9
8.4(b)(5) If any employee on layoff status disputes his or her recall status cs reflected in Company 10 records, Company records shall prevail unless the employee can produce cither	11
12
(a)	a Company receipt, or	13
14
(b)	a properly addressed U.S. Postal Service return receipt ev:dencing filing of the 15 registration letter during the calendar period in question.	16
17
8.4(c) Salary and Level of Returning Laid Off Employees. Company offeis to laid off employees	18
for return to active employment will be extended at whatever salary and level is deemed by management 19 to be appropriate.

ARTICLE 9
CONTRACT PERSONNEL
Section 9.1 Purpose. The Company and the Union recognize that Contract personnel are a practical source of skilled temporary labor that allows the Company to acquire skilled engineering and technical support in a timely manner. The parties recognize that requirements for experienced Contract personnel must be balanced with the need to build and maintain the Boeing experience base and to support our mutual objective of workforce stabilization by minimizing employee layoffs. The parties further acknowledge limitations in rhe use of contract personnel during workforce reductions, as described in this Article 9, or when employees are on priority recall status, as described in Article 8.
Section 9.2 Definition. The term Contract personnel refers to temporary personnel provided by another business entity to perform work on Company premises under the daily control and supervision of Company management. The business entities that provide Contract personnel normally are in the business of providing temporary services (such as temporary employment agencies and staffing firms). Sources of contract personnel may also include businesses in the aerospace or related fields that make their employees available for temporary labor (so-called “industry assist" arrangements). Excluded from the definition of Contract personnel are consultants and their employees and employees of subcontractors or vendors.
Sec	tion 9.3 Procedures and Limitations.
9.3(a) The Company shall notify the Union of the basis for the need, the approximate number of Contract personnel required and the job family and skills management codes normally held by employees performing the type of work involved.
9.3(b) If based on a variety of factors (including but not limited to the nature of the assignment, the status of the program, the overall need for the skills at issue, and the purpose of using Contract personnel described above) the Company needs the skills supplied by Contract personnel on a long-term basis, the position shall be made available in accordance with the Boeing job posting process.
9.3(c) The Company and the Union agree that it is normally inappropriate to hire Contract personnel as direct hires in periods of surplus activity within a job family and skills management code. Deviations will be subject to approval by the appropriate senior level executive for the Major Organization. The granting of a deviation to allow such hiring shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 3.
9.3(d) The Joint Workforce Committee will review the duration of Contract personnel assignments as requested by the Union. In specific situations where contract labor assignments are in excess of eighteen (18) months, the Union may request that the Company provide a rationale for the duration of the assignment.
9.3(e) Contract personnel shall not be authorized to make decisions normally associated with management responsibility including salary determination, retention and discipline.
20
9.3	(f) No employee with an assigned retention rating of RI or R2	shall be la doff from a	surpl using	1
Major Organization while Contract personnel are still employed in that job	family	and skills	2
management code within that, or any other, Major Organization.	No employee	from a	surplusing	3
Major Organization shall be laid off while Contract personnel are	still employed	in that	job family	4
and skills management code within that Major Organization, except those emp oyees as to whom there 5 is supporting documentation of performance deficiencies.	6
7
9.3	(g) Exceptions to this Article to avoid significant disruption or impact <.n committed packages 8 of work will require rhe approval of the Enterprise Senior Workforce Managi r. Notification will be 9 provided to the Union as soon as practicable.	10
11
Section 9.4 Data. The Company shall supply the Union on a monthly basis >vith data that displays 12 the number of contract personnel utilized by job code and Major Organizatic i, so that compliance 13 with all limitations identified in 9.3 can be monitored. The data shall include names, BEMS 14 identification numbers, work location, job title, group/organization name, contra: i: labor type codes, and 15 start dates.	16

3	2/1/08	2/29/08	4.0%	Dependent on market analysis	2.0%
11.4(a)(2) Base salaries of eligible employees will be increased from a fund computed by multiplying the Increase Percentage by the total salaries of eligible employees. All eligible employees will participate in the selective review with minimum increases given as indicated in Table I. All increases will be effective on the Increase Effective Date of the review period. Eligible employees are defined as follows:
• Hired before November 1st; and
■ Classified in the bargaining unit on both the Fund Computation Date and the Increase Effective Date.
Employees on leave of absence for more than 180 days as of the Fund Computation Date are excluded from the Salary Review exercise.
11.4(a)(3) The Company in its sole discretion may selectively increase base salary rates of individual employees on effective dates other than the Increase Effective Dates in Table I (out-of-sequence increases).
11.4(a)(4) Annual Salary Data Review. The Company agrees to annually review the relationship of bargaining unit salaries to those of the market, and to share the results with rhe Union. Based on this year’s salary analysis, the Company agrees to supplement the 2006 Base Salary Adjustment Fund with a Market Adjustment Fund of 1.0%, as set forth in Table I.
The final determination as to the amount of any Market Adjustment Fund in 2007 and 2008 will be made by the Company and will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 3.
The Union agrees to keep confidential, and not disclose, any information provided pursuant to this Section 11.1 (a)(4) that the Company designates as not subject to disclosure.
11.4(b) Cost of Living Adjustments.
11.4(b)(1) Employees eligible to participate in the selective adjustment funds under 11.4(a) may also receive Cost of Living Adjustments to the extent such adjustments become effective under and in accordance with all of the terms, conditions and limitations stated in 11.4(b). The terms, definitions, and limitations stated in 11.4(a) and 11 4(b) also apply to such adjustments. Cost of Living Adjustments would be delivered to each eligible employee separately from those selective adjustment funds derived in 11.4(a). Cost of Living Adjustments would be effective on the dates specified in Table I.
11.4(b)(2) Determination of Cost of Living Adjustments shall be made in reference to the series U.S. city average “Consumer Price Index Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers” published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, with the following base period: 1982-1984 = 100, such Index being referred to herein as the BLS Index.

3
11.4(b)(4) During the life of this Agreement, Cost of Living Adjustments shall be computed	4
using the three-month average of the BLS Index for the periods spec Eied in Table II and the	5
corresponding BLS Index threshold values expressed as percentage increases over the 2005 base	6
period. The formula will be: percentage of Cost of Living Adjustment equals fifty (50) percent	7
of the percentage increase in the BLS Index, from the 2005 base period to the BLS Index	8
Comparison Quarter, that exceeds the BLS Index Threshold Percentage shown in Table 11. In	9
order to preclude recognition, on more than one effective date, of the sane percentage increase in	10
the BLS Index, any recognition on one effective date of a percentage increase over the applicable	11
BLS Index Threshold Percentage will cause that percentage to be set aside and disregarded in	12
ensuing computations, [e.g., if the BLS Index for October, November, and December, 2005	13
represented a 14.0 percent increase over the base period (yielding a 2.0 percent Cost of Living	14
Adjustment effective 3/3/2006), no Cost of Living Adjustment woulc result for the 3/2/2007	15
effective date unless, and to the extent, the BLS Index for October, N jvember, and December,	16
2006 represented an increase tn excess of 22.4 percent over the b;?:« period.] BLS Index	17
three-month averages, BLS Index increase percentages, and salary inc ease percentages will be	18
rounded to the nearest tenth, with five hundredths rounded upward tn the nearest tenth. The	19
BLS Index Threshold Percentages will be adjusted accordingly in the event of a market adjustment	20
in review periods 2 or 3.	21

Section 22.3 Application and Intent of Job Descriptions.
22.3(a) Occupations are the broadest categories of work. Job families describe the organization of tasks. Level descriptions guides identify various levels of responsibility within the job family. Each job classification is linked to Skills Management Codes (SMCs) within the SJC system. SMCs identify unique knowledge, skills, abilities, and environments within the job family.
22.3(b) Each occupation code, job family code, level code and SMC is defined by a unique description as identified within the SJC system.
22.3(c) An employee may perform some of the work of a higher level and/or some of the work of a lower level in the performance of the work assignment. It is not anticipated that any employee will perform all the duties set forth in the job description. Any work assignment may include:
22.3(c)(1) Teaching, instructing, leading or providing assistance to others.
22.3(c)(2) The use of equipment to facilitate the work assignment.
22.3(c)(3) The submission of completed work or any portion thereof for checking or approval.

38
SMC description appropriately covers a new or reorganized work assignment, either party may initiate	1
a request for evaluation and review through the Company’s SJC Maintenance Process. The Union will	2
participate as a voting member on the Company’s SJC team in the identification, evaluation, and review	3
of all proposed changes to job family descriptions and level guides for SJC job classifications listed in	4
Appendix A and their associated SMC descriptions. The Company will impl.ment changes (1) by	5
revising or deleting an existing job family, level guide, and/or SMC description; or (.!) by developing a new	6
job classification code, with supporting descriptions, which will be incorporated in- a Appendix A through	7
the issuance of an installation memo; or (3) the Company will establish a Temporary Job Classification	8
and/or SMC in accordance with 22.4(b).	9

within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the new or revised job level guide is forwarded by the	13
Company, challenge the level, setting forth in writing the reasons why the Union disagrees. 14 Otherwise, the level guide as determined by the Company will stand.	15
16
22.4(a)(1) If the Union challenges a new or revised level guide, the Company’s Director of 17 Compensation and Benefits, and his/her appointees, and Union representatives shall meet within 18 forty-five (45) calendar days of the request for the purpose of attempting i o reach agreement as to 19 the appropriate level guide. Disagreements between the Union and the C< npany shall be resolved 20 exclusively on the basis of the level guide assigned as a result of the Company’s application of 22.4.	21
A Union challenge shall in no way prevent or delay the Company from assigning personnel to the	22
job classification involved in the challenge.	23
24
22.4	(a)(2) If the Union challenges a new or revised level as submitted b| the Company, and it is	25
determined that the level is not correct, the Company will pay each employee involved at a rate	26
that is within the range of the corrected level, for the time in which the employee has performed 27 the duties of the corrected level.	28
29
22.4	(b) Temporary Job Family, Level, or SMC A temporary job family level, or SMC may be 30 established by the Company for new or revised work for which no current job family, level, or SMC 31 is applicable and which requires a period of time to stabilize job duties. Th i period will not exceed	32
ninety (90) days unless extended by mutual agreement. The Union will be notified of the effective	33
date and approximate duration. Employees will be assigned to such new work at not less than their	34
current levels until the job family and level is made permanent. If the temporary job family code or	35
level is made permanent at a higher level than the levels of the assigned em iloyees, these employees	36
will be paid within the range of the higher level for the time assigned o the work covered by	37
the permanent job family or level. Effective upon and after the Company’s determination that	38
a temporary job family and/or level has become permanent, the provisions of 22.4 shall apply.	39

employee bean accurate and timely reflection ofthe work assigned; however, the Company shall retain	44
the exclusive right to reassign employees as necessary to meet work requirements, and employees shall	45
comply with such reassignments notwithstanding the employees’ job classi ications of record at the	46
time. If the Company determines, by reference to the applicable job family description, that an	47
employee’s level is higher than is appropriate for the work to which the '. mployee is assigned, the	48
Company may permit the employee to continue in the same assignment v.ithout reclassification for	49
whatever period of time the Company elects; or the Company may add to the employee’s current	50
assignment or reassign the employee to other work for which the employe; s level is appropriate; or,	51
within the limitations stipulated in this Article 22, the Company may red. isify the employee to the	52
level that the Company deems appropriate for the work assigned.	53

22.5(c) Temporary promotions to a higher level will be made by management to accommodate short-term assignments anticipated to last more than thirty but not exceeding ninety continuous calendar days, or for such period longer than ninety continuous calendar days as may be designated by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. Temporary promotions will be distinguished from other promotions in the Company’s records systems, and for the purposes of 8.1(b), 8.2, and 8.3, an employee in such status shall be considered as still being in the job classification from which the temporary promotion occurred.
22.5(d) Employees may be reclassified to a higher level irrespective of their assigned retention rating.
22.5(c) Challenges Concerning Individual Employee’s Job Family, Level, or SMC.

Employees will attempt to resolve their classification first by discussion with first-line management. In the absence of a resolution mutually agreeable to both management and the employee, the following steps will be utilized in the review process:
22.5(e)(1) If the employee contends that a classification or level issue still exists, he or she along with his or her Union Representative will notify the Skill Team Manager to request a review.

Reclassifications to lower levels shall be subject to the limitations set forth in 22.6(a)(1) through 22.6(a)(9). Additionally, the limitations set forth in 22.6(b) shall apply to in-place reclassifications to lower levels, i.e., cases in which the assignment an employee is performing is altered such as to remove that portion of the assignment that previously justified the higher level.

Additional components of the Company’s Child Development Program include providing leadership to help improve the quality and availability of child care in communities where employees live and enhancing child care referral services through the existing Child and Elder Care referral program. Consideration will be given to adding other elements, such as collaboration by the referral program with day care providers and parents on evaluation of facilities and day care curriculum, assistance in extended/alternate hours, and assistance dealing with specific day care needs.
Finally, in an effort to assist employees’ work-related needs, the Company and the Union agree to meet at least quarterly (if requested) to exchange concerns related to dependent care issues, including but not limited to issues arising due to employee movement to new or relocated Company facilities.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
RELATING TO JOINT COMMITMENT ON EMPLOYMENT SECURITY
Reductions in employment in Commercial Airplanes have been very painful for everyone involved. The negative effects on both morale and productivity have been substantial. This, along with uncertain economic conditions, has resulted in a great deal of focus on both job security and our future.
SPEEA and rhe Company understand the impact these issues have had on employees, their careers and Boeings overall performance. Therefore, we have developed constructive approaches to address them. The foundation of our company’s success is the technical workforce, and it is clear that business success starts with commitment to people first. This commitment must be demonstrated by our actions, and our agreement to form a real partnership was an important step forward.
As we know, job security is enhanced by preparing ourselves to compete more effectively in a dynamic, global marketplace. SPEEA and the Company are joindy committed to a number of critical initiatives where we will work together for the mutual success of employees, SPEEA and Boeing. These include;
*	Breakthrough improvements in productivity and morale through effective utilization
*	Retention and transfer of key knowledge
•	Exploring more effective ways to link compensation to productivity
■	Improved approaches to increase stabilization of employment levels
•	Life-long learning as an investment in our knowledge and skills and an avenue for retraining
As we define and implement these key initiatives, our desire is that we use attrition whenever practical to accomplish any further reductions in employment and avoid layoffs in the future. We are committed to exploring new and innovative approaches to employment transitions. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, it is difficult to predict and control conditions that affect employment levels. Therefore, to the extent practical, the Company will provide job transition support and services to the technical workforce affected by employment reductions through, but not limited to, the following:
•	Skills retraining (Ed Wells Partnership)
•	Career Transition Services
•	Career Counseling
•	Resume preparation
*	Boeing Enterprise Staffing System (BESS)
■	Intellectual capital management
•	Skills management through Process Councils and Skill Teams
•	Partnerships with local educational institutions
■	Financial counseling
■	Medical benefits continuation
•	Income benefits continuation
64
We will continue programs for knowledge retention and transfer and skill retrair ing to support employees as Boeing transitions over time. We have committed additional funds to the Ed Wells Partnership. We will also commit to continued discussions in our Joint Workforce Comrr ittee on these important topics.
Lastly, we will to continue to work together to build a positive and successfol future for our company and our team.
Nothing in this Letter of Understanding will be subject ro the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article 3.

Annual certification of eligibility is required to continue coverage from age 19 through age 24.
In accordance with Federal law, the Company also provides medical and dental coverage to certain dependent children (called alternate recipients) if the Company is directed to do so by a qualified medical child support order (QMCSO) issued by a court or state agency of competent jurisdiction.
Documentation is required to request coverage for a child named in a QMCSO or a child for whom you have been given legal custody or guardianship, and may be required for a spouse or same-gender domestic partner and his or her children.
Special Provisions When Family Members Are Boeing Employees
If your spouse, same-gender domestic partner, or dependent child is employed by Boeing and eligible for any type of benefit plan offered by Boeing, your dependent must be covered separately under the plan or plans available to that person.
No person may be covered both as an employee (active or retired) and as a dependent under any type of plan offered by Boeing, and no person will be considered a dependent of more than 1 employee. Eligible dependents do not include other Boeing employees covered under any Company-sponsored plan providing medical, vision care, prescription drug, dental, or similar services. However, if your spouse is a part-time Boeing employee, retired, on approved leave of absence or layoff, or an employee of a subsidiary company, your spouse and eligible dependent children are considered eligible dependents if other Boeing coverage is waived. If you and your spouse both are Boeing employees and have dependent children, you both may elect medical and dental coverage for eligible children under 1 parents plans. As an alternative, parents may elect medical coverage for eligible children under 1 parents plan and dental coverage under the other parent’s plan. In either case, all eligible children must be enrolled in the same medical plan and the same dental plan (except as required by a QMCSO). The same provisions apply to a same-gender domestic partntr and his or her children.
Incapacitated Children
A disabled child age 25 or older may continue to be eligible (or enrolled if you are a newly eligible employee) if he or she is incapable of self-support due to any mental or physical condition that began before age 25. The child must be unmarried and dependent on you for principal support. Coverage may continue under the medical and dental plans for the duration of the incapacity as long as you continue to be enrolled in the plans and the child continues to meet these eligibility requirements.
Special applications for coverage are required for disabled dependent children age 25 or older.

Your benefit may be adjusted for other income benefits and rehabilitative employment. There is no minimum or maximum benefit payment under this plan.
Your benefits under this plan will be determined using the weekly salary reflected in the records of the Boeing Service Center for Health and Insurance Plans at the time your disability first begins (called your predisability earnings). If you are a part-time employee regularly scheduled to work more than 19 hours and less than 40 hours per week, your benefits under this plan will be determined using the average weekly salary that you actually earned for the 6 weeks immediately preceding your date of disability.
If you are actively at work and your weekly salary either increases or decreases, your short-term disability benefit amount will change automatically on the first day of the month after or coinciding with the date the Boeing Service Center is notified of the change in your salary. If you are not actively at work on the day the coverage change would become effective, the effective date for your new coverage amount will be delayed until the first day of the month after or coinciding with the day you return to work for 1 full day. Any retroactive change in your weekly salary will not retroactively change your disability coverage amount under this plan. If your period of disability has started, a change in your weekly salary will not change your benefit amount.
Eligibility for Benefit Payments
To be eligible for short-term disability benefit payments, you must be totally disabled; that is, you must be unable to perform the material duties of your regular occupation or other appropriate work the Company makes available and be earning 80% or less of your predisability earnings. You must be under the continuous care of a legally qualified physician throughout your period of total disability. In addition, the service representative may require you to be examined by a physician of its choice as often as is reasonably necessary to verify your continuous total disability
All determinations of total disability are made by the service representative within the terms of its contract with the Company.
Benefit Payment Period
Benefits begin after a waiting period of 7 consecutive days and continue while you are totally disabled, through the 26th week of disability Benefits stop when you no longer are disabled, at the end of your maximum benefit period, or when you die.
Separate Periods of Disability
A period of disability ends and benefit payments under this plan stop when you no longer are disabled or you return to work for 1 full day. If you incur a second period of disability, the cause of die second disability and the length of your recovery time between the disability periods will determine whether the second disability is treated as a temporary recovery (that is, a continuation of the first disability claim) or as a separate disability claim.
Your recovery will be considered a temporary recovery if, during the benefit payment period, you cease to be disabled for a total of 60 days or less.
The following provisions apply to periods of temporary recovery;
•	Only 1 benefit waiting period applies.
•	Your weekly salary used to determine your initial short-term disability benefit does not change.
•	No short-term disability benefits are paid for the period of temporary recovery.

•	Accelerated benefits paid under a life insurance policy.

During the period you ate receiving short-term disability benefit payments, you may earn up to a maximum of 100% of your predisability earnings through a combination of your short-term disability benefits plus earnings from approved rehabilitative employment.
The service representative must approve the rehabilitation program. If the sum of rehabilitative earnings, other income benefits, and short-term disability benefits exceeds your predisability earnings, the excess will be considered other income benefits and will reduce your weekly benefit under this plan.

•	Intentionally self-inflicted injury (while sane or insane).
•	Committing or attempting to commit an assault, battery, or felony.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM SUMMARY
The prescription drug program described here is available to active and retired employees and dependents enrolled in the Traditional Medical Plan.
This program offers 2 coverage options for prescription drugs and medicines;
•	Retail pharmacy card program - you can use the pharmacy card co facilitate reimbursement when you obtain covered prescriptions from a participating retail pharmacy.
*	Mail service program - called Medco By Mail.
A formulary applies to all retail pharmacy and mail order purchases. (A formulary is a list of drugs determined to be effective in both cost and treatment and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A nonformulary drug also may be effective for treatment, but Is not as cost-effective as formulary or generic drugs. A group of practicing physicians and pharmacists routinely reviews drugs to indude in the formulary. If clinical data show several drugs are equally effective, the most cost-effective drug usually is chosen. The formulary may change from time to time.)
There are 3 categories of prescription drug purchases:
•	Generic - drugs that are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts but usually cost less.
•	Brand-name formulary - brand-name drugs selected for the formulary based on cost and effectiveness.
•	Brand-name nonformulary - brand-name drugs not selected for the formulary.
The program includes utilization management services (see Pharmacy Management on page A-35) to help ensure cost-effective, clinically appropriate treatment.

Annual Deductible	24
25
Generally, the annual deductible is the amount you must pay out of your own pt :ket each year before	26
the plan begins to pay benefits for Class I services received from a nonnetwork provider and for all	27
(network and nonnetwork) Class II and III services. The following services and supp I ies are excluded from 28 the annual deductible:	29
30
• Class I services and supplies received from network providers.	31
32
• Class IV services and supplies received from network or non network providers.	33
34
This means that the plan begins to pay its coinsurance percentage immediately for these dental services.	35
The coinsurance percentage you pay for these services (if applicable) does not coui : toward your annual	36
deductible.	37
38
The plan has an individual annual deductible and a family annual deductible. If you nd 3 or more of your 39 dependents are covered under the plan, the family annual deductible limits the total annual deductible you 40 are required to pay in any benefit year.	41
42
The annual deductibles are shown in the Preferred Dental Plan Schedule of Benefit: above.	43
44
Coinsurance Percentages	45
46
For many services and supplies, you and the plan each pay a percentage of the ecognized fee. These	47
percentages are called coinsurance percentages. A coinsurance percentage does not ajpiy to	48
49
•	Class I services and supplies received from network providers.	50
51
•	Any amounts you pay tor services and supplies that the plan does not cover.	52
53
•	Any amounts that exceed the maximum allowable fees recognized by the plan.	54

Benefit Maximums
For Classes I, II, and III, an annual maximum applies to each covered person. The annual maximum amount is shown in the Preferred Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits above. You are responsible for paying any charges over the annual maximum benefit.
For Class IV, a lifetime maximum benefit applies to each covered person. The lifetime maximum benefit amount is shown in the Preferred Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.
Recognized Fees
This plan pays benefits based on the recognized fees. A recognized fee is the provider’s charge for a covered service, up to the plans maximum allowance. The amount of the recognized fee depends on whether you see a network or nonnetwork provider.
Under this plan, recognized fees are determined as follows:
•	For a network dentist, recognized fees are network-allowed charges.
•	For a member dentist who is a non network dentist, recognized fees are the fees that the dentist filed with the service representative for specific dental services and supplies. The service representative approves these fees and agrees to pay the plans nonneework benefit based on them.
•	For a non member dentist, recognized fees are the lesser of either
The amount charged by the dentist, or
The maximum allowable fee that the service representative approved for member dentists in the state where services are performed.
When alternative procedures are available, the plan covers the least expensive procedure. However, if your dentist submits satisfactory evidence to the service representative that a more expensive procedure is the only one professionally adequate for you, the plan will cover the more expensive procedure according to the appropriate benefit payment level.
Three Classes of Providers
The Preferred Dental Plan covers the charges of any licensed dental provider. The level of coverage is highest for network providers.
•	Network providers are members of Delta Dental and participate in the Delta Dental preferred provider network in your state,
•	Nonnetwork member providers are members of Delta Dental, but do not participate in the preferred provider network.
•	Nonmember providers are not members of Delta Dental.

SCHEDULED DENTAL PLAN SUMMARY
The Scheduled Dental Plan described here is available to active employees and their dependents. This plan helps you and your covered dependents pay for minor and major dental work, including routine examinations, crowns, and orthodontia.
The Scheduled Dental Plan reimburses you and your covered dependents for necessary dental care received from any licensed dentist based on a schedule of maximum covered charges. Your out-of-pocket cost will vary depending on the type of treatment you receive and, in many cases, on your dentist’s charges. This plan is available in all areas of the country.
Annual Deductible
Generally, the annual deductible is the amount you must pay out of your own pocket each benefit year before the plan begins to pay benefits. The deductible applies to most covered services and supplies. The following services and supplies are excluded from the annual deductible:
•	Examinations, including specialist examinations and emergency oral exams.
•	Fissure sealants.
•	Fluoride treatments.
*	Prophylaxis (teeth cleaning^ including periodontal cleanings.
*	X-rays.
This means that the plan begins to pay immediately for these baste dental services. Certain limits apply; see the Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Covered Services in this document.
This plan has an individual annual deductible and a family annual deductible. If you and 3 or more of your dependents are covered under the plan, the family annual deductible limits the total annual deductible you will be required to pay in any benefit year.
The annual deductibles are shown in the following Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Benefits.
Maximum Covered Charges
The plan pays the maximum covered charges listed in the Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Covered Services in this document for necessary dental services and supplies. If 2 or more covered services are received at the same time, the plan pays up to the scheduled benefit for each service, unless the schedule has a maximum fora particular combination of services.
In addition, certain other dental treatments may be covered even though they are not listed in the schedule; details are available from the service representative. (See Predetermination of Benefits in this document.)

Fissure sealants are coveted to age 16 only for permanent molars with chewing surfaces intact, no caries (decay), and no restorations. Repair or replacement of a fissure sealant within 3 years is considered part of the original service. Predetermination of Benefits Before you receive expensive dental treatment or services and supplies not listed in the Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Covered Services, you or your dentist should request a predetermination of benefits under the plan. This is a review by the service representative of your dentist’s description of planned treatment and expected charges, including charges for related services. The service representative will tell you in advance which procedures the plan will cover, the amount that the plan will pay toward treatment, and your out-of-pocket costs. The amount covered will be consistent with the allowances listed in the Scheduled Dental Plan Schedule of Covered Services. Scheduled Dental Plan Exclusions The Scheduled Dental Plan does not cover the following services or supplies: •	Anesthetics, administration of anesthetics, or anesthetic supplies or drugs, except general anesthesia when medically necessary.

Other coverage includes, whether insured or uninsured, another employer’s group benefit plan, other arrangement of individuals in a group, Medicare (to the extent allowed by law), individual insurance or health coverage, and insurance that pays without consideration of fault. The service representative has the right to obtain and release any information or recover any payment it considers necessary to administer these provisions. Order of Payment The primary plan pays its benefits first and pays its benefits without regard to benefits that may be payable under other plans. When another plan is the primary plan for health care coverage, the secondary plan pays
A-54
the difference between the benefits paid by the primary plan and what would nave been paid had the 1 secondary plan been pritnaty.	2
3
•	A plan is considered primary if	4
5
It has no order of benefit determination rules.	6
7
It has benefit determination rules that differ from coordination of benefit rules under state 8 regulations or, if not insured, that differ from these rules.	9
10
All plans chat cover an individual use the same coordination of benefi; rules, and under those 11 rules, the plan is primary.	12
13
•	If the aforementioned rules do not determine which group plan is considered primary, this plan applies	14
the following coordination of benefit rules:	15
16
A plan that covers a person as an employee, retiree, member, or subscrib.r pays before a plan that 17 covers the person as a dependent.	18
19
A plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an aciive employee is primary. 20 The plan that covers a person as a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee or as a dependent 21 of a retired, laid-off, or other inactive employee is secondary.	22
23
If a dependent child is covered under both parents’ group plans, the child’s primary coverage is 24 provided through the plan of the parent whose birthday comes first ir the calendar year, with 25 secondary coverage provided through the plan of the parent whose bir:hday comes later in the 26 calendar year.	27
28
If a dependent child's parents are divorced or separated and a court decree establishes financial 29 responsibility for the health care coverage of the child, the plan of the |: trent with such financial	30
responsibility is the primary plan of coverage. If the divorce decree s silent on the issue of	31
coverage, the following guidelines are used;	32
33
•	The plan of the parent with custody pays benefits first.	34
35
•	The plan of the spouse of the parent with custody pays second.	36
37
•	The plan of the parent without custody pays third.	38
39
•	The plan of the spouse of the parent without custody pays fourt h.	40
41
If none of the aforementioned rules establishes which group plan should pay first, then the 42 plan that has covered the person for the longest period is consideed the primary plan of 43 coverage.	44
45
Continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Re.onciliation Act of 1985	46
(COBRA), as amended, always is secondary to other coverage, except a- required by law.	47
48
If an employee or dependent is confined ro a hospital when first becoming covered under this 49 plan, this plan is secondary to any plan already covering the employee or dependent for the 50 eligible expenses related to that hospital admission. If the employee or dependent does not have 51 other coverage for hospital and related expenses, this plan is primary.	52
53
Benefits under a Company-sponsored medical or dental plan are not coordinated with benefits 54 paid under any other group plan offered by the Company. You can receive benefits from only 55 1 Company-sponsored medical or dental plan. However, when dental services performed by 56

a licensed dentist also are covered under the medical plan, the dental plan pays its benefits first and the medical plan is secondary.
Federal rules govern coordination of benefits with Medicare. In most cases, Medicare is secondary to a plan that covers a person as an active employee or dependent of an active employee. Medicare is primary in most other circumstances.
Medical Plans
The primary plan pays benefits without regard to any other plan. When the Company-sponsored plan is secondary, it adjusts benefits so that the total payable under both plans for expenses covered under the Company-sponsored plan is not more than would be payable under the Company-sponsored plan. Neither plan pays more than it would without coordination of benefits.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under individual insurance, group insurance, or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis.
Treatment of end-stage renal disease is covered by the Company-sponsored plan for the first 30 months following Medicare entitlement due to end-stage renal disease, and Medicare provides secondary coverage. After this 30-month period, Medicare provides primary coverage and the Company-sponsored plan provides secondary coverage.
Coordination of benefit provisions of Company-sponsored coordinated care plans and HMO plans vary by plan.
Dental Plans
Benefits payable under the Company-sponsored dental plans take into account any coverage (including orthodontic coverage) you or your eligible dependents have under other plans.
Plan means any plan providing medical, dental, vision care, hearing aid benefits, or treatment under group insurance or any other coverage for individuals in a group, whether on an insured or uninsured basis. However, plan excludes any medical plan sponsored by the Company. This means the dental plans pay first when dental expenses performed by a dentist also are covered by any medical plan sponsored by the Company.
The dental plans pay regular benefits in full or a reduced amount which, when added to benefits payable by another plan, equals 100% of allowable expenses.
WHEN AN INJURY OR ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANOTHER
In some situations, you or a covered dependent may be eligible to receive, as a result of an accident or illness, health care or disability benefits from an automobile insurance policy, homeowner’s insurance policy or other type of insurance policy, or from a responsible third party. In these cases, this plan will pay benefits if the covered person agrees to cooperate with the service representative in administering the plans subrogation rights.
If a person covered by this plan is injured by another party who is legally liable for the medical or dental bills or disability income, he or she may request this plan to pay its regular benefit on his or her behalf. In exchange the covered person agrees to:
•	Complete a claim and submit all bills related to the injury or illness to the responsible party or insurer.
•	Complete and submit all of the necessary information requested by the service representative.
A-56
•	Reimburse the plan if he or she recovers payment from the responsible pan / or any other source. 1 2
• Cooperate with the service representative’s efforts to recover from the ihird party any amounts 3 this plan pays in benefits related to the injury or illness, including any kuvsuit brought against the 4 responsible party or insurer.	5
6
This provision applies whenever you or a covered dependent is entitled to or recev'es benefits under this plan	7
and is also entitled to or receives compensation or any other funds from another party in connection with 8 that same disability or medical condition, whether by insurance, litigation, sett.ement, or otherwise. The 9 plan is entitled to such funds to the extent of plan benefits paid to or on behalf of the individual, whether	10
or not the individual has been “made whole," and without regard to any commo i fund doctrine. This plan	11
may recover such funds by constructive mist, equitable lien, right of subrogatic n, reimbursement, or any 12 other equitable or legal remedy.	13
14
If an individual fails, refuses, or neglects to reimburse the plan or otherwise com ply with the requirements	15
of this provision, or if payments are made under the plan based on fraudulent in or mat ion or otherwise in	16
excess of the amount necessary to satisfy the provisions of the plan, then, in addition to all other remedies	17
and rights of recovery that the plan may have, the plan has the right to terr inate or suspend benefit	18
payments and/or recover the reimbursement due to the plan by withholding, offsetting, and recovering 19 such amount out of any future plan benefits or amounts otherwise due from the plan to or with respect to	20
such individual. The plan also has the right in any proceeding at law or equity to :issert a constructive trust,	21
equitable lien, or any other equitable or legal remedy or recovery, against any and all persons who have	22
assets that the plan can claim rights to. The plan has the right of first recovery from any judgment,	23
settlement or other payment, regardless of whether the individual has been “rr ide whole,” and without 24 regard to any common fund doctrine.	25

Medical Coverage
Medical coverage for you and your dependents stops at the end of the calendar month your active employment terminates or the end of the last month required contributions are paid, whichever occurs first. If earlier, your dependent’s coverage stops at the end of the month in which he or she no longer qualifies as a dependent.
However, coverage may be continued under certain circumstances as specified below. Any required contributions must be paid during these periods for coverage to continue.
If you are terminating employment, the service representative will make available an individual program of medical benefits similar co those then being issued for group conversion. The benefits provided under the individual plan will not exactly duplicate the benefits provided under this group medical plan. This conversion privilege is also available to your covered dependents who cease to qualify under the group policy and to surviving covered dependents if you die. No evidence of insurability is required.
Dental Coverage
Dental coverage for you and your dependents stops at the end of the calendar month your active employment terminates. If earlier, your dependent’s coverage stops at the end of the calendar month in which he or she no longer qualifies as a dependent,

If you become totally disabled before coverage ends under the Package, the life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, and short-term disability benefits of the Package, which would have continued if you had stayed in the eligible class, will continue according to the terms governing benefits during leaves of absence instead of all other Company life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability benefits.

If medical and dental coverage for you and your dependents (including a same-gender domestic partner and his or her children) otherwise would terminate due to one of the following reasons, these benefits may continue for specified periods under Public Law 99-272, Title X, as amended, if the individual makes a timely request to the Company and pays the required contribution.
*	Reduction in hours or termination of employment for any reason.
•	Your death.

•	Your dependent’s loss of eligibility because you became eligible for Medicare.
A-58

Uniformed Services Leave of Absence
If you take a leave of absence for service in the U.S. uniformed services (including the military, National Guard, and the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service), you are covered under the Package until the end of the month in which your leave began. If you remain on an approved leave of absence, coverage under the Package continues until the end of the third foil calendar month of the leave as if you were an active employee on an approved nonmedical leave of absence.
If uniformed service extends beyond 3 months, you will be enrolled for COBRA coverage automatically as of the beginning of the fourth foil calendar month of your leave. You may continue COBRA coverage for an additional 21 months while your uniformed services leave continues, in accordance with your rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).
During a temporary period after September 11, 2001, military leave of absence can be extended for a total of 60 months, based on military orders. Your life insurance, medical, and dental coverage continue during this period. The cost of coverage during this 60-month period is the same as for active employees.
Your COBRA continuation period runs concurrently with coverage during USERRA leave.
If you return to active employment promptly after uniformed service, according to USERRA, the Package is reinstated on the date you return to the active payroll.
Changes in Leave Types
If your type of leave changes from a medical leave of absence to a nonmedical leave of absence (or vice versa), your periods of leave will be considered separate leaves of absence. However, if the type of your nonmedical leave of absence changes (for example, from family leave to personal leave), your maximum period of coverage in your new leave category will be reduced by the number of days or months for which you already received an extension of your active coverage.
Successive Periods of Leaves of Absence
Two medical leaves of absence separated by less than 30 days of continuous work are considered 1 leave of absence unless the second leave is due to entirely unrelated conditions.
