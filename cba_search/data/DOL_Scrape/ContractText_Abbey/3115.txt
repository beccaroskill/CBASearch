C.	Agreement
1.	This contract shall not be altered, amended or changed except in writing and signed by both the Board and the Union, which writings shall be appended hereto and become part hereof.

B.	Teachers will be assigned appropriate starting and dismissal times by the School Board. The work day of elementary teachers shall not exceed 7 hours. The work day of secondary teachers shall not exceed 7 1/2 hours, except as provided herein. It is recognized that while the work day for elementary teachers is !4 hour less than the work day for middle school and high school teachers, elementary teachers, in addition to classroom instruction, engage in a large amount of parental contact and paperwork.

Middle School Day for Classroom Teachers - 7 1/2 Hours
300 minutes of instruction (Daily average for the week)
30 minutes of uninterrupted lunch time
Duty free planning equivalent to one class period

C.	Schools which use a class schedule that results in less than 300 minutes of instruction shall each develop a plan for teachers to use the time difference as instruction-related time. The plan shall be developed collaboratively by the faculty and school administration. However, the final decision regarding the plan shall be within the sole discretion of the building principal, and much comply with the workday terms of this agreement. Any proposal that varies with the workday
13
requirements in the agreement must be processed under Article 11, Waiver Procedure/Charter School District. If the principal rejects a plan collaboratively developed by the faculty and the school administration, the rationale shall be explained to the staff.

E.	Uninterrupted lunch time shall not include assisting students in the lunch line.
F.	Consistent with Section 1012.22 (1)(h), Florida Statutes, the purpose of planning time is to allow classroom teachers time for planning during which they will not be directly responsible for student supervision. During such time, a building principal has the discretion to require the teacher to participate in meetings as may be necessary. However, teachers shall not be required by the building principal to attend inservice meetings, grade level meetings, department meetings or curriculum meetings during their planning time more than once per week, except in cases of emergency. The administration will continue it’s on going efforts in collaboration with the teachers to reduce paperwork required of teachers. If a principal believes it will be necessary to have teachers give up their planning time during the administration of FCAT or the PSAT, the principal shall first seek volunteers from the teaching staff with an appropriate schedule. If there are an insufficient number of volunteers, then the principal may designate the teachers who will be required to give up their planning time. Teachers called upon to give up their planning time during the administration of FCAT or the PSAT shall have the choice of receiving either an equivalent amount of time off on a duty day, or compensation at a rate of $15 per hour, rounded to the nearest quarter hour.
G.	For as long as the middle schools continue to have a professional service period, that professional service period will be used for team planning, parent conferences, faculty meetings, and other staff meetings. Reasonable efforts will be made to limit the number of meetings scheduled by the principal during the professional service period, and to allow teachers time on a daily basis prior to the student day to be used at the teacher’s discretion.
H.	Teachers may be required to remain after the end of the regular work day, without additional compensation to attend school related general faculty meetings, school department meetings, and/or grade level meetings. Faculty meetings may also be used to deliver inservice education. The building principal shall endeavor to ensure that such inservice is applicable to the entire staff. No teacher shall be required to attend more than one after-school faculty meeting, grade level meeting, department meeting, in-service meeting or curriculum meeting a week after the end of the regular work day without additional compensation in accordance with this agreement. Attendance at all other meetings beyond the regular work day for which compensation is not paid
14
shall be at the option of the individual teacher, except attendance may be required at one Open House annually, or as otherwise provided in this contract.
I.	The Principal shall endeavor to minimize the number of meetings to be held during or after the end of the regular workday, except when additional compensation is to be paid for such meetings. When possible, the building principal shall consider the use of email to communicate with teachers.
J.	Teachers shall be notified of all meetings 24 hours in advance, except in cases of emergency. All faculty meetings, except on Duty Days, shall begin no later than 15 minutes after the student dismissal time and shall last no longer than one hour or begin no earlier than one hour prior to the beginning of the student day. Except in emergency cases, a written agenda should be made available to those who will be attending prior to the beginning of any faculty meeting.
K.	As much as practicable, non-teaching duties shall not be performed by teachers. These non-teaching duties include collecting money (except as in Section M of this Article); supervising cafeterias and buses; delivering books; taking inventories; distributing supplies; duplicating instructional materials; similar clerical and/or custodial duties. When supervisory needs are not met by teacher volunteers, and supervision of corridors, rest rooms, stairways and other areas is warranted as determined by the Principal, it will be assigned on a scheduled rotating basis. In lieu of performing duties on a scheduled rotating basis, a faculty may, with the approval of the principal, select an alternative plan for the faculty to provide such student supervision. The faculty shall vote by secret ballot on such plan, and the currently identified VTO steward or other building representative appointed by VTO shall conduct the voting.
L.	Specific planning time, apart from student contact hours and travel time, will be provided to all itinerant classroom teachers.
M.	Teachers shall not be required to collect general instructional fees of a school-wide nature beyond the second week of school.
N.	Teacher attendance at sales presentations will be optional.
O.	Teachers shall not be required temporarily to perform administrative duties (out of the bargaining unit) above grade without appropriate compensation.
P.	Employees may engage in the private tutoring of students for profit, provided the following conditions exist:
1.	The teacher is not on duty status.
2.	The tutoring does not take place on school property or use district curriculum resources without permission of the principal.
3.	The teacher shall refrain from tutoring students enrolled in his instructional class.
Q.	The workday for district level bargaining unit members shall be seven and one half hours, including a half hour paid lunch. With the agreement of the supervisor, an employee may extend his or her workday to 8 hours for the purpose of having a one hour lunch, with one half hour of lunch being
15
unpaid. District level bargaining unit members will have, in the course of the week, 325 minutes of non-instructional time. This time is not required to be continuous.
R.	Early Release Days - Early release days for students will be scheduled as follows.
1.	On early release days, the student day shall be shortened by 60 minutes.
2.	A schedule for early release days not to exceed 32 days will be provided prior to the start of each school year, with Wednesday being the day of the week in which early release will be given. The class schedule that will be utilized on early release days will be discussed at a staff meeting during preplanning.
3.	The student time lost as a result of the early release days shall be added to the remaining student days in the year in order to avoid any loss of student learning time. No more than 10 minutes of additional instruction time shall be added to the student day in order to avoid any loss of student time. If this addition causes instruction time to exceed 300 minutes per day, such addition shall not be considered a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.
4.	Except as stated herein, all early release time shall be unscheduled and utilized at the
discretion of the teacher for job responsibilities such as, but not limited to, class planning and preparation, required paperwork, parent conferences, team planning, and record keeping. District or school level administrators shall schedule no mandatory meetings, in-service or other activities during release time, except that the release time on up to five (5) days in the 2006-2007 school year, and then six (6) days per year thereafter as long as there are at least thirty (30) early release days, may be used for required professional development. The Superintendent will identify the topic(s) for professional development. Understanding that teachers are an important part of the process, principals will seek input from their faculty in order to customize the delivery of training.
5.	The implementation of early release days shall not cause the teachers’ normal work day to be extended on non-early release days.

The Union shall be notified of the areas determined by the Superintendent to be a critical shortage area.
7.	If an affected teacher is placed in an out-of-field assignment, it shall be noted in the individuals file that such placement was due to the downsizing of an individual building staff.
D.	Vacancies
Vacancies shall be advertised for three (3) work days beginning the day after post planning and concluding July 31. From August 1 through post planning, vacancies shall be advertised for two (2) work days. The following vacancies are excluded from this requirement:

However, if an employee is employed in another school district at the time of recall, such employee shall be allowed to complete his contractual obligation before returning, but such employee must notify the Board in writing of the contractual obligation before returning. If an employee is unable to return within the fifteen (15) day
24
time limit because of illness or physical incapacity, such employee shall notify the Board in writing and shall return as soon as he is released from the doctor's care. Verification of illness or physical incapacity may be requested by the Assistant Superintendent for Personnel Services.

2.	Non-Tenured teachers shall be laid off prior to tenured teachers.
3.	In the event the School Board declares a district-wide reduction in force or recall after
layoff, such layoff or recall shall be executed based upon the qualifications and certification of the individual teacher being considered for reduction in force or recall. In the event that two employees are equal in qualifications, seniority shall control.
4.	Employees who have been laid off will be recalled on the basis of seniority with the employee with the most seniority on layoff being called back first using the criteria listed above.
5.	An employee on layoff shall remain on the recall list so long as he expresses a desire to do so to the Board, in writing, at least once per school year.

25
B.	General Responsibility
While on duty, a teacher has a general responsibility for student control and a major responsibility for controlling those students under his direct supervision. Similarly, the school principal has the ultimate responsibility of ensuring the enforcement of the district Code of Student Conduct and Discipline.
C.	School Disciplinary Procedure
1.	Teachers will be provided with a copy of the district Code of Student Conduct and Discipline at the beginning of each year.

5.	Transfer of a teacher to the appropriately designated organization frees his unit at the transferring organization to be filled by another teacher.

K.	Time Limits - The time limits set forth in the Sections D and E are to be considered essential to the grievance and arbitration procedure, and failure of the employee or the Union to meet any time limit set forth therein shall, unless the parties by mutual agreement have extended a time limit, constitute waiver of the grievance and acceptance of the Superintendent's or Board's position.

42
2.

Further, if a matter is pending before an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the grievance procedure, then the arbitrator is deprived of jurisdiction by the teacher seeking resolution in another forum or before the Board under a different procedure. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to grant a non-tenured teacher a right to continued employment beyond the term of the teacher's contract.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT
1.	Family and Medical Leave Act: All provisions of this article shall be interpreted so as to comply
with the requirements of the Family and Medical Leave Act and any amendments thereto, and with such federal regulations that may be issued under the Act.
2.	Employee Eligibility: Eligibility for these benefits shall be limited to those bargaining unit members that have been employed for at least the previous twelve (12) months by the Board, and worked at least 1,250 hours during that previous twelve (12) month period. Full-time teachers will be deemed to have met the 1,250 hour requirement.
3.	Terms of Leave: This leave shall be granted, in the following instances, for no more than a total of twelve (12) work weeks during the school year, July 1 through June 30. It shall be granted to eligible bargaining unit members for: (A) to care for the employee's child after birth, or following placement for adoption or foster care; (B) to care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent who has a serious health condition; or (C) for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job.
4.	Definitions: The definitions contained in the Act apply to this article.
5.	Group Medical Insurance: The Board shall continue an employee's group medical insurance in full effect during FMLA leave, to the same extent as when the employee worked. The employee shall be responsible for his or her share of insurance premium payment. Days of leave taken under the sick leave provision of the collective bargaining agreement shall be considered to be leave taken under the FMLA if taken for a serious health condition, for the purposes of this article, as shall any annual leave taken after the employee has exhausted his or her sick leave due to a serious health condition.
6.	Length of Unpaid Medical or Child Care Leave: The length of any unpaid medical or child care leave shall be determined by the collective bargaining agreement, provided such provisions, when considered with sick leave and annual leave used as stated above in paragraph 6, meet the required twelve (12) week allotment called for by the Act.
7.	Notice: If leave is taken to care for a newborn child or a child newly placed for adoption or foster care, the employee must provide notice of the leave in writing, to the personnel department and to his or her immediate supervisor, approximately thirty (30) days in advance, where possible. If a leave is needed for foreseeable medical care, it shall be requested, in writing at least thirty(30) days in advance, or as early as is practicable.
8.	Medical Certification: (A) Illness of Others: When requesting leave for a serious health condition of the employee's spouse, child or parent, the employee, upon request by the school district shall submit a statement from the patient's doctor which certifies that it is necessary for the employee
66
to care for the patient, and estimates the length of time the care is needed. (B) Illness of Employee: The Board may require a medical certification from eligible employees who request leave under the FMLA. Additional requests for medical certification shall be at the employer's expense and shall comply with the regulations under the Act.
9.	Intermittent Leave For Planned Medical Treatment: Unpaid medical leave with FMLA benefits may be taken on an intermittent basis when the employee, the employee's spouse, child or parent has a serious medical condition and it is foreseeable that the employee will need short periods of time off. Such intermittent leave days may be taken only when all sick leave and annual leave have been exhausted.
Intermittent leave may be taken in increments of one or more days or partial days at work. Intermittent leave will be granted, subject to the previously mentioned terms, if the health care provider certifies that it is medically necessary. The Board may require medical certification of the need, and the schedule or time of the treatment. The employee must give the Board thirty (30) days written notice of the need for the leave, if possible. If it is not possible to give thirty (30) days advance notice, the employee shall provide as much notice as is practicable.
10.	Employees must exhaust all sick leave prior to taking an unpaid leave covered by the FMLA, where the reason for the leave is covered by section (B) or (C) of paragraph number 3.
11.	Restoration: Upon return from an FMLA leave, the affected employee is entitled to be restored to the same position that the employee held when the leave started, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment.

Appendix E
TEACHER AUTHORITY TO REMOVE STUDENTS FROM THE CLASSROOM
PROCEDURE
Teachers and other instructional staff shall keep good order in the classroom and in other places in which they are assigned to supervise students, shall maintain an orderly and disciplined classroom with a positive and effective learning environment that maximizes learning and minimizes disruption, and shall work with parents and other school personnel to solve discipline problems in their classrooms.
Teachers and other instructional personnel shall establish and enforce reasonable classroom rules that treat all students equitably, that include consequences designed to change behavior, and which are consistent with school board policy and disciplinary rules established by the principal.
Teachers and other instructional personnel shall have the authority to request and receive training and other classroom assistance to improve skills in classroom management, violence prevention, conflict resolution, and other areas. They shall seek professional development to improve classroom management skills when data show that they are not effective in handling minor classroom disruptions. Any teacher who removes 25% of his or her total class enrollment shall be required to complete professional development to improve classroom management skills.
In accordance with law and within the framework of school board policy, teachers and other instructional personnel shall have the authority to undertake any of the following actions in managing student behavior and ensuring safety of all students in their classes and school and their opportunity to learn in an orderly and disciplined classroom:
•	Have disobedient, disrespectful, violent, abusive, uncontrollable, or disruptive students removed from the classroom for behavior management intervention;
•	Have violent, abusive, uncontrollable, or disruptive students directed for information or assistance from appropriate school or district personnel;
•	Assist in enforcing school rules on school property, during school sponsored transportation, and during school-sponsored activities;
•	Request and receive information as to the disposition of any referrals to the administration for violation of classroom or school rules;
•	Request and receive immediate assistance in classroom management if a student becomes uncontrollable or in case of emergency;
•	Press charges if there is reason to believe that a crime has been committed on school property, during school-sponsored transportation, or during school-sponsored activities; and
•	Use reasonable force, according to standards adopted by the State Board of Education, to protect himself or herself or others from injury.
A teacher may, in accordance with the procedure established at the school, send a student to the principal’s office to maintain effective discipline in the classroom and may recommend an appropriate consequence consistent with the Code of Student Conduct and Discipline. The principal shall respond by employing the teacher’s recommended consequence or a more serious disciplinary action if the student’s

history of disruptive behavior warrants it. If the principal determines that a lesser disciplinary action is appropriate, the principal should consult with the teacher prior to taking disciplinary action.
A teacher may remove from class a student whose behavior the teacher determines interferes with the teacher’s ability to communicate effectively with the students in the class or with the ability of the student’s classmates to learn. A teacher who does so shall provide the principal with a description of the behaviors and how they have interfered with the class prior to the end of the school day. If a teacher fails to provide the information in a timely manner, the teacher will be deemed to have agreed to having the student readmitted. Where student is removed under this procedure, the principal may place the student in another appropriate classroom, in in-school suspension, or in a dropout prevention and academic intervention program. The principal also may choose to recommend the student for out-of school suspension or expulsion, as appropriate. The student may be prohibited from attending or participating in school-sponsored or school-related activities. The principal may not return the student to that teacher’s class without the teacher’s consent unless the placement review committee (PRC) determines that the placement is the best or only available alternative, or the placement is required by the student’s individual education plan or section 504 plan. The decisions of the teacher, principal and PRC shall be made within five days of the removal of the student from the classroom.
When a student is classified as one with disabilities and receiving exceptional education services or is identified as a section 504 student, the principal/designee will, in consultation with ESE personnel or section 504 contact at the building and district level where necessary, review the IEP or the section 504 plan and determine if removing the student from class would violate the applicable plan. If the principal/designee determines that removal would violate the applicable plan, the teacher shall be so informed and the principal/designee will return the student to the classroom. If the referral involved an ESE student, the principal/designee shall notify the staffing specialist to convene the ESE staffing committee to review the student’s IEP. If the referral involved a section 504 student, the principal/designee shall notify the section 504 contact to review the section 504 accommodation. Changes in Florida statutes do not alter federal requirements related to students with disabilities.
A PRC shall be established at each school to determine placement of a student when a teacher withholds consent to the return of a student to the teacher’s class. The principal shall notify each teacher about the availability, the procedures, and the criteria for the PRC. The PRC membership shall include at least two teachers (one selected by the school’s faculty, with a standing member and an alternate being elected at the start of the year, and one selected by the teacher who has removed the student) and one member of the school staff selected by the principal. Additional staff members may be appointed at the discretion of the principal (e.g. guidance counselor, assistant principal). The principal may also serve on the PRC. The teacher who withheld consent to readmitting the student may not serve on the committee.

SICK LEAVE BANK PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES
The purpose of the Sick Leave Bank is to enable employers to provide protection in cases of long-term catastrophic illness and to encourage employees to “save” sick leave for a valuable future economic benefit (terminal leave.) Membership in the Sick Leave Bank must precede the diagnosis date for the current illness for which days are being applied.
1.	To become a member of the Sick Leave Bank, an employee must have accumulated five (5) sick leave days. Following the accumulation of five (5) sick leave days, the employee may join the Sick Leave Bank by donating one (1) sick leave day to sick leave bank.
2.	To utilize “bank days” the member must first use all other accumulated sick leave days.
3.	Members may be granted four times the number of days they have accumulated at the beginning
of their illness to a maximum of one hundred (100) days.
4.	Following any use of the Sick Leave Bank provisions, the employee will have to rejoin the Sick Leave Bank as indicated in #1 above.
5.	Days from the bank may only be used for extended personal physical, or mental disability.
6.	The bank will be administered by the Union as follows:
Three (3) teachers appointed by the VTO President
7.	In cases of extreme hardship, the bank administrators may grant additional days voluntarily given by other Sick Leave Bank members. Any unused donated days will be returned to the Sick Leave Bank.
8.	Members with zero accumulated sick days will have the option of days being donated on their behalf, which will be monitored, by the Sick Leave Bank.
9.	If the bank is depleted during a school year, members may be assessed up to two (2) additional days.
10.	The bank administrators will determine the eligibility of membership in the Sick Leave Bank.
11.	A list of all Sick Leave Bank members shall be provided to the VTO upon written request.
12.	Forms for enrollment shall be available through the VTO office.
