Table of Contents
The Memorandum of Agreement hereinafter referred to as the "Agreement" is established by agreement at San Jose, California, this 7th day of December, 2005 by and between the City of San Jose, hereinafter referred to as the "City" or "Management" and the San Jose Police Officers’ Association, hereinafter referred to as the "Employee Organization" or "Organization". The use of the term "Memorandum of Agreement" or "Agreement" is to be considered the same as the term Memorandum of Understanding contained in Section 3505.1 of the "Meyers-Milias-Brown Act."
The parties agree that the purpose of this Memorandum of Agreement is: To promote and provide harmonious relations, cooperation and understanding between the City and the employees covered herein; to provide an orderly and equitable means of resolving differences which may arise under this Agreement, and to set forth the full agreements of the parties reached as a result of meeting and conferring in good faith regarding wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment of the employees represented by the San Jose Police Officers’ Association.
ARTICLE 1	TERM
1.1	This Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter, "Agreement") shall become effective March 1, 2004, except where otherwise provided, and shall remain in effect through June 30, 2008. No amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless reduced to writing and signed by duly authorized representative(s) of the parties.
1.2	This agreement is premised on the parties’ mutual belief that they have the power to independently contract for retirement benefit changes, even if those retirement benefit changes differ from those eventually negotiated or awarded to employees exclusively represented by IAFF, Local 230. In the event that the parties are required to participate in a separate “tripartite” arbitration process covering retirement benefits during the term of this MOA, the parties agree as follows:
(a)	If the POA and IAFF, Local 230 are required to make a “Joint Proposal”:
1)	The POA will not agree to make any “Joint Proposal” that includes any benefit change other than the “4% after 20 years” benefit set forth in Article 49 with an effective date of July 1, 2006; and
2)	The City’s proposal will consist solely of the “4% after 20 years” benefit set forth in Article 49 with an effective date of July 1, 2006.
(b)	If the POA and IAFF, Local 230 are permitted to make separate proposals and be awarded separate benefits and the City is permitted to make separate proposals to POA and IAFF, Local 230:
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 1
1)	The POA’s proposal will consist solely of the “4% after 20 years” benefit set forth in Article 49 with an effective date of July 1, 2006; and
2)	The City’s proposal to POA will consist solely of the “4% after 20 years” benefit set forth in Article 49 with an effective date of July 1, 2006. This provision is not intended to limit the City’s ability to make different proposals to IAFF, Local 230.
In the event that neither of the foregoing occur, the parties will meet and confer over how to proceed and will not proceed to a “tripartite” arbitration process covering retirement benefits until they have reached an agreement regarding how to proceed.

53.2	Catastrophic Illness Time Donation (CITD):
53.2.2	Eligibility to Receive Donations
This section shall apply when an eligible City employee must be absent from work for an extended period of time due to a non-job related illness or injury which is medically catastrophic (e.g., the illness/injury is
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 69
extremely serious, totally incapacitating, and life-threatening) and the employee has exhausted all paid leave and meets all criteria listed below. CITD leave may be considered leave under the Family Medical Leave Act and/or the California Family Rights Act.
a.	The employee is an active employee (full or part-time benefited) who is eligible for paid leave, and;
b.	The employee has exhausted all paid leave (personal leave, sick leave, vacation, compensatory time and executive leave) or will have exhausted all paid leave by the time donations can be processed, and either;
c.	The employee experiences a non-job related catastrophic illness or injury, which has required him or her to be absent for a period of thirty (30) consecutive or cumulative days or more, within the previous six (6) months. The expected condition and term of absence must be verified by the City’s physician in consultation with the employee’s treating physician, or;

1)	A legal spouse or a registered Domestic Partner and is receiving City health benefits
2)	A person under 18 years of age, or a person incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability who is a biological, adopted, foster or step child, or a ward of the employee

b.	City employees may voluntarily donate accrued vacation and/or compensatory time either:
1)	to a specific eligible employee or
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 70
2)	to a non-specified eligible employee to be utilized by any eligible employee should the need arise
53.2.4	Relationship to Salary Continuation (Long-Term Disability) Insurance
Voluntary donations of paid leave are intended to assist the seriously ill or injured employee who would otherwise have no regular income. For employees who are covered by the City’s group insurance plan for salary continuation (long-term disability) or the SJPOA Insurance and Benefits Trust, donated leave is treated as sick leave, and is therefore an offset to benefits in accordance with that insurance plan.
53.2.5	Excess Donated Time
Donated time will be processed in increments of no more hours than the employee can use in a three month period. In the event the employee returns to work before using all of his/her processed donations, the recipient will retain the excess as sick leave. Donations may not be revoked.
53.2.6	Approval to Receive Donations
The Employee Services Department will review any CITD request submitted and determine whether the process of donation of paid leave may proceed based on the provisions of this section. The City’s physician will review documentation of the employee’s or eligible family member’s medical condition, in consultation with the treating physician, and determine whether or not the condition meets the medical criteria of a catastrophic illness or injury. Donated time may not be retroactive (i.e., donated time cannot be applied to any employee absence prior to the date on which the required medical documentation is received by the Employee Services Department.) No donations will be accepted until the City’s physician has qualified the recipient’s or his/her family member’s condition as medically catastrophic, and the Employee Services Department has verified that all other criteria are met. When CITD designation has been approved, a donation form specifically for the ill or injured employee will be created by Employee Services. The CITD form shall not be distributed prior to specific case approval. The employee or his/her Department Director will designate a CITD Liaison to distribute donation forms and facilitate the acceptance of donated time after CITD designation has occurred.
53.2.7	Approval to Make Donations
Donations cannot be made until the Employee Services Department has determined that the intended recipient employee is eligible to receive
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 71
donations. The employee or his/her Department Director will designate a CITD Coordinator to distribute donation forms and facilitate the acceptance of donated time.
53.2.8	Maximum Donation
A recipient employee is eligible to receive a total maximum of 1040 hours of donated leave time during their employment with the City. The amount of donated leave available to an employee shall be appropriately prorated for Part-time benefited employees.
If an eligible employee exhausts the maximum 1040 hours of donated leave and if the employee’s or eligible family member’s catastrophic illness or injury prevents the employee from returning to work, the employee or the employee’s designee may apply for an increase to the maximum to 2080 total hours of donated leave. Application for the increased maximum shall be made to the City Manager through the Office of Employee Relations. The application shall include a recommendation from the Department Director and shall be evaluated based upon the operational impact on the employee’s department and subject to the re-verification of the medical condition to determine if the illness or injury still qualifies and prevents the employee from returning to work. The decision of the City Manager regarding an application of an increase to the maximum donated leave is final and is not subject to appeal.
53.2.9	Donations to Non-Specified Employee(s)
Donations to a non-specified employee can be made at any time. Donations designated as non-specified will not be deducted from the donor employee’s compensatory and/or vacation leave balances until such time as they have been awarded to an eligible employee. The donation is to be rescinded if donated hours are not converted before the end of pay period 24 of each payroll calendar year. Donor employees may elect to have their unused person-to-person donations designated as non-specific employee donations. Employees requesting donations established as non-specific employee donations shall be utilized on a first come, first served basis. Employees are required to exhaust all of their person-to-person time donations before being eligible for non-specific employee donations.
53.2.10	Method of Converting Donated Hours
Donations may be made in 1/2-hour increments and will be transferred on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Each donor will complete a donation form provided by the Employee Services Department on which the donor
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 72
	specifies the number of hours to be donated. The dollar value of the time will be calculated at the donor’s current pay rate. This dollar value will then be converted to sick leave hours for the recipient, to the nearest 1/2 hour, based on the recipient’s current pay rate. 53.2.11 Confidentiality Donations will be entirely voluntary and confidential. Care will be taken by everyone involved in the process to emphasize the voluntary nature of contributions and to maintain the confidentiality of employee medical information. Names of donors will be kept confidential, except where the donor requests that his or her identity be made known to the recipient. No information regarding the nature of the illness or injury will be divulged to other employees by anyone with access to such information.
53.3	Personal Illness/Injury Time Donation (PITD): 53.3.1	Eligibility to Receive Donations This section shall apply when an eligible City employee must be absent from work due to a non-job related personal illness or injury and the employee has exhausted all paid leave. Employees are eligible for donations for absences of at least one (1) day, up to a maximum of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days immediately following an initial absence of at least thirty (30) consecutive calendar days. Donations to eligible employees under the PITD are limited to no more than what the employee can use in a one-month period (maximum of twenty-two (22) working days) for the same qualifying illness or injury. PITD leave may be considered Family Medical Leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). The employee must be an active employee (full or part-time benefited) who is eligible for paid leave. The employee must have exhausted all accrued paid leave (sick leave, vacation, compensatory time, personal leave and executive leave) or will have exhausted all paid leave by the time donations can be processed. Employees who have received donations under the PITD program must wait at least one calendar year before reapplying for PITD donations. The City reserves the right to deny PITD requests. 53.3.2	Criteria for Donating Time City employees will be able to voluntarily donate accrued vacation and/or compensatory time for transfer to another eligible employee in situations that meet all of the following criteria;
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 73
a.	The donor is an active employee (full or part-time benefited) who is eligible for paid leave.
b.	The donor has sufficient accrued compensatory or vacation time to cover the requested transfer.
53.3.	3 Relationship to Salary Continuation (Long-Term Disability) Insurance
Voluntary donations of paid leave are intended to assist the ill or injured employee who would otherwise have no regular income. For employees who are covered by the City’s group insurance plan for salary continuation (long-term disability) or the SJPOA Insurance and Benefits Trust, donated leave is treated as sick leave, and is therefore an offset to benefits in accordance with that insurance plan.
53.3.	4 Excess Donated Time
Donated time will be processed in increments of no more hours than the employee can use in a one month period. In the event the employee returns to work before using all of his/her processed donations, the recipient will retain the excess as sick leave. Donations transferred to the recipient’s sick leave balance may not be revoked.
53.3.	5 Approval to Receive Donations
The Employee Services Department shall be provided with medical verification that the employee’s condition will require more than thirty consecutive calendar day absence from work. The City reserves the right to request additional medical verification. No donations will be accepted until the Employee Services Department has received this medical documentation and all other criteria are met. Donated time may not be retroactive (i.e., donated time cannot be applied to any employee absence prior to the date on which the required medical documentation is received by the Employee Services Department).
53.3.	6 Approval to Make Donations
Donations cannot be made until the Employee Services Department has received medical verification that the employee’s illness or injury will require at least a thirty (30) consecutive calendar day absence from work. The employee or his/her Department Director will designate a PITD Coordinator to distribute donation forms and facilitate the acceptance of donated time.
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 74
53.3.	7 Maximum Donation
A recipient employee is eligible to receive a total maximum donation of leave of the total number of hours that the recipient employee can use in a one month period during their employment with the City. The amount of donated leave available to an employee shall be appropriately prorated for Part-time benefited employees.
53.3.	8 Method of Converting Donated Hours
Donations may be made in 1/2 hour increments and will be transferred on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Each donor will complete a donation form provided by the Employee Services Department which specifies the number of hours to be donated. The dollar value of the time will be calculated at the donor’s current pay rate. This dollar value will then be converted to sick leave hours for the recipient, to the nearest 1/2 hour, based on the recipient’s current pay rate.
53.3.	9 Confidentiality
Donations will be entirely voluntary and confidential. Care will be taken by everyone involved in the process to emphasize the voluntary nature of contributions and to maintain the confidentiality of employee medical information. Names of donors will be kept confidential, except where the donor requests that his or her identity be made known to the recipient. No information regarding the nature of the illness or injury will be divulged to other employees by anyone with access to such information.
ARTICLE 54	SEPARABILITY
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that any article, or subsections thereof, of this Agreement shall be declared invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by any applicable State or Federal law or regulation, or should a decision by any court of competent jurisdiction or any applicable State or Federal law or regulation diminish the benefits provided by this Agreement, or impose additional obligations on the City, the parties shall meet and confer or negotiate on the Article or subsections thereof affected. If they are unable to come to an agreement on the matter, the provisions of Section 1111 of the Charter shall apply. All other provisions of this Agreement not affected shall continue in full force and effect.
ARTICLE 55	MEET AND CONFER AND INTEREST ARBITRATION
The meet and confer process between the City and the Police Officers’ Association shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures:
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 75
55.1	Meet and Confer. The goal of the meet and confer process is to reach a voluntary settlement which adequately addresses the interests of both parties. The parties shall be committed to conducting the process in good faith, treating all participants with respect and honoring each others’ time by providing advance notice of scheduled and cancelled meeting dates.
55.2	Mediation. In the event impasse is declared regarding contract negotiations for a new MOA, the parties will participate in mediation prior to arbitration in an attempt to resolve the dispute. However, the parties shall arrange for an arbitrator and schedule arbitration dates in advance (arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with City Charter section 1111). If the mediation process has not been completed within a 90-day period, beginning with the first day of impasse as determined by written notification of impasse by either party, either party may proceed to arbitration. If the parties do not proceed to arbitration, the arbitrator shall be cancelled.
55.3	If the parties remain at impasse following mediation, the POA may choose to make a presentation during a public City Council meeting without the requirement of a Council response.
ARTICLE 56	PROBATIONARY PERIOD
56.1	With respect to the method for calculating the end of the probationary period for employees within the SJPOA bargaining unit, vacation time, sick time, disability leave, lost time, and all other periods of absence with or without pay shall not be considered to be part of the employee’s service to the City and shall not count toward the calculation of the employee’s probationary period except as specified in 56.3 below.
56.2	Time spent on modified/light duty shall not count toward calculation of the employee’s probationary period, other than employees serving a promotional probationary period in the classification of Sergeant and above who are in permanent modified duty positions.
56.3	Compensatory time off that is mandated in writing by the City pursuant to Section 13.6.5 of the Memorandum of Agreement shall be deemed to be part of the employee’s service to the city and shall count toward the calculation of the employee’s probationary period. Additionally, voluntary approved compensatory “time off”, up to and including eighty (80) hours in the aggregate, whether taken in sort or extended increments shall be deemed to be part of the employee’s probationary period. Any and all voluntary approved compensatory “time off” in excess of eighty (80) hours shall not be considered to be part of the employee’s service to the City and shall not count toward the calculation of the employee’s probationary period.
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 76
56.4	The City agrees to indemnify the Association as to any liability arising solely from the implementation of Section 56.2. The indemnification also extends to the act of Association’s cooperation in the defense of this section before an forum.
The City will not indemnify the Association for any liability caused by separate acts or omissions independent of the acts described in Section 56.2. For example, the City would not indemnify the Association if the Association is found liable for misrepresentations or nondisclosures to its membership, or liable for any breach of duty of fair representation other than a breach predicted solely on the acts or omissions described in Section 56.2.
The City will not pay attorneys' fees to or on behalf of the Association but at the sole option of the Association, the City Attorney's Office will defend the Association against claims or lawsuits arising from the implementation of Section 56.2 so long as the Association waives any conflict of interest, actual or potential, arising out of representation by such counsel. However, legal counsel for the City shall keep Association informed of all developments particularly as to any possible settlement of the dispute/litigation. The Association shall have the right to participate in the defense.
The City's obligation to indemnify, as described above, is conditioned upon the City having primary authority for the defense. The Association and the City attorneys shall cooperate in the defense of the case. The Association may not agree to any settlement involving its financial liability without consent of the City.

EXHIBIT II
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM
The purpose of the Substance Abuse Program is to provide guidelines for selfreferral and rehabilitation options for employees that may be experiencing a problem with alcohol and/or drug use as well as “for cause” alcohol/drug testing for the detection and deterrence of alcohol and drug abuse. It also outlines the responsibilities of management and employees.
It is the policy of the City of San Jose to maintain a safe, healthful and productive work environment for all employees. To that end the City will act to eliminate any substance abuse (alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription drugs or any other substance which could impair an employee's ability to safely and effectively perform the functions of the particular job) which increases the potential for accidents, absenteeism, substandard performance, poor employee morale or tends to undermine public confidence in the City's workforce. All persons covered by this policy should be aware that violations of the policy may result in discipline, up to and including termination.
In recognition of the serious duty entrusted to employees of the City, with knowledge that drugs and alcohol do hinder a person's ability to perform duties safely and effectively, the following policy against drug and alcohol abuse is hereby adopted by the City of San Jose.
Application
A.	Personnel
1.	Full-time and permanent, benefited part-time employees represented by: San Jose Police Officers’ Association.
B.	Substances
1.	alcohol;
2.	illegal drugs; and
3.	prescription drugs and other substances which may impair an employee's ability to effectively perform the functions of the job.
Policy
It is the policy of the City that employees:
•	shall not report to work under the influence of alcohol or drugs or exhibit symptoms of alcohol or drug use;
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 81
•	while on duty shall not use, possess, sell or provide drugs or alcohol;
•	shall not have their ability to work or be paid stand-by impaired as a result of the use of alcohol or drugs.
An employee is required to notify his/her supervisor when any medications or drug he/she is taking create an unsafe and dangerous situation.
In the event there are questions regarding an employee's ability to safely and effectively perform assigned duties while using such medications or drugs, clearance from the City physician will be required. If an employee is prescribed medication or drugs in relation to a work-related injury or illness, the doctor treating the employee for the work-related injury or illness shall provide the required clearance.
The City has established an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to assist those employees who voluntarily seek help for alcohol or drug problems. Employees could contact their supervisors or the Department of Employee Services for additional information.
Employees reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as described under the Management Responsibilities and Guidelines Section, paragraph B, shall be prevented from engaging in further work and shall be instructed to wait for a reasonable time until an authorized department representative can transport the employee from the worksite to home or an appropriate medical facility.
Violations of this policy shall be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge for serious or repeated infractions. Refusal to submit immediately to an alcohol and/or drug analysis when requested by management will constitute insubordination which alone will form a basis for discipline.
Employee Responsibilities
An employee must:
A.	not report to work while his/her ability to perform job duties is impaired due to alcohol or drug use;
B.	not possess or use, or have the odor of alcohol or drugs on his/her breath during working hours while operating any City vehicle or equipment;
C.	not directly or through a third party sell or provide drugs or alcohol to any person or to any other employee while either employee or both employees are on duty, or paid stand-by;
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 82
D.	submit immediately to reasonable requests for alcohol and/or drugs analysis when requested by an authorized representative of a department director and may request union representation;
E.	notify his/her supervisor, before operating City equipment, when taking any medications or drugs, prescription or non-prescription, which may create an unsafe or dangerous situation for the public or the employee's co-workers, including but not limited to valium, muscle relaxants, and painkillers, and
F.	provide within 24 hours of request a current valid prescription for any drug or medication identified when a drug screen/analysis is positive. The prescription must be in the employee's name.
Management Responsibilities and Guidelines
A.	Managers and supervisors are responsible for consistent enforcement of this policy, i.e., that refusal constitutes insubordination that will result in disciplinary action. Any supervisor who knowingly permits a violation of this policy by employees under his/her direct supervision shall be subject to disciplinary action.
B.	A department director or authorized representative may request that an employee submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis when a manager or supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. "Reasonable suspicion" is a belief based on objective and articulable facts sufficient to lead a reasonable prudent supervisor to suspect that an employee is under the influence or drugs or alcohol so that the employee's ability to perform the functions of the job is impaired or so that the employee's ability to perform his/her job safely is reduced.
For example, any of the following, alone or in combination, may constitute reasonable suspicion:
1.	A pattern of documented abnormal or erratic behavior;
2.	Direct observation of drug or alcohol use; or information provided by a reliable and credible source that an employee has engaged in drug or alcohol use, the identity of which source shall be available to the employee and the Union;
3.	Presence of the mental or physical symptoms of drug or alcohol use (e.g., glassy or bloodshot eyes, alcohol odor on breath, slurred speech, poor coordination and/or reflexes);
4.	A work related accident in conjunction with other facts which together support reasonable cause.
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 83
C.	Any manager or supervisor should immediately notify another supervisor to meet him/her to observe the employee's behavior prior to requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis. If the employee requests union representation, the employee will be allowed the opportunity to secure such representation. If an employee believes an employee not under his supervision has a problem and should be tested or referred, he/she should contact the Office of Employee Relations (OER) who will notify the Department Director or authorized representative. Should the Department Director or authorized representative concur that the employee appears to be in violation of the policy, the following procedures shall immediately be applied:
1.	The manager or supervisor shall document in writing the facts constituting reasonable suspicion that the employee in question is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs. This information shall be stated on the Investigation Documentation Memorandum (IDM).
2.	Any manager or supervisor requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis shall be responsible for the employee's transport to the City's designated Employee Health Services or after-hours facility where a drug and/or alcohol test will be requested.
3.	Any manager or supervisor encountering an employee who refuses to submit to a drug and/or alcohol analysis upon request shall remind the employee of the requirements and consequences of this policy. The manager or supervisor should ask the employee to wait a reasonable time until an authorized City representative can transport the employee home.
4.	Managers and supervisors shall not physically search employees.
5.	Managers and supervisors shall notify the Police Department when they have reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee may have illegal drugs in his or her possession or in an area not jointly or fully controlled by the City.
6.	Managers and supervisors shall not confiscate, without consent, prescription drugs or medications from an employee who has a prescription.
7.	The employee will be informed of the requirement that he or she undergo testing in a confidential manner, by one of the supervisory employees who made the reasonable suspicion determination.
D.	A manager or supervisor may require an employee to attend an initial screening session with the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) as an alternative to drug or alcohol testing. The employee shall provide proof of attending the initial appointment. Failure to attend or to provide proof of such attendance may
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 84
subject the employee to disciplinary action. The employee’s decision to attend or not attend follow-up sessions shall be voluntary.
E.	Demands for drug or alcohol analysis by supervisors or managers, which are determined to be malicious or vexatious will not be tolerated and will subject the directing individual to disciplinary action.
F.	Results of Drug and/or Alcohol Analysis:
1.	Upon a negative result, the employee shall return to work if otherwise fit for duty.
2.	If the test result is positive, the following shall apply:
First Offense: In an effort to encourage the employee to take responsibility for his/her problem, first violation of this policy will result in a formal, mandatory referral to the Employee Assistance Program ( EAP), using the established referral procedures in addition to any disciplinary action the City may impose for violations of this policy. A written record of this referral will be maintained in a restricted confidential employee medical file. EAP will assess the employee's need for treatment. An employee declining to be evaluated by EAP may be subject to disciplinary action independent of any other misconduct. Treatment will be offered to the employee on a voluntary basis and the employee will be responsible for thirty (30%) percent of the treatment cost. No disciplinary action will be imposed for refusal of treatment; however, misconduct including being under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol in the workplace and/or while on duty and/or while on standby or any action constituting a violation of this policy will continue to be subject to discipline, subject to applicable due process for City employees.
3.	Second Offense: During an employee's career, a second opportunity for treatment may be offered in the event of a relapse. Discipline, which could result in termination, will be imposed for the second violation of this policy, , subject to due process for City employees. If a second treatment program is allowed, the employee will be responsible for the cost.
4.	The employee may request a split sample be tested at another facility at City expense to provide a second independent result.
Confidentiality
Laboratory reports or test results, if positive only, shall appear in an employee's confidential medical file. The reports or test results may be disclosed to a department director or authorized representative and Employee Services Director on a strictly need-to-know basis and to the tested employee upon request. Disclosures, without patient consent, may also occur when: (1) the information has been placed
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 85
at issue in a formal dispute between the employer and employee; (2) the information is to be used in administering this program; (3) the information is needed by medical personnel for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient who is unable to authorize disclosure.
Procedure: Drug Testing
The City of San Jose Drug Testing Procedures contains procedures for handling testing for drugs if the test is conducted by the City’s Employee Health Services during normal business hours. Tests required on nights or weekends will be handled in a medical facility determined by the City.
Presence of drugs in the employee's system will be reported as positive in the initial and confirmation test if the amount exceeds the minimum detection levels defined in the City of San Jose Substance Abuse Program and Policy Drug Minimum Detection Levels.
In addition to drug screening, alcohol level will be reported as positive if it is present at greater than or equal to 0.04g.
Substance Abuse Treatment
The City will make substance abuse treatment available to employees represented by the San Jose Police Officers’ Association in the following way:
1.	Self Referral
A.	If an employee believes he or she has a substance abuse problem, he or she may make a confidential appointment with a counselor at EAP.
B.	The counselor will evaluate the case and determine the appropriate level and type of treatment, if any. The EAP will approve a plan and facility. These decisions will be made jointly with the individual seeking treatment.
C.	The counselor will notify the City by an employee code number that treatment and funding is authorized. Claims administration will be handled confidentially as are other health insurance claims.
SJPOA MOA March 1,2004 - June 30, 2008
Page 86
2.	Formal Referrals
A.	If an employee's pattern of work behavior indicates a problem is potentially related to substance abuse, the supervisor may contact the EAP and define issues.
B.	The employee will be advised to go to the EAP for evaluation. Any participation in treatment is voluntary.
C.	If the employee accepts treatment, the procedures for developing a plan and the payment of bills by the City are the same as for the person who self refers.
3.	Positive Drug Test
A.	If an employee tests positive on a drug test the department director or authorized representative will contact the EAP and initiate a formal referral. An evaluation by the EAP is mandatory. Participation in treatment is voluntary.
B.	The employee will sign a release allowing the EAP to advise the City about whether the employee is participating in and cooperating with treatment. No information can be released about the problem or treatment.
4.	Settlement of a Proposed Discipline
A.	If an employee has received a Notice of Intended Discipline (NOID) for misconduct or job performance, either on or off the job, which has a substance abuse component, the City may agree to waive the discipline, if the employee will agree to and successfully comply with a treatment program.

5.1	Booklets containing test questions shall be officially numbered in sequence with test answer sheets containing the same number. Candidates taking an exam shall be given a test booklet and answer sheet identified with identical numbers.
5.2	All questions used in all written examinations shall have their source listed in parenthesis under questions on exams.
5.3	With respect to Sergeant and Lieutenant examinations, questions on the written examination will be based upon the content of the departmental reading list if a written examination is given as part of that promotion process.

If that concern continues, the observer shall promptly report the concern to the Office of Employee Relations.
5.10.2	If no irregularity is presented by the end of an examination phase, the observer may not raise an issue solely related to that examination phase at any later time with respect to discrimination. The observer shall not be concerned with or report on the content of an examination.

5.10.3	The observer shall not talk, disrupt, provide clues to any candidate or rater during the examination process, interrupt proceedings in progress or otherwise disrupt the examination process. The observer shall at all times protect the confidentiality of the examination content and candidates’ performance except with regard to reports to the parties herein.
