4

3.	Management will provide the Association with the name, home address, and employee number of each permanent employee.
4.	The Controller shall provide the organization, at least monthly, a status report showing all changes in the employment status of employees in this unit which affect the applicability of the provisions of this Article to those employees.

ARTICLE 3.0	GRIEVANCES
ARTICLE 3.1	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section I	- Definition
A grievance is defined as any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of this written MOU or departmental rules and regulations governing personnel practices or working conditions applicable to employees covered by this MOU. An impasse in meeting and conferring upon the terms of a proposed MOU is not a grievance.
13
Section II	- Responsibilities and Rights
a.	Nothing in this grievance procedure shall be construed to apply to matters for which an administrative remedy is provided before the Civil Service Commission. Where a matter within the scope of this grievance procedure is alleged to be both a grievance and an unfair labor practice under the jurisdiction of the Employee Relations Board, the employee may elect to pursue the matter under either the grievance procedure herein provided, or by action before the Employee Relations Board. The employee's election of either procedure shall constitute a binding election of the remedy chosen and a waiver of the alternative remedy.
b.	No grievant shall lose the right to process a grievance because of Management imposed limitations in scheduling meetings.
c.	The grievant has the responsibility to discuss the grievance informally with the immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor will, upon request of a grievant, discuss the grievance with the employee at a mutually satisfactory time. The grievant may be represented by a representative of the grievant’s choice in the informal discussion with the immediate supervisor and in all formal review levels and in arbitration. Operative the effective date of the MOU, when more than one employee in a department is aggrieved, and the facts and issues of the alleged grievance are the same, and if affected employees agree to waive their right to discuss the grievance with their immediate supervisor, a single immediate supervisor will be designated by department Management to discuss the grievance at the informal level with one affected employee designated to represent the grievance and the employees’ representative. Such grievance will be processed as a single grievance through all formal levels of review. All affected employees involved in the action must waive their respective rights to file an individual grievance on the same issue and to discuss the grievance at the informal level with the respective immediate supervisors on a form provided by Management prior to the discussion with the designated supervisor.
Operative the effective date of the MOU, in instances where more than one employee in a department is aggrieved, the Association may elect to file the grievance on behalf of the employees. The facts and issues of the alleged grievance must be the same. Such grievance must contain the names of all grievants and the specific facts pertaining to each grievant. At the time of filing the grievance, the Association may request that the first level of review be at a level higher than Step 1 and shall provide justification for such request. A single supervisor will be designated by department Management to discuss the grievance at each level with one affected employee designated to represent the grievance and the Association. Such grievance will be processed as a single grievance through all
14
formal levels of review. All affected employees involved in the action must waive their respective rights to file an individual grievance on the same issue and to discuss the grievance at the informal level with their respective immediate supervisors on a form provided by Management prior to the discussion with the designated supervisor. Such form shall also include a statement that the employee understands that he/she is party to a grievance filed by the Association.
d.	The time limits between steps of the grievance procedure provided herein may be extended by mutual agreement; or, by mutual agreement, the grievant and Management may waive one or more levels of review from this grievance procedure.
e.	Management shall notify the Association of any formal grievance filed that involves the interpretation and/or application of the provisions of this MOU, and a paid Association Staff Representative shall have the right to be present and participate in the discussion at any formal grievance meeting concerning such a grievance. The paid Association Staff Representative who elects to attend the grievance meeting shall notify the head of the department, office or bureau.
The Association is to be notified of the resolution of all other formal grievances.
Section III	- Procedure
The grievance procedure for employees covered by this MOU shall be as follows:
Step 1 - Informal Discussion
The grievant shall discuss the grievance with the immediate supervisor on an informal basis in an effort to resolve the grievance and said grievance shall be considered waived if not so presented to the immediate supervisor within ten (10) calendar days following the day during which the event upon which the grievance is based occurred.
The immediate supervisor shall respond within five (5) calendar days following the meeting with the grievant. Failure of the immediate supervisor to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process the grievance at the next step.
Step 2 - First Level of Review
If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on a form provided by the department, office or bureau upon the person designated to review the grievance at Step 2 within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of
15
the grievance response at Step 1. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, said person shall meet with the grievant, and a written decision or statement of the facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and the representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process the grievance at the next level of review.
Step 3 - Second Level of Review
If the grievance is not settled at Step 2, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on a form provided by the department, office or bureau upon the person designated to review the grievance at Step 3 within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance response at Step 2. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, said person shall meet with the grievant, and a written decision or statement of the facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and the representative, if any, within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process the grievance at the next level of review.
Step 4 - General Manager/Commission Review (Third Level of Review)
If the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the grievant may serve written notice of the grievance on said form provided by the department, office or bureau upon his/her General
Manager or designee within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the grievance response at Step 3. Failure of the grievant to serve such written notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such notice is served, the grievance shall be heard by the General Manager or a designee, or in the case of the departments under the administrative control of a board of commissioners, by the Commission or the General Manager or their designee, as shall be determined by the head of the department involved. The General Manager/Commission or their designee will afford the parties an opportunity to present oral and/or written arguments on the merits of the grievance.
Said person shall meet with the grievant and a written decision or statement of facts and issues shall be rendered to the grievant and the representative, if any, within one-hundred-and-twenty (120) calendar days from the date of service. Failure of Management to
16
respond within such time limit shall entitle the grievant to process the grievance at Step 5 (Mediation) and/or Step 6 (Arbitration).
Step 5 - Mediation (optional)
If the grievance is not settled at Step 4 within ten (10) calendar days of receiving the Step 4 response the Association and Management may mutually agree to request mediation. Either the Association or Management will notify the Employee Relations Board of such request by letter. The Employee Relations Board shall first attempt to obtain the services of a mediator from the State Conciliation Service. The fees, if any, of such mediator shall be shared equally by the Association and Management.
The primary effort of the mediator should be to assist the parties in settling the grievance in a mutually satisfactory fashion. The mediation procedure shall be informal. Court reporters shall not be allowed to be present, the rules of evidence shall not apply and no record shall be made. The mediator shall determine whether witnesses are necessary in the conduct of the proceedings.
If settlement is not possible, the mediator may be requested to provide the parties with an immediate oral opinion as to how the grievance would be decided if it went to arbitration. Such opinion shall be advisory only. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, the mediator may be requested to furnish such opinion in writing, along with a brief statement of the reasons for the opinion. Such opinion as well as anything said by the parties during mediation shall not be used during any subsequent arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, and Section 4.865 of the Employee Relations Ordinance, the parties may, upon mutual agreement, agree to accept the opinion of the mediator as binding, in lieu of arbitration.
Step 6 - Arbitration
If the written decision at Step 4 does not settle the grievance, or if Step 5 is waived or does not settle the grievance^ the grievant and the Association jointly may serve upon the head of the department, office or bureau a written notice that a written request for arbitration has been filed with the Employee Relations Board. The request for arbitration must be filed with the Employee Relations Board within fifteen (15) calendar days following the date of service of the written decision of the General Manager/Commission or their designee, at Step 4, or the date of the mediator’s opinion in Step 5. Failure of the grievant and the Association jointly to serve a written request for arbitration with the Employee Relations Board within said period shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
If such written notice is served, the parties shall meet for the purpose of selecting an arbitrator from a list of seven (7) arbitrators furnished by the Employee Relations Board, within seven (7) calendar days following receipt of said list.
17
a.	Arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be limited to the formal grievance originally filed by the employee to the extent that said grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved. The proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with applicable rules and procedures adopted or specified by the Employee Relations Board, unless the parties hereto agree to other rules or procedures for the conduct of such arbitration. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties involved, it being mutually understood that all other expenses including, but not limited to, fees for witnesses, transcripts, and similar costs incurred by the parties during such arbitration, will be the responsibility of the individual party incurring same.
b.	The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be binding upon the parties concerned, except for grievances involving the Departments of Harbor, Water and Power, Library, and Pensions, which shall be advisory only.
c.	The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of grievances hereunder shall not add to, subtract from, or otherwise modify the terms and conditions of this MOU.
ARTICLE 3.2	GRIEVANCE REPRESENTATION
The Association may designate a reasonable number of grievance representatives who must be members of the Unit, and shall provide all departments, offices or bureaus with a written list of employees who have been so designated. Management will semi-annually accept changes to the list presented by the Association. A grievance representative, if so requested, may represent a grievant at all levels of the grievance procedure.
The grievant and the representative may have a reasonable amount of paid time off for the purpose of presenting grievances. However, said representative will receive paid time off only if a member of the Association; is in the same Unit as the grievant; is employed by the same department, office or bureau as the grievant; and is employed within a reasonable distance from the work location of the grievant.
The grievant’s supervisor must concur regarding the necessary time off for presenting the grievance at the appropriate level. The grievant shall notify the representative of the meeting arrangements.
If a grievance representative must leave the work location to represent a grievant, permission shall first be obtained from the representative’s supervisor on a form provided for such purpose. Permission to leave will be granted unless such absence would cause an unreasonable interruption of work. If such permission cannot be granted promptly, the
18
grievance representative will be informed when time can be made available. Such time will not be more than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding scheduled days off and/or legal holidays, after the time of the grievance representative's request unless otherwise mutually agreed to. Denial of permission to leave at the time requested will upon mutual agreement constitute an extension of time limits provided in the grievance procedure equal to the amount of the delay.
Time spent on grievances outside of regular working hours of the employee or the representative shall not be counted as work time for any purpose. Whenever a grievance is to be presented during the work hours of the grievant and/or the representative, only that amount of time necessary to bring about a prompt disposition of the grievance will be allowed.
ARTICLE 3.3	GRIEVANCES OF SUSPENSIONS
Grievances involving suspensions of five (5) days or less may be filed, by mutual agreement, at any Step of the Grievance Procedure, but at no Step lower than Step 2.
ARTICLE 4.0	ON THE JOB
ARTICLE 4.1	SAFETY
Section I
Safety clothing and devices currently provided by Management shall continue to be provided, as long as the need exists. The Association will encourage all members of the Unit to utilize said safety clothing and devices to the fullest extent possible.
Section II
Management will make every reasonable effort to provide safe working conditions. The Association will encourage all members in the Unit to perform their work in a safe manner. Each employee should be alert to unsafe practices, equipment and conditions, and should report any hazardous condition promptly to his/her immediate supervisor. Said Supervisor should:
a.	Correct or eliminate the hazardous condition if correction or elimination thereof is within the authority and capability of the supervisor; or
b.	Safeguard a hazardous condition in such a manner as to preclude injury to personnel and/or property damage, and promptly report the nature and location of the hazardous condition to the next level of supervision designated by departmental
19
management for said purpose, if elimination of the hazardous condition is not within the immediate supervisor's capability.
c.	If elimination of the hazardous condition is not within the capability of the second level of supervision to correct, he/she shall promptly report the problem to the next designated level of supervision or inform the Departmental Safety Coordinator about the problem.
Section III
If the procedures for handling a reported hazardous condition are not initiated, or if initiated, fail to effect a satisfactory solution of the problem within a reasonable time, the employee or his/her representative may call the City Occupational Safety Office and report such hazard.
Unresolved complaints hereunder may be referred to the State Safety Engineer for processing under the CAL/OSHA rules and regulations.
ARTICLE 4.2 PERSONNEL FOLDERS
An employee shall be entitled to review the contents of any of his/her departmental personnel folder(s) at reasonable intervals, upon request, during hours when his/her personnel office is normally open for business. Such review shall not interfere with the normal business of the department, office or bureau.
No evaluatory or disciplinary document may be placed in an employee's personnel file without his/her review and a copy of the document presented to him/her for his/her records. The employee shall acknowledge that he/she has reviewed and received a copy of the document by signing it with the understanding that such signature does not necessarily indicate agreement with its contents.
A written reprimand or “Notice to Correct Deficiencies” will be sealed upon the written request of an affected employee if he/she has not been involved in any subsequent related incidents that resulted in written corrective counseling or other Management action for a period of five (5) years from the date the most recent notice was issued or Management action taken.
Pursuant to the above paragraph, those documents, either removed from the personnel file or sealed, shall be available upon subpoena or other appropriate legal request.
20
ARTICLE 4.3
OUT-OF-CLASS ASSIGNMENT
Section I	- Definition
It is the intent of Management to avoid working an employee on an out-of-class assignment. An out-of-class assignment is defined as any assignment requiring substantial work in a higher level position which is not usually included within the scope of the duties and responsibilities as defined by the class specifications for the class to which the assigned employee's regular position is allocated.
Section II	- Waivers and Exceptions
a.	Nothing in this Article shall be construed as limiting Management's authority to make temporary assignments of qualified personnel during emergencies or unusual operating conditions. However, such assignments shall not be extended beyond the period of emergency or unusual operating conditions.
b.	Whenever an employee performs duties outside of the normal duties of his/her position for the purpose of training or providing experience, written confirmation of such performance will be placed in the employee's personnel file upon request by the employee. Management shall designate a knowledgeable person to supervise said training or experience.
Section III	- Rate of Pay
An employee temporarily assigned higher level duties under the provisions of Section Ila will continue to receive the rate of pay for his/her regular classification and pay grade, unless or until he has been appointed to a higher classification or pay grade. In the event that said assignment exceeds thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, Management will initiate a request to provide the higher level position authority, or initiate action to appoint a qualified employee to said position.
ARTICLE 4.4	REST PERIOD
Each employee shall be granted a minimum fifteen (15) minute rest period in each four (4) hour period; provided, however, that no such rest period shall be taken during the first or last hour of any employee's working day nor in excess of fifteen (15) minutes without the express consent of the designated supervisor.
Management reserves the right to suspend the rest period or any portion thereof during an emergency. Any rest period so suspended or not taken at the time permitted shall not be
21
accumulated or carried over from one day to any subsequent day, or compensated for in any form.
ARTICLE 4.5	RAIN GEAR
Management will provide rain gear to employees in the classifications listed below who are required to work outside in inclement weather as a normal part of their job duties. Management shall replace such gear when no longer serviceable.

ARTICLE 4.6	TELECOMMUTING
The Engineers and Architects Association and Management acknowledge the City of Los Angeles Telecommuting Program (C.F. 93-225), and that employees of this Unit may be considered for eligibility by management of their respective departments/bureaus in accordance with the Telecommuting Action Plan.
Both parties agree to comply with this Plan, the provisions of which shall be superseded by any modifications adopted by the Joint Labor/Management Committee on Employee Parking and Transportation Options, or other body so authorized to make such modifications.
ARTICLE 5.0	WORK SCHEDULES
ARTICLE 5.1	WORK SCHEDULES
Pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employees shall have a fixed workweek that consists of a regular recurring period of 168 consecutive hours (seven 24-hour periods) which can begin and end on any day of the week and at any time of the day. The designated workweek for an employee may be changed only if the change is intended to be permanent and not designed to evade overtime requirements of the FLSA. Management may assign employees to work a four/ten, five/forty, nine/eighty or other work schedule. The Association will be entitled to consult with Management on the matter prior to the proposed action. The Association will also be entitled, upon request, to consult with Management if Management intends to deny a change in schedule to an employee. Management may require employees to change their work schedules (working hours or
22
change days off, except the split day) within the same FLSA work week, providing that the change is not arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. In the event Management’s actions are shown to be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory before an arbitrator, the award of the arbitrator shall be to reverse the action of Management. However, the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding or advisory in accordance with Article 3.1. No employee shall be required to work a four/ten schedule against his or her will.
It is further agreed that Management shall retain the right to refuse an employee's request to work a four/ten, nine/eighty or other work schedule, and to require the reversion to a five/forty work schedule, providing that the exercise of such right is not arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. In the event Management's actions are shown to be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory before an arbitrator, the award of the arbitrator shall be to reverse the action of Management. However, the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding or advisory, in accordance with Article 3.1.
Employees on a nine/eighty modified work schedule shall have designated a regular day off (also known as 9/80 day off) which shall remain fixed. Temporary changes to the designated 9/80 day off at the request of Management or the employee are prohibited unless it is intended for the employee to work additional hours (overtime).
Employees on a four/ten work schedule shall work ten hours per day for a four day work week (or twelve hours per day for a three day work week in the Information Technology Agency only) exclusive of lunch periods. Employees shall be entitled to rest periods in accordance with the provisions of Article 4.4. Employees shall be compensated for 40 hours per week at the regular hourly rate for their class and pay grade.
EAA agrees that it is a management right to require employees who work on a four/ten, nine/eighty or three/twelve work schedule to work overtime on Saturday rather than on their day off which falls within the week. Employees who work on a schedule other than five/forty shall have their sick leave, vacation and holiday credits accrued at the same hourly rate as an employee on the five/forty schedule.
The City reserves the right to develop 26-week/1040 or 52-week/2080 hours’ work periods under FLSA Section 7(b) [29 USC §207(b)(1) and (2)] during the term of this MOU for the purpose of increasing scheduling flexibility. Implementation of this work schedule is subject to agreement by the parties and certification of the Association as bona fide by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
ARTICLE 5.2	DEPLOYMENT PERIOD (POLICE DEPARTMENT)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 4.108 (Regular Hours of Work) and 4.113 (Overtime) of the Los Angeles Administrative Code to the contrary, employees in this Unit who are employed in the Police Department shall have a work schedule consisting of
23
twenty (20) days of work in each twenty-eight (28) day deployment period. Such day may be eight (8) hours, seven and one-half (7%) hours, or seven (7) hours as determined by the Chief of Police.
Said twenty (20) days of work or the equivalent number of days for an alternate work schedule may be scheduled at such time during two (2) biweekly pay periods as the Chief of Police may direct.
This Article shall not be construed to prohibit the implementation of flexible work schedules.
ARTICLE 5.3	72-HOUR WORK SCHEDULE
Notwithstanding Section 4.108(a) of the Los Angeles Administrative Code, whenever a fulltime employee voluntarily reduces the number of his/her biweekly regular work hours from eighty (80) to a number not less than seventy-two (72) at the request of, or with the permission of, his/her appointing authority, such employee shall be credited with all rights and benefits as though he/she worked eighty (80) hours in the payroll period. The employee shall not be credited for overtime worked until more than forty (40) hours have been worked in the workweek. Compensation received under this Article shall be considered full compensation for all employees participating in the voluntary work hour reduction.

24

ARTICLE 6.2	OVERTIME
Section I	- Distribution of Overtime
Management will attempt to assign overtime work as equitably as possible among all qualified employees in the same classification, in the same organizational unit and work location. However, Management may consider special skills required to perform particular work. No employee shall work overtime without prior approval from his or her supervisor. FLSA non-exempt employees may not work outside of scheduled working hours, or during unpaid meal periods, without the prior approval of a supervisor, consistent with department policy. Failure to secure prior approval may result in discipline. Working and not recording the time is similarly prohibited.
Section II	- Non-emergency Overtime
Whenever Management deems it necessary to perform non-emergency work on an overtime basis, employees required to work will be given at least forty-eight (48) hours notice.
Section III	- Rate and Method of Compensation - FLSA Non-Exempt Employees
Compensation for overtime worked by employees in classifications listed in Appendices A through F, herein, shall be for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek, including all absences with pay authorized by law. Management shall have the discretion to determine whether overtime compensation shall be in cash or time-off. Overtime compensation shall be in time off at the rate of one and-one-half hours for each hour of overtime worked or at the rate of one and-one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay.
Section IV	- Compensatory Time Off
Employees may, subject to Management discretion, be permitted to accumulate up to 80 hours of compensatory time off (CTO). Occasionally, employees may accumulate CTO in excess of 80 hours for a temporary period of time, not to exceed an additional fiscal year. If an employee does not schedule and take CTO over 80 hours prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the overtime was worked, Management may require employees to use CTO prior to the end of the fiscal year; require employees to use such time in lieu of vacation (unless the mandatory use of CTO would result in the loss of vacation accumulation) or other leave time; or authorize cash payment. In the event sufficient funds are not available to provide cash compensation for all or a portion of the CTO hours in excess of 80,
25
Management may extend the time limit for a period not to exceed one additional fiscal year. Notwithstanding the above, departments may exceed the overtime limits specified above during the term of the MOU only; departments must be in full compliance with these provisions by June 30, 2004.
In accordance with FLSA, no employee shall lose CTO. Employees shall be permitted to take CTO for overtime worked upon request unless granting of such time would unduly disrupt the operations of the City department. This standard does not apply to non-FLSA overtime (i.e., overtime earned pursuant to this agreement that does not meet the FLSA definition of overtime).
Under no circumstances shall compensated time off in excess of 240 hours be accumulated.
ARTICLE 6.3	SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL
Notwithstanding the provisions of Note N of Schedule A of Section 4.61 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code, any employee, when required to work 50% or more of his/her time during his/her regular shift on any one day between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m., shall receive for each such day worked, salary at the second premium level rate above the appropriate step rate of the salary range prescribed for his/her classification. The procedure for the payment of adjusted compensation for work performed under the provisions of this Article shall be in accordance with Sections 4.72, 4.74, and 4.75 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code.
ARTICLE 6.4	BILINGUAL DIFFERENTIAL
Whenever an appointing authority determines that it is necessary or desirable that a position be filled by a person able to converse fluently in a language other than English, or write and interpret a language other than English, the appointing authority shall transmit to the Controller a written statement approving payment of a bilingual premium, as provided by this Article to the person occupying such a position and possessing such bilingual skills.
After authorizing payment of a bilingual premium, the appointing authority shall certify to the Controller the name of an employee eligible for a bilingual premium and the Personnel Department shall certify to the Controller that the employee has qualified under its standards of fluency and proficiency for said language.
Persons certified as being qualified by the Personnel Department shall receive a bilingual premium of one premium level rate (2.75%) for duties requiring that they converse fluently in a language other than English, or of two premium level rates (5.5%) for duties requiring
26
that they interpret a language other than English, in addition to conversing fluently in that other language.
Compensation provided for in this Article shall be retroactive to the employee's first day in a bilingual position.
ARTICLE 6.5	SIGN LANGUAGE PREMIUM
Any qualified employee covered by the provisions of the MOU who is requested by the hearingjmpaired assistance center to utilize sign language shall receive compensation equal to 2% percent of their salary or wages for each business day the skill is utilized. Such practices of additional compensation shall be in accordance with Section 4.84.1 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code.
ARTICLE 6.6	COURT APPEARANCES
Section I
The following court provisions will apply to all employees in the Unit, except those in the Police Department.
When an employee is required to appear in the Superior or Municipal Court in and for the County of Los Angeles outside of his/her normal duty hours, but on a matter arising within the scope of his/her employment, said employee shall be entitled to receive a minimum of one hour at 1% times his/her regular rate of pay. Time spent in excess of the one-hour minimum guarantee shall also be at the rate of 1% times the employee's regular rate of pay, payable in six (6) minute increments. No compensation shall be paid for the first forty-five (45) minutes of the Court's noon recess, provided, however, that no such compensation shall be allowed unless such employee is in actual attendance in court.
Such compensation for court appearances may be in either time off or cash. Call back provisions are not applicable to court appearances.
Section II
The following court provisions shall apply to employees in the Police Department only. These provisions apply only for the payment of overtime for court appearances outside of the normal duty hours of employees. Call back provisions are not applicable to court appearances.
27
A.	Basic Compensation
An employee, at the employee's option, may report to court when subpoenaed or remain on call. If the employee elects to appear in court, the division supervisor must be notified, at the latest, one administrative day prior to the scheduled court appearance. If the employee wishes to remain on call, the employee must be able to appear in court not more than one hour after being notified that the employee's appearance is required in court. To appear in court more than an hour after having been notified will void the employee's right to on-call compensation. An employee need not remain at home, but must be available for telephonic notification at a location where the supervisor knows the employee can be reached
(1)	An off-duty employee shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours overtime compensation for any court day he/she is subpoenaed to be on call or required to appear.
(2)	An off-duty employee shall receive hour-for-hour overtime compensation for each additional hour of actual attendance in excess of the two (2) hour minimum provided for in paragraph A(1) above, with the following noontime recess exceptions:
Length of Recess Forty-five (45) minutes or less
Amount of Compensation None
Length of Recess Forty-six (46) minutes or less
Amount of Compensation All time over forty-six (46) minutes (in six [6] minute increments).
NOTE:
An employee shall not receive court on-call overtime compensation and hour-for-hour overtime compensation for the same time period.
B.	Multiple Cases
An off-duty employee who receives morning and afternoon subpoenas for separate cases on a court day shall receive overtime compensation as in paragraph A(1) above, for each case for a total of four (4) hours. In addition, he/she shall receive hour-for-hour overtime compensation for each additional hour of actual court attendance in excess of two (2) hours.
28
C.	Exceptions to the Two Hour Minimum
Management will attempt to adjust an employee's shift to accommodate court appearances or on-call status commencing two hours or less before or after the employee's regularly assigned shift begins or ends. If an employee's shift cannot be adjusted, the employee will be compensated as follows:
(1)	Court appearances or on-call status commencing two (2) hours or less before the employee's regularly assigned shift begins. Compensation will be for the actual time between the commencement of the court appearance or on-call and the beginning of the employee's assigned shift with the same noon recess provisions as outlined in paragraph A(2) above.
(2)	Court appearances commencing two (2) hours or less after the employee's regularly assigned shift ends. Compensation will be for the actual time between the end of the employee's assigned shift and the termination of the court appearance with the same noon recess provisions as outlined in paragraph A(2) above.
(3)	Court appearances or on-call that begin during an employee’s regularly assigned shift. Compensation will be for the actual time between the end of the employee's assigned shift and the termination of the appearance or on-call status with the same noon recess provisions as outlined in paragraph A(2) above.
ARTICLE 6.7 CIVIC DUTY
Whenever an employee is served with a subpoena by a court of competent jurisdiction which compels his/her presence as a witness during his/her normal working period, unless he/she is a party to the litigation or an expert witness, such employee shall be granted time off with pay in the amount of the difference between the employee's regular earnings and any amount he/she receives for such appearance. This Article is not applicable to appearances for which the employee receives compensation in excess of his/her regular earnings.
A court of competent jurisdiction is defined as a court within the County in which the employee resides or if outside the county of residence, the place of appearance must be within 150 miles of the employee's residence.
29
ARTICLE 6.8
JURY SERVICE
Any employee who is duly summoned to attend any court for jury service or has been nominated and selected to serve on the Grand Jury of Los Angeles County shall, for those days during his or her scheduled working period during which jury service is actually performed and for those days necessary to qualify for jury service, receive his/her regular salary. Any jury attendance fees received by an employee who receives his/her regular salary pursuant to this provision, except those fees received for jury service performed on a regular day off or a holiday, shall be paid to the City. The absence of any employee for the purpose of performing jury service during his/her scheduled working period shall be deemed to be an authorized absence with pay within the meaning of Section 4.75 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code, with pay calculated pursuant to the Code.
ARTICLE 6.9	MILITARY LEAVE
Every employee who qualifies for and is granted a military leave, whether temporary or otherwise, pursuant to the provisions of the Military and Veterans Code of the State of California, shall, before he/she is paid his/her salary or compensation during such leave, or any part thereof, as provided in said Code, furnish to his/her appointing authority two certified copies of his/her orders, one (1) copy to be filed in the department in which he/she is employed and the other with the Controller. In lieu of the orders, the employee shall furnish to the appointing authority, upon forms provided by the Controller, certified evidence of his/her entry into active service in the armed forces of the United States and the date thereof. Any certification required by this Article may be made by any commissioned officer of such armed forces. The controller shall have power at any time to require such additional satisfactory evidence of the entry of such employee into active service in such armed forces and of the actual performance by the employee of ordered military duty during all or any part of such leave.
In determining whether an employee has been in the service of the City for a period of not less than one year immediately prior to the date on which the absence begins, continuous service shall be required.
ARTICLE 6.10	MILEAGE
Each employee that is authorized to use his/her own vehicle, pursuant to Division 4, Chapter 5, Article 2 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC), in the performance of his/her duties shall be reimbursed for transportation expenses at the rate of thirty-six (36.0) cents per mile, effective January 1, 2003, for all miles traveled in any biweekly period, in addition to any and all salaries and other compensation otherwise provided for by law.
30

ARTICLE 7.1 HEALTH AND DENTAL PLANS
During the term of this MOU, the City will provide benefits in accordance with the Civilian Modified Flexible Benefits Program (hereinafter Flex Program) and any modifications thereto as recommended by the Joint Labor-Management Benefits Committee and approved by the City Council.
The sections below are intended to reflect the Flex Program approved on July 17, 1996. If there are any discrepancies between the benefits described herein and the Flex Program approved by the Joint Labor-Management Benefits Committee, the Flex Program benefits will take precedence.
Section I	- Health Plans
The health plans offered and benefits provided by those plans shall be those approved by the City's Joint Labor-Management Benefits Committee and administered by the Personnel Department, in accordance with Administrative Code Section 4.303.
Management agrees to contribute a monthly sum not to exceed $524.66 per month, effective January 1, 2002, per full-time employee, effective the beginning of the pay period in which the Kaiser yearly premium rate change is implemented towards the cost of a City-sponsored health plan for employees who are members of LACERS.
Effective January 1,2002, for each half-time employee, as defined by Section 4.110 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) who becomes a member of LACERS following July 1, 1990, and for each employee who transfers from full-time to half-time status following July 1, 1990, Management agrees to contribute a monthly sum not to exceed $201.80 per employee.
Management will apply this subsidy first to the employee's coverage. Any remaining balance will be applied toward the coverage of the employee's dependents under the plan.
During the term of this MOU, Management's monthly subsidy for full-time employees shall increase by the increase in the Kaiser family rate. For half-time employees, Management's monthly subsidy shall increase by the increase in the Kaiser Permanente Single Party Rate. Increases in this monthly subsidy shall be effective at the beginning of the pay period in which the Kaiser Permanente yearly premium rate change is implemented.

Half-time employees who, prior to July 1, 1990, were receiving the same subsidy as fulltime employees shall continue to receive the full-time employee subsidy and shall be eligible to receive any increases applied to that subsidy as provided in this Article.
Employees who transfer from full-time to half-time under the provisions of Article 7.8, Family and Medical Leave, shall continue to receive the same subsidy as full-time employees and shall be subject to any adjustments applied to that subsidy as provided in this Article.

Coverage for dependents of eligible employees may be obtained in a City-sponsored plan at the employee's expense, provided that such sufficient enrollment is maintained to continue to make such coverage available.
For each half-time employee, as defined by Section 4.110 of the LAAC, who becomes a member of LACERS and for each employee who transfers from full-time to half-time status following July 1, 1990, Management will expend an amount equivalent to one-half of the cost of the employee-only coverage of the most expensive plan under the City-sponsored Dental Program.

35
regardless of Association membership or affiliation. Employees may not receive a subsidy for more than one of the City-sponsored or Association-sponsored dental plans.
If the monthly rate of any Association sponsored plan increases, the City will adjust its subsidy to the amount necessary to cover the employee only coverage; provided, however, that the monthly amount of the increased subsidy may not exceed the maximum cost of the employee only coverage at that time under the City plan or $18.00 per month, whichever is greater.
The parties mutually understand that the City will expend the above noted funds only for those employees who enroll in these plans and remain on active payroll status with the City, and that the City retains all rights to any unused funds which may be allocated for the purpose of implementing this Article.

Remittance of this aggregate amount will be made within 30-working days after the conclusion of the payroll period in which the subsidy was paid.
The parties further understand that for those employees enrolled in an Association-sponsored program, who authorized the City Controller to make a payroll deduction to cover any additional costs of said dental insurance plan, the City will remit to the carrier a separate amount and appropriate deduction list.
The parties mutually agree that the City is not responsible for, nor expected to provide, any additional accounting, administrative, bookkeeping, clerical or other services except as provided for in the above paragraphs, and that the Association assumes all responsibility for any services which may arise out of the administration of the Association-sponsored programs.
The Association shall indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or result from any action taken by the City for purposes of complying with this Article, or by failure of the Association or its dental insurance carrier to provide the coverage and services agreed to between the Association and the carrier.
