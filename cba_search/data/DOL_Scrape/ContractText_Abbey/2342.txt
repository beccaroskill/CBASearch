AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the 27th day of April 2018, by and between PRISM HOSPITALITY, L.P. dba TRU BY HILTON (hereinafter, called the “Employer”) and its successors and assigns, and the LOCAL JOINT EXECUTIVE BOARD OF LAS VEGAS, for and on behalf of CULINARY WORKERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 226, and BARTENDERS UNION, LOCAL NO. 165 (hereinafter, called the “Union”).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the parties have, by negotiations and collective bargaining, reached complete agreement on wages, hours of work, working conditions and other related, negotiable subjects to be incorporated into a Labor Agreement which shall supersede all previous verbal or written agreements in conflict with or modified by this Agreement applicable to the employees in the bargaining unit defined herein which may have existed between the Employer and the Union or between the predecessor of the Employer, if any, and the predecessor of the Union, if any.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the execution of this Agreement and the full and faithful performance of the covenants, representations and warranties contained herein, it is mutually agreed as follows:
ARTICLE 1:	RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT COVERAGES
1.0	1. Recognition of the Union.
The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the Employer’s employees employed at its facility as indicated in the first paragraph of this agreement. The Employer and the Union agree that all employees working in classifications listed in Exhibit 1 are properly within the bargaining unit. Any classification established by the Employer not listed in Exhibit 1, where all of the employees’ duties are covered by this Agreement, shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate comparable to related job classifications.
1.0	2. Open and Excluded Classifications.
(a)	The classifications set forth below are included in the bargaining unit, but their wage scales shall be open, and they shall be covered only by Article 22 of this Agreement and, where applicable, those provisions dealing with gratuities. The provisions of Article 18 may be invoked as to persons employed in such classifications solely for the purpose of processing grievances limited to disputes or differences involving the meaning, interpretation, and/or application of the Article specified above.

(b)	Non-bargaining unit employees shall perform no bargaining unit work except such occasional work as is reasonably connected with or incidental to the proper and orderly conduct of the hotel operations they are supervising.
ARTICLE 2:	HIRING OF EMPLOYEES
2.01. Hiring Procedure.
Whenever the employer finds it necessary to hire new employees for those classifications covered by the Agreement, it may recruit and procure applicants from any source.
At its sole option, the Employer may notify the Union who shall assist the Employer in obtaining applicants who meet the qualifications required by the Employer. When applicable, the Union’s selection of applicants for referral shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis, and shall not be based upon or in any way affected by membership in the Union or the Union’s bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspects or obligations of Union membership, policies, or requirements, or upon an applicant’s race, color, religion, sex, age or national origin.
The Employer shall be the sole judge of an applicant’s suitability, competence and qualifications to perform the work of any job to be filled. The Employer may accept or reject any applicant for employment in accordance with applicable laws.
When the Employer considers applicants for employment who have not been referred to the Employer by the Union’s dispatch office, the Employer shall, in order to maintain a consistent and orderly process, advise such applicants that in order to obtain employment they must be dispatched for available positions. The Employer agrees no employee will be hired or put to work without a referral slip from the Union’s Dispatch Office except in the case of an emergency. The Union’s referral service shall send applicants named by the Employer directly back to the Employer. Such applicants named by the Employer shall be processed by the service without any discrimination. Any applicant named by the Employer shall be permitted by the Union’s referral service to register in the same manner as others. If there are any problems with processing of applicants, the parties will review such problems and make such changes as may be necessary.
2.02. Employee Orientation.
At their option the Employer shall give the Union the right to participate in the Employer’s employee orientation process for new employees. Union representatives shall be allowed to either participate jointly or immediately subsequent to Employer representatives in giving new employees information about the Union, the collective bargaining agreement and the benefit programs under the agreement. In advance of each orientation meeting, the Employer shall provide the Union with a list of all new employees who will be involved in the orientation, including each employee’s name, social security, job title, department and Article 10 category. The Employer will not make any negative references to the Union during the Employer’s interviewing, hiring and orientation processes. The Employer shall not advise applicants or employees as to the need for or desirability of Union membership.
2
2.03. No Individual Contracts,
No employee by this Agreement shall be compelled or allowed to enter into any individual contract or agreement with the Employer concerning conditions of employment, which varies the terms or conditions of employment contained in this Agreement.
ARTICLES: UNION SECURITY
3.01. Union Shop.
Subject to the provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended, it shall be a condition of their employment that all employees covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the date of execution of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing during the period of their employment at the Employer’s Clark County, Nevada establishment; and those who are not members of the Union on the date of execution of this Agreement shall, on the thirtieth (30th) day following execution of this Agreement, become and remain members of the Union while employed at the Employer’s Clark County, Nevada establishment. It shall also be a condition of employment hereunder that all employees covered by this Agreement shall, on or after the thirtieth (30th) day following the employee’s first employment by the Employer in classifications covered herein, become and remain members of the Union throughout the period of their employment with the Employer.
3.02. Effect of State Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein, Section 3.01 shall not be applicable if all or any part thereof shall be in conflict with applicable law; provided, however, that if all or any part of Section 3.01 becomes permissible by virtue of a change in applicable law, whether by legislative or judicial action, the provisions of Section 3.01 held valid shall immediately apply.
3.03. Check-Off.
The Check-Off Agreement and system heretofore entered into and established by the Employer and the Union for the check-off of Union dues by voluntary authorization, as set forth in Exhibit 2, attached to and made a part of this Agreement, shall be continued in effect for the term of this Agreement.
3.04. Indemnification.
The Union will indemnify and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands or other forms of liability which may arise out of, or by reason of, any action taken or not taken by the Employer, at the request of the Union, in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE 4: UNION REPRESENTATIVES
4.01.
Authorized representatives of the Union shall be permitted to visit the Employer’s establishment for the purpose of communicating with employees and supervisors regarding Union business and collecting Union dues, assessments and initiation fees. Such visits shall not interfere with the conduct of the Employer’s business or with the performance of work by employees during their working hours. Union representatives will be required to report to the designated office or Security and sign in and wear identification while on the premises of the Employer.

4.02. Union Stewards.
The Union may select trained Union Stewards from among the employees. Union Stewards may act as Union representatives, or may assist Union representatives in proceedings under Article 18 of this Agreement (Grievance and Arbitration), and the discussion with the Employer’s representative of questions or concerns regarding the Employer’s work practices and procedures, provided that a designated Union official provides the Union Steward and the Employer’s designated representative with specific written authorization permitting the Union Steward to engage in such activity. The Steward shall not engage in the authorized activities described above on paid work time, unless the Employer’s designated representative provides specific written authorization to the Union Steward. No employee shall participate in meetings, discussions or other activities with the Union Steward while the employee is on paid work time, unless the Employer’s designated representative agrees that the employee should attend on paid work time. Union Stewards engaged in activities authorized by the Union shall comply with the obligations imposed upon authorized Union representatives by Article 4 of this Agreement.
4.03. Employee Information.
To permit the Union to properly and efficiently carry out its responsibilities, the Employer shall provide the following information to the Union:

ARTICLES: SALARIES AND WAGES
5.01. Weekly Payment.
Regular employees shall be paid weekly, provided that if the Employer’s practice in the past has been to pay semi-monthly or bi-weekly it may continue to do so. Paychecks (other than for employees in “open” classifications) must show the number of hours paid for in that pay period, broken down by straight-time and overtime hours. Records on the source and dates of gratuities included on paychecks shall be made available to the employees on request.
5.02. Terminated Employees.
(a)	Applicable Laws to Article 5, Section 608.020 - Discharge of an Employee - Immediate Payment: Whenever the Employer discharges an employee, the wage and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of discharge shall become due and payable within twenty-four (24) hours.
(b)	Section 608.030 - Payment of Employee Who Resigns or Quits His/Her Employment: Whenever an employee resigns or quits his/her employment, the wages and compensation earned and unpaid at the time of his/her resignation or quitting must be paid no later than:
1.	The day of which he would have regularly been paid the wage or compensation; or
2.	Seven (7) days after he quits or resigns, whichever is earlier.
5.03. Delinquencies.
If the Employer becomes delinquent in the payment of wages or is operating in receivership by the Board of Trade or a creditors’ committee, or in the case of liquidation or bankruptcy, all salaries accrued become due and must be paid at once. In such cases, the Union reserves the right at any time to demand and receive daily payment of wages to all employees, provided that by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union such wages due may be deposited in an approved escrow.
5.04. Deductions and Donations.
(a) No employee shall be required to subscribe to any form of insurance or to make contributions or suffer any deductions from wages without written authorization of such employee, except as may be required by law.
5
5.05. Superior Workmen.
The wage scales in this Agreement are minimum scales and do not prohibit the Employer from paying higher wages. It is specifically agreed that employees compensated at said higher wage rates may be returned to the scales published herein at the sole discretion of the Employer. Employees paid Superior Workmen rates shall have their wages increased by amounts of not less than the increases in the minimum wage scales as specified in Exhibit 1, attached to and made part of this Agreement, for the classifications in which they are employed.
5.06. Combination Jobs.
(a)	When an employee works in two or more classifications in any day, he/she shall be paid for that day at the rate of pay for the highest classification, provided that this shall not apply in cases of relief for meal and rest periods.
(b)	The Employer shall have the right to discuss with the Union, during the term of this Agreement, combining job classifications and the Union agrees to discuss and consider any job classification combinations proposed by the Employer.
5.07. Equal Pay.
The wage scales set forth in Exhibit 1 shall apply equally to male and female employees covered by this Agreement.
5.08.
Both the Union and the Employer agree that providing guests with excellent service is the primary objective of all employees. Employees shall normally perform the work customarily performed by their job classification. However, nothing in this contract shall be construed as limiting the right of the Employer to assign occasional work to any employee in order to ensure the proper and orderly conduct of hotel operations.
5.09. Lead/Trainer Special Assignment Pay.
Management may, in its discretion and without regard to seniority, at any time assign lead/trainer duties to an employee for all or part of a shift. Employees who have been assigned lead/trainer duties shall receive, in addition to the employee’s regular rate, premium pay of $1.00 per hour for the entire shift. Unless an employee is given a written multiple shift assignment of lead/trainer duties any lead/trainer assignment shall be effective for one shift only. Any employee may without penalty decline to accept the lead/trainer assignment at the time the assignment is made.
ARTICLE 6: DISCIPLINE
6.01. Cause for Discharge.
(a)	No regular employee, after having completed the probationary period under Section 17.01, shall be disciplined and/or discharged except for just cause. The Employer shall follow a system of progressive discipline. The parties agree that progressive discipline normally requires, prior to suspension or discharge, that an employee be given a written opportunity to correct the deficiency, but that within the principle of progressive discipline, the Employer may impose immediate suspension or discharge for dishonesty, incompetence, misconduct, insubordination, discourteous conduct toward a guest, failure to report to work without just cause, walking off the job during a
6
shift, or drinking alcohol or use of controlled substance, or being under the influence thereof, during the employee's shift.
When an employee who has completed the probationary period is disciplined and/or discharged, the reason therefore will be given to the employee in writing. Based on the Union and Employer’s established practice when an employee is discharged, copies of the written notice to the employee will be sent to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours of the discharge. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relevant to discipline or discharge, including videotapes, shall be provided to the Union.
(b)	Where there is reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, the employee, after being notified of the contents of this subsection, must consent to an immediate physical examination at an independent medical facility or suffer the penalty of discharge.
The Employer shall pay for the cost of the examination, and the employee shall be paid for all the time required for the examination. A blood alcohol level at or in excess of the current level allowed by law provides an absolute presumption that an employee is under the influence of alcohol.
(c)	Employees with less than three (3) years’ service may be offered before, after, or at any time during the grievance process two (2) months' pay including the higher of declared or assigned tips in lieu of processing a grievance and arbitrating the discharge. In the event the employee declines this offer when made by the Employer, the Union will not arbitrate the discharge unless it objectively determines that, in its judgment, the discharge constituted a flagrant miscarriage of justice. In the event a positive determination is made, and the Union processes the discharge to arbitration, the parties may bypass the mediation process and proceed directly to formal arbitration under Article 18.03 (b) at the option of the Employer.
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter; but in any event, warning notices shall be issued to employees only at the end of a shift. A legible copy of any written warning notice issued to employees shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after its issuance by the Employer. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in issuing the warning notice, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer’s own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for the warning notice. An employee may not be issued a warning notice solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Warning notices, written customer complaints, and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer’s own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for on in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
7
6.03. Time of Discharge.
Except as provided in Section 7.02, no employee shall be discharged on his/her day off or while on vacation or leave of absence.
6.04. Disciplinary Suspension.
No employee shall be suspended or laid off or have his/her shift, station or days off changed for discriminatory reasons, or for disciplinary purposes unless a prior written warning has been given to the employee except where the suspension is for one of the enumerated causes for discharge. All suspensions shall be for reasonable periods under the circumstances of each case. An employee may not be given a disciplinary suspension solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.05. Mitigation of Damages.
Any employee covered by this Agreement who is discharged by the Employer and who disputes his/her discharge was for just cause shall have an affirmative duty to mitigate any potential damages which might result to the Employer in the event the discharge involved is subject to Article 18 of this Agreement (Grievance and Arbitration) and an arbitrator overrules the discharge. In any dispute over the amount of back pay due to an employee under an arbitration award, the arbitrator shall have no authority to award any back pay to that employee unless the employee or the Union has affirmatively proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee has fulfilled his/her duty to mitigate damages at all times since his/her discharge.
ARTICLE?: REPORTING PAY
7.01. Reasons for Payment.
When the Employer or its representative orders an employee to report for work, or fails to notify an employee not to report for work as previously scheduled, for any reason, and said employee is not allowed to work, the Employer shall pay the employee at the employee’s regular rate of pay for the employees’ scheduled shift.
7.02. Discharged Employees.
Employees who are discharged must be notified not later than the end of their shift, except in cases of discharge for dishonesty discovered by the Employer after the end of the shift. If this is not done and the employee reports for work on his/her next regularly scheduled shift and is not allowed to work, the employee shall be paid for the scheduled shift.
7.03. Early Shift Release.
Employees shall not be required by the Employer to leave work before the end of a scheduled shift on which the employees have commenced work, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01; provided that this Section shall not be construed to prohibit an employee, with the Employer’s approval, from voluntarily leaving work early if the employee so desires and being paid only for the time actually worked on the shift.
8
ARTICLE 8:	DISCRIMINATION AND LIE DETECTOR TESTS
8.01. Prohibited Discrimination.
There shall be no discrimination by the Employer or the Union against any employee because of membership or non-membership in, or activity on behalf of the Union, provided that an employee’s Union activities shall not interfere with the performance of the employee’s work for the Employer. In accordance with applicable laws, there shall be no discrimination against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, privileges of or opportunities for employment because of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability or sexual orientation.
8.02. Lie Detector Tests Prohibited.
(a)	No employee shall be required or requested by the Employer to take a lie detector test.
(b)	Applicants for positions other than those for which individual bondable status is required under Section 8.04 shall not be given lie detector tests.
8.03. Confessions or Statements.
No employee shall be required, requested or coerced by the Employer or by any employee of the Employer to resign, or to sign a confession or statement concerning his/her conduct unless a Union representative is first given an opportunity to be present.
8.04. Bondable Status.
In accordance with the present practice as it exists with this Employer, employees who regularly, in the course of their employment, are required to handle money or negotiable instruments may be required to maintain bondable status as a condition of employment.

Where the FMLA governs instead of this Article, all of the requirements for a leave under the FMLA must be met by the employee. Where this Article governs, only the requirements set forth in this Article, and not those in the FMLA, must be met by the employee.
The following requirements shall apply to leaves of absences which are available only under the FMLA:
18
(a)	Eligibility for Leave. Employees are eligible for leave under the FMLA if they have worked at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12) months prior to the requested leaves of absences.
(b)	Conditions for Leave.
(1)	An employee must provide the Employer with thirty (30) days advance notice for any leaves of absence that are foreseeable. If thirty (30) days notice is not given, the Employer has the right to delay the requested leave for thirty (30) days from the date notice is given. If leave is not foreseeable, employees must give as much notice as is practical, generally within one or two business days of when the need for the leave becomes known.
(2)	The employee must provide the Employer with a medical certification from a health care provider (within the meaning of the FMLA) for any leaves of absence for a serious health condition of the employee, or to care for the serious health condition of the employee’s spouse, child or parent. The certification shall state the date on which the serious health condition commenced; the probable duration of the condition; appropriate medical facts about the condition; a statement that the employee is needed to care for the spouse, child or parent, if applicable; and a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of the position, if applicable.

19
13.05. Light Duty.
The Employer reserves the right to assign employees to work in light duty in classifications that are covered and excluded from the terms of this Agreement, during the time that an employee’s bona fide illness or injury compensable under the Nevada Industrial Insurance Act precludes him/her from performing the duties of his/her classification. The employee shall be paid either the temporary total disability rate mandated by the EICON while assigned to light duty excluded from this Agreement, or the appropriate rate for the classification if the employee is assigned to perform bargaining unit work, unless the appropriate rate for the classification is less than the temporary total disability rate mandated by the EICON, in which case the temporary total disability rate will apply. The Employer shall assign the employee to work the shift and hours consistent with the needs of the business and the availability of light duty work, and without regard to restrictions upon a weekly guarantee. In any event, employees assigned light duty work shall be paid at least the temporary total disability rate required by Nevada law.
Time spent working light duty shall not count as shifts worked for completion of the probationary period. However, the employee’s shifts worked, prior to and after assignment to light duty, shall be combined to complete the probationary period. Time spent working light duty shall not be considered a break in service when calculating seniority or vacation entitlement.
If the bargaining unit employee rejects the assignment to perform light duty work, whether within or outside of the bargaining unit, the employee shall be subject to disqualification of benefits under EICON. However, if the bargaining unit employee rejects the assignment to perform light duty work, the bargaining unit employee shall not otherwise be subject to discipline and shall continue to be entitled to leave for which the employee is eligible under Section 13.01(a) of this Agreement.
In the event a bargaining unit employee is assigned and accepts light duty work within the bargaining unit, all applicable provisions of this Agreement, subject to the modifications and restrictions set forth herein, shall apply to such employee, including accrual of seniority, and grievance and arbitration. In addition, the employee shall comply with all Company, House and Departmental rules to the extent required under Section 20.02 of this Agreement.
In the event a bargaining unit employee is assigned and accepts out-of-bargaining unit light duty work, the Employer shall make contributions on behalf of the employee pursuant to Articles 22 and 23 of this Agreement. In the event of a termination, the employee shall be entitled to all rights in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of this Agreement, except in the event of an arbitration, the arbitrator’s power shall be limited to restoring the employee to their pre-injury bargaining unit position. No other provisions of this Agreement shall apply to employee working in out-of-unit light duty positions. The employees shall comply with all Company, House and Departmental rules.
Employees shall be prohibited from receiving double benefits or recovery, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and an action or decision by the EICON, Nevada Department of Administration, or any other local, state, or federal department, agency or court.

ARTICLE 17:	SENIORITY
17.0	1. Probationary Period.
An employee will be considered as a probationary employee until he/she has completed sixty (60) calendar days after his/her most recent date of hire by the Employer. A probationary employee may be terminated at the discretion of the Employer, and such termination shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of Article 18. The above probationary period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union.
17.0	2. Definition of Seniority.
(a)	House seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee’s most recent date of hire into the bargaining unit as a regular or steady extra employee by the Employer.
(b)	Classification seniority is an employee’s length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee’s most recent date of hire into or transfer into his/her present classification on a full-time basis.
(c)	In the administration of this Agreement each of the classifications listed in Exhibit 1 is a separate and distinct classification.
17.03. Layoffs and Recalls.
(a)	In the event of layoffs due to a reduction in force, probationary employees within the affected classification(s) will be the first to be laid off. Employees will be laid off from and recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with their house seniority, provided they have the qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work available in their regular job classification. It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In accordance with their seniority, employees in layoff status will be offered, but not required to perform (subject to subparagraph {c}), all extra work in their classifications except for parties, before extra employees are hired, before steady extra employees are offered such work, and, to the extent practical, before regular employees are assigned to work their sixth (6th) day; provided, however, that such employees who are offered and accept extra work shall be paid as extra employees for such work in accordance with Section 10.05, but shall not be covered by the provisions of Section 9.03. For employees laid off without reasonable expectation of recall within sixty (60) days, the Employer shall provide employees with notice of vacancies (by posting or otherwise), and employees on layoff may apply for these vacancies. Employer shall select employees on layoff, who apply for said vacancies, provided that they are qualified to do the work. Employees must successfully complete a sixty (60) calendar day probationary period. Employee’s recall rights shall be unaffected by the operation of the above provision.
(b)	In the event of a layoff because of circumstances affecting only a portion of the establishment such as a room closing, the affected employees may be laid off without regard to house seniority, provided the layoff is scheduled to be fourteen (14) days or less, or, in the case of housekeeping department employees, the layoff is scheduled to be seven (7) days or less.
24
(c)	Employees to be laid off in accordance with Section 17.03(a) may be laid off without regard to their respective house seniority as each completes his/her current workweek. At the time of layoff the employee shall state availability or nonavailability for extra work; where the employee indicates availability, the employee shall not be called for extra work after he/she refuses two (2) out of seven (7) offers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee may declare unavailability for extra work for a definite period while on layoff.
17.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	When the Employer promotes an employee to another classification, the Employer will consider the employee’s seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in the other classification, and prior performance. Where qualifications to perform the work in the other classifications are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. The Employer shall encourage internal bidding in order to maximize promotional opportunities to permanent vacancies, but the Employer’s promotion decision shall be deemed to be valid unless arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory. An employee who has successfully completed the course of training offered by the Southern Nevada Joint Management Culinary & Bartenders Training Fund for a promotional position, or the Employer’s in-house training program, shall be deemed qualified for such position. For purposes of this paragraph (a) of this Agreement, a “promotion” shall be deemed to be a transfer to another classification in which the transferred employee has an opportunity for increased compensation or for subsequent job progression as a result of the transfer. Any permanent vacancy that is not filled pursuant to Sections 17.04(b) or 10.06(b) of this Agreement, and which would constitute a “promotion” compared to another bargaining unit classification, shall be filled in accordance with this section, provided there is a qualified bidder. Permanent vacancies to be filled by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours near the employees’ time clock or other location to which employees have regular access. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period. An employee promoted under this section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which promoted, shall be transferred back to his/her former job, shift and station within thirty (30) shifts worked after the date of the promotion.
(b)	When there is a permanent vacancy, or a temporary vacancy of at least ninety (90) days, on a particular shift or station, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or stations who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their classification seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/or station applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the employee desiring to transfer. An employee transferred under this Section shall assume the weekly schedule of days of work and days off, and the daily shift scheduled, applicable to the vacant position to which he/she transfers, and the employee shall not be eligible for another transfer under this Section for six (6) months. An employee transferred under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which transferred shall be transferred back to his/her former shift and/or station within thirty (30) shifts worked from the date of transfer. The resulting vacancy or vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or station who desires to work on the shift or station where the vacancy exists. Permanent vacancies under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours in the department where the vacancy exists. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period.
25

(d)	The employee is absent, due to injury or illness sustained during the course of employment, exceeding the period for which statutory, temporary, total disability payments are payable under the Employer’s Insurance Company of Nevada, provided that the employee shall have one (1) week after his/her release in which to return to work. However, the time required for an appeal through the appeals officer level shall not, in and of itself, constitute a break in the employee’s seniority.
(e)	The employee is absent because of layoff exceeding six (6) months if the employee had less than six (6) months of active employment when the layoff began, or absent because of layoff exceeding twelve (12) months if he had six (6) or more months of active employment when the layoff began. However, this provision shall not apply to layoffs because of construction lasting less than eighteen (18) months.
(f)	The employee is absent exceeding six (6) months because of illness or injury not compensable under the Employer’s Insurance Company of Nevada.
17.06. Notification.
An employee who is to be recalled to work by the Employer under Section 17.03 shall be notified to return to work by the Employer advising the employee by telephone, certified mail return receipt requested, or other available means of communication of the date and time the employee is to report, and by confirming such communication by certified mail return receipt requested to the employee’s current address of record on file with the Employer. A copy of the confirmation letter shall be sent to the Union. Reasonable advance notice must be given an employee being recalled. If such employee fails to report to work within forty-eight (48) hours after the time specified for the employee to report, the employee’s seniority and continuous service shall be terminated, and the Employer shall be free to hire a replacement in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement.
