WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to establish wages and other terms and conditions of employment upon which Joumeypersons and apprentices shall work for members of the Associations (it being agreed that the word “JOURNEYPERSON” shall mean all employees described by the IUPAT General Constitution Section 6 (issued January 1,2010) or one who has completed one of the approved apprenticeship programs provided for herein).;
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:
JURISDICTION, RECOGNITION & SCOPE OF WORK
Art. I. Sec. 1. - The Associations, and all their members and all other employers who hereafter become signatories to this Trade Agreement, recognize, acknowledge, and agree that the Union is the exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining within the meaning of Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act and that the Union has demanded recognition as such and has demonstrated through the use of authorization cards executed by a majority of the Association members’ bargaining unit employees that it possesses the support of a majority of all employees of the Associations’ members wherever such employees may be employed, in tire following classifications of work: all work described by the INTERNATIONAL UNION OF PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES General Constitution section 6, issued January 1, 2010.
The Union recognizes that the Associations, because of their size and the nature of their membership in the painting and related industries of New York City, Westchester, Putnam, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, is the principal bargaining representative for all employers working in the industries with whom the Union negotiates collective bargaining agreements, and any extensions or renewals thereof.
The Union shall give principal recognition to any successor association to the Association during the life of this Trade Agreement which (i) may be established; (ii) is affiliated with a national association whose members employ union employees only; and (iii) represents employers in the same industries for which the Union negotiates collective bargaining agreements for work performed in the territorial jurisdiction defined in Art. I, Section 4, of this Agreement and any additional area the Union may be awarded by the LU.P.A.T. General Executive Board.
Art. I. Sec. 2. - This Trade Agreement shall apply to all work involved in or related to the Painting and Protective Coatings Industry, which includes all finishes, dry wall finishing, skim coating, prepping, application of wall coverings, decorative work, plastering preparatory to painting, fabric panels, Forbo corking and all other work referred to in Section 6 the LU.P.A.T. General Constitution issued January 1,2010, or which the General Executive Board of the
5527/12169-012 current/23944140v3
07/22/2011 4:38 pm
LU.P.A.T. puts into the work jurisdiction of the Union. This Trade Agreement will also include all work related to rigging, surface preparation and clean up of any kind as well as lead abatement and glazing. This Trade Agreement shall be specifically applicable to the application of photoluminescent or other illuminated material, including but not limited to. those materials installed for the purpose of establishing exit path markings and exit signs.
Art. I. Sec. 3. - The Union agrees for the life of this Trade Agreement not to sign any agreements (through Local Union No. 1456 or otherwise) for direct hire of its members, unless there is no other way to protect its labor standards. Before agreeing to such a request, the Union agrees to refer any request of this type to the Joint Trade Board. The purpose of this referral is to allow an Association employer the timely opportunity to bid and perform the work required by the user with Union members.
The Union will not sign an agreement directly with any employer until after this review process by the Joint Trade Board. The review process must be timely instituted within 24 hours to allow the Union to maintain its established standards. This provision does not pertain to traditional maintenance agreements or to direct hire contracts signed prior to this Trade Agreement where the Union retains the sole right to make the final determination. When the Joint Trade Board does agree to permit a maintenance agreement, the terms and conditions of that agreement must be provided to the Association. The Union also shall provide the Association with access to all existing maintenance agreements, whether signed by the Union or an Employer.
All maintenance work, whether performed by an Employer or through a direct hire contract with the Union (through Local 1456 or otherwise), shall be performed at a rate of eighty percent (80%) of the standard wage rate.
TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION
Art. I. Sec. 4. - The territorial jurisdiction of this Trade Agreement shall include all areas in the New York Greater Metropolitan Region (Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Putnam counties), and all such areas authorized by the LU.P.A.T.

ENFORCEMENT OF ARTICLE XX
Art. XXI. Sec. 1. - Payments.
(a)	All Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions shall be made at such times and in such manner as the Boards of Trustees (collectively, the “Trustees”) and/or the National Trustees shall prescribe in accordance with the applicable Trust Agreement, as amended from time to time. The Signatory Employers agree that the Trustees shall have the authority to have an independent Certified Public Accountant audit the payroll records, payroll tax returns, cash disbursements records, bank statements, vendor invoices and any and all union reports for all other trades, wages, and general ledger of any Signatory Employer for the purpose of determining the accuracy of such contributions, provided, however, that the compensation and social security number of senior management of the Signatory Employer may be redacted from all such records. “Senior management” shall be defined as any officer, director, partner(s) or owner(s).
The independent Certified Public Accountant shall have the authority to audit, in addition to the documents and information set forth in the preceding paragraph, corporate tax information relating to a Signatory Employer or its affiliated entities, in the event that such independent Certified Public Accountant, in his professional judgment, determines that it is necessary to review such documents and information for the purpose of determining the accuracy of the Signatory Employer’s Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions and such independent Certified Public Accountant provides the Signatory Employer, in writing, with an advance explanation of the reasons for such determination. All documents and information furnished by the Signatory Employer in connection with such audit, shall be treated as confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third parties, except as may be necessary to enforce the Signatory Employer’s obligation with respect to tire Fringe Benefit Funds under this Trade Agreement
Unless otherwise provided by the Trustees, payments for all fringe benefit contribution stamps must be made by certified or bank checks. No cash currency, personal or business checks shall be accepted, except by Signatory Employers in good standing of a recognized Association or other Signatory Employers, who shall be able to pay with regular business account checks on a New York State licensed bank with a branch located in the geographic jurisdiction of this Trade
41
5527/12169-012 current/23944140v3
07/22/2011 4:38 pm
Agreement. If any Signatory Employer shall have its check dishonored, then this privilege shall be withdrawn.
(b)	For the purpose of this Article. Article XX and Article XXII. each hour worked and paid for, including hours attributable to show up time, and other hours for which pay is received by a JOURNEYPERSON or apprentice in accordance with this Trade Agreement, shall be counted as hours for which Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions are payable.
(c)	Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions shall be paid on behalf of any JOURNEYPERSON or apprentice, including, but not limited to, probationary employees, starting with his/her first day of employment in ajob classification covered by this Trade Agreement.
(d)	The failure of an Employer to make fringe benefit contributions or pay interest, liquidated damages or fees related thereto as provided for in this Article and Article XXII and Article XX, shall be attributed to any officer, stockholder, partner or proprietor in actual control of said Employer, and execution of this Trade Agreement by any such person shall bind said person individually to the terms and conditions set forth herein. A default in payment of any fringe benefit contributions or pay interest, liquidated damages or fees related thereto due pursuant to this Article and Article XX and Article XXII shall follow said officer, stockholder, partner, and/or proprietor into any succeeding enterprise entered into by said person. Where the Trustees determine that an Employer is being operated in the name of a nominee, family member, successor entity or alter ego of an individual actually controlling the Employer, the Trustees may consider any default of the obligations set forth in such Articles to be the default of said controlling individual.
(e)	Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions Payment Method. Signatory Employers must make Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions under the Stamp System. The amount of the security payment shall be $10,000.00.
(f)	As of May 1,2001, all fringe benefit stamps for a week must be included with the wage payments for such week, as already provided in this Trade Agreement.
(g)	Regardless of the ability or inability of a Signatory Employer to pay its required Fringe Benefit Contributions, the Signatory Employer shall be required to submit remittance reports weekly and the bargaining parties recommend that the trustees create an option for employers to make fund payments and submit remittance reports electronically. The failure to submit such reports will subject the Signatory Employer to fines by the Joint Trade Committee.
Art. XXI. Sec. 2. - Penalties.
(a)	The required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions constitute a consideration for entering into this Trade Agreement and constitute its very essence. Failure by any Signatory Employer to pay to the Trust Funds amounts due under this Trade Agreement shall be deemed a breach of this Trade Agreement, and thereupon a termination notice shall be served by the Trustees upon the Union. In such event, the Union must enforce the foregoing and following provisions relating to payment to the Trustees. In the event a Signatory Employer fails to make the required payments or reports for more than forty-eight (48) hours after such notice of termination, the Union must order its JOURNEYPERSONS and apprentices to cease work on all the delinquent employer's
42
5527/12169*012 current/23944140v3
07/22/2011 4:38 pm
projects until all required payments and/or reports have been rendered. Such Signatory Employer must pay all such JOURNEYPERSONS and apprentices for all time lost, not to exceed one (1) week of wages per JOURNEYPERSON or apprentice.
(b)	If a Signatory Employer fails to make contributions to the Pension Fund within the date required by the National Trustees, or fails to make any other Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions when due in a timely manner pursuant to this Trade Agreement, the Union shall have the right to take whatever steps are necessary to secure compliance with this Trade Agreement, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof to the contrary. The Signatory Employer shall be liable for all costs of collection of the payments due together with attorneys’ fees and such penalties as may be assessed by the Trustees and/or National Trustees, as set forth in Art. XXII, Sec. 2(a), (b), (c) and (d). The Signatory Employer’s liability for payment of Pension Fund Contributions under this Trade Agreement shall not be subject to or covered by the grievance or arbitration procedure in Articles XII and XIII, nor the “no strike" clause set forth in Art. XIV.
(c)	Any job action taken by the Union pursuant to the procedures in foregoing Article XXI, Sections 2(a) and (b) shall not be covered by the “no strike" clause set forth in Article XIV. The Union shall suffer no liability for ordering its members to cease work upon demand from the Trustees and each Signatory Employer expressly waives any right it may have to bring suit for damages or other relief against the Union for breach of the no-strike clause in the event the Union orders its members to cease work after demand from the Trustees.
Art XXI. Sec. 3. - Qualification for Income Tax Deductions. Each of the Trust Funds set forth in Article XX which are intended to qualify under the Internal Revenue Code shall at all times conform with tire currently applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code so as to enable each Signatory Employer at all times to treat Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions as a current deduction for income tax purposes. In the event that an Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contribution is not currently deductible, the Signatory Employer shall not be required to make such payment.
BONDS, DAMAGES, FEES AND INTEREST
Art. XXII. Sec. 1. - Bonds.
(a)	Security. The Signatory Employer shall provide security to the Trustees for the faithful performance by it of the requirements under this Trade Agreement for the the payment of Signatory Employer Benefit Contributions, liquidated damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, costs of collection and other monetary obligations under this Trade Agreement. The Trustees shall be entitled to retain any interest that accrues on such security during tire time such security is deposited with the Trustees.
(b)	Form of Security. Such security deposited with the Trustees shall be in the form of cash, surety bond acceptable to the Trustees, or other security acceptable to the Trustees.
(c)	Amount of Security. The amount of security which the Signatory Employer is required to deposit with the Trustees under the stamp system shall be $10,000.00. The security provided in accordance with the foregoing shall be available to satisfy any delinquency in Article XX Fringe Benefit Contributions and any interest or liquidated damages resulting from such
43
5527/12169-012 current/23944140v3
07/22/2011 4:38 pm
delinquency. In the event that a former Signatory Employer does not report any work covered by this Trade Agreement (or its successor) for a two year period and such employer refuses or fails to make records available to tire Certified Public Accountant as described in Article XXI, Section 1(a), the entire amount of such employer’s security shall apply and be paid to the Fringe Benefit Funds (in proportion to their respective contribution rates) to the Signatory Employer’s credit.
(d)	If at any time a Signatory Employer’s security on deposit with the Trustees shall, for any reason, be in an amount less than the amount required by this Section, the Signatory Employer shall immediately deposit with the Trustees additional security so that the Signatory Employer’s security on deposit shall at all times comply with this subsection.
(e)	The Trustees shall not accept any surety bond or other non-cash collateral from any Signatory Employer who shall have failed in the past to make payment of any sums found by the Trustees or National Trustees to be due under this Trade Agreement or under any prior Trade Agreement. In such cases, compliance with tire security requirements hereof shall be by cash deposit only.
(f)	Additional Security. In the event the Trustees determine that a Signatory Employer is guilty of violating any provision of this Trade Agreement or in the event the Trustees bring suit against a Signatory Employer to collect unpaid Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions or interest, liquidated damages or fees related thereto, the Signatory Employer shall provide additional security in such form and amount, as the Trustees shall determine. The Trustees may, but are not required to, assess such additional security in an amount no less than the amount of the Signatory Employer’s potential, existing or future liability to the Trustees. Any additional security required pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited with the Trustees who are authorized to pay out of such security any sums found by the Trustees to be due for unpaid Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions, liquidated damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, or other costs of collection.
Art. XXII. Sec. 2. - Damages, Interest and Fees.
(a)	Liquidated Damages. Time is of the essence for the payment of Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions. The parties recognize and acknowledge that the regular and prompt payment of Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions by Signatory Employers is essential, and that it would be extremely difficult, if not impractical, to fix the actual expense and damages which will result from a failure of a Signatory Employer to make the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions in full within the time provided, and without becoming delinquent. Therefore, the parties agree that if tlie required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions shall become delinquent, the amount of damage resulting from any such delinquency shall be, by way of liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, a sum equivalent to 10% of the total Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions required pursuant to this Trade Agreement, for each failure to pay in full within the time provided in Art. XX, Sec. 1 (g), for each pay period for which payments are required to be made; unless a lawsuit is commenced to recover such contributions, in which case the liquidated damages shall be 20% of the required contributions. The liquidated damages, so fixed and computed, shall be added to and become a part of the Signatory Employer’s required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contribution due to any of the Trustees.
44
5527/12169-012 current/23944140v3
07/22/2011 4:38 pm
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Signatory Employer shall be assessed liquidated damages if a delinquency is cured within 29 days from the date from which contributions were due.
(b)	Interest. If the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions of a Signatory Employer become delinquent, in addition to the amount assessed as liquidated damages, interest shall be added to the obligation of the delinquent Signatory Employer, calculated monthly at the annual rate of the prime rate plus 2.0%, which shall be calculated based upon the sum of all Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions due for the period for which the Signatory Employer is delinquent, starting with the first day of delinquency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Signatory Employer will be charged interest if a delinquency is cured within 8 days from the date from which contributions were due.
(c)	Attorneys’ Fees and Cost of Collection. If the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions become delinquent, in addition to the amount due as liquidated damages and interest as provided for in the preceding subsections (a) and (b), there shall be added to the obligation of the delinquent Signatory Employer, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustees in the collection of any delinquency, liquidated damages and interest, including but not limited to (i) reasonable attorneys’ fees; (ii) accountant’s fees; (iii) cost of attachment and execution; (iv) bond; (v) receivers; and (vi) court costs.
(d)	All liquidated damages, interest, and any other costs and assessments due and received from a delinquent Signatory Employer shall be paid to and received by the Trustees.
Art. XXII. Sec. 3. - Trust Fund Hearing.
(a)	Signatory Employer Request. Should a Signatory Employer, after an audit held by the Trustees, be subject to an assessment of additional Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions, the Signatory Employer shall be entitled, on request, to a hearing before the Trustees or a properly appointed subcommittee thereof. At such hearing, the Signatory Employer shall be given an opportunity to present all available facts, and shall be subject to open examination thereon, so that the Signatory Employer may establish an actual lower direct labor cost such that a readjustment of the basis for the calculation of the Signatory Employer’s Fringe Benefit Contributions due to the Trustees is warranted. At such hearing, the Trustees shall consider the recommendation of the Funds’ auditors and any proof that the Signatory Employer may offer. If the Signatory Employer’s right to a readjustment is proven, the Trustees shall remit any excess Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions to the Signatory Employer. The decision of the Trustees, after such hearing, shall be final and binding.
(b)	Failure to Request Hearing. If, after an audit and a final assessment of further contributions due, the Signatory Employer fails, within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof given by the Trustees, to request in writing a hearing before them as provided in the preceding sub-section (a), the Signatory Employer shall be deemed conclusively to have consented thereto, with no further recourse.

Re: Non-Manhattan Work
Dear Mr. Cafiero,
This letter is to confirm the agreement between District Council No. 9 and the Association of Master Painters of New York, Inc. with respect to commercial work done in the outer boroughs and counties. This side letter shall apply only to Association employers in the first instance. Association employers wishing to take advantage of this provision shall make application to the Joint Trade Board, whom shall generally approve such applications and shall not unreasonably withhold its approval. The Joint Trade Board, however, may withhold approval where it finds there is a reasonable basis to believe that the application of this provision will not materially advance the interests of the industry, e.g. where another discount has already been provided. If the Joint Trade Board deadlocks on whether to grant approval, the employer may request that the Joint Trade Board submit the request to arbitration. Upon receipt of such request, the Joint Trade Board shall promptly submit such grievance or dispute to arbitration pursuant to the Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The decision of the AAA arbitrator shall be final and binding.
Labor for work performed under this provision shall be provided through Local Union 1456, edthough all Journeymen and Apprentices are eligible to work on such projects.
The following terms shall apply to all work performed under this side letter.
•	Payroll Costs. For all work performed outside of Manhattan, the wage and benefit rates contained in the Trade Agreement shall be adjusted to provide for a twenty per cent (20%) reduction in the payroll costs attributable to applicable wage and benefit rates. This reduction may be accomplished by any lawful method, including direct payroll reductions, targeting efforts in accordance with existing targeting program, or any combination thereof, resulting in the equivalent of a twenty percent (20%) reduction in payroll costs (wage and benefit costs).
•	Labor shall be provided through Local 1456. All employees are eligible to work on non-Manhattan projects under this side letter but must clear into Local 1456.
•	The standard workweek shall consist of any 35 or 40 hours in a week, at the Employer’s discretion, excluding Sundays (which, if worked, will be considered overtime). The length of the workweek for each job shall be preregistered.

•	The standard workday shall consist of 7 or 8 hours a day at the option of employer. The length of the workday must be preregistered.
•	Job Stewards for non-Manhattan projects performed under this side letter shall be appointed by Union. Unqualified or unproductive job stewards may be removed, subject to review by the Joint Trade Committee, which shall convene a hearing within 24 hours.
•	A Non-Manhattan Project Stamp shall be created.
•	Appropriate penalties for violation of this side-letter shall be established by the Joint Trade Committee.
