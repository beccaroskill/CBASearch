Section 10--Exchange Days.
With the approval of the unit member's immediate supervisor, a unit member may exchange up to ten (10) workdays within the same school year with another unit member. The exchanges will allow a unit member scheduled to work to be absent and be replaced by an acceptable and qualified unit member not scheduled to work, and then later reciprocate in order to make up lost workdays. The request and exchange plan for the exchange days must be filed with the immediate supervisor not less than five (5) working days prior to the exchange day(s). Failure of a unit member to carry out the obligation to reciprocate under an approved exchange agreement within the school year shall result in a loss of pay for the day(s) in question, which shall be paid to the unit member who worked the added day(s). Paid leave time shall not be used to avoid repayment of exchange days. Where disputes arise regarding the repayment of exchange days, the unit member may appeal to the District's Chief Human Resources Officer.

Except at schools where all teachers have roving room assignments, the administrators of four-track, year-round schools may designate roving teachers after consideration of volunteers for roving assignments. In the absence of volunteers for roving assignments, the school administrator will rotate the rover assignments so that there is a fair distribution of roving assignments among unit members. The District shall make reasonable effort to provide locking storage space for the roving teacher. Teachers in their first two (2) years in the teaching profession shall not be given assignments if assigned prior to the first day of instruction unless no other option exists.

If the agreement is for five (5) years or less, the unit member shall receive full benefits as set forth in Article XII of this Agreement as if employed full-time. Participation in the program is limited to not more than (10) years. At the end of ten (10) years or the expiration of the reduced workload part-time, the unit member must retire.

The request shall be on a District-supplied form. The transfer request must be received by Human Resources prior to April 1 in order to be considered for the beginning of the next school year. Human Resources will return a date-stamped copy of the transfer request to the unit member.

Where the foregoing factors are substantially equal, first (1st) preference in transfer shall be given to the applicant who has made the third (3rd) annual request for transfer, if any. Second (2nd) preference in transfer shall be given to the applicant with the greatest seniority. The District may use an oral interview panel to evaluate candidates for voluntary transfer based upon the criteria set forth in this subsection.
C.	Once selected for requested transfer, the tenured unit member may rescind his/her request with the District's agreement.
D.	The District has the right to limit voluntary transfers for any unit member to one (1) per school year.
E.	Unit members hired specifically for the Special Education or Bilingual Education programs may not transfer out of the program during their first four (4) years of employment. The District must give notice of this limitation at the time of the unit member's employment.
F.	Voluntary transfers are implemented at the next instructional break; e.g., semester, parent conference, track change, winter recess, or spring recess.

(3)	Ethnic balance of the staff as required by law;
(4)	Staffing for designated co-curricular activities (secondary schools only); and

Where the foregoing factors are substantially equal, the unit member with the least seniority shall be the unit member to be transferred. No involuntary transfer shall occur under this subsection if there is a qualified volunteer from the school to be reduced in staff requesting a transfer.
C.	The unit member shall receive a written statement of the reason for the transfer. The unit member may request a meeting with the District's Chief Human Resources Officer or designee to discuss the involuntary transfer.
D.	A list of open positions in the District will be made available to the Association and to any unit member being involuntarily transferred. Unit members may request the positions in order of preference. Based upon the factors set forth in subsection "B" of this Section, the District will fill open positions from among those unit members being involuntarily transferred. Upon transfer to one of the open positions, the unit member will be considered involuntarily transferred.

year in different grade levels of instruction or subject changes shall be granted a reasonable time to prepare for the new assignment, not to exceed three (3) days.
F.	A unit member involuntarily transferred shall not be involuntarily transferred again for a period of two (2) years; however, the transfer of a District program from one site to another does not constitute an involuntary transfer of a unit member.
G.	Unit members returning from a leave of one year or less shall be governed by this Section 4.
H.	Within one (1) year following an involuntary transfer resulting from a staff reduction, as set forth in "B" above, a unit member has priority to return to his/her former school, if qualified to fill a vacancy. The District has no obligation to give notice to the unit member of any vacancy or right to return. When a vacancy occurs, the unit member must inform the District if he/she wishes to return to his/her prior school of assignment.
Section 5--School Closure.
If a school site is closed, unit members at the closed site, if qualified, shall be granted first priority in filling vacant positions at the school or schools at which the students at the closed school are being placed for the succeeding school year. Said positions shall not be deemed to exist unless there is sufficient enrollment to maintain the position past the first twenty (20) days of the school year. In addition, unit members from closed schools shall have first priority to fill all vacancies for which they are qualified, with selection based upon the criteria set forth in Section 3(B) of this Article. In order to accomplish the purpose of this Section, the District may limit the provisions of Sections 2 and 3 of this Article to unit members displaced by school closures. For purposes of this Section 5, schools converted to year-round education shall be treated as a school closure. In addition, when the grade level at a school site is moved to another site, the affected unit members shall be governed by this Section 5.

Sections 2 and 3 of this Article. The application for transfer shall be on District-provided Itinerant Transfer Application forms.
Section 7--Seniority.
For purposes of this Article XIX, seniority is established by the unit member's date of credentialed employment with the District. If there has been a break in service, the most recent date of employment shall be used. Those unit members whose dates of employment with the District are the same shall have their seniority established by lot. In cases of involuntary transfer, high school Departmental Chairpersons shall have the greatest seniority. When designated in writing to the District, Association Building Representatives shall have the greatest seniority following Departmental Chairperson.
Section 8--Transfer Information.
The District shall provide the Association with one (1) copy of the Notice of Personnel Action showing all transfers of unit members.

B.	Unit members shall have their annual sick leave credited to their account at the beginning of each school year, whether or not it has already been earned. A unit member who terminates employment prior to earning sick leave taken in advance of accrual shall have the amount of such unearned sick leave deducted from the final paycheck.
C.	Sick leave may be used for authorized absences from duty because of illness, injury, or exposure to contagious disease that prevents the unit member from performing the duties of his/her job.

The conditions for this leave are as follows:
A.	The unit member's salary shall be reduced by the amount actually paid a substitute. Such amount is based upon the District-established rate of pay for substitutes. If no substitute is employed, the amount deducted shall be the established rate of pay for the day-to-day substitute.

Section 4--Industrial Accident and Illness Leave.
Unit members who sustain illness or injury arising out of and in the course of their employment with the District shall be entitled to Industrial Accident and Illness Leave, as set forth in the following conditions and regulations:
A.	Any absence that is supported by an authorized doctor's certificate and is verified by the District's Workers' Compensation Office as qualified for Workers' Compensation is an absence payable under Industrial Accident and Illness Leave. Industrial Accident and Illness Leave is to be paid in lieu of temporary disability payments, and entitlement to the leave is governed by the Education Code.
Initially, the unit member's sick leave will be charged for the absence. Once the Workers' Compensation Office has verified eligibility for Industrial Accident and Illness Leave, the sick leave for the authorized number of days will be reimbursed and Industrial Accident and Illness Leave will be charged. (In the event the unit member is out of sick leave, appropriate payroll deductions will be 60

(3)	Industrial Accident and Illness Leave shall not be accumulative from year to year, nor from one illness/accident to another.
C.	Should the unit member's absence due to an industrial accident or illness extend beyond sixty (60) workdays, the unit member shall be permitted to use only as much of his/her accumulated sick leave, compensatory time, vacation, or other available leave which, when added to the temporary disability benefits, provides for not more than a full day's wage or salary.
D.	During any period that a unit member has paid leave benefits available for his/her use, the District shall monitor the temporary disability benefits to assure proper retirement credit and contributions for State Teachers' Retirement System (STRS).

E.	When students are referred to another school for adjustment purposes by the Hearing Panel or Transfer Committee, the cause for that transfer shall be communicated in writing to the students' teachers at the recipient school prior to the time the student is placed in the classroom if the cause is related to physical aggression, weapon possession or use, or threatening behavior towards staff.

so that the unit member's ability to perform his/her job safely is reduced.
For example, any of the following, alone or in combination, may constitute reasonable suspicion:
a)	Slurred speech

e)	Serious accident causing injury
f)	Physical altercation
g)	Verbal altercation

Unit members entering a rehabilitation program in lieu of discipline shall be required to submit to random testing for up to one (1) year after completion of the program. Violation of the rehabilitation agreement shall be cause for disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
While receiving medical treatment for alcohol or drug abuse, the unit member shall be eligible to apply for sick leave and long-term sick-leave benefits as provided for in Article XX.
