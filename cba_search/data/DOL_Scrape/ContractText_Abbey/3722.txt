AGREEMENT
This agreement, entered into this 12th day of November, 2019 between the City of Peoria, Illinois (the Employer, the City) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Local 3464 (AFSCME, the Union):
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the City and Union have endorsed the practices and procedures of collective bargaining as a fair and orderly way of conducting their relations with one another; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties to set forth herein their agreement covering rates of pay, wages, hours of work, and other conditions of employment; and to provide a procedure for the equitable and peaceful resolution of differences;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promise and agreements herein contained, the parties do mutually promise and agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION
SECTION 1.1 - UNION RECOGNITION: The City recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of bargaining the wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment, for all full time employees (those employees who are scheduled to work 40 hours each week on a year round basis) and regular part time employees (those employees who are regularly scheduled to work more than twenty (20) hours each week throughout the year) assigned to the job classification attached in Appendix A.
Excluded employees would include managerial, supervisory, confidential, short-term employees, and all other excluded employees as defined by the Illinois State Labor Relations Act.
Any employee hired on a temporary basis up to 180 calendar days to perform bargaining unit work shall not be covered by this Agreement. If that employee is employed in excess of 180 days, the temporary employee shall then be represented by the Union and covered by this Agreement. Such employees shall only be utilized to supplement the work force and not to permanently fill budgeted bargaining unit positions.
This Agreement shall not affect the hiring of agency personnel by the City per current practice.
SECTION 1.2 - NEW CLASSIFICATION: The employer shall promptly notify the Union of its decision to create any and all new class specifications. If the parties agree that the proposed new class specification is a successor title to a class specification covered by this Agreement, with no substantial change in duties, the Union and employer shall alter Appendix A to insure the new class specification becomes a part of this Agreement. Similarly, if the proposed class specification is a successor title to a class specification not previously included in Appendix A, with no substantial change in duties, it shall continue to be excluded from recognition.
If the Employer determines there is a need to modify any job description, the Union will be notified within 30 days.
Disputes regarding inclusion/exclusion of new class specification within the bargaining unit are subject to the grievance procedure, with such grievances being submitted at the Human Resources level of the grievance procedure. Should the issue proceed to the arbitration step, the arbitrator shall be instructed that the current unit was agreed to on the basis of an historical relationship, that the current unit contains a mixture of clerical,
1
professional and technical job titles, but that the historical recognition is not to be an indication nor a guide for the purpose of inclusion of new class specifications under dispute.
The arbitrator is to exclude: (1) all seasonal (those hired to work for a fixed period of time), casual, irregular part-time (those scheduled to work 20 hours per week or less); (2) managerial, supervisory, confidential, elected officials and their direct reports, and all officers of the City, and (3) all employees who do not share a substantial community of interest with the existing bargaining unit.
SECTION 1.3 - MERGER OF JOB CLASSIFICATIONS: The employer's determination to merge existing class specifications shall be subject to Section 1.2 as though it were a new class specification.
SECTION 1.4 - UNION EXCLUSIVITY: The Employer shall not discuss, confer, subsidize or negotiate with any other employee organization or its representatives on matters pertaining to hours, wages, and working conditions of employees in the bargaining unit. Nor shall the Employer negotiate with employees over their hours, wages, and working conditions, except as provided herein.
SECTION 1.5 - EMERGENCY CALL-OUT: In case of a declared emergency by the City Manager, the City will be allowed to assign, direct, and conduct operations of employees in positions that may not coincide with their regular duties or responsibilities.	-
ARTICLE 2 UNION RIGHTS
SECTION 2.1 - DUES DEDUCTION: The City agrees to continue to deduct the dues, assessments or fees for the Union upon the receipt of a written and signed authorization form from any employee. The Employer shall honor employees’ individually authorized deductions, including any P.E.O.P.L.E contributions. Such money deducted shall be remitted to the official designated by the Union for receipt of such funds in accordance with the current practice. The Union shall advise the City in writing of any change in the amount to be deducted at least fifteen (15) days prior to the effective date of the change. Employees in the bargaining unit who do not currently belong to the Union shall be given the opportunity to join. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law or which is not affirmatively consented to by the employee. The employer shall notify both Council 31 and the local via electronic mail of all new persons hired into the bargaining unit position or when they change positions or bargaining units on or before the new employee(s) date of employment.
SECTION 2.2 - UNION MEMBERSHIP: The employer, including its officers, supervisors, managers and/or agents, shall not discourage any bargaining unit employee from being a Union member or otherwise participating in Union activities.
SECTION 2.3- UNION INDEMNIFICATION: The Union shall indemnify, defend, and save the City harmless against all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability and for all reasonable legal costs that shall rise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the City in properly complying with the provisions of this article. The City will promptly notify the Union of all such charges received by the City. The parties shall mutually agree upon legal representation.
Should the City make an error in the Union's favor of any deductions, the Union agrees to refund to the City within fifteen (15) days.
SECTION 2.4 - UNION ACCESS: Council 31, or the AFSCME International Union representatives shall have access to the premises of the City in order to help resolve a serious dispute or problem. In order to receive access, the representatives must provide notice to the appropriate City representative and make arrangements not to disrupt the work of employees on duty.
2
SECTION 2.5 - BULLETIN BOARDS: The Employer shall provide enclosed bulletin boards at each work location. The Union agrees to equally share bulletin board space with other labor organizations. The boards shall be for the sole and exclusive use of said labor organizations. The items posted shall not be political, partisan or defamatory in nature. The locations shall be:
1.	City Hall, 1 st Floor
2.	Dries Lane Public Works Facility
3.	Police Department Building, 1" Floor
4.	ECC
SECTION 2.6 - OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT: Bargaining unit employees may not carry on any private business or employment which affects the time or quality of their work, which would seem to a reasonable person to be a conflict of interest with their position held at the City, or which casts discredit upon the City government. The Human Resources Director must be notified of any secondary employment. Employees taking a second job will notify the Human Resources Director of outside employment on a form provided by the City. The Human Resources Director will be notified of any change in secondary employment.
Upon the signing of this contract, all employees will fill out a secondary employment form and turn into Human Resources and will notify Human Resources of any subsequent changes in their secondary employment status.
SECTION 2.7- INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE UNION: The Employer shall promptly notify the local 3464 the Union secretary and President in writing via email of hires and terminations of bargaining unit employees. In addition, the employer shall report to the Union as they occur but no later than the 15th of the following month the listed personnel transactidns which occurred in the prior month; new hires, promotions, reallocations, lay-offs and reemployment. Consistent with current practice, the Employer will notify the local in writing via email of the following personnel transactions, on a quarterly basis: discharges, transfers out of the unit, terminations and the hiring of temporary employees. In all transactions listed above, bargaining unit employee's employee identification number will be included.
SECTION 2.8 - TIME OFF FOR UNION ACTIVITY: Local Union representatives shall be allowed reasonable time off without pay for legitimate Union business such as Union meetings, State or area wide Union committee meetings, State or international conventions, provided such representatives shall give notice to his/her supervisor of such absence and shall be allowed such time off if it does not substantially interfere with the operating needs of the Employer. Such time off shall not be detrimental in any way to the employee's record. The number of representatives selected to attend such activities shall not exceed one (1) employee from within the same division unless otherwise agreed to by the Director of the department.
For the Union's monthly meeting, one elected shift officer shall be released from duty to attend this meeting, with pay, up to a total of three hours. The City may seek a volunteer to fill this vacancy. If a volunteer is not available, the City may refuse the employee to attend this meeting due to an emergency or staffing needs within the department.
Effective 4/24/05 the practice of payment of Union officials for Union business for employers other than the City of Peoria will be discontinued. Any further payment by the City after that date will require the Union to reimburse the City for such wage expenditures. Invoices sent to AFSCME for reimbursement for wage expenditures will be paid within ninety (90) days.
SECTION 2.9 - UNION ORIENTATION: Generally, within the first week after the Union has been notified that a new employee has started employment with the City, the Union may schedule a thirty (30) minute orientation with the employee, with prior notification and approval of the employee's supervisor.
3
SECTION 2.10 - DISTRIBUTION OF UNION MATERIALS: The Employer agrees that the Union shall have the right to use the inter-office mail system for Union correspondence. During employee's non-working hours, he shall be permitted to distribute Union literature to other non-working employees in non-work areas and in work areas during non-work hours. Communications that are political in nature and/or which are in violation of the City’s anti-harassment policy are not permitted.
SECTION 2.11 - UNION MEETINGS ON PREMISES: The Employer agrees to make available conference and meeting rooms for Union meetings upon prior notification by the designated Union representative, unless to do so would seriously interfere with the operating needs of the Employer, or cause undue inconvenience to the Employer. Union stewards/representatives and employees shall record all Union business events during their regular hours of employment on their time sheets.
SECTION 2.12 - RATE OF PAY: Any time off with pay provided for under this Article shall be at the employee's applicable rate of pay as though the employee were working.
SECTION 2.13 - PERSONNEL RECORDS: The Employer and the Union agree to abide by the Illinois Personnel Record Review Act during the term of this Agreement
SECTION 2.14 - UNION REPRESENTATIVES LIST: The Union, upon request by the City, shall provide each year, an updated list of all local stewards, officers, and official representatives of the bargaining unit, along with their department/division location. Any changes in the list during the year shall be immediately reported to the Human Resources Director.
ARTICLES

SECTION 3.2 - STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to modify, eliminate or detract from the statutory responsibilities and obligations of the Employer except that the exercise of its rights in the furtherance of such statutory obligations shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 4

SECTION 4.1 - PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION: Both the Employer and the Union agree not to discriminate against any employee based on the protected class status of race, sex, creed, religion, color, age, national origin, mental and/or physical disability, pregnancy or pregnancy related illness or child birth, sexual preference or sexual orientation or any other form of discrimination prohibited by applicable federal, state and local law.
4
SECTION 4.2 - EQUAL EMPLOYMENT/AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: The parties recognize the Employer's obligation to comply with applicable federal, state, and local fair employment practice laws.
SECTION 4.3 - UNION ACTIVITY: The Employer and the Union agree that no employee shall be discriminated against, intimidated, restrained or coerced in the exercise of any rights granted by the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act, or on account of membership or non-membership in, or lawful activities on behalf of the Union.
SECTION 4.4 - GENDER CLAUSE: The use of the masculine pronoun throughout this agreement has been adopted by the parties for clerical convenience and shall in all instances include the feminine gender as well as the masculine.
ARTICLE 5
GRIEVANCE
SECTION 5.1	A - DEFINITION: A grievance is defined as a complaint or dispute between the parties, including the application or interpretation of this agreement.
SECTION 5.1	B - COMPLAINTS ON MATTERS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION: An employee or a group of employees may file a complaint concerning any matter in Article 22 (Health and Safety) of this agreement and such a complaint shall be processed in accordance with Section 5.2 below. Such complaints shall not, however, be subject to arbitration (Section 5.3).
SECTION 5.2	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE: The Union and/or any employee may file a grievance. It is the intention of both parties to promptly address grievances and to settle disputes at the lowest possible level.
Step One: Division Head (when appropriate)
An employee and his steward shall first attempt to resolve the grievance with the employee's Division Head who is outside the bargaining unit. All grievances must be presented not later than ten (10) working days of the occurrence upon which the grievance is based or when the grievant knew or should have known of the event. The Division Head shall meet with the grievant and his Union representative within ten (10) work days from receipt of the appeal to resolve the dispute whenever possible and if not settled, stating reasons why settlement was not possible. The Division Head shall render a written response to the grievance within ten (10) working days after the grievance has been presented.
Step Two: Department Head
If the Union desires to further process the grievance, it shall be presented in writing by the Union to the Department Head within ten (10) working days from the receipt of the answer from Step 1 of the grievance procedure. Within ten (10) working days after the grievance is presented to Step 2, the Department Head shall hold a grievance hearing with the Grievant and the Union. The Department Head shall render a written answer to the grievance within ten (10) working days after such hearing is held and provide a copy of such answer to the Union.
Step Three: Human Resources Director
If the Union desires to further process the grievance, it shall be presented by the Union to the City Manager (or designee selected by the City Manager) in writing within ten (10) working days after receipt of Step 2 answer. Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the written grievance, the parties shall meet in an attempt to resolve the grievance unless the parties mutually agree otherwise. The City Manager (or designee) shall give his written response within ten (10) working days following the meeting.
5
Step Four: Arbitration
If the Union desires to further advance the grievance it may seek arbitration. Decision by the Union to seek arbitration shall be made within ten (10) working days from receipt of the Step 3 response through written notification to the Human Resources Director. The Union shall notify the FMCS and shall request that the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) submit a panel list of seven (7) arbitrators, preferably experienced in municipal matters. The cost of this initial panel list of arbitrators shall be split evenly by the parties. The representatives of the parties shall meet within ten (10) working days of their receipt of this list from FMCS and engage in a mutual striking process to select an arbitrator. Each party shall have the right to reject one entire list, provided such rejection occurs within five (5) working days of the receipt of the list. The party rejecting the list shall be required to pay the full cost of the replacement panel. The parties shall alternately strike a name from the list until there is one name remaining, with the party requesting the arbitration striking the first name. The remaining name shall be the arbitrator.
SECTION 5.3-	ARBITRATION PROCEDURES: Both parties agree to attempt to arrive at a joint stipulation of the facts and issues as outlined to be submitted to the arbitrator.
The Employer or Union shall have the right to request the arbitrator to require the presence of witnesses and/or reasonable documents. Each party shall bear the expense of its own witnesses who are not employees of the employer.
The arbitrator shall have no authority to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide the issue(s) presented and fashion an appropriate remedy. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the employee or employees involved.
The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the cost of the hearing room, and the cost of a court reporter to provide a written transcript for the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties. If either party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it shall pay for the cost of its copy.
SECTION 5.4 - TIME LIMITS: The time limits at any step or for any hearing may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties involved at that particular step. The Employer's failure to respond within the time limits shall constitute a denial, and the grievance may be immediately appealed to the next step. Grievances not appealed within the designated time limits will be treated as withdrawn grievances. The term "days", as used throughout this Article, refers to work days.
SECTION 5.5 - INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION: When investigating and making a grievance, an employee shall (subject to the limitations below) be released from work without loss of pay for not more than two (2) hours to investigate and present the case in the oral step. If the employee requests Union representation during the investigatory, oral, or writing phase, one Union representative shall (subject to the limitations below) be released from work without loss of pay, for the same time limit as the employee. In formal grievance meetings (step one and above), the employee and the first Union representative may be joined by a second Union representative. Grievants and witnesses, who are called back on a different shift and/or on his day off as a result of the Employer scheduling a grievance meeting shall be compensated for attending such meetings. Meetings scheduled by an arbitrator shall not be compensated unless it falls on the employee's normal work shift. The employer and the Union shall schedule such meetings at the most convenient hour for all parties. When such meetings are held on the grievant's or witnesses work shift, they will be permitted reasonable time without loss of pay to attend grievance meetings and/or respond to the Union's investigation.
No employee or Union representative shall leave his work to investigate, file or process a grievance without first notifying and making mutual arrangements with his supervisor or designee as well as the supervisor of any unit to be visited, and such arrangements shall not be unreasonably denied.
6
Upon request, the employee and Union representative shall be allowed privacy or the use of an appropriate room while discussing a grievance; and shall be permitted the reasonable use of telephone facilities for the purpose of investigating or processing grievances. "Reasonable" telephone use does not include long distance or toll calls at the employer's expense.
SECTION 5.6	- ADVANCED GRIEVANCE STEP FILING: Certain issues which by nature are not capable of being settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure, may be filed at the appropriate advanced step where the action giving rise to the grievance was initiated.
SECTION 5.7	- EFFECT OF SETTLEMENTS: A grievance may be withdrawn or settled at any step without creating a precedent.
SECTION 5.8	- PERTINENT WITNESSES AND INFORMATION: In the interest of early settlement of disputes, both parties agree to provide directly applicable documents and witnesses pertinent to the grievance under consideration which are reasonably available to them and to the other party.

ARTICLE 6
NO STRIKE AND NO LOCKOUT
SECTION 6.1 - NO STRIKE AND NO LOCKOUT: The Union and the employees covered by this Agreement recognize and agree that the rendering of services to the community cannot, under any circumstances or conditions, be withheld, interrupted, or discontinued, in such a way that to do so would endanger the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the City. Therefore, during the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor its agents nor any employee, for any reason, will authorize, institute, aid, condone, or engage in any slowdown (a concerted effort to systematically delay or diminish services to the City), work stoppage, or strike, by bargaining unit employees. During the term of this Agreement, neither the Employer nor its agents for any reason shall authorize, institute, aid, engage in or promote any lockout of employees covered by this Agreement.

EMPLOYEE TESTING AND FITNESS FOR DUTY
SECTION 8.1	- EMPLOYEE TESTING: All employee testing shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
A. Psychological, Psychiatric and Physiological Testing: No employee shall be requested or required to undergo psychological, psychiatric or physiological testing unless the employer has just cause to believe the employee is then unfit for duty. The employer shall set forth the basis for such just cause in writing to the employee at the time the employee is ordered to undergo such testing, including all objective facts and subjective reasoning that forms the basis for the Employer's belief that the employee is then unfit for duty. Employees shall have the right to Union representation when being informed of the need for testing, and shall have the right to secure similar testing at their own expense from psychiatrists, psychologists or physicians of their own choosing. The City and the employees shall only utilize the services of qualified, certified medical doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists. The employee shall be given a copy of any and all information, reports and opinions that is provided the City as a result of such testing. An employee’s fitness for duty shall be measured and determined by the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the job.
SECTION 8.2	- DRUG AND ALCOHOL FREE WORKPLACE
I.	POLICY: It is the policy and commitment of the City and the Union to provide an environment within the workplace which is free from prohibited drugs and alcohol in order to protect the employees as well as the health and safety of the public. The City recognizes that alcohol and drug abuse is considered by many to be an illness and encourages its employees who may have substance abuse problems to voluntarily utilize an effective treatment and rehabilitation program before such abuse affects the employee's job
8
performance. The City's Employee Assistance Program and the Union Counselor Program will provide coordination and referral services in such cases.
A.	Consistent to the requirements of the Federal Drug Free Workplace Act:
1)	Any employee who consumes, possesses or distributes illegal controlled substance while in the workplace or while conducting City business shall be terminated from the employ of the City.
2)	Any employee who consumes, possesses, distributes or is under the influence of alcohol while in the workplace or while conducting City business shall be disciplined by the City; provided, that this paragraph shall hot apply to the consumption of alcohol by an employee at an event such as a business reception or conference, where such consumption has been authorized by the employee's division or department head.
3)	Any employee who fails to notify the City within five (5) days after they are convicted of a criminal drug offense for a violation taking place in the workplace or while conducting City business, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
4)	Any employee, convicted of the manufacture, sale, or distribution of prohibited drugs, regardless of when or where that act takes place, will be terminated from the employ of the City.
5)	The City shall provide employees and supervisors with a positive program of drug and alcohol education and make everyone aware of help that is available for such a problem.
B.	Recall: The parties recognize that employees may be placed in a conflict arising from the fact that employees are not prohibited from consuming alcohol or legal drugs while off duty but may be subject to emergency recall from off duty, the following procedure shall apply.
1)	The recalled employee shall advise the department representative notifying him if he has consumed alcohol or legal drugs during the day of the emergency recall and the extent of such activity.
2)	The individual in charge of the recall shall assess the employee's condition and fitness for duty and either assign him to duty or, if the employee is determined to be unfit for duty will not allow him to sign in for duty.
3)	Any employee who reports for the recall without informing the department of his consumption of alcohol or legal drugs as required in paragraph 1 above, shall not be allowed to work if he appears to be impaired and shall not be paid for reporting.
4)	It is specifically agreed that no employee shall be disciplined or the subject of any adverse employment action for being under the influence of alcohol or legal drugs in any instance where the employee notifies the employer that he has consumed alcohol or legal drugs off duty and is ordered into work by a supervisor.
C.	Voluntary Referral: It is specifically agreed that no employee shall be disciplined or the subject of adverse employment action because of alcohol or drug abuse where the employee notifies the Employer that he has a problem with drug or alcohol use, and voluntarily seeks assistance prior to initiation of an investigation of suspected drug or alcohol abuse by the employee or pending discipline. If the employee questions the prior initiation of the investigation or discipline procedure, the City shall, on request, provide documentation showing the date such action was commenced. Such employees shall be referred by the managerial employee who is notified to the City's employee assistance program for confidential counseling and treatment or referral to a recognized treatment program. Such voluntary participation shall not confer immunity from discipline, for any misconduct attendant to the substance abuse but the substance abuse problem shall not be considered against the employee in the disciplinary procedure. The managerial employee shall not divulge any information regarding the nature of the problem received from the employee who voluntarily seeks the help of the employee assistance program except on a strict need-to-know basis to any other person or entity except upon proper court order or written authorization of the affected employee. Such voluntary referrals to the employee assistance program, however, does not
9
relieve the employee from the responsibility to adequately perform their job. In addition, voluntary submittal does not eliminate the employee from the requirements to take required drug or alcohol tests as described in this Article.
D.	Disciplinary Action for Confirmed Positive:
1)	First Positive. The first confirmed positive test result will be cause for a disciplinary suspension of 5 days. Effective 1/01/06, the first confirmed positive test result will be cause for a disciplinary suspension of 10 days. The employee must agree to the following conditions: (1) the employee will be mandatorily referred to the City's Employee Assistance Program or the Union Counselor Program for referral for evaluation, diagnosis and development of a treatment plan consistent with generally accepted standards; and (2) the employee will be required to cooperate in and complete the treatment plan, undergo unannounced periodic drug and/or alcohol screening for a period of up to 12 months, remain free of drug and alcohol use, and sign an agreement consenting to said conditions. Failure to comply with these conditions of continued employment shall be cause for discharge.
2)	Second Positive. If an employee has a first confirmed positive test under the previous paragraph 1 and enters a treatment program, and thereafter that employee has a subsequent confirmed positive test as a result of periodic unannounced random or reasonable suspicion drug and/or alcohol screening, the employee shall receive a 30 day disciplinary suspension and shall be required to continue in treatment and comply with the other conditions of treatment set forth in the preceding paragraph. The length of the 30-day disciplinary suspension shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee, and the level of discipline shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Effective 1/01/06, a second confirmed positive test shall result in the employee's discharge, which discharge shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee and the penalty shall hot be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement.
3)	Subsequent Positive. An employee who, prior to 1/01/06, has a confirmed positive test subsequent to the second confirmed positive under Paragraph 2 of this Section D, or on after 1/01/06 has a second confirmed positive test at any time either periodic unannounced, random or reasonable suspicion, shall result in the employee's discharge, which discharge shall be final and binding on the Union and the employee and the penalty shall not be subject to the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining agreement.
4)	Employment Status. There is no requirement on the part of the City to keep an employee on active employment status who is receiving treatment under this Section if it is appropriately determined (i.e., determination by an independent physician and/or appropriately certified medical and/or psychological professional) that the employee's current use of alcohol or drugs prevents such individual from performing his duties or whose continuance on active status would constitute a direct threat to the property and safety of others. Such employee shall be afforded the opportunity to use accumulated paid leave or take an unpaid leave pending treatment.
5)	An employee who has been disciplined in accordance with Section 8.2 (D.l), and who does not have a subsequent positive test result for a period of eight (8) years after the initial positive test result, shall be subject to a ten (10) day suspension for the next positive test result.
E.	OTHER RELATED DISCIPLINE. This section shall in no way limit discipline for other offenses arising out of, related to or aggravated by alcohol or drug abuse, including but not limited to discipline or discharge because the employee's condition is such that he is unable to properly perform his duties due to the effects of drugs or alcohol, nor shall it limit the discipline to be imposed for selling, purchasing or delivering any illegal drug during the work day or while off duty or for using any illegal drug while on duty. In cases of misconduct arising out of, related to, or aggravated by alcohol or drug abuse, the discipline imposed shall be based upon the extent, severity, and/or consequences of the misconduct
10
(including whether such misconduct is a violation of public law) or inability to perform (including the risk of damage to public or City of Peoria life, limb or property).
F.	COSTS OF TESTING AND REHABILITATION: The City agrees to bear the costs of all testing ordered by the City, and of rehabilitation programs ordered by the City to the extent they are not covered by the employee's health care provisions or insurance. The employee may be required to assist the City in coordinating benefits of insurance coverage.
G.	REMUNERATION: In the event that it is determined at Step 3 of the grievance procedure that any employee was ordered to submit to multiple drug and/or alcohol tests for the purpose of harassing that employee, the employee shall be compensated One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars. In the event that it is found by an arbitrator that any employee was ordered to submit to multiple drug and/or alcohol tests for the purpose of harassing that employee, the arbitrator shall have discretion to order compensation for that employee of up to Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars as a part of the arbitration award. When drug and alcohol tests are taken concurrently, it shall be considered one test.
II. PROCEDURE
1.	Reasonable Suspicion: The City shall require any employee to submit to drug or alcohol testing when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol on duty. The existence of reasonable suspicion shall be determined according to the standard defined below. Where reasonable suspicion has been determined to exist the City may order individual employees to submit to blood, breath, or urine tests to determine the presence of alcohol and/or drugs in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.
A. Reasonable Suspicion Standard. Reasonable suspicion exists if the facts and circumstances warrant a rational inference that a person is impaired by alcohol or controlled substances. Reasonable suspicion will be based upon the following:
1)	Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of use and/or the physical symptoms of impairment by alcohol or controlled substances.
2)	Information relating directly to use of alcohol or controlled substances provided by an identifiable third party which is independently conoborated.
3)	Post-accident which results in an injury to a person and/or damage to City property in excess of $250.
The foregoing does not limit the City from ordering testing in the absence of reasonable suspicion in the following circumstances:
1)	Pre-employment screening of applicants for employment to bargaining unit positions;
2)	Any employee who was driving a city vehicle involved in an accident where injury occurred or a citation for a moving violation was issued;
3)	Employees who have voluntarily requested referral under Paragraph IC above before they return to work.
4)	Post-accident which results in an injury to a person and/or damage to City property in excess of $250.
2.	In addition, the City shall have the right to order random test for the presence of alcohol or illegal
drugs of Emergency Communications Telecommunicators, Property & Evidence Technicians and his/her relief person, and employees in the following classifications where regular use of a vehicle is required in the performance of City business: Civil Engineer I & II, Public Works Planner, Neighborhood Development Specialist, Workforce Development Team Leader, Business Services Representative, Career Counselor, Permit Engineer, Facilities Engineer, Parking Meter 11
Technician, Rehabilitation Specialist, Shelter Services Coordinator, Zoning Enforcement Inspector, Building Inspectors I, II & III, Code Enforcement Inspector, Senior Code Enforcement Inspector, Plumbing Inspector, Senior Plumbing Inspector, Electrical Inspector, Senior Electrical Inspector, Engineering Technician I, II & III, Engineering Program Administrator, Forestry/Grounds Planner, Parts Technician, Animal Control Officer, Parking Enforcement Officer and Electronics Repair Technician. The parties agree that there shall be no random, periodic or mass testing of employees for alcohol or drugs other than as provided in this Article.
3.	Employees ordered to submit to drug and alcohol tests shall promptly comply with the order, whether or not they believe reasonable suspicion or other grounds for the order exists. Refusal to submit to and complete such tests as provided for under this Article, shall subject the employee to immediate discharge. Employees who submit to such tests shall not be deemed to have waived or otherwise impaired their rights to grieve or otherwise contest any aspect of the testing as may be provided by law or this Agreement. Employees shall have the right to union representation when being ordered to submit to drug or alcohol tests. Tests shall not be unreasonably delayed because of the absence of the union representative. In the absence of the union representative, the employee may choose another bargaining unit employee who is available to be present when being ordered to submit to the test(s).
4.	It being the desire of the parties to protect the safety of the public and other employees, yet safeguard the rights of individual employees, the parties agree that drug and alcohol testing shall be conducted as follows:
(i)	Use only a SAMHSA certified or licensed clinical laboratory to test body fluids or materials for alcohol or drugs, and only a breath testing device and operator currently certified by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). All breath tests shall be done on a DOT certified breath analysis machine;
(ii)	Establish a chain of custody procedures for both sample collection and testing that will insure the
integrity of and identity of each sample and test result;
(iii)	Collect a sufficient sample of the same body fluid or material to permit for an initial screening, a confirmatory test and a sufficient amount to be set aside and reserved for later testing if requested by the employee. In the case of urine testing, it shall be a split sample;
(iv)	Collect all samples in such a manner as to preserve the individual employee’s right to privacy, insure a high degree of security for the sample and its freedom from adulteration. Proper testing may be conducted to prevent the submission of a false or adulterated sample;
(v)	Confirm any body fluid sample that tests positive in the initial screening for alcohol or drugs by use of gas chromatography, with mass spectrometry or an equivalent scientifically accurate and accepted method that provides quantitative data about the detected alcohol or drug metabolites;
(vi)	Provide the employee tested with an opportunity to have an additional portion of the same sample
tested by a licensed testing facility of his own choosing and at the employee's expense;
(vii)	Require that the clinical laboratory report to the designated Medical Review Officer for the City positive results only in the case where both the initial and confirmatory test results are positive as to the same sample;
(viii)	Provide each employee with a report of the confirmed positive results of each drug or alcohol test that includes the types of tests conducted, the results of each test, the detection level used by the laboratory, and any other information provided to the City by the laboratory.
(ix)	Where a positive result is confirmed, specimens shall be maintained in secured, refrigerated storage for at least a period of 120 days to permit additional testing at the election and expense of the employee;
12
(x)	If an alcohol test reveals that there is a concentration of 0.04% of alcohol or more in the employee's
blood stream (blood alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grains of alcohol per 210 liters of breath), the employee will automatically be deemed "under the influence" of alcohol within the meaning of this policy, and therefore, shall be subject to discipline under this policy;
(xi)	The testing or processing phase for body fluids shall consist of a two-step procedure:
(a)	Initial screening test
(b)	Confirmation test
(xii)	The body fluid sample is first tested using the initial drug screening procedure. An initial positive test result will not be considered conclusive; rather, it will be classified as "confirmation pending". Notification of test results to the City shall be held until the confirmation test results are obtained;
(xiii)	A body fluid specimen testing positive will undergo an additional confirmatory test. The confirmation procedure shall be technologically different and more sensitive than the initial screening test;
(xiv)	Personnel utilized for testing will be certified as qualified to collect samples or adequately trained in collection procedures;
(xv)	Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for screening tests shall be considered a positive test result when using the initial immunoassay drug screening test. At the present time, these levels are:
INITIAL TEST
Levels—Nanogram/Milliliter (hereafter referred to as ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite........... 50
Cocaine metabolite............. 300
Opiate metabolite............... 2000
Phencyclidine.................. 25
Amphetamines................... 1000
Concentration of a drug at or above the levels established by SAMHSA for confirmatory test shall be considered a positive test result when performing a confirmatory Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrophotometry test on a urine specimen that tested positive using a technologically different initial screening method. At the present time, these levels are:
CONFIRMATORY TEST______________ Level (ng/ml)
Marijuana metabolite.................. 15* *________
Cocaine metabolite................... 150**_________
Opiates: Morphine............................. 2000
Codeine.....’....................... 2000
_______6-Acetylmorphine.................... 10***
Phencyclidine.............................. 25______
Amphetamines:_______________________________________
Amphetamines........................ 500
Methamphetamine...................... 500****
*Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylicacid
* *Benzoylecgonine
***Test for 60AM when morphine concentration exceeds 2000 nanograms/milliliter ****Specimen must also
contain amphetamine at a concentration >= 200 nanograms/milliliter
13
(xvi)	Employees having a negative drug test result shall, upon request, receive a memorandum stating that no illegal drugs were found. If the employee requests such, a copy of the letter will be placed in the employee's personnel file;
(xvii)	Each step in the collecting and processing of the drug testing shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and the chain of custody;
(xviii)	For random drug tests, the following additional conditions shall apply:
(a)	The City will contract with an independent third party to provide random selection services through use of a computerized random number generator program. The City shall specify the percentage of positions that are to be tested annually, and the number of dates on which the testing is to occur. The random number generator will then select the dates for testing and the individuals to be tested that day.
(b)	To maintain the security of the selection system, the contractor shall deal exclusively with the designated City Representative, for purposes of notifying the City of testing dates and individuals selected, verifying and updating the pool and supplemental selection of individuals, if necessary.
(c)	Any employee selected who is on authorized time off which was applied for and approved prior to notice to the department of the date of the test shall be required to report to the collection site on his/her first day back from preapproved leave. Any employee who requests leave of any type after the department has been notified of the testing date shall be required to report to the collection site of the shift he would otherwise have been required to report unless he is excused by the Human Resources Director for good cause shown. Any employee so excused shall be required to report to the collection site on his first day back to work.
(d)	When an employee is selected in the random process, he/she shall promptly report to the appropriate collection site upon the direction of his/her supervisor. He/she shall provide a urine specimen sufficient to allow for "split sample" collection and processing of the specimens or a breath sample sufficient for a breath alcohol test depending upon whether the random test is for drugs or alcohol respectively.
(xix)	If an employee is required to leave work to take a drug/alcohol test, the City will pay the employee for time lost from scheduled work for that day. When an employee is required to report for a drug and/or alcohol test other than while at work, the employee shall be paid for such time at then-regular rate.
5.	The City agrees to maintain all records concerning drug problems of its employees, including all records pertaining to City required drug tests, in the utmost confidence, subject to legal discovery. If the City receives a discovery request for any records regarding drug problems of an employee and it decides to comply with that request, it shall notify the employee prior to releasing any of the records.
Except when required pursuant to legal discovery, no records concerning the drug problems of any employees shall be released to other employers or agencies without written permission of the person whose records are sought.
6.	Employees shall have the right to grieve the basis for the order to test, accuracy of the tests, the consequences of the test (except as specified herein), or any alleged violation of this Agreement. Should a grievance concerning such testing be sustained, the arbitrator shall have the authority to fashion an appropriate remedy, including but not limited to expungement of records, a prohibition against using information concerning the test or results thereof in any future employment decision, and the posting of appropriate notices. It is understood that employees' legal rights that may exist outside this Agreement concerning drug and/or alcohol testing are not limited or in any manner
14
abridged herein and they may pursue the same as provided by law, this Agreement notwithstanding. The City agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Union for and against any claims, demands or any liability that may arise, reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees included, as a result of any testing conducted by the City.
SECTION 8.3 - PHYSICAL & MENTAL FITNESS: It shall be the responsibility of each employee to maintain the standards of physical and mental fitness required for performing his job. Whenever the Employer has just cause to suspect that the physical or mental condition of an employee is endangering his own health or the safety of fellow workers, the employee may be requested to submit to an examination by a physician without expense to the employee which shall only be for the purpose of determining his physical and/or mental condition relative to City employment.
SECTION 8.4 - POLYGRAPH TEST: Except for the Property & Evidence Technician, and his/her relief person, no employee shall be required to take a polygraph examination as a condition of retaining employment with the Employer nor shall they be subject to discipline for the refusal to take such. A Union representative may accompany a bargaining unit employee to a polygraph examination. The representative may review the polygraph questions but may not be present during the administration of the polygraph examination. Should a polygraph examination be agreed to, or used, only licensed professionals will be used.
SECTION 8.5 - EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM: The City agrees to provide an Employee Assistance Program to assist employees who are experiencing personal problems which the employee believes may be affecting his job performance. This program is available to all employees and their immediate family. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, employee participation in the Employee Assistance Program shall be voluntary, confidential, and not used for or considered in matters relating to performance evaluation, discipline or promotions. Participation in the program shall not be used as an excuse for poor job performance. The EAP will be in addition to the Union Counselor Program.
ARTICLE 9 SENIORITY
SECTION 9.1 - DEFINITION OF SENIORITY: Seniority as used in this Agreement, shall mean the fulltime employment with the Employer beginning with the latest date of hire in a position covered by this collective bargaining agreement and shall include other periods of absence authorized by and consistent with this Agreement. Employees employed as of the effective date of this Agreement shall retain seniority as presently held.

The Employer and the Union will promptly meet to discuss alternatives to the layoff. If alternatives cannot be found, employees to be laid off will be notified ten (10) working days prior to the effective date. Employees who are later impacted by the bumping rights of more senior employees will be given advance notice when possible. Employees not being given ten (10) working days’ notice shall be given ten (10) days’ pay.
SECTION 11.2 - PROCEDURE FOR LAYOFF: When employees are removed from a classification for the purpose of reducing the work force in that classification, the following rules in part A and B shall apply:

(b)	Right to Representation: Employees shall have the right to Union representation at all meetings with the City where the employee reasonably understands that disciplinary action may result. If an employee asks the City representative if the meeting may result in disciplinary action, the City representative will respond in writing to the employee before the meeting can continue.

36
rating of "meets standard" warrants 1 step and "exceeds standards" warrants 2 steps). Employees above Step 10, who receive standard or above evaluations, will be eligible for a one (1) step movement. A second step may be granted based on exceptional performance at the sole discretion of the City.
