Notwithstanding what is stated in A. above, as a result of this monitoring process, the Coalition and the University may mutually decide during the life of this Agreement to replace one or both of the aforementioned programs, to designate or change the base plan, to limit or freeze new enrollments in a particular plan, and/or establish or revise the amounts payable by employees enrolling in the plan.
C.	Health Care Plan Contributions for Part-time Staff

D.	Coverage for married couples and Other Eligible Individuals (OEI) where both are employed by the University.
3

G.	Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the University and the Coalition the ability to access a state, regional or federally sponsored health and/or prescription drug plan(s), or any portion thereof, during the term of this Agreement. The parties agree that they shall have the right to add such a plan(s) to the current health plan and/or prescription drug plan provider(s) with such a plan(s).
As a result of agreeing to consider any such plan(s), the University and the Coalition may mutually decide during the life of this Agreement to replace, change or substitute any existing plan and/or establish or revise the amounts payable by employees enrolling in the plan(s).

4.	Health Care/Wages
4
A.	The parties agree the cost of health care and the funding available for wage increases are interrelated.
B.	Health Care Cost Experience shall be calculated based on per CLO member eligible for health care. Said calculation shall be based on a monthly average over the period July 1 through June 30 of each year. Therefore, wage increases will be determined by the matrices shown below.
1.	For collective bargaining agreements effective between July 1,2018 and October 1, 2019 (the 2018 cycle), it is agreed that the Base Wage/Lump Sum Factor Average increases for each bargaining unit for 2018 shall be determined as follows:
a.	The cost to MSU of health care plans per benefits eligible member represented by bargaining agents subject to this agreement will be computed for the periods July 1,2016, through June 30, 2017, and July 1,2017, to June 30, 2018.
b.	The per eligible Coalition member cost computation for the period July 1,2016, through June 30, 2017, (the initial comparison period) will be compared to the per eligible Coalition member cost computation for the period July 1, 2017 - June 30, 2018 (the ending comparison period) in order to yield a percent increase (or decrease) in Health Care Cost Experience.
c.	The funds available for Base Wage/Lump Sum Factor Average increases shall be based on the percentage increase (or decrease) per eligible Coalition member in Health Care Cost Experience as shown in the following chart for 2018 cycle:
Health Care Cost Experience		Increase to Base Wage	Lump-Sum
0.0%	-	1.0%	2.75%	0.00%
1.01% -	2.0%	2.65%	0.00%
2.01% -	3.0%	2.50%	0.00%
3.01% -	4.0%	2.35%	0.00%
4.01% -	5.0%	2.20%	0.00%
5.01% -	6.0%	2.00%	0.00%
6.01% -	7.0%	1.80%	0.20%
7.01% -	8.0%	1.60%	0.40%
8.01% -	9.0%	1.40%	0.60%
9.01% -	10.0%	1.20%	0.80%
10.01% -	11.0%	1.00%	1.00%
11.01% -		1.00%	1.00%
5
2.	The funds available for Base Wage Factor Average increases shall be based on the percentage increase (or decrease) per eligible Coalition member in Health Care Cost Experience (computed consistent with the methodology reflected in paragraph 4.B. above) as shown in the following chart for 2019, 2020, 2021 cycles:
Health Care Cost Experience			Base Wage Factor Average
0.0%	-	1.0%	2.75%
1.01%	-	2.0%	2.65%
2.01%	-	3.0%	2.50%
3.01%	-	4.0%	2.35%
4.01%	-	5.0%	2.20%
5.01%	-	6.0%	2.00%
6.01%	-	7.0%	1.80%
7.01%	-	8.0%	1.60%
8.01%	-	9.0%	1.40%
9.01%	-	10.0%	1.20%
10.01%	-	11.0%	1.00%
11.01%	-	0.00%	0.00%1
1 Active employees shall receive a one-time lump sum payment of 1%, calculated on the annual base salary if the increase in health care cost experience is 11.01 % or greater.
C.	Base Wage Factor Average for collective bargaining agreements effective in this Agreement shall be calculated using the following initial and ending comparison periods in order to determine Health Care Cost Experience for the applicable cycle:
Effective Dates of Agreements between:	Initial Comparison Period	Ending Comparison Period
July 1,2018 - October 1, 2019 (the 2018 cycle)	7/1/2016-6/30/2017	7/1/2017-6/30/2018
July 1, 2019 - October 1, 2020 (the 2019 cycle)	7/1/2017-6/30/2018	7/1/2018-6/30/2019
July 1, 2020 - October 1, 2021 (the 2020 cycle)	7/1/2018-6/30/2019	7/1/2019-06/30/2020
July 1, 2021 - October 1, 2022 (the 2021 cycle)	7/1/2019-6/30/2020	7/1/2020-6/30/2021
