INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS
While the parties agree that it is desirable that schools be similarly staffed with regard to average years of experience; percentage of teachers with advanced degrees, and racial composition;' it is recognized that frequent transfers of teachers from one school to another is disruptive to the educational process and interferes with optimum teacher performance. It is therefore agreed that involuntary transfers will be kept to a minimum.
A.	Condition
No vacancy will be filled by means of involuntary transfers if there is a qualified volunteer available to fill said position.	.
B.	Seniority
All other factors being equal, priority to remain in the assigned position shall be given first to tenured teachers and then to those having seniority in a school when an involuntary transfer is necessary and no qualified volunteer is available.
C.	Required Meeting
An involuntary transfer will be made only after a meeting between the teacher involved and the Director of Human Resources, at which time the teacher will be notified of the reasons for the transfer. In the event that a teacher objects to any of the conditions of the transfer, the teacher may request that the Association be notified and the Director of Human Resources will meet the Association’s representative(s) and the teacher to discuss the matter within three (3) school days after the request. In the event the differences cannot beresolved, provisions of the grievance procedure will be employed.

A list of current open positions in the school system will be made available to all teachers being involuntarily transferred. Such teachers may request a transfer to the open position(s) for which they are certified and/or qualified. Teachers being involuntarily transferred shall have selection preference in order of seniority over those seeking voluntary transfer.

The Board recognizes its responsibility to give its full support and assistance to teachers in regard to maintaining control and discipline in the classroom through the use of reasonable pupil control measures. Therefore the parties agree that they will take appropriate disciplinary measures consistent with the Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook.
B.	Shared Responsibility
Upon accepting employment in the Little Rock School District, classroom teachers assume their appropriate share of the responsibility for pupil discipline in the classroom, in the halls, and on the campus of the school where they teach. When the teacher observes a student who is guilty of misconduct or an infraction of a school rule, he/she is expected to correct the student and/or report the offense to the principal’s office. Nothing in this section shall be construed to imply that a teacher is responsible for student behavior outside of the regular workday (except in cases of emergency).
C.	Physical Restraint
In its support of its teachers, the Board recognizes the right of the teacher to use physical restraint when conditions are such as to threaten the physical well-being of the teacher or a student.

The teacher may make a recommendation for appropriate action. The administration will take appropriate action that shall incorporate and be consistent with the guidelines m the Student Rights and Responsibilities Handbook (SRRH).
The student may report back to class after meeting with the principal or his/her designee and will present an admission slip to the teacher indicating how the problem has been dealt with.

The teacher will receive within two (2) working days a written report of the conference. A copy of this report, together with the teacher’s statement of the original problem, will be filed.
F.	Discipline Oversight Committee (DOC)
In addition the parties agree to establish a Discipline Oversight Committee (DOC) for the LRSD.	■
Purpose of the DOC

By the end of September of each school year the DOC for the LRSD shall review the discipline plan of each school to ensure that it incorporates and is consistent with the SRRH and the District policy and procedures.
By May 1 of each year the DOC shall review discipline management in the District and compile a report to be sent to the Superintendent of Schools and the Association.
Composition of the DOC
The DOC shall be comprised of five administrators and five members appointed by the Association. None of the members of the DOC may work at the site being reviewed. The DOC also shall serve as an advisory board to the Association and the Superintendent of Schools.
DOC Review Procedure
If the teacher believes that the action taken by the building administration was not consistent with the building discipline plan and the SRRH, the teacher may ask the BCC to review the action.
If the BCC establishes that the administration has committed a violation of, or failed to follow, the plan and/or the SRRH, the BCC may ask that the DOC for the LRSD review discipline enforcement at the school.
If any school’s BCC wishes to have a DOC review the discipline enforcement at the school, the BCC must notify the Assistant Superintendent for Student Discipline in writing. The notification must include the name of the school, the specific instances which give rise to the requested review, and a brief summary of the facts as they relate to those incidents. The BCC should also include the principal’s action or response to the BCC concern if it is not satisfied with the resolution at the building level. The DOC will ask the BCC chairperson, the principal, and the teacher(s) involved for any information it needs to review before drawing its conclusions.
Within five days of the receipt of the notification, the Assistant Superintendent for Student Hearing will arrange a meeting to review the complaint. Within five days after the meeting, the findings of the DOC will be sent to the school's principal, the BCC chairperson, the Associate Superintendent for School Services and the Association. (During the term of this contract, the DOC also shall send a copy of its finding to the Little Rock School Board.

Such meeting shall include the principal, the teacher, the pupil’s parents and any specialist deemed necessary by any of the parties. Following this meeting, the principal and teacher will make a joint decision on the disposition of the case. Tn the event the teacher and principal do not reach a joint decision, the matter shall be referred to the appropriate assistant of or associate superintendent. In a secondary school, if the student is excluded from the same class a second time, he/she may be dropped from that course for the remainder of the year. In an elementary school, if a pupil is excluded a second time, he/she may be transferred to another teacher's class or to another school.
If the student continues to be disruptive to the learning process in his/her new environment, placement in an alternative setting or a recommendation for expulsion fer the remainder of the year is in order.

Individual records will be maintained on student discipline and will be available to teachers as an aid for determining disciplinary recommendations concerning particular pupils.
I.	Suspension
Any student whose suspension is on appeal may be required to attend an alternative classroom or other alternative setting during the appeal. During that time the student may not return to the class of the teacher initiating the referral which resulted in the suspension except by permission of the teacher.

The Board and the Association agree that effective alternative classrooms/settings are an effective tool for maintaining an orderly school and classroom environment. Therefore, to the extent possible, the Administration agrees to the establishment of alternative classrooms or settings for every school.
K.	Due Process Rights
Nothing in this article should be interpreted to supersede student’s due process rights for a hearing where appropriate.
L.	504 Students
The parties recognize that students covered by IDEA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 have statutory rights that supercede the normal disciplinary plan for students. Therefore, a special section of the SRRH shall specify the appropriate action for teachers and administrators to take in dealing with disciplinary infractions committed by students covered by these statutes.
