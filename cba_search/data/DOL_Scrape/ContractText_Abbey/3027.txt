30.2	Purpose. The purpose of an EDPP is to inform the employee of the supervisor’s perception of the employee’s job performance and to enhance communication between the employee and supervisor. Performance evaluations should be substantive in their review of an employee’s performance.
30.3	Procedure. An EDPP shall be processed utilizing the following steps:
(a)	Preview session. The immediate supervisor and the employee shall meet and discuss the process to be followed. During the session a review of the current classification questionnaire, previous performance expectations and relevant performance elements shall also occur.
(b)	Preparation of Drafts. Separate and apart from one another, the immediate supervisor and the employee shall prepare Part I: Performance Feedback, Part H: Future Performance Expectations, and Part HI: Future Training and Development. The employee shall also complete Part IV: Organizational Support.
(c)	Feedback Session. During the feedback session, the supervisor and the employee shall meet and discuss their drafts of Part I through Part III and Part IV as completed by the employee.
(d)	Completion and Signatures. The immediate supervisor shall prepare the final EDPP and shall include verbatim Part IV as submitted by the employee. The immediate supervisor shall sign the final EDPP and shall share it with the employee. The EDPP shall be considered complete on the date the evaluating supervisor signs the assessment. The employee shall sign and return the EDPP within seven (7) calendar days of its receipt. The employee’s signature shall not constitute agreement with the contents of the evaluation. During the seven (7) calendar-day period the
51
employee may request an appointment for further discussion with the immediate supervisor and the reviewer. The employee shall be provided with a copy of the final EDPP. Upon request, the employee shall be entitled to Union representation during such discussion. The role of the representative is that of an observer and advisor to the employee.
30.4	Appeal Rights. The evaluation process is subject to the grievance procedure or the rule violation appeal process at the option of the employee. Employees who elect to appeal such alleged violations to the Personnel Appeals Board shall not pursue a grievance over the same issues. Specific contents of the evaluation are not subject to the grievance procedure.

34.2	New Or Additional Work. Except as authorized by current law, it is further agreed that Management shall not contract or subcontract for services for new programs or expansion of existing programs which are to be accomplished under substantially the same conditions and in the same manner as those historically performed by classified employees within the institution.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT
The Agreement expressed herein, in writing, constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties and no express or implied statements, actions, or previously written or oral statements shall add to or supersede any of its provisions. Both Management and the Union acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter appropriate for collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement.
