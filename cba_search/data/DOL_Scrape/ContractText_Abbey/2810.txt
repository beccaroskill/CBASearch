Introduction
San Francisco faces an unprecedented challenge: to restore its aging water system to ensure a reliable Bay Area water supply and avoid system outages which could be caused by natural disasters. The City faces similar challenges in maintaining, restoring, and improving other essential City infrastructure components.
The parties recognize that achievement of this goal requires an extraordinary level of labormanagement cooperation, and that disagreements regarding contracting out, terms and conditions of employment, hiring and promotion methods, and other matters have the potential to interfere with implementation of the City's capital projects. The parties further recognize that the success of the City's capital projects will require new and innovative approaches in many employment-related areas including recruitment, hiring, promotion, training, work rules, compensation, evaluation, and management.
The purpose of this Agreement is to promote the efficiency of design, construction management and project management operations for the City's capital projects and provide for efficient resolution of labor disputes and grievances, thereby promoting the public interest in assuring the timely and economical completion of capital projects.
Findings
WHEREAS, the City is or will be engaged in a number of significant capital projects in the coming years which will require that work proceed in an efficient manner without delay or disruption because of disagreements between the City and the Union; and

4.1.5	The parties acknowledge that this is a pilot process limited to contracting decisions at PUC and DPW, but mutually desire that successful outcomes will motivate other City departments to utilize this pilot process or related processes for contracting decisions.
4.2	Standards for Contracting-Out. The parties recognize that under Civil Service Commission guidelines contracting-out work may be necessary for the following reasons:
4.2.1	Specialized Expertise. The City may contract-out specialized services for which City staff do not possess the necessary specialized skills or experience.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, FY 2003- 2006 CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND IFPTE, LOCAL 21
87
APPENDIX C
4.2.2	Peak Workloads. The City may contract-out to address temporary peak workloads. Temporary peak workloads are situations where City staff are capable of providing needed services, but sufficient staff are not available to meet project deadlines and the work is not forecasted to be sufficient to sustain the hiring of additional, qualified permanent employees without risk of layoff or displacement.
4.2.3	Emergencies and/or Unanticipated Events or Delays. The City may contract-out work necessary to address emergencies, unanticipated events or delays.
4.3	Process for Contracting-Out. The City commits to engage in the following process with the Union before issuing an RFP/RFQ for outside engineering, planning, architectural, construction management, program management and project management or related services:
4.3.1	Specialized Expertise. Before determining the RFP/RFQ is necessary because the City lacks specialized expertise to handle specialized work or projects the PUC and DPW will:
a.	Poll other City departments to see if such specialized expertise exists;
b.	Engage in forecasting with other City departments to assess whether an inhouse position with the specialized expertise can be supported;
c.	Post the need for specialized skills on email or other systems to enable in-house employees to apply for specialized positions;
d.	Determine the extent to which on-going training by City-staff and existing contractors to employees seeking new skills or job opportunities can mitigate the need to rely upon additional contractors for such specialized expertise;
e.	To the extent applicable, use information contained in the PUC-developed Skills Bank to determine staff availability and training needs.
4.3.2	Peak Workload. Before determining the RFP/RFQ is necessary to address a peak workload, the PUC and DPW will engage in forecasting with other City departments to determine whether the City can sustain the hiring of additional permanent employees without risk of layoff or displacement.
4.3.3	Emergencies, Unanticipated Events or Delays. Before determining the RFP/RFQ is necessary to address emergencies, unanticipated events or delays, the PUC and DPW will articulate to the union, in writing, the nature of the emergency or unanticipated delay and explain how the RFP/RFQ is designed to cure that emergency or unanticipated delay. For emergencies that imminently threaten health
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING, FY 2003- 2006
CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND
IFPTE, LOCAL 21
88
APPENDIX C
and safety, the procedures set forth in this Article shall be followed at the earliest practicable time after imminent health and safety concerns have been addressed.
4.3.4	The PUC and DPW will endeavor to regularly present its contracting needs to the JUCC Staffing and Contracting Subcommittee with as much advance notice as practicable. At a minimum, the PUC and DPW will notify the Subcommittee, by providing a draft RFP/RFQ, at least 11 working days prior to publicly advertising or requesting Civil Service Commission approval (whichever is earlier) for an RFP/RFQ for engineering, planning, architectural, project management, program management, construction management or related services, unless such minimum period is waived by Local 21. In the notice, the PUC and DPW will identify the need for such contracting consistent with the criteria in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The Subcommittee will meet to discuss the rationale for contracting-out within five working days of notice being provided. The Subcommittee may recommend modifications or alternatives to such contracting, provided that such recommendations or alternatives be forwarded to the Assistant General Manager for Infrastructure at PUC or the Deputy Director of Engineering at DPW within 11 working days of notice, except by mutual agreement.
4.4	Prop. J Contracts. Nothing herein is intended to alter or diminish the City's rights or obligations with respect to contracting under Charter Section 10.104 (15).
4.5	Appeals. If the Union disagrees with the decision to contract out, it may pursue available remedies before the Civil Service Commission or the Board of Supervisors with respect to Prop J. contracts desired under Charter Section 10.104 (15). The decision to contract out shall not be grievable.
ARTICLE V	- COMPENSATION
5.1	Principles
5.1.1	Recognizing the challenging goals of the CIP, the parties agree that a flexible compensation structure is necessary. In particular, incentives may be appropriate to encourage and recognize employees who assume additional responsibilities, develop and utilize specialized skills through classroom and on-the-job training, and exhibit leadership, initiative and creativity in their field.
5.1.2	The parties further acknowledge that although basic compensation levels are established through their existing MOU, the needs and resources of the CIP and related capital projects are unique.
