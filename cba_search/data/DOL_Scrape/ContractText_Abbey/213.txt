Overtime asking requires either a yes or no response from employee

Employees that have already accepted an overtime assignment in another department and are not eligible for overtime in their home department.
The steward will be used to help identify any qualified people whenever possible.
An employee has an obligation to work any accepted or assigned overtime shift unless excused by Human Resources. Scheduled overtime is considered a regular work shift and subject to the attendance program. If an employee accepts an overtime assignment and later wants to cancel it - this is only allowed if Supervision can reasonably reschedule another employee for this overtime. (See exceptions in Para 23)
Employee may voluntarily work eighteen (18) consecutive hours max, with a minimum of six (6) hours off before their next scheduled shift.

16
Overtime Charging
29	An employee's overtime record shall be credited with overtime when asked, whether the employee works or not. (See also Para Call List 23.2 exceptions) When asked to work overtime, the employee is required to either accept or refuse the overtime. If the department works overtime, an absent employee's overtime record shall be charged with any overtime for which the employee would have been eligible had the employee not been absent; this includes vacation. Employees who are on vacation will not be called in to work overtime except in an emergency. (See also Para Call List 23.2 exceptions)
Overtime Eligibility While on Vacation
An employee at work when overtime is scheduled is allowed to work daily overtime if on a full day of vacation that day.
An employee on a day-at-a-time vacation when overtime is scheduled but who returns before the overtime is worked shall be asked for overtime if such employee is eligible and qualified. If such employee replaces another employee already scheduled, the employee being replaced is not charged for that overtime. It's the employee's responsibility to communicate with supervision no later than the start of the unpaid lunch period of the Thursday (Variable shifts), Friday (Monday Through Friday shifts) or Sunday (Capacity shifts) to determine if weekend work is available for Variable and Monday Through Friday shifts and for Capacity shifts to determine if overtime is available Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and/or Thursday of the following week.
An employee absent or on day-at-a-time vacation on Thursday and Friday may work the weekend if that employee contacts supervision on: (1) Friday by noon for the first or Mid shift, 9:00 p.m. for the 2nd shift and the day before for the 3rd shift (Monday Through Friday shifts), and (2) Thursday by 1:00 p.m. for the Variable V-1 shift or 11:00 p.m. for the Variable V-2 shift, provided work is available and no one is being replaced.
17
An employee assigned to the Monday Through Friday Schedule may work the weekend when absent or on a day-ata-time vacation on Friday if weekend work is being scheduled that day and if work is available and no one is being replaced, providing the employee contacts supervision by noon on the 1st or Mid shift, 9:00 p.m. on the 2nd shift and the day before for the 3rd shift.
An employee assigned to the Variable shift may work the weekend when absent or on a day-at-a-time vacation on Thursday if weekend work is being scheduled that day and if work is available and no one is being replaced, providing the employee contacts supervision by 1:00 p.m. on the Variable V-1 shift and by 11:00 p.m. on the Variable V-2 shift.
An employee assigned to the Capacity shift may work on the following Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday when absent or on a day-at-a-time vacation on Sunday if such work is being scheduled that day and if work is available and no one is being replaced, providing the employee contacts supervision by 11:45 a.m. on the Capacity WE-1 shift and 11:45 p.m. on the Capacity WE-2 shift.
An employee that preschedules a half (V) day of vacation is eligible for daily overtime. If the employee is on a half (V) day vacation when the overtime is asked, it becomes the employee’s responsibility to contact supervision to determine if an opening is available for them to work and no one is being displaced.
An employee is not entitled to weekend work when on a week's vacation, except in an emergency. (See also Para Call List 23.2 exceptions) However, the employee may work overtime on the Saturday/Sunday preceding the vacation week(s) as this will be considered overtime for the previous week's work. An employee who scheduled a one-half (V) week vacation the last half of the week is not entitled to weekend work, except in an emergency.
18
This includes employees who are on day-at-a-time vacation (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday). (See also Para Call List 23.2 exceptions)
An employee who is being laid-off is entitled to weekend work provided the employee’s last regular workday is Thursday for Variable shifts or Friday for Monday through Friday shifts.
Where the applicable rate of pay is time and one-half the employee will be charged with one and one-half (1%) hours for each overtime hour. Employees assigned to the Variable or Capacity shifts will be charged time and one-half for all such overtime credited, even if the employee is paid at straight time due to the requirement to work forty (40) hours before overtime is paid.
Where the applicable rate of pay is double-time, the employee will be charged with two (2) hours overtime for each overtime hour. Employees assigned to the Variable or Capacity shifts will be charged with two (2) hours for all such overtime credited, even if the employee is paid at straight time due to the requirement to work forty (40) hours before overtime is paid.
An employee asked to work overtime, after the deadlines defined in Paragraph 22, where the overtime is in a department or shift other than their own, will not be charged with such overtime refused but will be charged if the employee works such overtime.
An employee who is asked to work additional overtime while working an overtime shift, will not be charged for such additional overtime if refused, but will be charged if such additional overtime is worked. (See also Para Call List 23.2 exceptions)
Telephone offers of overtime where management reaches the employee, are charged whether or not the overtime is worked. All work, or refusal of work, on a day observed as a holiday
19
under this Agreement is charged. (See also Para 23.2 Call List exceptions)
An employee who accepts an overtime assignment but fails to report for such assignment will be charged with an absence. This absence will be counted as a regular scheduled workday absence and will be included in the employee’s work record and handled as outlined in Paragraph 100.
Overtime Averaging and Re-Averaging
30	On January 1, of each year, overtime records will be set at zero (0). After January 1, an employee’s overtime hours will only be averaged or re-averaged when:
(a)	employee is returning from layoff. When an employee returns from layoff the employee will be given a new overtime record which will have charged against it the average total amount of overtime previously worked in the appropriate overtime group into which the employee is transferred or recalled.
(b)	an employee becomes permanent in a new department.
(c)	an employee is on temporary transfer. The employee will be given the average of the appropriate overtime group in the new department. The employee will be maintained on the home department overtime records, while on temporary transfer and the employee’s overtime record will be charged with any eligible overtime had the employee remained in the home department. The employee’s overtime record will not be re-averaged when the employee returns to the home department.
(d)	a probationary employee gains seniority. The employee will be given the average of the appropriate overtime group.
31	When changing shifts in a department, an employee will carry their overtime hours with them on the new shift. Employees are overtime eligible when changing shifts commencing on the first day of the new shift week (see pay week in
20
glossary.) Re-averaging will not be done for shift changes within a department.
32	When an employee is farmed out and works overtime in that department the overtime shall be charged against the employee and the employee’s home department.
Overtime Distribution
33	The supervisor will keep daily records of all overtime worked by the employees. In order that the overtime on a shift within a department is distributed as evenly as possible (within a half [%] an hour balance), those with the least amount of overtime shall be asked to work first among those qualified to do the work. It is recognized that an employee may be qualified to do the overtime work without holding the applicable job classification. If an employee is eligible for overtime but declines the hours that are offered, the overtime will be offered to the next qualified employee. (See also Para 23.2 Call List exceptions)
The supervisor's copy of the overtime record will be posted at the supervisor's desk and kept as current as possible. The names and work centers, where applicable, of those scheduled for daily and weekend overtime work or in the department and shift will be displayed in the department area by the supervisor prior to the overtime work to permit checking by employees so they may determine before the overtime is worked if any errors in selection have been made. This information is to be used by employees to point out any overtime assignment errors to the supervisor before the overtime is worked. When an entire shift in a department is scheduled for weekend work, a notice displayed to that effect need not include names and work centers.
21
Holiday Overtime Distribution Work performed on a holiday will be first offered to the shift that would normally be scheduled to work that day.
34	It is further agreed that the Company will maintain as close a balance of overtime hours among the shifts within a department as production necessitates and individual skills allow. It is recognized that overtime hours worked on any given day are subject to production requirements. Such requirements may not require all shifts (i.e.: both first and second shifts, V-1 and V-2 or WE-1 and WE-2) to work additional hours in the same day. The intent of this paragraph is to only work the overtime required to meet production requirements, not to balance overtime between shifts.
Overtime Guidelines: (Where Monday through Friday, Variable and Capacity shifts are all in the same department.)
For Scheduled Overtime - Planned absences, planned vacations, planned shift gaps, etc. where production needs dictate that all shift openings be filled.
Monday Through Friday Shifts (M-F)
-	Use WE-1 to cover M-F’s first shift Monday through Thursday.
-	Use V-1 to cover M-F’s first shift on Friday.
-	Use WE-2 to cover M-F’s second shift Monday through Thursday.
-	Use V-2 to cover M-F’s second shift on Friday.
-	Use the lower total shift hours of shift WE-1/WE-2 to cover M-F’s third shift Tuesday through Thursday.
-	Use the lower total shift hours of shift WE-1/V-2 to cover M-F’s third shift Monday.
-	Use the lower total shift hours of shift WE-2/V-1 to cover M-F’s third shift Friday.
22
For Monday Through Friday Shift weekend:
-	Offer Saturday/Sunday first shift overtime initially to M-F’s first shift, then to V-1.
-	Offer Saturday/Sunday second shift overtime initially to MF’s second shift, then to V-2.
-	Offer Saturday/Sunday third shift overtime initially to M-F’s third shift, then to the lower hours shift between V-1 and V-2.
Variable Shifts (V-1 and V-2):
-	Use WE-1 to cover V-1 on Monday through Thursday.
-	Use WE-2 to cover V-2 on Monday through Thursday (ends Friday morning 02:15 a.m.).
For Daily Variable Shift “4 Hour” Gap:
-	Work V-1 two hours early daily on Tuesday through Thursday.
-	Work V-2 two hours late daily on Tuesday through Thursday.
-	Use M-F first shift to fill the gap on Friday from 02:15 a.m. to 05:45 a.m.
Overtime on Capacity Shifts (WE-1 and WE-2) when no Monday thru Friday shift is scheduled:
If only one shift is scheduled on Friday and/or Saturday and/or Sunday
Use V-1 to cover the first half (6 hours) of shift.
Use V-2 to cover the last half (6 hours) of shift.
If both shifts are scheduled on Friday and/or Saturday and/or Sunday
Use V-1 to cover all WE-1
Use V-2 to cover all WE-2
23
Overtime on Capacity Shifts (WE-1 and WE-2) when Monday thru Friday shift(s) is scheduled:
Friday shift
Use V-1 to cover the first half (6 hours) of WE-1 on Friday.
Use V-2 to cover the last half (6 hours) of WE-1 on Friday.
Use M-F’s third shift to cover all of WE-2 on Friday (ends 06:00 a.m. Saturday) and Saturday (ends 06:00 a.m. Sunday)
If only one shift is scheduled on Saturday and/or Sunday
Use the lower total shift hours of V-1 or M-F’s first shift to cover the first half (6 hours) of either Saturday or Sunday.
Use the lower total shift hours of V-2 or M-F’s second shift to cover the last half (6 hours) of either Saturday or Sunday.
If both shifts are scheduled on Saturday and/or Sunday
Use the lower total shift hours of V-1 or M-F’s first shift to cover all WE-1 on Sunday.
Use the lower total shift hours of V-2 or M-F’s second shift to cover all WE-2 on Sunday (ends 06:00 a.m. Monday).
For other daily production needs or to cover for short notice (i.e. unplanned) absence or vacation, the plan would be to work shifts early or late, as needed and with an effort toward balancing distribution among the shifts.
These guidelines attempt to define primary on-shift overtime. Where an employee is a primary on-shift candidate, the employee will be charged for the overtime, even if not worked. When situations arise where not enough employees “on-shift” accepted the overtime, and an off-shift employee is asked, the
24
employee will be charged only if the employee works, not if the overtime is declined.
Overtime Entitlement on Transfer or Probation
35	An employee temporarily transferred shall have had to work two (2) weeks at the employee’s regular work schedule in the department to which transferred before becoming entitled to overtime. Such employee may work overtime at any time upon the request of the supervisor, provided all other employees working in that department have been asked to work. It is agreed that if the temporary transferred employee has satisfied the two (2) week requirement within the six (6) months immediately prior to the overtime need, such employee will be entitled to overtime in accordance with Paragraph 33. Probationary employees will not be asked to work until all employees with seniority working in the department and on the shift, including temporarily transferred employees, have been asked to work; except that when all employees in the department on all shifts who are qualified for the work involved have been asked to work and more employees are needed, qualified probationary employees may be asked. (See also Para 23.2 Call List exceptions)
36	Intentionally left blank to keep paragraph numbers below the same
ARTICLE V - HOLIDAYS
Paid Holidays
37	All employees on the seniority list assigned to the Monday Through Friday shifts and the Continuous shift shall receive eight (8)-hours pay at their regular straight-time hourly rate inclusive of shift premiums for the following holidays: New Year's Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, day after Thanksgiving Day, December Twenty-fourth, Christmas Day, December thirty-first, Employee's Birthday, and a Company-designated floating
25
holiday, providing the employees have worked a major part of their last scheduled workday before, and the major part of their first scheduled workday after the holiday, providing such days are in the same workweek as the holiday; except where this work requirement is specifically waived by the Company for reasons of personal urgency.
One floating holiday will be designated by the Company on or before March 1 of each year or, if not designated, it will be selected by mutual agreement between the Union and the Company.
Based on the holidays listed above, all employees on the seniority list assigned to the Variable or Capacity shifts shall be: (1) paid up to ninety-six (96) holiday hours at the applicable rate inclusive of shift premiums, and (2) will have the opportunity for up to ninety-six (96) hours of time off from work per the following: (a) holidays are paid at the applicable rate of pay when observed on the regular scheduled work shift, (b) all holiday qualifiers apply, (c) employees are able to take remaining hours as pre-scheduled within the vacation quotas within the following year, (reference Paragraph 38, Holiday/Vacation Scheduling) (d) employees have the choice of getting paid or taking the time off, (e) employees choosing pay in lieu of remaining holiday hours must request such payment by January 31, and will receive payment in February, (f) if an employee observes more than ninety-six (96) holiday hours on their shift, they will be given the option of working and getting paid at their double-time rate of pay if a holiday is worked after ninety-six (96) holiday hours were observed. Such work hours shall be calculated at the double time rate and the hours shall be offered in one-half shift increments to provide the payment the employee would have received, had such employee not exceeded the allotted 96 hours. If more than one half shift is required to make-up the payment, then the employee will be afforded the opportunity at his/her option to work the portion of the 2nd half of the shift required to make up the time or the
26
entire second half of the shift. Hours worked will not be charged as overtime and no overtime claims will be considered, (g) the Company will maintain it’s current practice of assigning one floating holiday.
For employees assigned to the Monday Through Friday Schedule, when December twenty-fourth and December thirty-first fall on Saturday or Sunday, the holidays will be observed on the preceding Friday. When any other holiday listed above falls on Saturday, it will be observed on the preceding Friday.
Employees assigned to the Capacity shift will observe the Good Friday holiday on Easter Sunday.
Holiday/Vacation Scheduling
38	Holiday/Vacation hours are comprised of the holiday hours an employee earned during the previous year. These earned hours are available for the employee to preschedule in full day/odd increments with their supervisor, within the current vacation quotas, or the employee may choose to be compensated for all or a part of the earned Holiday/Vacation hours during January of each year.
When scheduling earned Holiday/Vacation hours, employees must follow the guidelines listed below.
•	All Holiday/Vacation hours are to be prescheduled with supervision.
•	Holiday/Vacation cannot be used for random or half (1/2) day vacation.
•	Employees are responsible to keep track of their regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation entitlement and usage.
•	Regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation will be tracked separately (i.e.: two buckets of hours).
•	Employees must stipulate which bucket of hours is to be used. If the employee does not stipulate, the hours will first be taken from the vacation bucket.
27
Odd hours (non-shift increments) of Holiday/Vacation may be used at any time. All odd hours (non-shift increments) of regular vacation must be used last.
Holiday/Vacation must be taken in prescheduled full days within the vacation quotas. All odd hour increments of less than a full shift must be taken at one time.
Remaining odd hour increments of regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation can be combined if equal to or less than a full shift. These odd hour increments must be prescheduled.
All earned Holiday/Vacation hours must be taken in the calendar year. Holiday/Vacation cannot be carried over into the next calendar year. Regular vacation and Holiday/Vacation bucket hours cannot be combined to qualify for carryover to the next vacation period.
The Three Hour Rule applies to Holiday/Vacation and regular vacation. The submission of documentation to Human Resources is required as per the attendance policy. If an employee has excused time off during their shift, the employee is responsible for coming to work if three hours or more can be worked. If less than three hours can be worked the employee needs to communicate this when submitting their documentation to Human Resources.
Note the three hour attendance guideline will apply for employees with less than a full days vacation left. As an example: (a) if an employee has two hours of vacation remaining, the employee is scheduled to work the remainder of their shift. All attendance policies/guidelines apply for employees taking off from work, (b) if an employee is assigned to a V-1 shift and has eight hours of vacation remaining and wants to take the remaining two hours off work, the three hour guidelines stipulates that the time would be an excused absence provided the employee follows the attendance policy.
28
Birthday Holiday
39	All employees will comply with the following procedure when observing their Birthday Holiday:
(1)	The employee may observe their Birthday Holiday on any day of their scheduled work week (Monday Through Sunday) in which their birthday falls, provided it is pre-scheduled a minimum of 24 hours in advance of the actual observed day off.
Employees will be paid double-time if scheduled to work on a day observed as a birthday holiday, scheduled (as identified above), provided the employee advises their supervisor that the day requested to be worked is being observed as a birthday holiday, therefore paid at double-time, for that employee prior to the employee being scheduled to work. Consistent with past practice, if an employee inadvertently works their birthday holiday or is on vacation the entire week in which the birthday occurs, the employee will be able to re-schedule the birthday holiday to the next soonest day as approved by supervision, based on production needs.
Birthday Holiday on a Regular Holiday
If an employee's birthday falls on a day being observed as a holiday, the Birthday Holiday will be considered as occurring on the employee’s following workday. Boiler operators may schedule their Birthday Holiday to coincide with their floating weekend schedule, if otherwise eligible to do so, provided such time off is scheduled at least one (1) week in advance.
On Layoff and Sick or Military Leave
40	Employees who have been laid off in a reduction of workforce during the workweek prior to or during the week in which the holiday falls shall receive pay for such holiday or earned holiday hours (based on assigned shift) per Paragraph 37.
Employees who go on sick leave during the workweek prior to or during the week in which the holiday falls shall receive pay
29
for such holiday or earned holiday hours (based on assigned shift) per Paragraph 37.
Employees who go on military leave during the first or second workweek prior to or during the week in which the holiday falls shall receive pay for such holiday or earned holiday hours (based on assigned shift) per Paragraph 37.
ARTICLE VI - OTHER PAY PROVISIONS
Call Back Pay
41	Any employee called back for work outside regularly scheduled hours shall receive not less than two (2) hours pay at the applicable rate.
Reporting Pay
42	When an employee reports for work and no work is available, the employee shall be paid up to the first half of the shift at the employee’s applicable rate for the time lost during the first half (%) of the shift unless notified in advance of the starting time of the shift not to report for work. When an employee reports for overtime work and no work is available, the employee shall be paid two (2) hours at the employee’s applicable rate of pay. Scheduled overtime shifts of less than two (2) hours will be paid for the time worked. However, if stoppage of work is due to fire, lightning, failure of power lines or other causes beyond the Company's control, no payment for lost time shall be made.
The Company agrees that employees shall be notified when not to report for work by either the supervisor of the department, the Human Resource Department, or the Company.
Time Lost Due to Injury
43	If it has been established that an injury to an employee has arisen out of and in the course of employment with the Company, and the employee is instructed by the Medical Department to receive outside treatment for the injury during the
30
current shift, the employee will be paid for time necessary to obtain such treatment. If follow-up outside treatment is required which cannot be scheduled outside the employee's regular working hours, the employee will be paid up to two (2) hours at the employee’s applicable rate of pay for time lost from the regular working hours for the first such follow-up visit only.
Outside Treatment instructed by Medical Department
44	In the event an employee is instructed by the Medical Department to receive subsequent outside treatment during the employee’s regular shift because of the inability to continue work due to the original injury, the employee will be paid for time necessary to obtain such treatment.
Outside Treatment when not Instructed by Medical Department In any case where an employee believes outside treatment for the injury is necessary during regular working hours, even though the Medical Department has refused to instruct the employee to receive such outside treatment, the employee has the option to leave work to receive outside treatment. Should it be determined that the treatment was necessary in order that the employee continue work or if it is determined that the employee is unable to continue work, the employee will be paid for the time lost from regular working hours in accordance with Paragraphs 43, 44 and 45.
45	If the employee loses time and the attending physician determines that the employee is physically unable to work the balance of the shift in which outside treatment was received due to the severity of the injury, the employee shall be paid for the balance of that regular shift, but not to exceed a full days wage (regular hours), upon furnishing proof of the physician's determination. If an employee is injured while working in the plant and such injury arises out of and in the course of employment, and the injury is of such nature as to prevent the employee's return to work for an initial period of three (3) or more consecutive calendar days excluding Sunday (unless
31
assigned and working on the Capacity shift) or paid holiday or vacation following the day of injury, then the Company will pay such employee a sum equal to the current sickness and accident daily benefit rate for each of such three (3) days;
provided, however, that such payment shall not be made if the Workmen's Compensation carrier of the Company is required to pay the employee Workmen's Compensation for the three (3)-day period following the day of injury.
Bereavement
46	An employee with seniority, who is working at the time, will be granted three (3) regular working days off with pay at their applicable rate in the event of a death in the employee's immediate family. Immediate family is defined as the employee's wife, husband, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, step-parent (which includes one of each mother or step-mother and father or stepfather), step-child, brother-in-law, sister-in-law or grandchild.
Employees will be allowed to use bereavement hours, based on their work schedule, starting upon notification of the death of the family member. This would allow the employee to use a portion of the hours available on the first day if the employee is working when notified.
An employee may take the time off with pay later than the day of death or funeral if circumstances warrant and are a direct result of the death. An employee with seniority, who is working at the time, will be granted one (1) regular work day off with pay at their applicable rate for the death of a grandparent of the employee.
When an employee is on a three (3) day bereavement for a member of their immediate family, in accordance with the Labor Agreement, the Company will not require documentation from the employee. The employee is required to notify the Company as identified under the attendance policy.
32
Employees need only call EARS the first day to be excused for the 3-day bereavement leave.
47	An employee with seniority who is working at the time has the option of working and being paid for the bereavement. (Up to twenty four (24) hours for immediate family and eight (8) hours for a grandparent of the employee.) Employees that choose to work and be paid bereavement will receive eight (8) hours of bereavement pay for each day worked. Employees must contact Human Resources to exercise the bereavement pay/work option.
Bereavement is not intended to include overtime.
Jury Duty
48	An employee with seniority shall be excused from work on a workday when called to perform jury service in a court of record, provided prior notice is given to the Company.
Employees assigned to the second shift or Variable Output (V-2) Schedule may transfer to first shift or Variable Output (V-1) Schedule respectively for the week(s) of jury duty provided the employee requests the transfer to Human Resources at least one (1) calendar week before the jury duty is to be served.
Employees assigned to the Variable Output (V-2) Schedule have the option of remaining on V-2 and having up to the last three (3) hours of their shift excused personal business the night before jury duty is to be served upon approval of Human Resources.
Employees must call EARS Reporting system in accordance with the attendance policy guidelines page 154.
49	An employee with seniority who is excused from work for jury service and who furnishes the Company with a statement from the court with regard to jury pay received and time spent on jury service will be reimbursed by the Company as follows:
33
Monday Through Friday Schedules
1)	A first or third shift employee will receive eight (8) hours of pay at the employee’s regular straight-time rate less the amount received as jury pay for each day called to serve as a juror.
• A first shift employee that is released from jury duty before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed would be required to return to work the remainder of the day.
2)	A second shift employee will receive eight (8) hours pay at the employee’s regular straight-time rate less the amount received as jury pay for each day called to serve as a juror, provided the employee is not excused from further service before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed.
•	A second shift employee that is released from jury duty before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed would be required to return to work the remainder of the day.
In no event shall an employee be reimbursed for more than twenty-one (21) days jury service in any period of one year, commencing with the first day for which claim for reimbursement is made.
Variable Output and Capacity Schedules
When an employee is called for service as a juror, the employee will be paid the difference between the fee received for such service and the amount of earnings lost based on the employee’s current rate (lost by the employee for reasons of such service) up to a limit of the employee’s normally scheduled hours in a workday and forty (40) hours per week. An employee shall not be reimbursed for more than one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours of jury service in any one (1) year, commencing with the first day for which claim for reimbursement is made.
34
An employee assigned to the Variable V-1 shift (Monday through Thursday) or Capacity WE-1 shift (Friday only) will receive a full shifts pay at the employee’s regular straighttime rate less the amount received as jury pay for each day called to serve as a juror, provided the employee is not excused from further service before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed.
•	A V-1 or WE-1 shift employee that is released from jury duty before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed would be required to return to work the remainder of the day.

35
ARTICLE VII - SENIORITY
51	It shall be the policy of Trane to recognize seniority. To accomplish this, there shall be one seniority list covering all employees in all production departments.
Probationary Period
52	The probationary period shall consist of the employee working twelve (12) scheduled work weeks which will begin the Monday following successful completion of the new employee orientation. Time missed during the probationary period, full or partial day(s) will be added in increments of full working days to said probationary period. In situations where individuals are assigned to work in the same week of the orientation, the probationary period will begin as of the Monday of that week.
An employee shall have no seniority rights until the completion of the probationary period and will be given a seniority date of Monday following twelve (12) scheduled work weeks. The employee’s wage rate will be increased to the seniority rate upon completion of said probationary period.
Employees that start in the same week and have added day(s) due to absenteeism during their probationary period will have a common seniority date. The seniority wage increase will become effective beginning at the completion of the probation period. This paragraph does not apply to the summer hire program (children of active Trane employees).
53	An employee shall lose seniority rights for the following reasons:
1.	Voluntarily terminates employment with the Company.
2.	Employee has been discharged.
3.	After being laid off, if an employee fails to report for work within five (5) days after being notified by the Company,
36
through the Human Resource Department by certified letter, provided, however, that no employee shall lose seniority rights if the employee’s failure to so report is the result of sickness or causes beyond the employee’s control, in which case the employee shall furnish written proof. Work Rule 6 of Attendance Policy does not apply until the employee has reported to work.
4.	If for any reason an employee has had thirty-six (36) consecutive months of unemployment with the Company or a period equal to one-half (V) of seniority, whichever is greater.
5.	If the employee is absent without notice to the Company for five (5) consecutive days.
Layoff
54	When it becomes necessary to reduce the working forces, the last employee on the seniority list shall be the first employee laid off, etc., and the last employee laid off shall be the first employee recalled, etc., except as hereinafter provided. Before any layoffs or recalls of any employees occur, a list of employees to be laid off or recalled will be presented to the Shop Committee as to the employees laid off or recalled and the effect on seniority; but this shall not in any way interfere with the right of the Company to reduce its force.
If it is necessary to call employees back out of seniority because their skills are required, the Company will provide a list of those being called back to the Union before doing so.
When employees are called back out of seniority because their skills are required, the Company will assign the employees to the jobs they were called back for out of seniority.
37
Maintenance Manpower Guidelines
55	It is agreed that manpower movements (layoff/surplus) of maintenance personnel will be done in accordance with the labor contract with the following clarifications: Within the same trade and department, (Journeymen to Journeymen) seniority will be the predominate factor governing manpower movement. Deviations from straight seniority will only occur in the instance where a very specific, highly technical skill not common to all journeymen from the same trade is required based on recognized work requirements. Possible exceptions to straight seniority will be reviewed by Human Resources and Union Shop Committee before the exemption is acted on.
Within the same trade and department, (Journeymen to Apprentice) the journeyman is recognized to have a higher skill level than an apprentice. Journeyman will have layoff protection over an apprentice in the same trade even if the apprentice is more senior.
Within the same trade and department, (Apprentice to Apprentice) the following criteria will be utilized to determine skill/qualifications for manpower movement:
A. 8001-10,000 Hours
B. 7001-8000 Hours C. 6001-7000 Hours D. 4001-6000 Hours E. 2001-4000 Hours
F.	1001-2000 Hours
G.	0-1000 Hours
Governed by straight seniority. If an apprentice is not able to complete indenture, apprentice will be moved into his most current journeyman classification.
Governed by straight seniority. Governed by straight seniority. Governed by straight seniority. Governed by straight seniority. Governed by straight seniority Probationary period.
38
For example, an employee in the 6001-7000 hour category will be considered as having more skill and qualifications than an employee in the 2001-4000 hour category.
Note: If the need arises within one year of being declared surplus (based on employee working at the time) an apprentice with over 1000 hours completed in the apprenticeship program will have the opportunity to be reinstated into the apprenticeship program.
This opportunity must comply with all current rules and regulations of the Wisconsin Apprenticeship law, Trane Apprenticeship guidelines and current Labor Contract.
It is also agreed that exemptions in maintenance will be handled based on skill and qualifications with senior qualified/skilled people being given the opportunity to perform the work with the junior person going to layoff.
The company will post all maintenance electrical and mechanical openings internally, with the option to simultaneously recruit externally.
Exemptions and Deviations from Layoff
56	All boiler operators, welders, and electricians are exempt from the seniority clause as to layoff as long as they are needed on their exempted jobs. It is understood that an exempted employee must have demonstrated the capability to perform the required job. If the Company replaces an employee exempted in one of the above jobs with an older qualified employee, the exempted employee will be laid off.
57	Deviations from straight seniority in addition to those listed above can only be made for justifiable reasons, that is, when an employee's qualifications are essential on available work and no senior employee not subject to layoff has the necessary qualifications. The Company will specify such exemptions to
39
the Shop Committee sufficiently in advance of the layoff/recall giving the specific reasons for such deviations in each case. The company will endeavor to find alternate qualified employees not subject to layoff for such exempted employees to replace those so exempted. The Company will not be required to make more than two (2) transfers to replace one (1) employee under this paragraph.
The following guidelines clarify the exemption procedure and are in reference to Paragraphs 55 - 61 of the current Labor Contract.
1.	All exemptions from layoff are based on needed skill requirements.
2.	The Company will identify the employees and needed skills to be exempted to the Union Shop Committee as soon as possible after manpower requirements have been determined.
3.	Furthermore, production operations will review manpower to determine if adjustments can be made to free up skilled employees to fill the needed exempt positions. Such manpower adjustments will be communicated to the shop committee.
4.	The Company will (per the job posting/internal upgrade language) initiate a job posting/internal upgrade for exempted skills as soon as determined.
•	All capable employees will be considered provided the employees can perform the skilled job with a reasonable amount of training.
•	If such training is required for capable senior employees, the junior employees will remain on the exempted jobs until the senior employees are trained to fill the exempted
40
positions. At that time the junior exempted employees will be laid off.
•	No qualified employees will be forced out of their home department into any exempted job position.
5.	Exemptions will be discussed between the Company and Shop Committee upon request.
58	The parties may discuss from time to time the problem of deviations from seniority on layoff.
59	Probationary employees will not be exempt from straight seniority if other qualified employees are available.
60	If the Union does not agree with certain exemptions, the Company and the Shop Committee shall make every effort to resolve their differences before resorting to the grievance procedure.
Layoff Notice
61	When layoffs, because of lack of work, are in accordance with straight seniority, the employees affected shall be given two (2) working days notice of the employee’s regular work shift before being laid off for a period of two (2) weeks or more. It is further agreed that in case of material shortages resulting from conditions beyond the Company's control, the two (2) days notice provision will be waived. Employees exempted from layoff who are to be laid off because they are no longer needed on the work for which they are exempt may be laid off without notice. Such exempt employees will work to the end of the shift in which layoff notice is given.
One-Day Layoffs
62	Layoffs due to lack of work or material shortages will be made by seniority in a department, provided such a layoff does not exceed one (1) day in any one (1) week. For any layoff in
41
excess of one (1) day in any (1) one week, the procedure set forth in Paragraphs 54, 56-60 will be followed. This paragraph is not intended to be used to establish a regular workweek with less days than the employees regularly scheduled week for the employees in any department, and shall be applied in such a way that no employee is affected more than six (6) times or more than three (3) consecutive weeks in a twelve (12)-month period. The Union Office will be notified in advance of any layoff under this paragraph.
Inventory
63	The interruption of production due to the taking of inventory is not to be considered as an ordinary layoff. Employees will be asked for inventory work on the basis of seniority in the department provided they are able to perform the work involved. However, when production is also scheduled on their shift, an employee who is scheduled for inventory will be given the opportunity instead to work on such production for which the employee is qualified on this shift and is senior to employees who would otherwise be scheduled for such production.
If inventory is scheduled for Saturday and/or Sunday, this principle will still apply notwithstanding Paragraph 33. Employees who work inventory assignments on Saturday and/or Sunday will be charged for such hours on their overtime record. A refused offer of inventory work on an overtime basis will not be charged.
Final notice for production work shall be posted four (4) days before inventory. If any addition is made in the production schedule subsequent to such notice, any employee affected thereby will not be disqualified for holiday payment if the employee chooses not to work on production on inventory day.
42
ARTICLE VIII - TRANSFER
Requests for Transfer
64	All requests for permanent transfers by employees may be granted by the mutual consent of the Shop Committee and the Company. These transfers shall not be put into effect until agreed and acted on at a regular monthly meeting between the Shop Committee Chairperson and a representative of Human Resources.
The selecting of employees to fill vacancies shall be based upon seniority and qualifications. An employee shall not be entitled to have more than one (1) permanent transfer a year. An employee shall be entitled to submit no more than twelve (12) such requests in any calendar year.
65	When an employee is granted a job or department transfer, the employee shall have up to a thirty (30) calendar day, or in the case of the maintenance and inspection departments, up to a sixty (60) calendar day trial period to determine:
1.	If the employee is acceptable in the new job. If not acceptable in the new job, the employee will be given verbal notice by the supervisor as to why the employee is not acceptable. Wherever possible, such verbal notice will be given prior to the employee leaving the department.
2.	If the employee desires to remain in the new job, one (1) thirty (30) calendar day extension may be made at the request of the employee, the Union, or the Company. When such request is made, the Union, the employee, and the supervisor will receive a written notification using the designated form obtained from Supervision, the Union Office or Human Resources.
43
3.	The employee’s rate will not be lowered in the new department until the employee becomes permanent in said department.
Temporary Transfers
66	All employees who have been on temporary transfer for three (3) months prior to January 15, April 15, July 15, or October 15 will be reviewed on these dates of each year to determine whether or not it would be possible to make the transfer permanent. An employee's rate will not be reduced during the temporary transfer period. The employee will receive the rate of the job being performed while on temporary transfer if it is higher than the employee’s classified rate as soon as the job cycle has been completed. If it is decided to make the transfer permanent, the employee is given a rating in the new department, and the option of accepting the new rate or returning to the old job and department.
44
Temporary Transfer Review Posting
Employee E1 Transferred to Department D1
45
Seniority Principle
67	It shall be the policy of the Company to follow the principle of seniority insofar as it is possible to do so in making temporary transfers and in returning employees to their home departments.
Employees will be transferred from their home department by inverse seniority regardless of shift assignment, provided the remaining employees are qualified to perform the remaining work.
Exception for Union Representatives
68	A department steward, a chief steward, or a member of the Shop Committee, will not be farmed or transferred from the department, nor subject to replacement on the shift (under Paragraph 85) nor transferred to another shift (under Paragraph 87) so long as there is work available in the employee’s job classification, or in a job classification the employee has held, or other work available which, in the Company's judgment, the employee is able to perform. This provision shall not be construed to give extra seniority to such Union representative in the event of layoff under Article VII, or to prevent such Union representative from exercising individual seniority under Paragraphs 85 and 87.
Calling Back Transferred Employees
69	When it is established that there is a need for additional personnel for two (2) calendar weeks or more in a department with employees out on temporary transfer, such temporarily transferred employees will be returned to their home department to fill the need in accordance with Paragraph 67 unless such need is being met temporarily by an employee with physical limitations who is unable to perform these normal duties. Such needed employee will be returned to the department no later than the first scheduled workday of the affected employee following the existence of the need except where an unusual replacement problem exists or there are
46
employees with physical limitations assigned to the job, in which case the employee and the Union will be so notified. However, prior to the senior employee on temporary transfer losing rate protection and home department rights, the employee with physical limitations will be removed from the job. The Union will also be informed of the action to be taken by the Company so that the employee can be returned to the home department as promptly as feasible.
Employees who return to their home department at any time for any reason during their temporary/forced transfer will have their temporary/forced transfer time restarted from the date of their return to their home department.
70	If an employee is scheduled to be returned to the home department to fill a need, but is delayed due to an unusual replacement problem, and rate protection or right to return, as provided in Paragraph 72, is due to expire during such delay period, such rights will be extended until the employee is replaced.
Farming
71	It is recognized that in order to utilize the work force efficiently and to keep people working insofar as possible, the Company requires flexibility in farming employees for short periods up to six (6) calendar weeks. An employee may be farmed out by the Company because of a reduction of work in the home department, because the employee’s specific skill is needed in another department or because of the production needs of another department. Department seniority will be applied on farm-outs and in the return of farmed out employees where practical to do so.
Except where production needs reasonably require otherwise, employees shall not be placed in a department where employees are farmed out prior to returning those on farm out back to their home department by seniority.
47
Forced Transfers
72
1.	When an employee is forced to accept a permanent job or department transfer due to a shortage of work, material, manpower, etc., such employee shall carry the present classification rate for a period of three (3) months as provided in Paragraph 66 of the current contract plus an additional thirty (30) days.
2.	This period may be extended for a period equal to the length of time such employee was precluded from consideration for return to the home department by the temporary presence therein of an employee with physical limitations.
3.	The Company will make every effort to place such an employee within the four (4) month period on available work consistent with the employee's rate, seniority, training and qualifications.
4.	However, in no case will such an employee replace another employee in a job. If work again becomes available in the occupation the employee was performing, the employee will have the option of returning to the occupation providing the individual has sufficient seniority and no employee with physical limitations is assigned to the job. However, prior to an employee losing rate protection or the employee with limitations getting permanent department rights, the employee with limitations will be removed. After this period, the employee on forced transfer shall receive the rate for the new job provided such rate is lower than the old rate.
5.	If the new job rate is higher than the old rate, the employee shall receive the new rate as soon as the job cycle has been completed. If, during the six (6) month period immediately following the new rate and department assignment, work becomes available in the department from which the employee was forced transferred, the
48
employee will have the option of returning to the department.
Wage Rate Handling
73	When an employee is transferred into a job classification where the training cycle has previously been completed the employee shall receive the rate for that job immediately provided such rate is higher than the rate carried.
74	If an employee continuously performs a job, with a higher classification rate for one (1) full day or more, that job rate shall be received as long as the employee continues to perform the job provided the job cycle has been completed. If the employee continues on the job for a period of nine (9) cumulative months within a two (2)-year period, the employee’s short-term rate shall become the employee’s job classification.
Product Transfer or Discontinuance
75	When the Company transfers a product line or a portion thereof from La Crosse, or discontinues the manufacture of a product line or portion thereof at La Crosse, or merges two (2) or more departments and as a result of such action a department is dissolved or a major portion of the regular employees in such department are no longer needed on their jobs, each employee in the department whose job is abolished because of this action will be subject to the following procedure:
1.	Such employee will not be reduced in wage rate for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer from such department unless the employee requests, and is awarded, a permanent transfer. If, after the six (6) months period, the employee has no permanent department, the employee will be placed on a forced transfer in accordance with Paragraph 72.
2.	Further, before such transfer or discontinuance of a product line or a portion thereof takes place, the Company and the Union will discuss the problems of the placement of the above-affected employees on jobs within the bargaining unit
49
in an attempt to resolve such problems consistent with other provisions of this Agreement.
New Department
76	A new department is created when a new product line is originally manufactured in a separate plant area, and such department is assigned a new department number. When a new department is created, the Company and the Union will agree upon a procedure for the distribution of information regarding the department and the minimum requirements therefore. The selection of the employees will be made in accordance with Paragraphs 64 and 82, and the provisions of Paragraph 65 shall also apply.
Requirements for Upgrade
77	Upgrades, on or after June 15, 1993, for both current and future employees will be based on distribution percentages. The Company will manage the distribution of employees as identified in the Contract Amendment, “Attachment B” (page 111) throughout the Labor Grade Structure based on need. Groupings, under the Job Restructuring Program, will continue to be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need as identified by distribution arises. The use of “groupings” will no longer be the sole qualifier for an upgrade.
Employees who temporarily perform a stand-alone job, in a higher classification, will be compensated as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 74, of the current Labor Agreement. However, consistent with Demand Flow Technology principles, employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower classification without having their rate of pay adjusted. This principle of “one up, one down,” is essential to Demand Flow.
The Company will establish the distribution percentages, including the current workforce, and will manage to that distribution. Operations will be responsible for establishing and
50
managing distribution percentages. In addition, Operations will schedule a meeting to discuss the workforce distribution at least semi-annually with Union leadership. The minimum percentage for MT will not fall below ten percent (10%). The combined total for MT and T1 will not fall below 35 percent (35%).
Transfer to Lighter Work and Incapability
78	When a senior employee, who is at the time working, requests a transfer to light work, or the Company determines that such an employee is incapable of performing the employee’s regular job, the Company and the Union will discuss the problem with the intent of:
1.	assigning the employee to available work which the employee is able to perform and which needs to be performed, and
2.	paying for such work at the wage rate of the job the employee would be performing.
It is understood that the above does not obligate the Company to make work for an employee or to assign an employee to work which cannot be performed satisfactorily.
Americans With Disabilities Act (A.D.A.)
79	Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed as a barrier to reasonable accommodation to qualified applicants or employees with a disability, as defined by the Act, provided the Company agrees to provide the Union with advance notice of any job assignment or other form of accommodation which may otherwise conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Leaving or Returning to Bargaining Unit
80	Any member of the bargaining unit who has been promoted or transferred or is promoted or transferred to a position outside
51
the bargaining unit described in Article I shall maintain the amount of seniority held at the time of such promotion or transfer and will not continue to accumulate seniority within the bargaining unit.
Should such employee request to return to the bargaining unit or should the Company decide to return such employee to the bargaining unit, the employee will be reinstated with the amount of seniority maintained at the time of promotion or transfer. The Company agrees that it will not return employees to the bargaining unit for the purpose of temporarily reducing the staff of non-bargaining unit employees. When such employee returns to the bargaining unit, job and department assignments will be at the discretion of the Company. The employee will be assigned the entry-level job within a department. The employee will be granted home department rights in the department where assigned. The Union will be notified of the job and department assignment five (5) days prior to such assignment wherever possible.
However, an employee will not be placed in a department where the assignment would cause the transfer of a regular department employee then working in the department, or where there are employees out of such department on temporary transfer, or where there is not a need for the employee in the department for at least two (2) calendar weeks.
81	Nothing, however, contained in Paragraph 80 shall be construed as limiting the Company's right to discharge any employee promoted or transferred from the bargaining unit for cause.
Should any employee who has been promoted or transferred from the bargaining unit and then returned to the bargaining unit under the above procedures, be subsequently again promoted or transferred from the bargaining unit, the employee will lose
52
all seniority status in the bargaining unit on the date of such promotion or transfer.
An initial temporary vacation replacement assignment of up to three (3) months outside the bargaining unit will not be counted toward the limitations of this paragraph.
Permanent Transfers Not Covered
82	All permanent transfers not covered elsewhere in this Agreement shall be discussed with the Shop Committee before such transfers are made.
ARTICLE IX - SHIFT TRANSFERS
Voluntary Shift Exchange (up to 1 week)
83	Voluntary shift exchanges which are approved by the Company will be permitted between two (2) employees (permanent and/or temporary) in the same department on a temporary basis (up to one [1] week) if such exchange conforms to the Walsh-Healey Act and does not cause overtime payments. No changes in night shift premium will be made for either employee involved in temporary shift exchange under this paragraph.
Voluntary Shift Exchange (more than 1 week)
84	A request for an exchange of shifts which are approved by the Company will be permitted - for up to one (1) year by two (2) employees (permanent to permanent employee or temporary to temporary employee) in the same department will be permitted providing:
1.	Neither employee puts in more than one (1) workday in a twenty-four (24)-hour period in making the exchange, to conform with the Walsh-Healey Act.
53
2.	Neither of the employees making the exchange may do so again within a period of six (6) months, based on Company approval.
3.	The qualifications and experience of both employees are relatively equal.
4.	A temporary to temporary exchange expires if the one of the temporary leaves the department.
The employees involved shall complete and submit the
Voluntary Request Form to Human Resources with a copy to the Union. Forms may be obtained from Supervision, the Union Office or Human Resources.
Shift Preference
85	An employee with seniority may replace a junior employee (with seniority) on a different shift in the same department subject to the following:
1.	The junior qualified employee shall have worked in the same department for at least six (6) weeks.
2.	In order to bump, an employee must be qualified to do the job of a junior employee being bumped. Typically, this means the bump will be in the same classification (i.e. welding, machining).
3.	In addition, an employee will be allowed to bump if the employee is able to do the job of a junior employee with a minimal amount (couple days) of updating on the job.
a. If an employee does not know the job, an employee may request a shift preference to a job of a junior employee with labor grade and classification the same as their labor grade and classification. This shift preference would be reasonably considered when training would be minimal.
54
4.	Alternately, the Company will consider manpower adjustments/moves in order to accommodate the bump. This accommodation will only be allowed if there is no disruption to production and within all applicable Labor Contract provisions. The Company maintains the right to assign work.
5.	The Company is not required to train the employee that is requesting the shift preference. The only training requirement is where the senior employee is replacing an employee in the same or a lower rated labor grade, the Company will, in all instances where possible, train a replacement within three (3) months for the senior employee so that the shift transfer may be exercised. The training period will start within a one (1) week period after the employee’s written request is acted upon at the regular meeting. Also, employees transferred to other shifts for training cannot be bumped.
6.	Bump Procedure (Shift Preference) with the Maintenance Program. Bump Procedure Apprenticeship: To meet the training requirements of the apprenticeship program, an apprentice may not bump or be bumped while on a specific shift for training the first 2 years of a 4 year program or the first 6 months of a 1 year advanced program.
Journeymen/apprentice may bump only within their own classification.
7.	Supervision determines the person being bumped and any manpower adjustments involved. Supervision will communicate to the employee and steward on the status of all bumps.
8.	There will be not more than one (1) such transfer for every thirty (30) regular employees or portion thereof in a department in any one (1) month period, except that each department will be allowed at least one (1) such transfer in
55
any one (1) month period. The number of transfers to be allowed in accordance with the above provisions will be determined on August 1st and February 1st of each year.
86	With respect to the operation of this paragraph, an employee who has performed a job in a department classified in Labor Grade Technician 4 for nine (9) months, or a job classified in Labor Grade Technician 3 or above for twelve (12) months, may be replaced by a senior employee from another shift. This does not place a requirement on the Company to grant a full rate to any employee before the job cycle has been completed.
Transfer to Another Work Schedule
87	When it is necessary to transfer an employee from one shift to another, the youngest employee by seniority in the department capable of doing the work involved, shall be so transferred. When another shift is to be established in a department, the shift will be manned by transferring the youngest employees by seniority from the shift capable of doing the work involved.
The above principles will apply provided no senior employee capable of doing the work expresses a preference to be transferred to the shift involved.

However, where the Company-determined rating would result in a lower rating than the current rate carried by employees regularly performing the work involved, such Company-determined rating will not be placed in effect until it has been discussed at the second regular meeting.
The Shop Committee must then file a grievance at Step 3 within thirty (30) calendar days from the date such Company-determined rating was placed in effect and any settlement in Step 3 will be effective on the date the Company-determined rating was placed in effect.
Newly-Created Job
152	On a newly-created job, no permanent assignment will be made until thirty (30) days after the date of the Committee's rating or the date the Company-determined rate is put into effect, whichever is the earlier. If the employee performing the job has a higher rate than that put into effect, the employee may accept the lower rate or the job or, within the thirty (30) days, decide to return to the previous job. However, the Company may retain the employee on the new job at the employee’s current rate for a period of time adequate for training a replacement.
Effective Date - Grievance
153	Where a job is re-rated and the rate is increased, an employee performing the job will receive the higher rate effective on the date of the floor review, provided a written grievance concerning
78
the rating of the job was presented to the Human Resource Department and, provided the job cycle has been completed.
Over-Rates
154	Employees whose jobs are rated downwards will not be reduced in rate at the time of rating but will carry an over-rate status by the amount the job is reduced. Over-rates will be eliminated or reduced by applying one-half (%) of any negotiated wage increase including improvement factors against the over-rate.
155	Any employee holding an over-rate who receives a permanent transfer to some other classification will lose the over-rate status.
156	Any employee permanently transferred to or given a rating in a classification which has over-rates attached to it will receive the rating for the job upon completion of the job cycle.
ARTICLE XV - VACATION
Vacation Periods
157 The vacation period will start on the Monday preceding the start of each of the following one (1)-year periods: March 15, 2007, to March 15, 2008; March 15, 2008, to March 15, 2009; and March 15, 2009, to March 15, 2010. Vacations are not cumulative from year to year. Vacations may not run consecutively from year to year more than once during the term of the Labor Agreement and then only if the employee qualifying for and requesting such consideration meets the scheduling requirements of Paragraph 164. With advance notice to the Company, an employee may carryover minimum of one full shift up to one (1) full week (40 hours) of vacation from one year to be taken during the following year as prescheduled vacation. Carry over declaration must be made by the Monday preceding March 8th.
79
Human resources can on a case-by-case basis at employee request, allow for any incremental amount of vacation for medical appointment purposes or emergency situations. At employee option, Accident and Sickness Benefits may be paid for in the same period as vacation.
Vacation Entitlement
158 Twelve months from the employee’s hire date, the employee will be eligible for one (1) week (40 hours) of vacation, provided the employee has worked at least six (6) months during the twelve (12) month period from hire date. In order to qualify for future vacation, employees must meet the requirements identified in Paragraph 159, ‘Work Requirements’.

Vacation for employees hired on or after June 15, 1993 will be capped at four (4) weeks (160 hours).
Employees will be charged the number of hours paid for when taking vacation. Note that employees working the Capacity shift will be charged 6.67 hours of vacation for one half (1/2) day, 13.33 hours of vacation for one (1) day and forty (40) hours of vacation for one (1) week [three (3) days equals forty (40) hours vacation].
80
When an employee's anniversary date makes the employee eligible for a higher vacation entitlement, the employee may schedule such incremental entitlement following such anniversary date and prior to the next vacation period.
Work Requirements
159 In order that an employee can qualify for a vacation in the period from March 15 to March 15 in each of the vacation periods, an employee must have worked at least six (6) months during the previous vacation period. For the purpose only of calculating such work requirements, time lost from work due to a compensable work-related injury during the vacation year in which the injury occurs, will be considered as time worked.

161 An employee who has worked for the Company less than one (1) year prior to each of the vacation periods is not entitled to a vacation, but receives a vacation check which is two percent (2%) of the employee’s regular straight-time earnings from January 1 through the end of the payroll week preceding December 15 of the vacation period. New employees must be 81
on the payroll prior to November 1 of the vacation period. Employees that receive vacation during a vacation period will not receive a percentage check. The Company will pay the percentage check in a pay period that will not coincide with shutdown.
Vacation Pay
162	Employees have the option of having their vacation paid in advance or having their vacation paid according to the work week. All vacation must be scheduled as identified in Paragraph 164.
Vacation pay will not be paid in advance unless requested by the employee as specified in the paragraph below. Paychecks may be mailed upon request.
Employees may choose to be paid prior to vacation of one-half (1/2) week (20 hours) or more, including consecutive single days equaling one-half week (20 hours) or more, for the appropriate number of hours to be taken at the employee’s regular rate subject to the above requirements and appropriate advance scheduling. In order to receive vacation pay in advance of the vacation, the employee must: (1) schedule the vacation with their supervisor, and (2) submit a written request to Human Resources for advance payment. Notification must be received by the Human Resources Department before 9:00 a.m. of the second Thursday which precedes the week in which vacation is to be taken. It is the employee’s responsibility to get the advanced vacation request directly to Human Resources within the time guidelines. Employees that opt to hand deliver their advance vacation request to Human Resources must do so outside of their scheduled shift.
Non-Entitlement
163	An employee who has been discharged prior to vacation entitlement (March 15) is not entitled to anything.
Vacation Scheduling Procedure
82
164	The procedure to be followed in scheduling vacations shall include the following:
1.	The number of hours of vacation eligibility is determined for each department.
2.	Based on this number, the vacation quota(s) are established for the departments. The Company follows the policy of allowing the majority of vacation hours to be taken between the beginning of the vacation year and December 15.
3.	During January of each year, employees are asked their vacation preference for the coming vacation year. The principle of seniority in asking vacation preference is followed within each department and shift, insofar as possible.
4.	By February 1, the Company will notify the Union and announce to all employees when the vacation shutdown period or periods for the year will be. If more than one (1) shutdown period is scheduled during the vacation year, then one (1) vacation shutdown must be scheduled the week of July 4.
5.	At Company option, operations may be shutdown for vacation for up to forty (40) hours of an employee’s regular scheduled work shift each year, and during such shutdowns the vacation for eligible employees shall be considered to run concurrently. Exceptions for certain departments or individuals by reason of requirements of the business shall be at the Company's discretion. Employees on leave of absence, such as sick leave or workers compensation, are required to use vacation during scheduled shutdowns.
6.	Employees scheduled to work during a shutdown period will be notified of this not later than 30 calendar days prior to the shutdown period. At the time of such notification, vacations for such employees will be scheduled.
83
7.	The Three Hour Rule applies to regular vacation. The submission of documentation to Human Resources is required as per the attendance policy. If an employee has excused time off during their shift, the employee is responsible for coming to work if three hours or more can be worked. If less than three hours can be worked the employee needs to communicate this when submitting their documentation to Human Resources.
Note the three hour attendance guideline will apply for employees with less than a full days vacation left. As an example: (a) if an employee has two hours of vacation remaining, the employee is scheduled to work the remainder of their shift. All attendance policies/guidelines apply for employees taking off from work, (b) if an employee is assigned to a V-1 shift and has eight hours of vacation remaining and wants to take the remaining two hours off work, the three hour guideline stipulates that the time would be an excused absence provided the employee follows the attendance policy.
Employees entitled to vacation may take all of their vacation on a one-day-at-a-time basis.
1.	Vacations must first be used during scheduled vacation shutdowns as described in number five (5) above.
2.	Vacations on the last regular workday prior to and the first regular workday after a holiday(s) and the Friday prior to deer season cannot exceed the department established quota plus 50 percent (50%).
3.	Requests for prescheduled vacations should be made as far in advance as possible. Such requests made after the start of the employee’s unpaid lunch break of the previous
84
day may not be considered. Additional vacation hours must be scheduled in advance and approved by the Company.
4.	Employees entitled to eighty (80) hours or more vacation (not including Holiday/Vacation hours or vacation carryover hours) may apply their vacation as random full day vacation as identified in number five (5) below.
5.	If an employee calls in on time, the employee may specify that they wish to apply that day as a random full day of vacation, to a maximum of:
Monday through Friday shifts: five (5) random, eight (8) hour day-at-a-time days vacation.
Variable shifts: four (4) random, ten (10) hour day-at-a-time days vacation.
Capacity shifts: three (3) random thirteen and three tenths (13.3334) hour day-at-a-time days vacation.
All employees will be charged the number of hours paid for when taking vacation. Reference Paragraph 164.
6.	The use of day-at-a-time vacation cannot disrupt production operations.
7.	Requests for day-at-a-time vacation are subject to the approval of the Company.
Employees entitled to eighty (80) hours or more vacation will be able to convert up to three (3) single days vacation into six (6) “pre-scheduled” half (%) day vacations. Requests for a half (%) day vacation should be made as far in advance as possible. Pre-scheduled is defined as being scheduled prior to the start of the employee’s unpaid lunch break of the previous work day. Employees may not call in for a random half (%) day vacation.
85
1.	All department vacation quotas remain in effect and the use of a half (V) day vacation cannot disrupt production operations. As in the past, supervision may deviate up or down from the vacation quota based on production needs.
(a)	Half (V) day vacation scheduling will be recorded with the day-at-a-time vacation quota. Employees may pre-schedule the first or second half (V) of the shift as a half (V) day vacation. Two (2) employees may each pre-schedule a half (V) day vacation to equal one (1) full day per the department quota provided:
(b)	one half (V) day vacation is scheduled in the first half (V) of the shift, and
(c)	the second half (V) day vacation is scheduled in the last half (V) of the shift.
Note that once a half (V) day vacation is scheduled, each day-at-a-time vacation quota opening is considered full unless another half (V) day vacation is scheduled for the other half (V) of the shift. Two (2) people in the same department or shift may sign up for the same half (V) day of that shift provided this does not result in exceeding the vacation quota and/or result in disruption to production.
1.	Note that all Contract language remains in effect. All day-at-a-time vacation language will apply to the half (V) day vacation.
2.	Shift hours refer to normal hours paid, thus the first half (V) of the shift is defined as the first four (4), five (5) or six (6) hours paid at the applicable rate, and the second half (V) of the shift is defined as the second four (4), five (5) or six (6) hours paid at the applicable rate. Based on when the unpaid lunch period is scheduled, such unpaid lunch periods must be included in the defined half of the shift when scheduling a half day vacation.
86
For example: an employee assigned to work a Monday Through Friday first shift (6:45 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.) may preschedule a half (%) day vacation for the first half (%) of the shift (6:45 a.m. - 10:45 a.m.) or the second half (%) of the shift (10:45 a.m. - 3:00 p.m.).

An employee assigned to work a Variable V-1 shift (5:45 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.) may preschedule a half (1/2) day vacation for the first half (1/2) of the shift (5:45 a.m. - 10:45 a.m.) or the second half (1/2) of the shift (10:45 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.).
An employee assigned to work a Variable V-2 shift (4:00 p.m. - 2:15 a.m.) may preschedule a half (1/2) day vacation for the first half (1/2) of the shift (4:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m.) or the second half (1/2) of the shift (9:00 p.m. - 2:15 a.m.).
An employee assigned to work a Capacity WE-1 shift (5:45 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.) may preschedule a half (1/2) day vacation
87
for the first half (1/2) of the shift (5:45 a.m. - 11:45 a.m.) or the second half (1/2) of the shift (11:45 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.).
An employee assigned to work a Capacity WE-2 shift (5:45 p.m. - 6:00 a.m.) may preschedule a half (1/2) day vacation for the first half (1/2) of the shift (5:45 p.m. - 11:45 p.m.) or the second half (1/2) of the shift (11:45 p.m. - 6:00 a.m.).
Pay in Lieu of Vacation
165	An employee who retires will be entitled to pro-rata vacation pay based on the appropriate percentage for length of service for all regular straight-time earnings from the beginning of the vacation period until termination, if the employee satisfies the work requirements listed in Paragraph 159, and if the employee gives the Company at least five (5) working days notice of the intention to retire.
No payment in lieu of vacations will be made to any employee for a vacation not taken by the individual, unless the employee is eligible for a vacation in accordance with the above paragraphs but has not actually worked ten (10) months during the qualifying period. Upon an employee's death, the beneficiary, as shown in the Group Life Insurance Record, will be entitled to pro-rata vacation pay based on the appropriate percentage for the employee's length of service for all regular straight-time earnings from the beginning of the vacation period until the employee’s death.
Return from Military Service
166	When an employee returns to work from a duly authorized leave of absence to the armed services, vacation rights will be determined as follows:

88
2.	If the employee returns to work between September 15th and March 14th, inclusive, the employee shall be entitled to 2%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 10% or 12% of the regular straight-time hourly earnings between September 14th and up to the Monday preceding March 15th of the next vacation year in lieu of a vacation for the vacation year during which returned.
3.	All time spent in the armed services which is supported by a duly authorized leave of absence shall be considered the same as work time for computing vacation rights for the vacation period which follows the vacation period during which the employees return to work.
ARTICLE XVI - WAGES

Wage Protection
170
1.	All employees covered by this Agreement shall be eligible to receive wage increases based on wage protection allowances on August 3, 2008 and August 2, 2009.

172	In-house candidates selected for an apprenticeship will continue to carry their current rate until such time as the appropriate progression schedule takes over.
All six (6)-month advancements, whether part of the progression schedule or this provision, are contingent on the evaluations of supervision and the journeyman-instructor as reported to Joint Committee.
Upgrading
173	The Company will continue to upgrade employees to higher skilled jobs where possible to do so. The fact that an employee is proficient on the job currently held, will not in itself be the cause to prevent the upgrading to a higher skilled job. Seniority will be a factor in making the selection.
Requirements for Upgrade
174	Upgrades, on or after June 15, 1993, for both current and future employees will be based on distribution percentages. The Company will manage the distribution of employees (see Attachment B chart on page 111) throughout the Labor Grade Structure based on need.
Groupings, under the Job Restructuring Program, will continue to be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need as identified by distribution arises. The use of “groupings” will no longer be the sole qualifier for an upgrade.
Employees who temporarily perform a stand-alone job, in a higher classification, will be compensated as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 74, of the current Labor Agreement. However, consistent with Demand Flow Technology principles, employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower classification without having their rate of pay adjusted.
100
This principle of “one up, one down,” is essential to Demand Flow.
The Company will establish the distribution percentages, including the current workforce, and will manage to that distribution. Operations will be responsible for establishing and managing distribution percentages. In addition, Operations will schedule a meeting to discuss the workforce distribution at least semi-annually with Union leadership. The minimum percentage for MT will not fall below ten percent (10%). The combined total for MT and T1 will not fall below 35 percent (35%).
LABOR GRADE GUIDELINES
GUIDELINES FOR ASSIGNING LABOR GRADES
1.	Labor grade assignments will be based on need and managed to the distribution guidelines.
2.	Employees who are temporarily assigned to a higher rated job will be covered under Paragraph 73 and 74 of the Labor Agreement.
3.	Employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower labor grade without having their labor grade or rate of pay adjusted.
4.	Any employee who is assigned to a permanent stand alone job will be assigned the appropriate labor grade when qualified. If an employee is trained as a backup, the employee will receive the appropriate labor grade as outlined in Paragraph 74.
5.	Employees assigned a stand alone or a seniority based grouping labor grade will retain the labor grade unless it is voluntarily forfeited by the employee as identified in the Labor Agreement.
101
6.	Groupings will be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need, as identified by distribution, arises.
GUIDELINES FOR UPGRADE
I) All seniority grouping upgrades will be based on La Crosse wide seniority and distribution requirements, adjustments to seniority grouping upgrades will be discussed at least semi-annually. For all required seniority grouping upgrades, the first opportunity for upgrade will be afforded to the senior employee who is already qualified for the upgrade grouping. However, if there is a senior employee that only requires one more “T” qualification to attain the upgrade grouping qualification then the senior employee is afforded the upgrade opportunity.
An example of a required MT seniority grouping Upgrade is as follows:
Step 1 The senior employee carrying a T1 or T2 labor grade who is already a qualified MT (7 x T2’s) will be upgraded (an exception may exist based on Step 2-B). Refer to Attachment B chart on page 107
Step 2
A.	If there is no qualified employee in the “A” category then the upgrade will be afforded to the senior employee who is a T2 with 6 x T2’s (T1 grouping). Refer to Attachment B chart on page 107
B.	However, if the employee in the “B” category has more seniority than the employee in “A” and only requires one more “T” qualification to obtain a MT rating, then the senior employee is
102
afforded the upgrade training opportunity. Refer to Attachment B chart on page 107
C.	Upon successful completion of the training, the employee will receive the appropriate back pay from the date the employee was identified for the required grouping upgrade.
II)	In work cells, employees are required to learn all jobs within their respective work cell before training on jobs outside of their work cell. Furthermore, employees in their work cell are afforded the opportunity to train on all jobs within the work cell before employees outside of the work cell are afforded the opportunity.
III)	Employees have the responsibility to do all assigned work including training.
IV)	Training does not have to be offered to an employee if the training is not a one step away upgrade. i.e. it is not required for a MT welder to be trained on a T1 job since it would not result in an upgrade.
V)	Capability will continue to be a factor of consideration in filling a training need.
VI)	On occasion, it may be necessary to train junior employees in order to free up senior employees for training. This will be done only if there is a written training plan and all employees involved are informed about the needed training.
VII)	The extent of training in a department is based on the production needs and the practical ability to keep employees cross trained.
103
VIII)	Supervision will communicate the general plan for training to employees. Training is normally an ongoing process.
IX)	All applicable labor contract language is in effect.
Supplement to Upgrade and Training Guidelines
•	No training for overtime
•	Upgrade - Labor Grade change (i.e., T3 to T2)
•	All employees will rotate in their assigned work cell.
•	Home department employees on the shift within the department will be given primary consideration for backup job training.
A.	For Standalone/workcell job training for backup operator MT & T1 unless entry level applies. Select back up person to be trained in the following order.
•	1st Criteria: Fill by qualification within classification. Balance for flexibility.
•	2nd Criteria: Fill within classification without qualification. Balance for flexibility.
•	3rd Criteria: Within department, assign junior qualified person if they are on a lower rated job.
•	4th Criteria: Assign the junior person within the department.
B.	For Standalone/workcell job training for backup T2 & below unless entry level applies. Steward/Factory Unit Manager identify individuals for training. Balance for flexibility. Considerations:
104
•	Seniority, number of jobs already trained for back up and one away from grouping upgrade. Steward/Factory Unit Manager call.
•	Upgrade offered to home department employees in department (based on Guidelines). It is not required to train home department employees for a lateral labor grade job unless one away from upgrade; however, the Company is not excluded from selecting home department employees for a lateral move when it is deemed practical.
A.	For lateral moves within classification or outside of classification if qualified. Employees can be assigned to any job the employee is qualified to perform. Lateral moves are a normal occurrence if employees are qualified. If an employee is unqualified and requires training, the training selection guidelines apply.
B.	For lateral moves for permanent jobs outside classification that requires training with volunteers. Applies only if there is a need to add people within a classification, but not add to department. Use training selection guidelines for picking the people to be trained.
C.	A lateral move for permanent job outside of classification that no one volunteered for (could be lower rated job performed by a person that didn’t give up their previous labor grade when the job was assigned.) Supervisor assigns junior person in department if department is not adding people in total. Posting applies if people are being added to department.
•	Temporary employees may be assigned to temporary needs (jobs) based on skill.
105
•	Temporary employees will be assigned when openings exist after home department employees are offered upgrade if a permanent need exists. This could be an assignment to stand alone or workcell job.
•	If temporary employee is assigned to a workcell, they could be trained on all jobs within the workcell ahead of other home department employees within the department.
•	Temporary employees may be trained in multiple jobs for flexibility; however, it is the Company’s intent to invest training in home department employees ahead of temporary employees whenever practical.

DISTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
METHOD FOR SLOTTING OF
EMPLOYEES IN LABOR GRADE DISTRIBUTION
DISTRIBUTION PROCEDURES:
Step 1: Each employee will be reviewed and categorized based on the highest stand alone job (labor grade) the employee is qualified to perform within their work cell based on seniority, qualifications and need.
Step 2: All employees will be assigned to their highest qualified stand alone labor grade within their work cell.
Step 3: The distribution percentage will be calculated based on the results from Step 2.
Step 4: If there are less than 10% MT and/or a 35% combined total for MT and T1 after Step 2 then some employees will be assigned the grouping labor grade to meet the minimum distribution of 10% MT and combined 35% for MT and T1. If these minimum distribution requirements have not been met after Step 2, employees will be reviewed in seniority order to meet the minimum distribution.
Step 5: The distribution of employees will be reviewed at least semi annually with the union leadership.

SAFETY CREED
“No one wants to make a product when part of its cost is an injury to an employee. No one wants to earn keep or wages when part of that earnings has resulted in misfortune to a fellow worker. No one wants to feel that carelessness has meant suffering or permanent injury to someone who is careful and who would be an innocent victim of such carelessness.
“We all want to feel that no action of ours has caused misfortune to others, that we individually have worked and planned to avoid accidents, and have a right to be proud of having prevented accidents. So let's be safe and work in the Committee or for the Committee to that end.”
- - Reuben N. Trane

Employees are considered first shift employees for purposes of determining normal working and sleeping hours while traveling. Travel, including time outside normal working hours, will be compensated according to the Trane Travel Policy.
Experimental Department
246 It is agreed that the Memo of Understanding dated May 22, 1958, with reference to the Experimental Department remains in effect.
135
MEMO OF UNDERSTANDING
The experimental department (367) is responsible for building sample, test and experimental units. These units are used for the most part as a means of obtaining production orders for the units from customers or potential customers. The customer may subject a group of experimental units to severe tests, some of which are destructive in that they exceed by far the specifications necessary. If the customer’s specifications are met, The Trane Company usually receives confirmation on a quantity order for the units involved. Once such an order is received, the company takes steps to obtain the necessary tooling to produce the units on a production basis. In general, it is not the purpose of the experimental department to manufacture units on a production quantity basis.
In view of the problem arising out of the carrying on of Experimental Department work in Plant 3, the Company has decided to move Dept. 367 facilities and personnel to the Engineering Laboratory. This problem arose because these men have been physically located in a factory building.
The parties agree this transfer means that the personnel involved are outside of the Company’s factory employee group and therefore outside of the Union’s jurisdiction. The transfer will be made on or before June 15, 1958.
It is understood that Experimental Department personnel may be required to coordinate the work between Experimental and Production and to instruct factory employees when necessary as is now being done. However, it is not intended that such personnel act in a direct supervisory capacity over hourly employees.
The union further agrees that their grievance dated February 18, 1958 on this problem is settled.
136
Reference is made to the signed minutes of the meetings between the Company and the Union on April 9, 1958, April 24, 1958 and May 5, 1958 in which questions relating to this matter are covered.

138
ARTICLE XXIV - STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS
No Strike - No Lockout
247 Since the procedures herein provide a means of peaceable settlement of all differences, disputes, complaints and grievances that may arise between them, it is agreed that the Union shall not authorize, encourage, or participate in any strike or slowdown, and the Company agrees that there shall be no lockouts.
Violation of Clause
248 In the event of an illegal, unauthorized or uncondoned strike, sitdown, slowdown or interference with the operation by an employee or employees in violation of this Agreement, the Union will undertake all reasonable means at its disposal to terminate such action. Employees who participate in or are responsible for such violation may be disciplined or discharged, and such discipline or discharge shall be subject to the grievance procedure except as to employees who do not terminate the violation promptly. The question of whether an employee participated in or had any responsibility for such violation shall in every case be subject to the grievance procedure. In the event that the Union, using immediate action, is unable to induce the employee or employees to terminate such unauthorized action, the Company will not hold the local Union or its officers or the International Union or its officers financially responsible therefore.
ARTICLE XXV DEMAND FLOW TECHNOLOGY
249 The Union and Company agree to use their best efforts to work cooperatively to implement Demand Flow Technology throughout La Crosse operations. Demand Flow Technology is a prerequisite for consideration of manufacturing in La Crosse, and by doing so makes La Crosse more cost-competitive in our industry.
139
ARTICLE XXVI - 1993 AMENDMENT*
* (Note that all articles and paragraph numbers referenced in the 1993 Amendment are based on the 1991 - 1995 Agreement.)
250 Over the past several months Company and Union representatives have met to discuss the future of Trane’s La Crosse manufacturing operations. These joint discussions covered the multifaceted cost disadvantages facing La Crosse of which La Crosse’s high labor rates were identified as a major cost factor that could work against the La Crosse Business Unit when making future investment decisions.
The objective for both parties was to control future labor costs thereby insuring that meaningful consideration for future investments of redesigned products (Commercial Scroll and Absorption Water Chillers) was given to La Crosse while maintaining the base wages of the current workforce through grandfathering.
It is understood between the parties that should the Company not make the decision to invest in the above referenced redesigned products for La Crosse production by June 15th of 1993, this Amendment in its entirety becomes null and void.
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive outline of the proposed Amendment to the current labor Agreement as well as noncontractual commitments and agreements on various issues of discussion, as featured below and supplemented by Attachments A, B and C (pages 147150).
Demand Flow Technology
American Standardand all of its facilities and manufacturing locations are converting to Demand Flow Manufacturing Technology which is intended to eliminate nonvalue-added activities. Cooperation with Demand Flow Technology is a
140
prerequisite for consideration of manufacturing the redesigned products in La Crosse, and by doing so makes La Crosse more cost-competitive in our industry.
The Union and Company agree to use their best efforts to work cooperatively to implement Demand Flow Technology throughout the La Crosse Business Unit.
New Wage Schedule
A new wage schedule will be added to the Labor Grade Structure, Schedule E (see Attachment A page 147and A-1 page 148) and is applicable only to individuals hired (or rehired) on or after June 15, 1993. This does not affect current employees who may be laid off with recall rights. Wage protection provisions based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, as outline in the current Labor Agreement, Article XVI, Paragraph 169, will apply to all wage schedules. Future changes to the Wage Protection provisions beyond the current Labor Agreement will be subject to future labor contract negotiations.
Trainee Rates
Trainee rates, as outlined in Schedules I, II and III of the current Labor Agreement will not apply to employees hired on or after June 15, 1993 under Schedule E. Such employees will fall under Schedule E of this Amendment.
Probationary Period
Individuals hired on or after June 15, 1993, must complete a probationary period as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 53, of the current Labor Agreement. Upon successful completion of one’s probationary period individuals will receive $1.00 per hour increase under Schedule E. The day following the end of an individual’s probationary period will establish the seniority date.
Time Progression
141
Time progressions in grade where applicable under Schedule E will continue to be based on “of working time” the same as it is for individuals hired prior to June 15, 1993. Time progression increases will be one (1) year “of working time” from one’s seniority date allowing for adjustments outside “of working time,” i.e., layoff, long leave, and leave of absence. Single day(s) of leave of absence will not cause adjustments towards time progressions.
The Company is implementing a new time and attendance record keeping system which will aid in the tracking “of time worked,” as well as provide timely response to requests for certain types of personnel information.
The Company will provide the Union Office with two (2) terminals and one (1) printer so direct viewing can be made by the Shop Committee of non-confidential hourly employee information, i.e., vacation, absentee records, training records, etc.
Upgrades Between Levels
Upgrades (pay) for individuals hired on or after June 15, 1993, under Schedule E will be based on time in grade. The following examples illustrate how upgrades between levels would work:
First illustration: an individual who has been employed for three (3) years and is at an FT2 36-month progression rate and is upgraded, based on need, to an FT1 will receive the 36-month progression rate for an FT1.
Second illustration: an individual who has been employed for five (5) years and is at an FT2 60-month progression rate and based on need qualifies for an upgrade to FMT will receive the 60-month progression rate for an FMT.
Requirements for Upgrade
Upgrades, on or after June 15, 1993, for both current and future employees will be based on distribution percentages. The
142
Company will manage the distribution of employees (see Attachment B page 149) throughout the Labor Grade Structure based on need.
Groupings, under the Job Restructuring Program, will continue to be used for the purpose of preparing an individual for upgrade when the need as identified by distribution arises. The use of “groupings” will no longer be the sole qualifier for an upgrade.
Employees who temporarily perform a stand-alone job, in a higher classification, will be compensated as outlined in Article VIII, Paragraph 75, of the current Labor Agreement. However, consistent with Demand Flow Technology principles, employees may be required to perform duties at adjacent work stations for short periods of time that may be in a higher or lower classification without having their rate of pay adjusted. This principle of “one up, one down,” is essential to Demand Flow.
The Company will establish the distribution percentages, including the current workforce, and will manage to that distribution. Operations will be responsible for establishing and managing distribution percentages. In addition, Operations will schedule a meeting to discuss the workforce distribution at least semi-annually with Union leadership. The minimum percentage for FMT will not fall below ten percent (10%). The combined total for FMT and FT1 will not fall below 35 percent (35%).
Seniority within a department will be used to fill upgrade needs in grades FT2 and below. Upgrades based on need in FT1 and FMT will be filled by classification (welding, machinist, machine operations, assembly, factory services) and seniority within the department, i.e., an upgrade to an FMT welder will be filled by the senior qualified person already in the welding classification. An exception may exist when the entry-level position within a department is above an FT2. In such cases, seniority will be used to fill the upgrade.
143
Vacation
Vacation for hourly employees hired on or after June 15, 1993, will be capped at four (4) weeks (see Attachment C page 150). All other provisions of Article XVI - VACATION remain unchanged.
Vacation entitlement, for current employees, will remain unchanged for the life of the Contract, subject to future labor contract negotiations.
Wage Increase
The Union agrees to forego the 1993 negotiated general wage increase of 300 per hour. The 1994 negotiated general increase of 350 per hour will apply to all wage schedules.
State Funding
The Company and Union will work together in an effort to secure State funding assistance for capital purchases and/or leasing of capital equipment and expense needs. Specific needs will include: capital financing and/or leasing of capital equipment for Scroll Compressors and Absorption Water Chillers, and grants for the relocation of Plant 6 Compressor Operations and training for people on new jobs.
The Company and Union have discussed the future of work considered for placement in La Crosse as a result of the Company receiving State Funding assistance and the implementation of this Amendment.
The Company and the Union agree that the Company’s obligations with respect to the ongoing continuation of work placed in La Crosse, as a result of the Amendment, is limited to those conditions as required by the State to secure the funding assistance. As previously stated, this Amendment in its entirety becomes null and void if the Company does not make the decision to invest in the redesigned products for La Crosse by June 15, 1993, regardless of the source of funding.
144
Grandfathering
The intent of grandfathering, as outlined under Security of Amendment, is to maintain the current base wage rate for all hourly employees hired prior to June 15, 1993. All employees will be assigned their appropriate job classification (labor grade) based on the agreed distribution guidelines and percentages per Attachment B page 149
Grandfathered employees will maintain their current base wage rate unless they voluntarily choose to forfeit their grandfather protection. Examples of voluntary forfeiture of one’s grandfathered rate would be if an employee refuses training for an upgrade on the shift, bids on a posted lower-rated job, accepts a request for transfer to a lower-rated job, bumps to a lower-rated job, or chooses a lower labor grade when offered a choice between two (2) or more levels.
Employees must continue to qualify to receive “premiums”.
Paragraphs 73 and 76 of the current Labor Agreement will apply to employees who forfeit their grandfathered rate, as well as to all employees hired after June 15, 1993.
Security of Amendment
The intent of this Agreement is to grandfather current employees with regard to current wage rate and establish a new wage structure that, in time, will lower the cost structure within the La Crosse manufacturing operation.
To that end, upward adjustments in wages for the grandfathered wage schedules and the new wage structure (Schedule E) will be subject to future labor contract negotiations with the following two (2) qualifications:
145
1.	From the effective date of the Amendment, the Company will not ask for any downward adjustments to any grandfathered wage schedule or labor grade of the current Labor Agreement for the next ten (10) years.
2.	From the effective date of this Amendment, the Union will not ask for any changes to the intent of the new wage and labor grade structure for the next ten (10) years.

ATTENDANCE POLICY GUIDELINES UPDATE AND RELATED POLICIES & PROCEDURES
Please note, when the Company considers excusing absences/ tardiness, which are not defined as “excusable absences”, under the Labor Agreement’s Attendance Policy, the Company and the Union jointly agree the absences/tardiness are considered on a case by case basis, and if excused, are excused on a non-precedent setting basis. The employee’s attendance record is included in the consideration process.
1)	All employees must notify the Company when they are going to be either absent or tardy. Notification must be made prior to the start of the shift by calling the Employee Absence Reporting System (EARS), using a touch-tone phone, on (608) 787-2142. Please note that all absences and tardiness must be reported on EARS even if employees notify other Company representatives about either their absences or tardiness. ALL CALLS MUST BE COMPLETED AND SAVED PER THE PROCEDURE. Employee must stay on the line until the system says the call has been saved. If you do not have a touch-tone phone, call (608) 787-4882 to report either your absence or tardy. Note, only the current day and next day can be reported. Employees should also inform their Supervisor ahead of time whenever they know they will be either absent or tardy. If an employee does not give notification prior to the start of their shift, then the absence is an unexcused “no report”. If an employee is going to be tardy, notification must be made prior to the start of the shift on EARS, otherwise it is an unexcused “no report”.
Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case, nonprecedent setting basis.
Employees that are going to be absent from work for one workweek (seven calendar days) or less may schedule the time
154
away from work with Human Resources by going on an approved leave of absence. In such cases, employees are required to: (a) schedule a time to meet, outside of the employee’s shift, where practicable, on their own time, with a Human Resources Representative, (b) submit documentation acceptable to the Company in advance of the absence to Human Resources, and (c) receive approval by a Human Resources Representative to be away from work. Upon receiving advanced approval from a Human Resource Representative, daily absence reporting is not required.
All work related absences must be reported and handled in accordance with the Attendance Policy.
Employees must go on a leave of absence after missing in excess of one (1) workweek. Once an employee is on an approved leave of absence, through Human Resources, then the daily reporting is not required. Also, employees returning to work from a medical leave of absence, or a leave that does not have a predetermined return date, must first come to Human Resources with the return to work authorization/documentation before returning to their job.
2)	It is the employee’s responsibility to provide the Company acceptable documentation to be considered for excused time away from work. Employees have five working days, of their work schedule, beginning the date of their return to work to provide documentation to cover the absence/tardy. If the absence is for an entire shift, then the documentation must indicate that the employee be excused for the entire shift. For example, if an employee has a doctor’s appointment, the employee would not normally be excused for the entire shift unless the doctor’s slip identifies that the employee is medically unable to work and should be excused for the entire shift.
Whenever possible, personal appointments should be made during off shift times.
155
It is the employee’s responsibility to get the documentation directly to Human Resource’s (Building 12-1) 2213 South 20th Street. La Crosse, WI 54601 or other address as communicated, within the time guidelines. There are two locked boxes located by Human Resources for drop off. One box is located in the kiosk room and the other is in the entryway at the West entrance to Building 12-1. All deliveries are to be done on the employee’s own time.
“Original” documentation is required to be submitted to Human Resources, not copies of the original.
3)	Employees are required to see the doctor on the first day of the illness to be excused. The three (3) exceptions are:
A) For consecutive days of illness, if an employee cannot see the doctor on the first day due to the illness and sees the doctor on the second day, then it is excused if acceptable documentation is provided per the guidelines. In these cases the doctor must specifically identify that due to medical reasons, the employee was unable to work and missed the first day due to illness.
If an employee cannot see the doctor on the first day due to the illness and is not sick the second day, and, the employee sees the doctor on the second day, the previous sick day may be excused if acceptable documentation is provided per the guidelines. Also, in these cases, the doctor must specifically identify that due to medical reasons the employee was unable to work and missed the first day due to the illness. The employee must see the doctor on the second day on their own time.
If an employee is sick the last day of their work schedule, and is too sick to see the doctor on that day, the employee may see the doctor the following day providing acceptable documentation is provided per the guidelines. Also in these
156
cases, the doctor must specifically identify that due to medical reasons the employee was unable to work the previous day due to the illness. The employee must see the doctor on their own time.
Employees should schedule medical appointments during off shift times or at the start or the end of their shifts whenever possible.
4)	It is the employee’s responsibility to be at work in time to clock in and to be on their job and ready to begin work at the start of the shift. Furthermore, it is the employee’s responsibility to work up to the end of their shift and clock out as soon as possible after their shift ends. If an employee plans on leaving work, it is the employee’s responsibility to obtain permission from Supervision before punching out otherwise the employee is leaving the plant without permission. Such permission will not be unreasonably withheld.
Note, “on the button” punches are tardy.
The Trane time clock is the “basis of standard” for all Trane’s time and Attendance Policies and Procedures.
5)	If employees have problems clocking in or out at their designated clock, it is their responsibility to go to the next nearest clock and again repeat the clocking process. If the second clocking does not take, the employee must notify their Supervisor immediately. Supervision is to then check out the problem with the employee. If there is a system or power failure, employees are to contact their Supervisor (or Steward if the Supervisor is not available) to report the system is down.
Note: Security access into a building or plant is not part of the time and attendance system. To be considered at work, and on time, employees must punch-in using the time clock system.
157
Access into the building does not fulfill the clocking procedures as outlined in the Labor Agreement.
6)	Voluntary, non-mandatory and extra curricular activities are not excusable absences. Mandatory meetings for such activities as parent-teacher conferences are excused provided the employee follows the Attendance Policy requirements.
7)	Regarding Monthly Saturday Union Membership Meetings: For employees leaving work to attend these meetings the following procedure applies; (a) The employee is required to advise their Supervisor, before the start of their shift, that they will be absent from work to attend the Union Meeting; (b) The employee is required to clock out when leaving the plant to attend the Meeting and clock back in when returning to work; (c) In order to be excused, employees attending the Union Meeting must sign on the official sign-in sheet at the Union meeting, which is then submitted to Human Resources on the following Monday morning by the Lodge 21 Shop Committee. (d) Provided the employee follows this policy, and returns to work immediately following the conclusion of the Meeting, the time away from work will be an excused unpaid absence, (e) Also, the time spent attending Monthly Saturday Union Membership Meetings will apply toward the forty (40) hour work requirement for overtime. This applies to employees assigned to the Capacity (WE-1) shift.
8)	Regarding the “Three Hour Rule”, if an employee has excused time off during the shift, the employee is responsible for coming to work if three (3) hours or more can be worked. If three (3) hours cannot be worked the employee needs to communicate this when submitting their documentation to Human Resources. The “Three Hour Rule” applies for employees observing less than a full day’s vacation. Note the following exceptions: (a) Employees that attend Union Meetings must return to work upon the conclusion of the Union Meeting, and (b) The “Three Hour Rule” does not pertain to
158
medical or therapy appointments involving work related injuries. When released to return to work by the physician, injured employees are to immediately return to work, even if less than three (3) hours remain on their scheduled shift.
Note the “Three Hour Rule” will apply for employees with less than a full day’s vacation left. For example: (a) If an employee has two (2) hours of vacation remaining, the employee is scheduled to work the remainder of their shift. All Attendance Policies/Guidelines apply for employees taking off from work; (b) If an employee is assigned to a Variable Shift (V-1) and has eight (8) hours of vacation remaining and wants to take the remaining two (2) hours off of work, “Three Hour rule” guideline stipulates that the time would be an excused absence provided the employee follows the Attendance Policy. (Reference Work Rule 6).
9)	Birthday Holiday: All employees are responsible to comply with the following procedure when observing their Birthday Holiday:
(1)	The employee may observe their Birthday Holiday on any day of their scheduled work week (Monday Through Sunday) in which their birthday falls, provided it is pre-scheduled a minimum of 24 hours in advance of the actual observed day off.
Employees will be paid double-time if scheduled to work on a day observed as a Birthday Holiday, scheduled (as identified above), provided the employee advises their Supervisor that the day requested to be worked is being observed as a Birthday Holiday, therefore paid at double-time, for that employee prior to the employee being scheduled to work. Consistent with past practice, if an employee inadvertently works their Birthday Holiday, or is on vacation, or is being required to work, the entire week in which the birthday occurs, the employee will be able to re-schedule the Birthday Holiday
159
to the next soonest day as approved by Supervision, based on production needs.
Other: If an employee’s birthday falls on a day being observed as a holiday, the Birthday Holiday will be considered as occurring on the employee’s following workday. Boiler operators may schedule their Birthday Holiday to coincide with their floating weekend schedule, if otherwise eligible to do so, provided such time off is scheduled at least one (1) week in advance.
10)	Bereavement: An employee with seniority, who is working at the time, will be granted three (3) regular working days off with pay at their applicable rate in the event of a death in the employee’s immediate family. Immediate family is defined as the employee’s wife, husband, father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, father-in-law, mother-in-law, step-parent (which includes one of each mother or step-mother and father or stepfather), step-child, brother-in-law, sister-in-law or grandchild.
An employee may take the time off with pay later than the day of death or funeral if circumstances warrant and are a direct result of the death. An employee with seniority who is working at the time, will be granted one (1) regular work day off with pay at their applicable rate for the death of a grandparent of the employee.
When an employee is on a three (3) day bereavement for a member of their immediate family, in accordance with the Labor Agreement, the Company will not require documentation from the employee. The employee is required to notify the Company as identified under the Attendance Policy.
An employee with seniority, who is working, at the time, has the option of working and being paid for the bereavement. (Up to twenty-four (24) hours for immediate family and eight (8) hours for a grandparent of the employee.) Employees that choose to
160
work and be paid bereavement will receive eight (8) hours of bereavement pay for each day worked. Employees must contact Human Resources to exercise the bereavement pay/work option.
Bereavement is not intended to include overtime.
Note: In order to assure proper bereavement pay, employees must contact Human Resources directly regarding family bereavements.
11)	Negotiated vacation language changes allow for all vacation time to be taken in single day increments. As a reminder, the intent behind half (1/2), single, and random day vacation is so employees can utilize vacation time for personal business and emergencies, while at the same time ensuring consistent weekly checks.
Regarding “Random Day” Vacation: For all employees, vacation time is converted into hours in accordance with the Labor Agreement. Employees on the Variable shift, who qualify per the Labor Agreement, are entitled to four (4) days ten (10) hour shifts of “random” vacation while employees on the Capacity shift who qualify per the Labor Agreement, are entitled to have three (3) days twelve (12) hour shifts - charged at 13.3334 hours per shift of “random” vacation. Employees on the Monday Through Friday schedule continue to have five (5) “random” days eight (8) hour shifts vacation.
To be eligible for a maximum of forty (40) hours of “random” vacation, an employee must have met the vacation entitlement requirements identified in the Labor Agreement and have two (2) or more years of service. Employees that become entitled to two (2) weeks vacation, as the result of an anniversary date are eligible for “random” vacation after said anniversary date. Random vacation days must be taken in full day increments.
161
Carry over vacation is not considered part of the eighty (80) hours “entitlement”. As a point of clarification, employees are not entitled to random vacation days unless they are entitled to two (2) weeks’ vacation, not including carry over vacation.
All “random” day vacations must be reported (completed and saved) on the EARS system prior to the start of the shift, otherwise, it is an unexcused “no report”.
Regarding Half-Day (1/2) Vacation Language: All half-day (1/2) vacations must be pre-scheduled per the Labor Agreement for all shifts. Employees that are eligible for half-day (1/2) vacation may split up to three (3) days of vacation into half (1/2) days. The Variable shift may split three (3) days’ vacation into six (6) half-day (1/2) vacations (one half-day (1/2) equals five (5) hours vacation). The Capacity shift may split three (3) days vacation into six (6) half-day (1/2) vacations at the accelerated rate, (one half-day equals 6.67 hours of vacation, one (1) day equals 13.3334 hours of vacation, and three (3) days equals forty (40) hours of vacation.) The Monday through Friday schedule may split three (3) days vacation into six (6) half-day (1/2) vacations (one half-day (1/2) equals four (4) hours of vacation).
To be eligible for half (1/2) day vacations, an employee must have met the vacation entitlement requirements identified in the Labor Agreement and have two (2) or more years of service. Half day (1/2) vacations must be pre-scheduled with the employee’s Supervisor per the Labor Agreement. Employees that become entitled to two (2) weeks vacation, as the result of an anniversary date are eligible for half day (1/2) vacation increments. Carry over vacation is not considered part of the eighty (80) hours “entitlement”. As a point of clarification, an employee is not entitled to half (1/2) day vacation unless they are entitled to two (2) weeks vacation, not including carry over vacation.
162
12)	Perfect Attendance: Perfect Attendance by definition and policy will remain - as perfect. Employees are required to have perfect attendance for all scheduled work, including overtime shifts. As in the past, employees on paid vacation, holidays, bereavement, and jury duty, as defined in the Labor Agreement, are not scheduled for work therefore, such absences do not impact Perfect Attendance.
Employees who punch out and are paid for Union Business will not be impacted for Perfect Attendance. In addition, employees assigned to the Capacity (WE-1) or working overtime on the Capacity (WE-1) shift, who attend the Monthly Saturday Union Membership Meetings and comply with the procedure in item #7 above will not be impacted for Perfect Attendance
Also, when the Company sends employees home due to lack of work, then Perfect Attendance is not impacted since the employee is not scheduled to work. However when, if an employee is given an option of leaving work (excused personal business) or working, Perfect Attendance is impacted if the employee opts to leave work.
Time away from scheduled work, as a result of work related injury, does impact perfect attendance.
13)	Employees are required to report all injuries to Supervision immediately, per the Labor Agreement. In case the Supervisor is out of the department the employee must report the injury to the nurse or first aid attendant immediately. Furthermore, outside medical treatment for industrial injuries must be authorized by the nurse or first aid attendant prior to going for outside treatment, except in cases of emergencies. Employees are to schedule medical treatment as the result of a work related injury/illness outside of their regular shift - per the Labor Agreement.
163
If follow-up outside treatment is required which cannot be scheduled outside the employee’s regular working hours, the employee will be paid up to two (2) hours at the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate for time lost from the regular working hours for the first such follow-up visit only. Overtime hours are not considered part of the employee’s regular working hours.
14)	Jury Duty: An employee with seniority will be excused from work on a workday when called to perform jury service in a court of record, provided prior notice is given to the Company.
Employees assigned to the second shift or Variable Output (V-2) Schedule may transfer to first shift or the Variable Output (V-1) Schedule for the week(s) of jury duty provided the employee requests the transfer to Human Resources at least one (1) calendar week before the jury duty is to be served.
Employees assigned to the Variable Output Schedule (V-2) have the option of remaining on V-2 and having up to the last three (3) hours of their shift excused personal business the night before jury duty is to be served upon pre-approval of Human Resources.
An employee with seniority who is excused from work for jury service and who furnishes the Company with a statement from the court with regard to jury pay received and time spent on jury service will be reimbursed by the Company as follows:
Monday through Friday Schedules:
1)	A first or third shift employee will receive eight (8) hours of pay at the employee’s regular straight time rate less the amount received as jury pay for each day called to serve as a juror, on their work day.
2)	A second shift employee will receive eight (8) hours pay at the employee’s regular straight time rate less the amount
164
received as jury pay for each day called to serve as a juror, on their work day, provided the employee is not excused from further service before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed.
In no event shall an employee be reimbursed for more than twenty-one (21) days jury service in any period of one year, commencing with the first day for which claim for reimbursement is made.
Variable Output and Capacity Schedules:
When an employee is called for service as a juror, on their work day, the employee will be paid the difference between the fee received for such service and the amount of earnings lost based on the employee’s current rate (lost by the employee for reasons of such service) up to a limit of the employee’s normally scheduled hours in a workday and forty (40) hours per week. An employee shall not be reimbursed for more than one hundred sixty-eight (168) hours of jury service in any one (1) year, commencing with the first day for which claim for reimbursement is made.
An employee assigned to the Variable V-2 shift (Monday through Thursday) or Capacity WE-2 shift (Friday only) will receive a full shifts pay at the employee’s regular straight time rate less the amount received as jury pay for each day called to serve as a juror, on their work day, provided the employee is not excused from further service before noon on the day for which reimbursement is claimed.
Jury duty is to be paid at the accelerated rate for employees on the Capacity Schedule.
An employee with seniority who is called for jury service, responds to the call and loses time from work, but is not accepted for jury service, will receive an amount equal to the
165
regular wages for such time lost on the employee’s regular shift, provided the employee returns to the job promptly.
The “Three Hour Rule” applies to jury duty.
All language per the Labor Agreement remains in effect.
Refer to your Human Resource Representative with questions.
