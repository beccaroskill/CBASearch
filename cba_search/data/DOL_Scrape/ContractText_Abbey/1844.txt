A bond can be required for up to three years in duration from the date the bond is first posted, or for a longer period as provided in Section 6 below.
In the event of multiple violations by the contractor, the contractor may satisfy the bonding requirements as to all violations by posting one or more bonds which, taken together, are in a sufficient amount and of a sufficient duration to satisfy the total bonding requirements established by the Joint Conference Board for the contractor.
The Joint Conference Board may adjust the amount of the bond(s) required, from time to time, as to each contractor that is required to post a bond based on that contractor’s payment, or failure to pay, further contributions to the trust funds as such become due.
SECTION 6.	Additional Bonding Requirements as to Contractors Posing Great Risk to the Trust Funds

In the event of such a waiver(s), the Joint Conference Board may require bond(s) of a greater amount and for a longer period.
SECTION 7.	Successor relationships
An additional bond may be required of a contractor not in violation of this agreement if that contractor becomes associated with a person or persons who have previously, or who currently are, acting as a principal or managing individual of another contractor that has an unpaid monetary obligation as a result of violations of this agreement or any of its predecessor agreements.

The Contractor shall be responsible for payment of wages from the reporting point, as ordered by the Contractor, to the jobsite and from job to job and return. When a contractor is forced, by condition of contract with an owner or general contractor, to have its employees report to a location for mandatory transportation into and out of a project, the Union agrees to negotiate with the Contractor specifically over appropriate travel time pay for the specific project and only after the Union receives such a request before the start of the Contractors portion of work on the project. It is agreed by the parties that these negotiations will be done on a project-by-project basis and the results will not be used as a basis for a Favored Nations grievance by the Association or Contractors signatory hereto. However, employees who voluntarily travel to a point for free transportation to the job site will not be compensated for the time en route and return. For offshore work, employees will receive travel pay at straight-time rates from point of embarkation to jobsite and from job-site to debarkation regardless of mode of transportation, which transportation shall be at Contractor’s expense. If no camp is furnished by Contractor, such transportation shall be furnished daily. Where air transportation is available to any of the off-shore islands, air transportation shall be furnished by the Contractor, and, in addition, if any work of construction at any of the islands or any combination of them shall exceed (5) working days, Monday through Friday, then employees shall also be furnished transportation at the conclusion of their shift of the fifth day of employment back to the point of embarkation for the weekend with transportation being furnished them prior to the commencement of the Monday morning shift from the point of embarkation back to the islands. It is understood that the basic mode of transportation shall be by air and only total unavailability of air transportation will permit any other mode of transportation. Any transportation required to or from the point of embarkation and any transportation in between shall be at the expense of the Contractor.
SECTION 16.	Incentive Pay
The parties signatory hereto recognize that the wall and ceiling industry is very competitive and that quality production is the competitive edge that contractors subject to this agreement enjoy over non-union contractors. The parties signatory hereby adopt an Incentive Pay Program to further their common goal of increasing quality production and thereby enhancing the continued work opportunities for both parties. By design, this Incentive Pay Program rewards employees covered by this Agreement for their success in achieving production levels that exceed preestablished targets as to a designated scope of work (hereinafter “incentive pay project”).
The amount of incentive pay paid to employees for an incentive pay project will be determined by comparing the targeted hours for the incentive pay project to the actual hours worked on the incentive pay project. A calculation will then be made by deducting the actual labor hours worked from the targeted hours for the incentive pay project and if the actual hours worked are less than the argeted hours for the incentive pay project then incentive pay will be paid by the contractor for the incentive payproject. Incentive pay is not, and in no way shall be construed as allowing for piece work, a substitute for the payment of wages and fringe benefit contributions for all hours worked by employees covered by this Agreement, or a way to circumvent the work jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
Employers may provide incentive pay to their employees covered by this Agreement pursuant to the following provisions:
21
A.	A Contractor offering incentive pay for a particular project shall notify the Union in
writing, within 2 weeks of the start of an incentive pay project. The notification will describe the project to be covered by the Incentive Pay Program and will include project name, project number and complete address of the project. The notification will identify the scope of work on the project that is subject to incentive pay and will provide, in numerical form, the targeted labor hours for the scope of work subject to incentive pay.
B.	The Contractor shall maintain labor records for the scope of work identified in its notification to the Union that are sufficient to show actual labor hours worked to accomplish the identified scope of work.
C.	Incentive pay shall be calculated by deducting the actual labor hours worked from
the targeted labor hours for the incentive pay project and the savings, if any, will be split between the Contractor and the employees covered by this Agreement, who performed the identified scope of work, on a no less than 65% to 35% basis respectively.
D.	When incentive pay has been earned, it shall be divided proportionally among the plaster crew that performed the work, based on the hours worked by each plasterer on the scope of work identified in the notification provided pursuant to sub-section A.
E.	The Contractor shall pay employees the wage and fringe benefit contribution rates specified in this Agreement for all hours worked on the project and any incentive pay earned shall not in any way reduce their wages and fringe benefit contributions otherwise earned.
C.	Incentive Pay shall be distributed by the Contractor no later than the actual collection
of retention money for a completed project. The Contractor will use its best effort to locate former employees who earned incentive pay from a particular project and shall solicit the Union's assistance if efforts to locate former employees are unsuccessful.
G.	Upon request of the Union, the Contractor shall make available for inspection, its records
that demonstrate actual labor hours worked on an incentive pay project for comparison to the targeted labor hours provided pursuant to sub-section A For purposes of ensuring compliance with this Section C only, the Contractor is obligated to maintain and allow inspection of records that are sufficient to show actual labor hours worked to accomplish the identified scope of work. Such records shall include, but not be limited to, any mathematical calculations made which demonstrate how the incentive pay was calculated and distributed by the Contractor, as-well-as the check numbers issued to each employee that received incentive pay. These records shall be maintained for no less than a four-year period.
H.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII that require the payment of fringe benefit
contributions on all hours worked or paid, no such contributions shall be required for Incentive Pay paid in compliance with the provisions of schedule A. Such Incentive Pay shall not be considered compensation for hours worked or paid.
I.	Any Contractor who violates the provisions of this Article VIII, by using the incentive
pay as a subterfuge for the payment of wages and fringe benefit contributions required by this Agreement or to circumvent the work jurisdiction covered by this Agreement, shall be liable to the Union in damages equivalent to the journeyman hourly wage rate and liable to the Trust Funds in
22
damages equivalent to the journeyman fringe benefit contribution rate, for each hour that was not worked by or properly paid to an employee covered by this Agreement as a result of the violation.
J.	Pursuant to Article XII, section 2, the Joint Conference Board shall review the
Incentive Pay Program periodically to determine the effectiveness of this Program on an industry wide basis and may suspend or eliminate this Program should they find Contractors are misusing this Program to the detriment of the industry and the integrity of this Agreement.

B.	In such case, the Joint Conference Board shall not review the final order or decision but shall consider only the matter of its exercising its powers under Article XII. The right to apply to the Joint Conference Board for enforcement of any such final order or decision shall be in addition to other enforcement procedures available under the Standards or under the State Apprenticeship Law.
SECTION 3.	Apprenticeship Standards
The Apprenticeship Standards as now adopted and as may be amended by the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee during the term of this Agreement shall be used to govern the Apprentices.
SECTION 4.	Ratio and Rotation of Apprentices
A.	For each three (3) Journeyman employed by a Contractor, he shall be required to employ one (1) Apprentice. On Fireproofing crews, the ratio shall be 1 to 1 on project with more than one pump. The number of Apprentices to be employed shall be determined by the Joint
23
Apprenticeship Committee based upon continued surveys to determine the working conditions and the availability of skilled craftsmen. Apprentices shall be hired and transferred in accordance with the Apprenticeship Agreement between the parties. One (1) Apprentice to each three (3) Journeyman is mandatory but extra Apprentices may be used in job crews.
B.	The rotation of Apprentices on all work shall be governed by the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee.

In the event any provision of this Agreement is thus held inoperative, the remaining portions of this Agreement shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, unless the parts so held inoperative are wholly inseparable from the remaining portion of this Agreement.

DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION

DETECTION
EXHIBIT “A”
DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND DETECTION
The parties recognize the problems, which drug abuse, have created in the construction industry and the need to develop drug abuse prevention programs. Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to maintain a drug free work environment, individual employers may require applicants or employees to undergo drug screening. The parties agree that if an individual Employer implements a screening program, Labor and Management have agreed upon the following items:
1.	It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer’s job premises or while working on any site in connection with work performed under the applicable agreement
2.	All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug screen at a facility that has been certified by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. The Employer agrees to pay each applicant or employee who takes and passes the drug screen test for all the time it takes to undergo the drug screen up to a maximum of two hours travel time plus lab time.
3.	Applicants and employees not passing the drug screen will be removed from the Employer’s payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug screen and the time stated in number 2 above.
4.	The employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing his/her job. At least two (2) persons, one of whom may be a Union employee, must make observation. This provision shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For employees who refuse to take a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph have been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been positive for an unlawful substance.
5.	An employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be tested for drugs where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the accident resulted from drug usage.
6.	There will be no random drug testing by the signatory employer.
7.	It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of prescribed medication impairs the employee’s ability to perform work, is a basis for removal.
8.	A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and a confirmation test. The initial test will be by Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test, a confirmation test must be utilized before action can be taken against the employee or applicant. The confirmation test will be by gas Chromatography -mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The cutoff levels for both the initial test and
confirmation test will be those established by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. Confirmed positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long term frozen storage for a minimum of one year. Handling and transportation of each sample must be documented through strict chain of custody procedures.
9.	Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a rehabilitation program at the employee’s expense. When such program has been successfully completed, the employer shall not discriminate in any way against the employee. If work for which the employee is qualified exists, he or she shall be reinstated.
10.	Any dispute, which arises under this drug policy, shall be submitted to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable agreement.
11.	In the event an individual employer is required, as a condition of contract award, to abide by the terms and conditions of a General Contractor or Building Owner’s drug policy, the Employer will notify the interested Unions in writing prior to implementing such policy and all employees of the employer shall be informed that the program they will be working under differs from the standard policy. Employees shall have the right to request that they be assigned to another project with no inferences being made.
12.	The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of and employee found in any law, rule, or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the parties, the remaining portions of the policy shall be unaffected and the parties shall enter negotiations to replace the affected provision.
13.	The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or liabilities that may arise solely out of the employer’s application of the substance Abuse Program.
14.	Any employer implementing a Drug Testing policy pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding will give the Unions fifteen (15) days advance notice before implementation.
EXHIBIT “A-1” ORAL DRUG TESTING
WHEREAS WWCCA and Local 200 recognize the importance of reasonable procedures to ensure that project sites are managed to protect worker's safety and to permit high quality work;
WHEREAS WWCCA and Local 200 have discussed procedures to implement these goals in relation to screening for prohibited drugs; and,
NOW, THEREFORE, WWCCA AND LOCAL 200 AGREE AS FOLLOWS:
DRUG TESTING
Employers may require employees subject to the collective bargaining agreement to take Avitar "ORALscreen" and/or Branan Medical Corporation "Oratect" oral fluid tests, which the undersigned agrees are effective and are low-cost tools for substance abuse screening for pre-employment testing and for testing employees during post accident investigations.
Testing procedures shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the product manufacturers' specifications. Any non-negative test will be treated as Inconclusive and the sale use of the test will be to require a further test at a certified facility as permitted by the collective bargaining agreement.
Employers may seek a urine test at a certified laboratory in accordance with the drug testing procedures set forth in the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement in addition to or in lieu of the test described above.
