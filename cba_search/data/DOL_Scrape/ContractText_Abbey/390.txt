3
Article 2
the agreements supplemental hereto.
Section 2.
Supplements to the National Master Agreement
There are three (3) divisions of the Automobile Transporting Industry covered by this Agreement and for this reason Supplemental Agreements are provided for each of the specific divisions controlled by this National Master Agreement.
All such Supplemental Agreements are subject to and controlled by the terms of this National Master Agreement and are referred to herein as "Supplemental Agreements."
All such Supplemental Agreements are to be clearly limited to the specific division and classification of work as enumerated or described in each individual Supplement.
Section 3.
Non-covered Units
This Agreement shall not be applicable to those operations of the Employer where the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a Union not signatory to this Agreement or to those employees who have not designated a signatory Union as their collective bargaining agent.
When a majority of the eligible employees in any appropriate bargaining unit (including office) performing work for a signatory Employer, execute a card authorizing a signatory Local Union to represent them as their collective bargaining agent at their terminal location, then, such employees shall automatically be covered by this Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Agreements. In such cases, the parties may by mutual agreement negotiate wages and conditions, subject to Joint Area Committee approval.
In the event the Employer and the Union are unable to mutually agree to the inclusion or exclusion of individuals within the appropriate bargaining unit with sole reference to the question of their supervisory, managerial, guard or confidential status, such issue shall be resolved by a special committee appointed by the appropriate Joint Area Committee. The Committee shall meet and resolve the dispute within fourteen (14) days. Subsequent to the resolution of this issue, the parties shall ascertain whether a majority of employees included within the appropriate bargaining unit have designated the Union as their collective bargaining agent and they shall be immediately covered by this Agreement and applicable Supplemental Area Agreements. In such cases, the parties may by mutual agreement negotiate wages and conditions subject to Joint Area approval. Failure to resolve such issues will constitute a disputed Rider, subject to the
4
Article 2
provisions of Section 7 of this Article.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the provisions of the National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Agreements shall be applied without evidence of Union representation of the employees involved to all subsequent additions to and extensions of current operations which adjoin and are utilized as a part of such current operations, newly established terminals and consolidations of terminals utilized as part of such current operations. The provisions of the applicable Work Preservation Article shall apply to this paragraph.
If an Employer refuses to recognize the Union as above set forth and the matter is submitted to the National Labor Relations Board or any mutually agreed upon process for determination, and such determination results in certification or recognition of the Union, all benefits of this Agreement and applicable Supplements shall be retroactive to the date of demand for recognition.
Section 4.
Single Bargaining Unit
The employees, Unions, Employers and Association, covered by this National Master Agreement and the various Supplements thereto, shall constitute one (1) bargaining unit It is understood that the printing of this National Master Agreement and the aforesaid Supplements in separate Agreements is for convenience only and is not intended to create separate bargaining units and contracts.
This National Master Agreement applies to Truckaway, Driveaway, Local and other classifications of employment authorized by the signatory Employers to be represented by the National Automobile Transporters Labor Division and to other Employers participating in national collective bargaining. The common problems and interests, with respect to basic terms and conditions of employment, have resulted in the creation of the National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement and the respective Supplemental Agreements. Accordingly, the Employers, parties to this Agreement, acknowledge that they constitute a single national multi-employer collective bargaining unit, composed of those Employers authorizing such Association to represent them for the purpose of collective bargaining, and such other individual employers which have, or may, become parties to this Agreement.

Riders may become effective on an interim basis by agreement between the Employer and the Local Union, provided that such Riders have been filed with the appropriate Area Joint Arbitration Committee within thirty (30) days of their implementation. Local Riders not submitted to the appropriate Area Joint Arbitration Committee for approval within this thirty (30) day period shall be considered null and void. If not approved or otherwise modified by the Area Joint Arbitration Committee, the Rider shall become null and void from the date of the Area Joint Arbitration Committee decision. Riders that affect the provisions of the National Master Agreement must be first approved by the National Joint Arbitration Committee.
(b)	Riders to this Agreement and to Supplements thereto between Local Unions and Employers that do not meet the standards set forth in the National Master Agreement and Supplements thereto, shall be continued pending negotiations for amendment of such Riders, which negotiations shall be conducted and concluded within one hundred eighty (180) days after execution of this Agreement.

6
Article 2
Section 6.
Approval of Local Riders

All negotiated Riders must become a part of the appropriate Area Supplemental Agreement and be attached thereto.
Section 7.

In the event that the Local Union and the Employer cannot agree to a Local Rider within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of execution of this Agreement, such Rider must be referred to the appropriate Area Joint Arbitration Committee, which Committee(s) shall hold hearings and attempt to adjust the dispute.
In the event the Area Joint Arbitration Committee cannot resolve the Local Rider dispute, such Committee may, by majority vote, submit the matter to the National Joint Arbitration Committee for determination.
If the Area Joint Arbitration Committee does not, by majority vote, submit such dispute to the National Joint Arbitration Committee, either party shall be permitted all lawful economic recourse in support of their demands. It is understood and agreed that in the event such Rider dispute is submitted to the National Joint Arbitration Committee and such Committee is deadlocked on the Rider dispute, then either party shall be entitled to all lawful economic recourse to support its position in this matter.
Section 8.
Agreements may be negotiated by the Employer and the Local Union which modify the wage rates, incentives and other provisions set forth in the National Master and the applicable Supplemental Agreement and Riders for employees working in loading and unloading classifications which will have the effect of permitting the Employer to acquire and retain yard work at plants, railheads, ports and other loading and unloading facilities, subject to appropriate Area Committee approval and the approval
7
Article 3

ARTICLE 3.
RECOGNITION, UNION SHOP AND CHECKOFF
Section 1.
Recognition
(a)	The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the Teamsters National Automobile Transporters Industry Negotiating Committee and the Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are the exclusive representatives of all employees in the classifications of work covered by this National Master Agreement, and Supplements thereto for the purpose of collective bargaining as provided by the National Labor Relations Act.
Subject to Article 2 (Scope of Agreement), this provision shall apply to all present and subsequently acquired operations and terminals of the Employer.
This provision shall not apply to wholly-owned and wholly independently operated subsidiaries which are not under contract with Local IBT Unions. "Wholly independently: operated" means, among other things, that there shall be no interchange of freight, equipment or personnel, or common use, in whole or in part, of equipment, terminals, property, personnel or Interstate Commerce Commission (I.C.C.) rights.
Union Membership
(b)	All present employees who are members of the Local Union on the effective date of this subsection or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, shall remain members of the Local Union in good standing as a condition of employment. All present employees who are not members of the Local Union and all employees who are hired hereafter shall become and remain members in good standing of the Local Union as a condition of employment on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of their employment or on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the effective date of this subsection or the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. Within seven (7) days from the date of hiring of a new employee, the Employer will give to the Union, in writing, the following information:
(1)	The name, home address and social security number of the newly hired employee; and
(2)	The date the employee was hired.
8
Article 3
An employee who has failed to acquire or thereafter maintain membership in the Union, as herein provided, shall be terminated seventy-two (72) hours after his Employer has received written notice from an authorized representative of the Local Union, certifying that membership has been, and is continuing to be, offered to such employee on the same basis as all other members and, further, that the employee has had notice and opportunity to make all dues payments. This provision shall be made and become effective as of such time it may be made and become effective under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, but not retroactively.
Additional Employees
(c)	When the Employer needs additional employees, it shall give the Local Union equal opportunity with all other sources to provide suitable applicants, but the Employer shall not be required to hire those referred by the Local Union.
The Local Union and the Employer agree to prepare a list of automobile transporter employees within their area who are currently on layoff status. The Employer agrees to give all persons on the list a good faith opportunity for employment before hiring new employees to perform work covered by this Agreement. Separate lists shall be prepared for employees in separate classifications such as driver, yard, office and garage.
(d)	No provision of this Article shall apply in any state to the extent that it may be prohibited by state law. If under applicable state law additional requirements must be met before any such provision may become effective, such additional requirements shall be met first.
Agency Shop Clause
(e)	If any agency shop clause is permissible in any state where the provisions of this Article relating to the union shop cannot apply, the following agency clause shall prevail:
(1)	Membership in the Union is not compulsory. Employees have the right to join, not join, maintain or drop their membership in the Union, as they see fit. Neither party shall exert any pressure on or discriminate against any employee regarding such matters;
(2)	Membership in the Union is separate, apart and distinct from the assumption by one of one's equal obligation to the extent that one receives equal benefits. The Union is required under this Agreement to represent all of the employees in the bargaining unit fairly and equally without regard to whether or not an employee is a member of the Union. The terms of this Agreement have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit and not only for members in the Union, and this
9
Article 3
Agreement has been executed by the Employer after it has satisfied itself that the Union is the choice of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. Accordingly, it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit pay his own way and assume his fair share of the obligation along with the grant of equal benefit contained in this Agreement;
(3)	In accordance with the policy set forth under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this Section, all employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, pay to the Union, the employee's exclusive collective bargaining representative, an amount of money equal to that paid by other employees in the bargaining unit who are members of the Union, which shall be limited to an amount of money equal to the Union's regular and usual initiation fees, and its regular and usual dues. For present employees, such payments shall commence thirty-one (31) days following the effective date or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, and for new employees, the . payment shall start thirty-one (31) days following the date of employment.
(f)	If any provision of this Article is invalid under federal law or the law of any state wherein this Agreement is executed, such provision shall be modified to comply with the requirements of federal or state law or shall be renegotiated for the purpose of adequate replacement. If such negotiations shall not result in mutually satisfactory agreement, either party shall be permitted all legal or economic recourse.
(g)	In those instances where subsection (b) hereof may not be validly applied, the Employer agrees to recommend to all employees that they become members of the Local Union and maintain such membership during the life of this Agreement, to refer new employees to the Local Union representative, and to recommend to delinquent members that they pay their dues since they are receiving the benefits of this Agreement.
(h)	To the extent such amendments may become permissible under applicable federal and state law during the life of this Agreement as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial determination, all of the provisions of this Article shall be automatically amended to embody the greater union security provisions contained in the 1947-1952 National Truckaway Agreement, or to apply or become effective in situations not now permitted by law.
(i)	Supervisory or non-unit personnel shall not perform work which is recognized by the Union and the Employer as the work of employees covered by this Agreement, except when mutually agreed by the Union and the Employer and except in accordance with Article 8 (Protection of Rights), Section 3.

11
Article 3
i.	Effective December 18, 1995, new employees who successfully complete the probationary period shall be assigned a seniority date commencing with their date of hire.

b.	In addition, drivers off work longer than six (6) months due to layoff, disability, compensable injury or leave of absence may be required to enter, at the Employer's option, a retraining program to ensure an awareness of the current loading and unloading policies/procedures of the Employer. The driver shall be paid at fifty percent (50%) of the regular hourly rate existing at that time until completion of the retraining program, which shall not exceed three (3) days at eight (8) hours per day in duration.
c.	Drivers shall not perform revenue-producing work during the retraining program.
(k)	Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed so as to require the Employer to violate any applicable law.
Section 2.
Probationary Employees
A probationary employee shall work under the provisions of this Agreement but shall be employed only on a thirty (30)-day trial basis, during which period the employee may be terminated without further recourse; provided, however, that the Employer may not terminate or discipline for the purpose of evading this Agreement or discriminating
12
Article 3
against Union members. The Union and the Employer may agree to extend the probationary period for no more than thirty (30) days but the probationary employee must agree to such extension in writing. The accrual of seniority for probationary employees shall be determined consistent with Article 3, Section 1 (j)(1), if applicable, and provided in the applicable Supplemental Agreement except as it has been otherwise applied by the parties.
In case of discipline within the thirty (30)-day trial period, the Employer shall notify the Local Union, in writing, of such discipline.
Section 3.
Employment Agency Fees

Where laws require written authorization by the employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required.
The Employer will recognize authorization for deduction from wages, if in compliance with state law, to be transmitted to the Union or to such other organizations as the Union may request, if mutually agreed. No such authorization shall be recognized if in violation of state or federal law.

The Employer shall transmit to DRIVE National Headquarters on a monthly basis, in one (1) check, the total amount deducted along with the name of each employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the employee's social security number and the amount deducted from that employee’s paycheck. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters shall reimburse the Employer annually for the Employer’s actual cost for the expenses incurred in administering the weekly payroll deduction plan.
In the event that an Employer has been determined to be in violation of this Article by the decision of an appropriate Joint Arbitration Committee, and if such Employer subsequently is in violation thereof after receipt of seventy-two (72) hours’ written notice of specific delinquencies, the Local Union may strike to enforce this Article.

Article 4
ARTICLE 4. STEWARDS
There shall be at least one Steward and one designated alternate at each terminal. The Employer shall provide a locking file cabinet for the Steward to conduct Union business on the Employer’s premises. The Union shall have sole possession of the key. At no time shall any steward be discriminated against for Union activities. Before discharging a steward, except in cases of proven dishonesty, drunkenness, or being under the influence of a habit forming controlled substance, the Employer shall take the matter up with the Union.
The Employer recognizes the right of the Union to designate a steward and an alternate from the Employer's active work list. The authority of the steward and alternate so designated by the Union shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the following duties and activities:	o
(a)	The investigation and presentation of grievances with the Employer or the designated Employer representative in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement;
(b)	The collection of dues when authorized by appropriate Local Union action; and,
(c)	The transmission of such messages and information, which shall originate with, and are authorized by the Local Union or its officers, provided such messages and information:

(2)	if not reduced to writing, are of a routine nature and do not involve work stoppages, slowdowns, refusal to handle goods, or any other interference with the Employer's business.
(d)	The job steward, or his designated alternate, shall be permitted reasonable time-off without pay to attend Union meetings called by the Local Union. The Employer shall be given twenty-four (24) hours prior notice by the Local Union.

If a Union requests a copy of waiver, the Employer shall promptly furnish it.
The steward and the alternate have no authority to take strike action, or any other action interrupting the Employer's business, except as authorized by official action of the Union. The Employer recognizes these limitations upon the authority of the steward and the alternate, and shall not hold the Union liable for any unauthorized acts. The Employer in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to impose proper discipline, including discharge, in the event the steward or designated alternate has taken unauthorized strike action, slowdown or work stoppage in violation of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 5.
SENIORITY
Section 1.
Definition of Terms
"Company seniority" is a term that is applied to an employee's date of hire by the Employer.
"Terminal seniority" is a term that is applied to the employee's most recent date of employment at a specific terminal.
"Dovetail seniority" is a term that is applied when two (2) or more seniority lists are merged or combined into a single seniority list which recognizes the terminal seniority date of each employee. The list is arranged by terminal seniority date with the most senior employee at the top.
"Endtail seniority" is a term that is applied when an employee or group of employees are placed at the bottom of a terminal seniority list although they retain their company seniority date for fringe benefits.
"Terminal" is a term that is applied to any facility of an Employer to which employees are assigned to work whether called a branch, terminal, division or operation.
"Fringe Benefits", as used in this Article, is a term that shall apply to vacation accrual only.
16
Article 5
Section 2.
Terminal seniority rights for all employees covered by this Agreement shall prevail unless the Supplements or other provisions of this Agreement provide specifically to the contrary. Because of the nature of the transportation industry in which employees transfer during the term of their employment in the industry from one location to another as the flow of business requires, there are two (2) levels of seniority recognized by this Agreement. These levels are known as "company seniority" and "terminal seniority" as defined in Section 1.
The extent to which seniority shall be applied and accrued as well as the methods and procedures of such application shall be clearly set forth, in writing, in this Agreement and in the Supplemental Agreements, including approved Local Riders.
Section 3.
(a)	Seniority, including for fringe benefits, shall only be broken by discharge, voluntary quit, more than a seven (7)-year layoff, except as otherwise provided herein or for such greater period than seven (7) years as the appropriate Joint Arbitration Committee may direct during the seventh (7th) year. This provision shall be uniformly applied throughout all Supplemental Agreements to the National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement.
(b)	Leave of Absence for Union Activities
Employees elected or appointed to full-time Union positions shall maintain and accumulate their seniority with the Employer so long as the employee maintains such full-time position with the Union. Such employee shall be granted a leave of absence without pay and be guaranteed re-employment at the end of such period with the same seniority as though the employee had been continuously employed, provided that the employee is physically qualified to perform the duties which he/she previously performed for the Employer.
Section 4.
Seniority lists are dovetailed in the following circumstances:
(a)	When the same Employer merges two (2) or more terminals;
(b)	When commonly owned separate Employers merge two (2) or more terminals;
17
Article 5
(c)	When two (2) or more Employers share traffic from the same shipper at the same location and the traffic of one (1) of the Employers is canceled by the shipper and it is assigned to one (1) of the remaining Employers, whether or not there is a financial transaction of any kind involving the affected Employers. At port facilities, the canceled Employer must have regularly handled the traffic for a period of at least six (6) months for this provision to apply.
(d)	When two (2) or more terminals are merged after an Employer enters into a major financial transaction such as a merger, purchase, acquisition, sale or similar transaction with another Employer. It is immaterial whether the transaction involved merely the purchase of stock of one (1) corporation by another, with two (2) separate corporations continuing in existence.
(e)	The above rules shall not apply to the acquisition of a wholly separate and independent company, the operations of which are conducted separately from other operations covered by this Agreement.
Section 5.
(a)	In the event a shipper cancels its business relationship with an Employer at a location and transfers all or part of that business to another Employer which is not servicing that shipper at that location, whether or not there is a financial transaction of any kind involving the affected Employers, both the active and the laid-off employees of the canceled Employer at that terminal shall be placed on a master seniority list. Those employees who accept employment with the successor employer shall be given a new company seniority date. This new company seniority date shall be the date used for work opportunities at any of the successor Employer's locations except the employee’s original terminal. However, the employee shall retain his prior company seniority date for fringe benefits. At port facilities the canceled Employer must have regularly handled the business for a period of more than six (6) months.
(b)	Employees of the canceled Employer who remain on layoff after all of the seniority rights contained in Sections 4 and 5(a) have been exercised shall remain on layoff status at their home terminal with recall rights unimpaired. They shall be afforded additional help opportunities at other locations by both Employers. For work opportunities at its other locations the successor Employer must exhaust its obligations to its existing laid-off employees before offering opportunities to employees of the canceled Employer. If an employee accepts employment under this subsection with the successor Employer, a new company seniority date shall be given and there shall be no further obligation of the canceled Employer. However, the employee shall retain his prior company seniority date for fringe benefits. If the employee selects employment at another location of the canceled Employer, there shall be no further obligation of the
18
Article 5
successor employer to that employee.
Section 6.
Sections 1 through 5 restate, in part, the Agreement and practices developed under Article 5, Section 1 of the 1999-2003 contract and previous contracts. This restatement is not to be construed as changing retroactively the established seniority lists or other terms and conditions of employment in existing terminals.
Section 7.
New Terminals, etc.
(a)	Opening of Terminal
(1)	When a new terminal is opened, the Employer shall offer the opportunity to transfer to regular positions in the new terminal in the order of their company or classification seniority, to employees in the terminals which are affected in whole or in part by the opening of the new terminal.
This provision is not intended to apply to replacement of an existing terminal or where a new terminal is opened in a locality where there is an existing terminal. In these latter situations, laid-off or extra employees in the existing terminal shall have first (1st) opportunity for employment at the new terminal in accordance with their seniority. If all regular full-time positions are not filled in this manner, then the provisions of the above paragraph shall apply.
(2)	The transferred employees, other than those referred to in the exceptions to Section 7(a)(1) above shall, for a period of thirty (30) days following the transfer, have an unqualified right to return to their old terminal if it is still in existence and carry with them their seniority at that old terminal. Employees who avail themselves of the transfer privileges because they are on layoff at their original terminal may exercise their seniority rights if work becomes available at the original terminal during the seven (7)-year layoff period allowed them at their original terminal. Transferred employees shall have, after thirty (30) days, the same privileges with respect to subsequent transfers as set forth in paragraph (1) above.
(3)	Where a new terminal is opened by an Employer which does not affect, in whole or in part, any other terminal of any Employer party to this Agreement, the Employer shall afford all of its drivers an opportunity to transfer to the new operation with full seniority for all purposes. In the event an employee elects to transfer pursuant to this provision, there shall be no trial period and such transfer is final,
19
Article 5
except for return rights provided under Section 7(b)(1) of this Article. In the event the Employer requires additional employees for the new terminal, it shall hire new employees in accordance with Article 3, Section 1(c) of this Agreement. When new terminals are opened, the drivers who signed the list for the new terminal will be offered work opportunities at that terminal before any new-hires from the street are added to the seniority list.
(b)	Closing of Terminals
(1)	When a terminal is closed and the work of the terminal is eliminated, an employee who was formerly employed at another terminal shall have the right to transfer back to such former terminal and exercise seniority based on the date of hire at the terminal into which the employee is transferring, provided the employee has not been away from such original terminal for more than three (3) years.
(2)	When a terminal is closed or partially closed and the work of the terminal is transferred to another terminal of the same Employer, a sufficient number of employees necessary to perform the transferred work shall have the right to transfer to the terminal into which the work was transferred, if regular work is available. Such employees shall exercise terminal seniority and maintain company seniority for fringe benefit purposes.
(3)	The above subsection (b) (2) shall not be applicable in instances when the manufacturer moves a model line from a plant located at one terminal to a plant located at another terminal of the Employer.
(c)	In all transfers referred to in subsections (a) and (b) above, the employee must be qualified to perform the job by experience in the classification. If a driver test is required, such test shall be given by a qualified driver-supervisor or driver.
Section 8.
The parties acknowledge that the above rules are intended solely as general standards and further agree that many factual situations may be presented to the Committee which necessitate modification or amendment in the application of these rules to specific factual cases and as set forth in the definition contained in Section 1. Accordingly, the Employers and the Union acknowledge that questions involving the accrual, interpretation or application of seniority rights may arise which require different treatment. It is understood that the Employers, the Union and the National or Area Joint Arbitration Committees may mutually agree to such disposition of questions of seniority which, in their judgment, is appropriate under the circumstances. The
20
Article 5
National and Area Joint Arbitration Committees shall have the authority to determine the establishment and application of seniority in all situations presented to them and the seniority decisions of the Joint Arbitration Committees shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the employees.
Section 9.
Pension and health & welfare contributions paid on behalf of an employee redomiciled as the result of a decision rendered by a Joint Arbitration Committee under the authority of this Article, shall continue to be paid to the appropriate funds to which such contributions were made prior to the employee’s change of domicile, and the decisions of the Joint Arbitration Committees shall so specify. In addition, in the event an employee does voluntarily transfer to another terminal pursuant to the terms of the Additional Help provisions outlined in the Supplemental Agreements, the pension and health & welfare contributions paid on behalf of such employee shall continue to be paid to the appropriate fund that such contributions were made prior to the transfer until the employee relinquishes seniority at the original terminal or nine (9) months whichever is sooner. This Section shall not apply to any other circumstances wherein employees who voluntarily change domiciles under the provisions of Article 3, Section 1(c) (Additional Employees) or Article 5, Section 7 (New Terminals) herein or who otherwise voluntarily change domiciles under the applicable provisions of the respective Area Supplemental Agreements. Any disputes concerning the appropriate fund for an Employer's contribution on behalf of a redomiciled employee, pursuant to a Joint Arbitration Committee decision or in event of an Additional Help transfer specified above shall be referred to the National Joint Arbitration Committee. The decision of the National Joint Arbitration Committee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be final and binding on all affected parties, including the Trust Funds.
Section 10.
Notice of Changes Which Affect Seniority
When a change is made by an Employer which affects the seniority rights of its employees as provided in this Article, the Employer shall give the affected Local Union(s) reasonable notice in advance of the change. The Employer and Local Union(s) shall cooperate in assisting the appropriate Area Joint Arbitration Committee or National Committee in determining the seniority of the employees affected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Such determination shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Local Union(s) and the employees.
21
Article 6
Section 11.
(a)	The Employer shall not require employees who exercise rights under Article 5, Section 4,5,7, and 8 transfers, except for transfers pursuant to Section 7 (a) (3) new terminal and additional help rights under any Supplement, to purchase any equipment as a condition of continued employment.
(b)	The Employer shall file with the Standing Seniority Committee a request for staffing at any terminal, operating point or other facility at which the Employer has no existing facility and is assigned off rail traffic after June 1, 1999 and retains such traffic for six (6) months.
Section 12.
The provisions set forth in Sections 1 through 11 above shall be applicable to an employer signatory to an agreement with reciprocal seniority transfer rights. Any and all matters pertaining to transfer rights, if any, shall be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Joint Standing Seniority Committee in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 6.
Section 1.
Maintenance of Standards
(a)	The Employer agrees, subject to the following provisions, that all conditions of employment relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials and general working conditions shall be maintained at not less than the minimum standards in effect at the time of the signing of this Agreement, and the conditions of employment shall be improved whenever specific provisions for improvement are made elsewhere in this Agreement; providing, however, that such past practice shall be limited to those in effect during the term of the immediately expired contract period. It is further agreed that in the event a dispute arises concerning any such past practice, the Local Union must prove that such past practice was in effect.
Oral testimony by an employee claiming a past practice, not accompanied by substantiating proofs or records existing at the time of the alleged past practice, shall not be considered as presumptive proof that such past practice existed.
22
Article 6
(b)	Individual Employers may, during the life of this Agreement, file with the appropriate Area Joint Arbitration Committee a request for review of those individual standards and conditions claimed or practiced under this Article, which exceed the provisions of this Agreement, Supplemental Agreements and approved Riders. The Area Joint Arbitration Committee shall develop a procedure to review the filing including the right to appoint a subcommittee to make recommendations. The Committee shall make every effort to adjust the matter. If the Committee reaches agreement concerning the disposition of the individual standards or conditions, the decision of the Committee shall be final and binding. In the event of deadlock, the submitted conditions shall be referred to the National Joint Arbitration Committee for resolution.
(c)	It is agreed that the provisions of this Article shall not apply to inadvertent or bona fide errors made by the Employer or the Local Union in applying the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such bona fide errors may be corrected at any time.
Section 2.
Extra-contract Agreements
The Employer agrees not to enter into any agreement or contract with its employees, individually or collectively, which in any way conflicts with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, except as provided in any Section of this Agreement which provides for economic relief. Any such agreement shall be null and void.
Section 3.
Workweek Reduction
It is understood and agreed that should it subsequently be determined that any employees come under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any similar legislation, or that the maximum workweek is reduced by the Interstate Commerce Commission or Department of Transportation as to such employees, any provisions of this Agreement that do not comply with the requirements of said statutes or regulations are to be changed so that there is no violation of the statutes or regulations. If such changes result in substantial penalties, either to the employees or to the Employers, a written notice shall be sent by either party requesting negotiations to change such provision or provisions as are affected. Thereafter, the National Joint Arbitration Committee shall enter into immediate negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory solution. In the event that the National Joint Arbitration Committee cannot agree on a solution to any problem arising from this Section within sixty (60) days after receipt of the stated written notice, either party shall be allowed lawful economic recourse to support their request for revisions.
23
Article 6
Section 4.
It is mutually agreed that, should the automobile hauling division of the trucking industry, by the truckaway and/or driveaway method, change the nature of its operations by enlarging the commodities hauled or, because of an existing emergency, haul commodities not within the present general operating authority of automobile haulers as issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, then in such case this Agreement may be reopened for consideration only for the purpose of reconsidering the wage scale in the transporting of such new or special commodities not within the purview of permits and certificates in existence at the time of the signing of this Agreement. In the event agreement cannot be reached within sixty (60) days after date such changed operations are put into effect, the matter shall be submitted to the National Joint Arbitration Committee for final disposition. Rates agreed upon or awarded shall be effective as of the date the changed operations were put into effect.

The Local Union may from time to time amend its listing of authorized representatives by certified mail. The Local Union shall not authorize any work stoppage, slowdown, walkout or cessation of work in violation of this Agreement. It is further agreed that in all cases of an unauthorized strike, slowdown, walkout or any unauthorized cessation of work which is in violation of this Agreement, the Union shall not be liable for damages resulting from such unauthorized acts of its members.

Section 4.
Grievance Procedure
The following procedure shall be used in processing all grievances. This Section contains a special provision for processing alleged pay shortages and violations of the dispatch procedure. There are separate provisions in the Supplemental Agreements for processing grievances involving suspensions or discharges.
The provisions of subpart (b) below shall not be applicable at any terminals covered by the Western Area Supplemental Agreement. The provisions of subpart (b) below shall not be applicable at a terminal covered by the CentraLSouthern Supplemental Agreement unless the Employer and the Local Union agree in writing to make it applicable.
Step 1.
(a)	All grievances shall first be taken up and discussed by the employee and the Employer.
28
Article 7
(b)	Claims Involving Pay Shortages and Violations of Dispatch Procedure
Any employee who claims any pay shortage, including a claimed violation of the dispatch procedure, shall file a request for a wage review with the Employer. This request must be filed in writing within ten (10) days excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays after receipt of the paycheck by the employee. Multiple copies of a request for wage review in a form set forth below shall be made available by the Employer for that purpose. The Employer shall meet with the employee to discuss the claim as soon as possible but no later than ten (10) days following receipt of such request excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays at which time the Employer shall make a written reply to the claim. If the claim is not adjusted satisfactorily, and if the employee wishes to file a written grievance, such grievance shall be filed within ten (10) days excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays after the written denial of the claim. These time limits replace other time limits expressed in this Agreement and are firm. Failure to file or respond on time will result in a default against the party failing to comply. Defaults establish no precedent on the merits of the claim.
After any grievance is reduced to writing, the Employer representative will make available for inspection by the business agent and/or the steward, time sheets and all such other records as are pertinent to the handling of the specific dispute or grievance. This does not preclude or prevent an oral attempt on the part of the business agent or the steward to settle such dispute or grievance before a request is made for such records. If the grievance is not settled it shall be referred to Step 4.

If no settlement is reached in Step 2, the grievance shall be put in writing and presented to the Employer no later than thirty (30) days after the dispute or grievance arises, except as may be otherwise provided in a Supplemental Agreement or Section 4 of this Article. The Employer must reply to the written grievance in writing to the Local Union within fourteen (14) days after receipt of the written grievance.
After any grievance is reduced to writing, the Employer representative will make available for inspection by the business agent and/or steward, time sheets and all such other records as are pertinent to the handling of the specific dispute or grievance. This does not preclude or prevent an oral attempt on the part of the business agent or the steward to settle such dispute or grievance before a request is made for such records.
Step 4.
The Local Union and the Employer shall conduct a local-level hearing after the foregoing steps have been exhausted. Scheduling of the local-level hearing will be by mutual agreement but it is to take place as soon as possible but no later than thirty (30) days after the Employer's written response to the grievance to discuss and attempt to resolve the grievance. If the grievance is not resolved at the local-level hearing, either party has the right to file the grievance with the appropriate Joint Arbitration Committee within fifteen (15) days after the local-level hearing.

Article 7
During the local-level hearing and prior to docketing the grievance with the Joint Arbitration Committee, the business agent and Employer representative shall designate in writing that the grievance has been examined by both parties. This document must be attached to the grievance if it is filed with the Joint Arbitration Committee. Failure of the Local Union and the Employer to comply with this requirement shall preclude the docketing of the grievance and it shall be returned to the parties to comply with this requirement.
Any party to a grievance who intends to use a decision of any Joint Arbitration Committee as precedent must present a copy of the decision to the other party as soon as possible prior to the presentation of the case to the Committee.

ARTICLES.
PROTECTION OF RIGHTS
Section 1.
Picket Line
It shall not be a violation of this Agreement, and it shall not be cause for discharge, disciplinary action or permanent replacement, in the event an employee refuses to enter upon any property involved in a primary labor dispute, or refuses to go through or work beyond any primary picket line, including the primary picket line of Unions party to
40
Article 8
this Agreement, and including primary picket lines at the Employer’s place of business.
Section 2.
Struck Goods
It shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be cause for discharge, disciplinary action or permanent replacement, if any employee refuses to perform any service which the Employer undertakes to perform as an ally of an Employer or person whose employees are on strike, and which service, but for such strikes, would be performed by the employees of the Employer or person on strike.
Section 3.
Subject to Article 33 - Work Preservation, or the appropriate work preservation or subcontracting provisions of the Area Supplements, the Employer agrees that it will not cease or refrain from handling, using, transporting or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other Employer or cease doing business with any other person, or fail in any obligation imposed by the Motor Carriers' Act or other applicable law, as a result of individual employees exercising their rights under this Agreement or under law, but the Employer shall, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, when necessary continue doing such business by other employees.
Section 4.
The layover provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement shall apply when the Employer knowingly dispatches a road driver to a terminal or dealer at which a primary picket line has been posted as a result of the exhaustion of the grievance procedure, or after proper notification of a picket line permitted by the collective bargaining agreement, or economic strikes occurring after the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement or to achieve a collective bargaining agreement.
Section 5.
Grievances
Within five (5) working days of filing a grievance claiming violation of this Article, the grievance shall be submitted directly to the National Joint Arbitration Committee without taking any intermediate steps, any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding.
41
Article 9
ARTICLE 9. BONDS
Should the Employer require any employee to give bond, cash bond shall not be compulsory, and any premium involved shall be paid by the Employer. The primary obligation to procure the bond shall be on the Employer. If the Employer cannot arrange for a bond within ninety (90) days, the Employer must so notify the employee in writing. Failure to so notify shall relieve the employee of the bonding requirement. If proper notice is given, the employee shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date of such notice to make personal bonding arrangements, standard premiums only on said bond to be paid by the Employer. A standard premium shall be that premium paid by the Employer for bonds applicable to all other of its employees in similar classifications. Any excess premium is to be paid by the employee. Cancellation of a bond after once issued shall not be cause for discharge, unless the bond is canceled for cause which occurs during working hours or due to the employee having given a fraudulent statement in obtaining said bond.
ARTICLE 10. COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND PAID LEAVE
Section 1.
Compensation Claims
At the time an injury report is turned in, the Employer shall provide the injured employee with an information sheet briefly outlining the procedure for submitting a worker’s compensation claim to include the name, address and phone number of the Employer’s worker's compensation representative and other pertinent information relative to the claim.
Section 2.
Day of Injury
(a)	An employee who is injured on the job and is sent home or to a hospital, or who must obtain medical attention, shall receive pay at the applicable hourly rate for the balance of the employee’s regular shift on that day. An employee who has returned to regular duties after sustaining a compensable injury, and who is required by the workers' compensation doctor to receive additional medical treatment during regularly scheduled working hours, shall receive the regular hourly rate of pay for such time.
42
Article 10
(b)	In the event that an employee sustains an occupational illness or injury while on a run away from the home terminal, the Employer shall provide transportation by bus, train, plane or automobile to the home terminal if and when directed by a doctor. The Employer agrees to provide any employee injured locally appropriate transportation, including an ambulance when the nature of the injury so warrants, at the time of injury from the job to the medical facility and return to the job, or to the .employee's home locally if required.
(c)	The employee must by the end of the shift or in the case of a driver who is on a trip, upon return to the home terminal or prior to the next dispatch if appropriate personnel are not available on the return, notify the Employer of an injury sustained and complete the required forms.
Section 3.
Modified Work
(a)	The Employer may establish a modified work program designed to provide temporary opportunity to those employees who are unable to perform their normal work assignments due to a disabling on-the-job injury. Recognizing that a transitional return-to-work program offering both physical and mental therapeutic benefits will accelerate the rehabilitative process of an injured employee, modified work programs are intended to enhance worker’s compensation benefits and are not to be utilized as a method to take advantage of an employee who has sustained an industrial injury.
(b)	Modified work programs in existence on the date of ratification, which exceed the provisions of this section, shall remain in effect. Local Unions wishing to opt-out of the Modified Work program outlined in this section may do so, in writing, within ninety (90) days of ratification of this Agreement. The Employer may not implement this modified work program unless agreed to by the Local Union. When implemented it shall be in strict compliance with applicable federal and state worker's compensation statutes. Acceptance of modified work shall be on a voluntary basis at the option of the injured employee. However, refusal to accept modified work by an employee, otherwise entitled to worker's compensation benefits, may result in a loss or reduction of such benefits as specifically provided by the provisions of applicable federal or state worker's compensation statutes. Employees who accept modified work shall continue to be eligible to receive "temporary partial" worker’s compensation benefits as well as all other entitlements as provided by applicable federal or state worker's compensation statutes.
43
Article 10
(c)	At facilities where the Employer has a modified work program in place, temporary modified assignments shall be offered in seniority order to those regular full time employees who are temporarily disabled due to a compensable worker's compensation injury and who have received a detailed medical release from the attending physician clearly setting forth the limitations under which the employee may perform such modified assignments. Once a modified work assignment is made and another person is injured, the second person must wait until a modified work opening occurs, regardless of seniority. All modified work assignments must be made in strict compliance with the physical restrictions as outlined by the attending physician. All modified work program candidates must be released for eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week. The Employer, at its option, may make a modified work offer of less than eight (8) hours per day where such work is expected to accelerate the rehabilitative process and the attending physician recommends that the employee works back to regular status or up to eight (8) hours per day by progressively increasing daily hours. A copy of any release for modified work must be given to the employee before the modified work assignment begins.
It is understood and agreed those employees who, consistent with professional medical evaluations and opinion, may never be expected to receive an unrestricted medical release, shall not be eligible to participate in a modified work program.
In the event of a dispute related to conflicting medical opinion, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to established worker's compensation law and/or the method of 'resolving such matters as outlined in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. In the absence of a provision in the Supplemental Agreement, the following shall apply:
When there is a dispute between two (2) physicians concerning the release of an employee for modified work, such two (2) physicians shall immediately select a third (3rd) neutral physician within seven (7) days, whose opinion shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the employee. The expense of the third (3rd) physician shall be equally divided between the Employer and the Union. Disputes concerning the selection of the neutral physician or back wages shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
For locations where the Employer intends to implement a modified work program or has a modified work program in place, the Local Union shall be provided with a copy of the current form(s) being used for employee evaluation for release and general job descriptions. This information shall be general in nature, not employee specific.
When a modified work assignment is made, the employee shall be provided with the hours and days he/she is scheduled to work as well as the nature of the work to be performed in writing. A copy of this notice shall also be submitted to the Local Union.
44
Article 10
(d)	Modified work shall be restricted to the type of work that is not expected to result in a re-injury and which can be performed within the medical limitations set forth by the attending physician. In the event the employee, in his/her judgment, is physically unable to perform the modified work assigned, he/she shall be either reassigned modified work within his/her physical capabilities or returned to full "temporary total" worker's compensation benefits. In the event a third (3rd);party insurance carrier refuses to reinstate such employee to full temporary total disability benefits, the Employer shall be required to pay the difference between the amount of the benefit paid by such third (3rd) party insurer and full total temporary disability benefits. Determination of physical capabilities shall be based on the attending physician's medical evaluation. Under no conditions will the injured employee be required to perform work at that location subject to the terms and conditions of the National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement or its Area Supplemental Agreements. Prior to acceptance of modified work, the affected employee shall be furnished a written job description of the type of work to be performed.
(e)	The modified workday and workweek shall be established by the Employer within the limitations set forth by the attending physician. However, the workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours, inclusive of coffee breaks where applicable and exclusive of a one-half (%) hour meal period and the workweek shall not exceed forty (40) hours, Monday through Friday, or Tuesday through Saturday, unless the nature of the modified work assignment requires a scheduled workweek to include Sunday. Whenever possible, the Employer will schedule modified work during daylight hours, Monday through Friday, or during the same general working hours and on the same workweek that the employee enjoyed before he/she became injured. In the case of an employee whose workdays and/or hours routinely varied, the Employer will schedule the employee based on the availability of the modified assignment being offered. Any alleged abuse of the assignment of workdays and work hours shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
(f)	Modified work time shall be considered as time worked when necessary to satisfy vacation and sick leave eligibility requirements as set forth in the National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement and/or its applicable Area Supplemental Agreements. In addition to earned vacation pay as set forth in the applicable Area Supplemental Agreements, employees accepting modified work shall receive prorated vacation pay for modified work performed based on the weekly average modified work pay. The only time modified work is used in prorating vacation is when the employee did not qualify under the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
Holiday pay shall first be paid in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement as it relates to on-the-job injuries. Once such contractual provisions have been satisfied, holidays will be paid at the modified work rate which is
45
Article 10
the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit.
Sick and funeral leave taken while an employee is performing modified work will be paid at the modified work rate, which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit. Unused sick leave will be paid at the applicable contract rate where the employee performed modified work and qualified for the sick leave during the contract year.
(g)	The Employer shall continue to remit contributions to the appropriate health & welfare and pension trusts during the entire time period employees are performing modified work. Continuation of such contributions beyond the period of time ■ specified in the Supplemental Agreement for on-the-job injury shall be required. Provisions of this Section shall not be utilized as a reason to disqualify or remove an employee from the modified work program.
(h)	Employees accepting modified work shall receive temporary partial benefits as determined by each respective state workers’ compensation law, plus a modified work wage when added to such temporary partial benefit, shall equal not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of forty (40) hours pay he/she would otherwise be entitled to under the provisions of the applicable Area Supplemental Agreement for the first six (6) months from the date the modified work assignment commences. After this initial six (6) month period, the percentage shall increase to ninety percent (90%) for the duration of each individual modified work assignment. The Employer shall not refuse to assign modified work to employees based solely on such employees reaching the ninety percent (90%) wage level. Such refusal shall be considered an abuse of the program and shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Modified work assignments beginning or ending within a workweek shall be paid on a prorated basis; one (1) day equals one-fifth (1/5th).
(i)	Employees accepting modified work shall not be subject to disciplinary action provisions of the Supplemental Agreements unless such violation involves an offense for which no prior warning notice is required under the applicable Supplemental Agreement (Cardinal Sins). Additionally, the provisions of Article 30, Section 14 shall apply-
(j)	Alleged abuses of the modified work program by the Employer shall be subject to the grievance procedure of the National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement and its applicable Area Supplemental Agreements. Proven abuses may result in a determination by the National Joint Arbitration Committee that would withdraw the benefits of this Article from that Employer, in whole or in part, in which case affected employees shall immediately revert to full worker's compensation benefits.

Article 10
(b)	In order to be eligible for daily sick leave payments, the eligible employee must be on the active seniority roster at the time of illness or accident.
Sick pay will be paid on the day that an employee notifies the Employer of an illness or injury. However, the first day sick pay will not be paid if the first day of absence is the day immediately preceding or following a paid holiday or scheduled vacation, in which case the employee must be absent three (3) consecutive days and sick pay will then be paid retroactive to the first day of absence.
(c)	Truckaway or driveaway drivers with bid schedules shall be treated as local employees with a standard workweek. Line drivers on sleepers or rotating boards will be treated as having a seven (7) day operation with no off days for the purpose of computing qualifying workdays.
(d)	Sick leave does not establish the need for a doctor's statement before sick leave benefits are paid. However, sick leave shall not interfere with an established procedure that requires an employee to have a doctor's statement before returning to work.
(e)	Employees on the inactive seniority roster prior to June 1 of a calendar year due to layoff or long term illness or injury are not eligible to receive sick leave. Once the employee returns to work, he shall be eligible for sick leave occurring after that date.

Sick leave not used by May 31st of any contract year will be calculated at the applicable hourly rate in existence on that date based on the following:
(1)	In order to receive payment of the unused portion of sick leave upon the completion of the contract year (May 31st), the employee must have worked ninety (90) days, including holidays, vacations, and compensable jury duty, during the contract year and the employee must have remained on the seniority roster (active or inactive) for the complete contract year (June 1st through May 31st);

(3)	Employees who are discharged for cause, or who voluntarily quit, are not eligible for unused sick leave;
48
Article 10
(4)	Employees who retire, die or are on workers* compensation shall be eligible for unused sick leave provided they have worked ninety (90) days or more during the contract year.
The additional sick leave days referred to above shall also be included in those Supplements containing sick leave provisions prior to June 1,1976.
Section 6.
Jury Duty
All employees called for jury duty will receive the difference between eight (8) hours' pay at the applicable hourly wage and actual payment received for jury service for fifteen (15) days per year for each eligible employee.
When such employees report for jury service on a scheduled workday, they will not be unreasonably required to report for work that particular day.
Time spent on jury service will be considered time worked for purposes of Employer contributions to health and welfare and pension plans, vacation eligibility and payment, holidays and seniority, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Supplemental Agreements to a maximum of fifteen (15) days per contract year.
It is the intent of this Section to provide compensation for time lost from work because of jury duty. It is applicable only to regular seniority employees. The employee shall receive the difference between eight (8) hours’ straight-time pay and the total amount of monies received for jury service.
Regular employees reporting for jury duty on a regularly scheduled workday and serving on a jury shall receive jury duty pay.
Regular employees reporting for jury duty and not selected for jury service shall be required to report for work, if, by reasonable efforts, such employees can complete four (4) or more hours of the normally scheduled workday. In such event, the employee shall be paid eight (8) hours' straight-time pay for the completion of the scheduled shift less total monies received for jury service.
Truckaway and driveaway drivers shall receive jury duty pay if the requirement to report for jury duty prevents the driver from being dispatched. Jury duty payments described above shall be made for each day's work lost as a result of such missed dispatch.
Agreed procedures of reporting for dispatch, after a dispatch has been missed, shall apply.
49
Article 10
The employee must present proof of jury duty and time of release to the Employer including jury duty pay amounts and the Employer shall pay jury duty pay the next regular pay period after receipt of the required information. Each payment of jury duty pay shall be included in the number of compensable jury days per contract year.
Jury duty pay does not apply to jury duty served when an employee is on sick leave, funeral leave, workers' compensation, leave of absence or personal time off. Employees shall inform the Employer upon receipt of jury duty notice. Failure to so notify the Employer will result in the disqualification for jury duty pay. When notified, the employee and the Employer shall, by mutual agreement, reschedule any vacation or holiday which may occur during the period of jury service.
An employee on layoff status will not receive jury duty pay unless the requirement to report for jury duty prevents the employee from working for his regular Employer on that day.

Article 23
The amount of the cost-of-living allowance shall be determined and redetermined as provided below on the basis of the "Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, U.S., All Items (1982-1984 = 100) (CPI-W (1982-1984 = 100)), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor" and referred to herein as the "Index."
The cost-of-living allowance shall only become effective if the annual increase in the CPI-W exceeds three (3.0%) percent.

And so forth with each additional .1 point increase in the Index there is an additional one cent ($.01) per hour; .50 mills per loaded mile; .25 mills per running mile; .1% flat or zone rate increase in all wage rates.
The second cost-of-living allowance, if any, shall become effective on June 1, 2005, based on the difference between the Index of January, 2004 (Published February, 2004) and the Index for January, 2005 (Published February, 2005).
61
Article 23
The Base Index Figure shall be the figure for January, 2004 (Published February, 2004). The cost-of-living increase shall be calculated as follows:

The Base Index Figure shall be the figure for January, 2006 (Published February, 2006). The cost-of-living increase shall be calculated as follows:
For every .1 point increase in excess of one hundred three percent (103%) of the Base Index of January, 2006, there shall be a one cent ($.01) per hour; .50 mills per loaded mile; .25 mills per running mile; .1 % flat or zone rate increase in the wage rates for all employees and classifications. Formula to be applied as indicated in the Example or Table shown above.

62
Article 24
Driveaway employees covered by the driveaway part of the Central-Southern Areas, Eastern Area and Western Area Supplements shall receive cost-of-living adjustments on the same basis as all other employees covered by this National Master Agreement.
For the duration of this Agreement only, all cost-of-living allowances, allocated to hourly, mileage and flat (zone) wage increases, shall become a fixed part of the base rate for all classifications on the effective date of each cost-of-living allowance.
A decline in the Index shall not result in a reduction of classification base rates.
In the event the appropriate Index figure is not issued before the effective date of the cost-of-living adjustment, the cost-of-living adjustment that is required will be made at the beginning of the first (1 st) pay period after receipt of the Index and will be made retroactive to the effective date. In the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics should revise or correct an applicable Index figure, any adjustment that may be required in the cost-of-living allowance shall be effective at the beginning of the first (1st) pay period after receipt of the revised or corrected Index figure and no retroactive adjustments will be made.
In the event that the Index shall be revised or discontinued and in the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, does not issue information which would enable the Employer and the Union to know what the Index would have been had it not been revised or discontinued, then the Employer and the Union will meet, negotiate, and agree upon an appropriate substitute for the Index. Upon the failure of the parties to agree in such negotiations within sixty (60) days, thereafter, each party shall be permitted all lawful economic recourse to support its request. The parties agree that the notice provision provided herein shall be accepted by all parties as compliance with notice requirements of applicable law, so as to permit economic action at the expiration thereof.

Article 30
A.	Reasonable Cause Testing.
Whenever the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the actions, appearance or conduct of an employee while on duty are indicative of the misuse of alcohol or the use of a controlled substance, the employee will be required to undergo an alcohol and/or drug test, and will be taken out of service pending results of such test.
The conduct of the employee must be witnessed by at least two supervisors, if at all feasible. If only one supervisor is available, only one supervisor need witness the conduct. The witnesses must have received training in the detection of probable drug use and alcohol misuse by observing a person's behavior. Any witness in such a case will be required to complete a Supervisor's Report of Conduct, which Report shall be prepared and signed by the witness within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the drug test are released, whichever is earlier. In the case of drug tests, the Report will be forwarded to the Medical Review Officer for review and consideration along with any positive test results.
In any reasonable cause circumstance, an Employer representative will transport the individual to an appropriate collection/testing facility and await the completion of the collection/testing procedure. The Employer representative will then transport the employee back to the Employer's premises.
Where reasonable cause drug testing is to be conducted, the employee will be required to provide a urine specimen for laboratory testing.
If requested, the employee will sign a consent form authorizing the clinic to collect a specimen of urine and release the results of the urine laboratory testing to his/her Employer's Medical Review Officer (MRO), in the case of D.O.T. covered employees, but shall not be required to waive any claim or cause of action under the law.
An employee may raise an affirmative defense that the positive test result was attributable to the proper use of a prescription medication. If the employee raises such a defense to the Employer, at the employee's request, the Employer shall refer the employee to a qualified physician to discuss the employee's explanation for the positive test result. The qualified physician may decide that there is a legitimate explanation and declare the test to be negative. The employee may be required to provide evidence that a prescription has been lawfully prescribed by a physician.
78
Article 30
A refusal to provide a specimen will constitute a presumption of intoxication and/or the use of a controlled substance, and the employee will be subject to discharge without the receipt of a prior warning letter.
Immediately after the specimen is provided, the individual collection bottles shall, in the presence of the employee, be sealed, labeled and then initialed by the employee. The employee has an obligation to identify each bottle and initial same. The specimens shall be placed in the transportation container after being drawn. The container shall be sealed in the employee's presence and the employee given an opportunity to initial the container and witness his/her social security number placed on the container. The container shall be sent to the designated testing laboratory on that day or the soonest normal business day by air courier or other fastest available method.
Urine Sample Kit (Reasonable Cause Kit)
The contents of the urine sample kit shall be as follows:
1.	Security seals for sealing and initialing each collection container; and tamper-proof shipping seals or sealing flaps for securing the exterior of the kit.
2.	Two (2) screw-capped self-sealing tamper-resistant urine collection bottles of appropriate capacities.
3.	Instructions for specimen collection.
A chain of possession form shall be completed by the hospital/clinic personnel during specimen collection and returned with the urine specimen before sealing the entire kit. The exterior of the collection kit must then be secured (e.g., by placing the tamper-proof shipping seals over the outlined tab areas, or sealing the flaps if so provided). If possible, have the employee initial the seals or flaps.
Urine testing shall be performed in strict accordance with federally mandated laboratory procedures regarding screening, confirmation and reporting of results, as reflected in the Substance Abuse Policy.
B.	Leave of Absence Prior to Testing.
An employee shall be permitted to take a leave of absence for the purpose of undergoing treatment pursuant to an approved program of alcoholism or drug use. The leave of absence must be requested prior to a positive test result or the commission of any act subject to disciplinary action.
79
Article 30
Such leave of absence shall be granted on a one-time basis and shall be for a maximum of sixty (60) days unless extended by mutual agreement. While on such leave, the employee shall not receive any of the benefits provided by this Agreement or Supplements thereto except continued accrual of seniority, nor does this provision amend or alter the disciplinary provision.
Employees requesting to return to work from a leave of absence for drug use or alcoholism shall be required to submit to testing as provided for in Part (E) of this Section. Failure to do so will subject the employee to discipline including discharge without the receipt of a prior warning letter.
The above provisions shall not apply to probationary employees.
C.	Disposition in Event of Positive Test Result
Federal regulations provide specific consequences for employees who test positive for the misuse of alcohol and the use of controlled substances.

If the test is positive for drugs or the alcohol BAC is 0.04 or greater, he/she will again be referred to a SAP and will be subject to the requirements of Section 8 above. Such an alcohol result of 0.04 or greater will also be considered a subsequent offense under the progressive discipline described in Section C.7 above.
An employee who tested 0.02 to 0.039 BAC on his/her first return to duty test must undergo a second return to duty test twenty-four 24 hours after the first return to duty test. An employee who tested positive for drugs or 0.04 or greater BAC for alcohol must undergo a second return to duty test after receipt by the Company of the written evaluation of the SAP that no further assistance is necessary. In such cases involving drugs, the test will be given no less than thirty (30) days after receipt of the prior test results. In such cases involving alcohol, the test will be given on the day of receipt or at the expiration of any period of disciplinary suspension, whichever occurs first.

1.	Union and Employer enter into this Work Preservation Agreement for the purpose of protecting and preserving Carhaul Work for the Employer’s bargaining unit employees, eliminating contracting and double breasting practices under which Parent or Employer permit persons other than Employer’s bargaining unit employees to perform Carhaul Work, and preventing any scheme or subterfuge to avoid the protection and preservation of Carhaul Work under this Agreement.
2.	Employer agrees that it shall not undertake to, nor permit any Controlled Affiliate (including freight broker companies) to, subcontract, transfer, lease, divert, contract, assign or convey, in full or in part, any Carhaul Work to any Controlled Affiliate, plant, business, person or non-unit employees other than Employer, or to any other mode of operation, except as explicitly and specifically provided for and permitted in the NMATA and/or applicable Supplemental Agreements.
3.	Employer agrees that it shall not permit any Controlled Affiliate other than Employer to perform any Carhaul Work and that no Carhaul Work shall be performed by any Controlled Affiliate other than Employer, except as permitted herein.
4.	Employer agrees that it will not engage in any scheme, transaction, restructuring or reorganization that permits it or any Controlled Affiliate either to evade the protection of Carhaul Work for Employer’s bargaining unit employees under this Agreement or to perform or assign or to permit the performance or assignment of any Carhaul Work outside the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the NMATA and applicable Supplemental Agreements, except as permitted herein. The Employer shall give written notification to the Union within fifteen (15) working days of the effective date of any acquisition (i.e. majority interest) by the Employer of any entity engaged in Carhaul Work as defined in Paragraph 10 (a) of this Work Preservation Agreement.
5.	Employer and Union waive any and all rights to assert that this Agreement or Article 33 of the NMATA violates any law or legal principle. Neither party will bring any
97
legal challenge or action of any form concerning the validity of this Agreement or Article 33 of the NMATA, nor permit any Controlled Affiliate to bring any such legal action, nor voluntarily provide any support to any person or entity that brings any such legal action; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph 5 shall be construed to prohibit Union, Employer or any Controlled Affiliate from responding to a properly issued subpoena or similar legal process.
6.	In the event that any provision of this Agreement or Article 33 of the NMATA is voided, invalidated or enjoined by a final decision of any court or government agency, then (a) the parties intend and agree that this Agreement shall be construed to provide the Union and the Employer's bargaining unit employees with the broadest permissible work preservation protection against subcontracting and double breasting practices consistent with governing law, and (b) Union and Employer shall each have the option to reopen collective bargaining negotiations over the NMATA, any Supplemental Agreement and/or this Agreement, in whole or in part, notwithstanding the duration clause contained in Article 35 of the NMATA.
7.	All grievances or disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be resolved in final and binding arbitration before the Board of Arbitration established in Article 33, Section 3 of the NMATA and pursuant to the procedure described in Article 33, Section 3 of the NMATA.
8.

If, and to the extent that, the Employer or the Union fails or refuses to comply with this request for information, for any reason, the Employer or the Union may request a subpoena duces tecum from the majority of the Board of Arbitration requiring that the information be produced by the Employer or the Union or any other entity or person. If, and to the extent that the subpoenaed party fails or refuses to comply with a subpoena issued by the majority of the Board of Arbitration, the Union or the Employer may seek enforcement of the subpoena in federal court pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended. If, and to the extent Employer or Union fails to comply with this provision for any reason, the Union or Employer may argue that the Board of Arbitration should draw an adverse inference against Employer or Union concerning the subject matter of the information that Employer or Union has failed to provide to Union or Employer within fifteen (15) days.
9.	The Employer’s obligations under this Agreement shall be binding upon its successors, administrators, executors and assigns. The Employer agrees that the obligations of this Agreement shall be included in any agreement of sale, transfer or
98
assignment of the business. In the event an entire operation or a portion thereof is sold, leased, transferred or taken over by sale, transfer, lease, assignment, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings, such operation shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the life thereof. Transactions covered by this provision include stock sales or exchanges, mergers, consolidation or spin-offs or any other method by which business is transferred.
In the event the Employer fails to require the purchaser, the transferee or lessee to agree to assume the obligations of this Agreement, the Employer (including partners thereof) shall be liable to the Local Union and to the employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to require assumption of the terms of this Agreement, until its expiration date, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, the transferee or lessee has agreed to assume the obligations of this Agreement.
The Employer shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee or other entity involved in the sale, merger, consolidation, acquisition, transfer, spin-off, lease or other transaction by which the operations covered by this Agreement may be transferred.
Such notice shall be in writing, with a copy to the Union, at the time the seller, transferor or lessor makes the purchase and sale negotiation known to the public or executes a contract or transaction as herein described, whichever first occurs. The Union shall also be advised of the exact nature of the transaction, not including financial details.
This section shall not impose any independent obligations under the NMATA, its supplements or this Agreement on any holding company that owns or controls Parent

Parent agrees that all grievances or disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be resolved in final and binding arbitration before the Board of Arbitration established in Article 33, Section 3 of the NMATA and pursuant to the procedure described in Article 33, Section 3 of the NMATA. Parent hereby expressly agrees to voluntarily submit to and be fully bound by the expedited arbitration and information exchange procedures established in Article 33, Sections 3 and 4 of the NMATA in all respects as if every reference to the term “Employer” in those Sections also expressly refers to, includes and binds Parent.

If, and to the extent Parent, Employer or Union fails to comply with this provision for any reason, the Union, Parent or Employer may argue that the Board of Arbitration should draw an adverse inference against Parent, Employer or Union concerning the subject matter of the information that Parent, Employer or Union has failed to provide to Union, Parent or Employer within fifteen (15) days.
9.	The Parent and Employer’s obligations under this Agreement shall be binding upon its successors, administrators, executors and assigns.

Transactions covered by this provision include stock sales or exchanges, mergers, consolidation or spin-offs or any other method by which business is transferred.
In the event the Parent or Employer fails to require the purchaser, the transferee or lessee to agree to assume the obligations of this Agreement, the Parent or Employer (including partners thereof) shall be liable to the Local Union and to the employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to require assumption of the terms of this Agreement, until its expiration date, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, the transferee or lessee has agreed to assume the obligations of this Agreement.
The Parent or Employer shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee or other entity involved in the sale, merger, consolidation, acquisition, transfer, spin-off, lease or other transaction by which the operations covered by this Agreement may be transferred.
Such notice shall be in writing, with a copy to the Union, at the time the seller, transferor or lessor makes the purchase and sale negotiation known to the public or executes a contract or transaction as herein described whichever first occurs. The Union shall also be advised of the exact nature of the transaction, not including financial details.
103
This section shall not impose any independent obligations under the NMATA, its supplements or this Agreement on any holding company that owns or controls Parent.

5.

This Work Preservation Agreement (the “Agreement") is made and entered into in accordance with Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §185, by and among (1) the undersigned employers party to the 2003-2008 National Master Automobile Transporters Agreement (the “NMATA”) as identified in Article 1, Section 1 of the NMATA and/or applicable Supplemental Agreements (hereinafter referred to as “Employer”), (2) the Employer’s corporate parent Leaseway Transportation Corporation (“Leaseway”) (hereinafter referred to as “Parent”), and (3) the undersigned Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that are parties to the NMATA as identified in Article 1, Section 2 of the NMATA and the Teamsters National Automobile Transporters Industry Negotiating Committee
120
(“TNATINC”) (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Union").
1.	Parent, Union and Employer enter into this Work Preservation Agreement for the purpose of protecting and preserving Carhaul Work for the Employer’s bargaining unit employees, eliminating contracting and double-breasting practices under which Parent or Employer permit persons other than Employer’s bargaining unit employees to perform Carhaul Work, and preventing any scheme or subterfuge to avoid the protection and preservation of Carhaul Work under this Agreement.
2.	Parent and Employer agree that neither Parent nor Employer shall undertake to, or permit any Controlled Affiliate (including freight broker companies) to, subcontract, transfer, lease, divert, contract, assign or convey, in full or in part, any Carhaul Work to any Controlled Affiliate, plant, business, person or non-unit employees other than Employer, or to any other mode of operation, except as explicitly and specifically provided for and permitted in the NMATA and/or applicable Supplemental Agreements.
3.	Parent and Employer agree that neither Parent nor Employer shall permit any Controlled Affiliate other than Employer to perform any Carhaul Work and that no Carhaul Work shall be performed by any Controlled Affiliate other than Employer, except as permitted herein.
4.	Parent and Employer agree that they will not engage in any scheme, transaction, restructuring or reorganization that permits Parent, Employer or any Controlled Affiliate either to evade the protection of Carhaul Work for Employer's bargaining unit employees under this Agreement or to perform or assign or to permit the performance or assignment of any Carhaul Work outside the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the NMATA and applicable Supplemental Agreements, except as permitted herein. The Parent and/or Employer shall give written notification to the Union within fifteen (15) working days of the effective date of any acquisition (i.e. majority interest) by the Parent or Employer of any entity engaged in Carhaul Work as defined in Paragraph 10 (a) of this Work Preservation Agreement.
5.	Parent, Employer and Union agree that they waive any and all rights to assert that this Agreement or Article 33 of the NMATA violates any law or legal principle and that they will not bring any legal challenge or action of any form concerning the validity of this Agreement or Article 33 of the NMATA, permit any Controlled Affiliate to bring any such legal action, or voluntarily provide any support to any person or entity that brings any such legal action; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph 5 shall be construed to prohibit Union, Parent, Employer or any Controlled Affiliate from responding to a properly-issued subpoena or similar legal process.
121
6.	In the event that any provision of this Agreement or Article 33 of the NMATA is voided, invalidated or enjoined by a final decision of any court or government agency, then (a) the parties intend and agree that this Agreement shall be construed to provide the Union and the Employer’s bargaining unit employees with the broadest permissible work preservation protection against subcontracting and double-breasting practices consistent with governing law, and (b) Union and Employer shall each have the option to reopen collective bargaining negotiations over the NMATA, any Supplemental Agreement and/or this Agreement, in whole or in part, notwithstanding the duration clause contained in Article 35 of the NMATA.
7.	Parent agrees that all grievances or disputes concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be resolved in final and binding arbitration before the Board of Arbitration established in Article 33, Section 3 of the NMATA and pursuant to the procedure described in Article 33, Section 3 of the NMATA. Parent hereby expressly agrees to voluntarily submit to and be fully bound by the expedited arbitration and information exchange procedures established in Article 33, Sections 3 and 4 of the NMATA in all respects as if every reference to the term “Employer" in those Sections also expressly refers to, includes and binds Parent. However, it is understood and agreed that Parent is not a signatory to the NMATA or any of its various supplements and is not, solely by virtue of this Agreement, single or joint employer with the signatory Employer(s).
8.	In the event Union submits a grievance involving Parent and/or Employer under the expedited arbitration procedure established in Article 33, Section 3, Parent and Employer and Union shall provide all information, documents or materials that are relevant in any way to the Union’s grievance within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of any written request for such information, documents or materials by the Union, Parent, or Employer. If, and to the extent that, the Parent, the Employer or the Union fails or refuses to comply with this request for information, for any reason, the Parent, the Employer or the Union may request a subpoena duces tecum from the majority of the Board of Arbitration requiring that the information be produced by the Parent, the Employer or the Union or any other entity or person. If, and to the extent that the subpoenaed party fails or refuses to comply with a subpoena issued by the majority of the Board of Arbitration, the Union, the Parent or the Employer may seek enforcement of the subpoena in federal court pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended. If, and to the extent Parent, Employer or Union fails to comply with this provision for any reason, the Union, Parent or Employer may argue that the Board of Arbitration should draw an adverse inference against Parent, Employer or Union concerning the subject matter of the information that Parent, Employer or Union has failed to provide to Union, Parent or Employer within fifteen (15) days.
122
9.	The Parent and Employer’s obligations under this Agreement shall be binding upon its successors, administrators, executors and assigns. The Parent and Employer agree that the obligations of this Agreement shall be included in the agreement of sale, transfer or assignment of the business. In the event an entire operation or a portion thereof is sold, leased, transferred or taken over by sale, transfer, lease, assignment, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings, such operation shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the life thereof. Transactions covered by this provision include stock sales or exchanges, mergers, consolidation or spin-offs or any other method by which business is transferred.
In the event the Parent or Employer fails to require the purchaser, the transferee or lessee to agree to assume the obligations of this Agreement, the Parent or Employer (including partners thereof) shall be liable to the Local Union and to the employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to require assumption of the terms of this Agreement, until its expiration date, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, the transferee or lessee has agreed to assume the obligations of this Agreement.

Such notice shall be in writing, with a copy to the Union, at the time the seller, transferor or lessor makes the purchase and sale negotiation known to the public or executes a contract or transaction as herein described whichever first occurs.
