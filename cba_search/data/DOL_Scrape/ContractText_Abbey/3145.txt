MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
PREAMBLE
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into between the Baltimore County Administration ("Administration") and The Baltimore County Professional Fire Fighters Association ("Association").
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION OF ASSOCIATION
Section 1.1	- Association Recognition. The Administration recognizes the Association as the exclusive representative of its employees, as defined in Section 1.2 of this Article, with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.
Section 1.2	- Employee Defined. Whenever used in this Memorandum of Understanding, the term "employee" shall mean all uniformed classes of the Fire Department in Pay Schedule V of the County Classification and Compensation Plan, up to and including the rank of Captain.
ARTICLE 2	- NON-DISCRIMINATION
Section 2.1	- Non-Discrimination. The provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be applied equally to all employees without discrimination as to race, color, sex, religion, creed, ancestry or national origin, age, marital status, physical or mental handicap unrelated in nature and extent so as to reasonably preclude the performance of the employment, political opinions, or political affiliations.
Section 2.2	- Employees' Exercise of Rights. The County and the Association agree that they shall not interfere with employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed under Title 25, Article II of the Baltimore County Code and Article VIII of the Baltimore County Charter.
ARTICLE 3	- MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Section 3.1 - Management Rights. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, it is the exclusive right of the County to determine the purposes and objectives of each of its constituent offices and departments; set standards of services to be offered to the public; to determine the methods, means, personnel and other resources, including volunteers, by which the County's operations are to be conducted, including the contracting out of work if deemed necessary by the County, and exercise control and discretion over its organization and operations. It is also the right of the County, subject to applicable provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding and in accordance with the County Charter and other applicable laws, to direct its employees, to hire, promote, transfer, assign or retain employees and to establish reasonable work rules; also to demote, suspend, discharge or take any other disciplinary action against its employees for just cause, provided however, that nothing contained in this Section shall be deemed to deny the right of any employee to submit a grievance with regard to the exercise of such rights.
ARTICLE 4	- ASSOCIATION SECURITY
7
Section 4.1	- Association Membership
A.	All employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding (1) who are employed after the effective date of this Memorandum of Understanding and elect not to join or remain members of the Association, or (2) who were employed prior to the effective date of this Memorandum of Understanding and had previously executed membership cards in said Association, but hereafter elect to terminate such membership, shall, as a condition of continued employment, pay a fair share fee to the Association, in an amount not to exceed the then current Association dues in order to defray the lawfully chargeable costs incurred by the said Association in negotiation, administration and implementation of the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding and all modifications and amendments thereto, including related proceedings before a mediator or a fact finder; in the processing of grievances, in the conduct of disciplinary proceedings and in the appeal thereof; in the protection and improvement of Merit System rights; and in any and all other proceedings and matters for which the Association is the employee's exclusive representative as a result of its certification, except in no case may these funds, or any part thereof, be used for political purposes. The above provisions shall be contingent upon the annual Certification by the Association to the County that fifty percent (50%) of the employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding are dues paying members of the Association.
B.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1 A, in the event that the Association certifies to the County that eighty percent (80%) or more of the employees covered by this Memorandum of Understanding are dues paying members of the Association, then, in such event, Association dues or fair share fees, not to exceed the then current Association dues, shall be paid by all employees covered by the Memorandum of Understanding as a condition of their continued employment, regardless of the date on which the employee was hired. This provision shall remain in effect as long as the monthly dues deduction for the month of January reflects at least eighty percent (80%) membership in the Association.
C.	Any employee who, under the provisions of Section 4.1 A or 4.1 B, is required to make an election between the payment of Association dues or fair share fees, shall be required to do so on a form provided by the County.
D.	An employee required to make an election of membership status must do so within thirty (30) days following the receipt of said form from the Association. Failure to do so shall result in the Association notifying the County of the breach by the employee of the provisions of this Section 4.1. The County will then notify the employee within five (5) working days of receipt of the Association notification, that the employee has ten (10) working days in which to make such an election. If the employee still does not make an election in the time provided, or has not reached a financial arrangement satisfactory to the Association, the County shall notify the Baltimore County Fire Department that the employee has breached the terms of continued employment, and the Department shall then begin proceedings subjecting the employee to appropriate disciplinary action, including termination.
Section 4.2 - Dues Checkoff. Upon receipt of a written authorization from an employee or retiree wishing to remain in the Association in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, the County shall, pursuant to such authorization, remit to the Association the regular monthly dues as fixed by the Association or its equivalent fair share fee. The method of payment shall be by direct deposit to an account specified by the Association in a bank approved by the County. The County shall provide to the Association, by magnetic media, a monthly itemized list of each employee's or retiree's name, social security number, and dues deduction amount, no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the month.
8
Section 4.3 - Checkoff Waiver. The County shall be relieved from making "checkoff" deductions upon an employee's (a) termination of employment, or (b) transfer to a job outside the department or unit, upon the request of the employee, or (c) layoff from work, or (d) an authorized leave of absence. Upon the return of an employee to work from any of the foregoing enumerated absences, the County shall immediately resume the obligation of making such deductions.
Section 4.4 - County Indemnification. The County assumes no obligation, financial or otherwise, arising out of the provisions of this Article 4, and the Association shall indemnify and hold the County harmless from any and all claims, grievances, arbitrations, award, suits, attachments, or other proceedings arising out of or by reason of any action taken by the County for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Article. If an error has been made in the amount of dues remitted to the Association under Section 4.2 of this Article, upon notification from the Association of such error, the County will expeditiously rectify the error.
Section 4.5	- Association Insignia. Employees shall be allowed to wear an Association pin on their "Class A” uniforms and an Association patch, as approved by the Chief of the Fire Department, on their fatigue jackets.
Section 4.6 - Association Business. No more than five (5) Association representatives shall be granted leave with pay to attend negotiation sessions which are scheduled with the Labor Commissioner. The representatives designated by the association may be employees who were scheduled to work the night shift just prior to the day on which negotiations were held, or employees who were scheduled to work the day shift on the day on which negotiations were held. Employees who attend negotiations and are scheduled to work the night shift succeeding the negotiations session shall be granted leave with pay in accordance with current practice. Such employees who may be eligible for leave with pay for the night shift succeeding the negotiation session will be in addition to the restriction of not more than five (5). Each employee shall be responsible for informing the employee's supervisor, in a timely fashion, of the employee's absence from work.
Section 4.7 - Leave With Pay. Eleven hundred (1,100) hours leave with pay per year shall be granted to representatives of the Association for Association business. The President of the Association will be placed on paid leave from the President's regularly assigned Fire Department duties to conduct the business of the Local during his or her term in office as President of the Association. Three (3) members of the Association, designated by the President, shall be granted administrative leave to attend the biennial conventions of the International Association of Fire Fighters and Professional Fire Fighters of Maryland. Three (3) members of the Association, selected jointly by the Fire Chief and President, shall be granted administrative leave to attend the biennial IAFF Redmond Safety and Health Symposium and the biennial IAFF EMS Conference. In order to be considered for selection, said members must serve on either the Joint Safety Committee or Joint EMS Committee.
Section 4.8 - Services Provided to the Association. The County agrees to furnish and maintain suitable bulletin board space of not less than sixteen (16) square feet in designated work areas to be used by the Association for official Association notices. The County further agrees to distribute bulletin board material through the county mail and/or information over the Department electronic mail system, subject to the approval of the Chief of the Fire Department. The County agrees to furnish and maintain a departmental centrex telephone line, computer and printer with an internet/intranet connection and authorized software.
9
Section 4.9	- Standby Pay. One member of the Association, either the President or the President's designee, will receive standby pay subject to the following conditions:
A.	The designated employee shall be compensated at one-fourth (1/4) the employee's regular hourly rate for each hour spent on standby.
B.	Standby pay will be afforded the designated employee between the hours of 1630-0800 on weekdays; standby pay will be paid on all Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, and at all other times when the offices of the Fire Department are closed.
C.	In the event that such employee is actually called back to work during the employee's standby duty assignment, the employee will earn callback pay in accordance with Department callback policy. At such a time, the ranking available Association officer will designate another member for standby assignment.
D.	Hours compensated for as standby duty shall not be counted in determining the total hours worked in a given workweek for overtime purposes.
E.	An employee not available for work after being assigned to standby duty will not receive any credit for standby work during such official assignment.
F.	This Section applies to those employees designated by the President of the Association for standby assignments. The individual who is designated as the Association's representative during standby hours will notify Fire Dispatch to log in one hour prior to the start of the individual's standby. The Association's representative's name shall appear on the night shift's list of personnel on duty.
ARTICLE 5	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 5.1 - Definition of Grievance. The term grievance shall mean:
A.	Any dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding; or
B.	Any dispute concerning discriminatory application or misapplication of the rules and regulations of any agency of the County; or
C.	Any dispute involving the suspension, dismissal, disciplinary action, promotion or demotion of any employee or complaint about an examination or examination rating.
A grievance may be filed by an individual employee, or by the Association on behalf of the employee (provided the aggrieved employee is named), or if two or more employees desire to file grievances involving the same issue, the Association may file a single grievance on their behalf. If two or more individual employees file separate grievances involving the same issue, the Administration may consolidate said grievances for the purpose of processing them under this Article. With respect to any grievance filed by the Association or any consolidated grievances, a single employee shall be designated by the Association as the employee who will participate in all meetings held pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Article. Neither party may be represented by counsel at any meeting held pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Article except at the meeting held pursuant to Step 5. The Administration shall notify the Association of any meeting required to be held pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Article at least three (3) days prior to such meeting; provided that if such notice is given three (3) days or less prior to the time limit for holding such meeting, such time shall be deemed extended to the date set for the meeting. If a grievance affects all employees within a station, battalion, division or other group of employees similarly situated, the Association may submit said grievance, in writing, directly at Step 2.
10
Section 5.2 - Procedural Steps. Recognizing that grievances should be raised and settled promptly, a grievance must be raised within fourteen (14) calendar days following the event giving rise to the grievance or within fourteen (14) calendar days following the time when the employee should reasonably have gained knowledge of its occurrence. The County shall send a copy of all grievances received to the Association. The grievant will be responsible for filing the proper forms within the time limits set forth in this Section, and shall keep the Association informed of same. Grievances shall be processed as follows, except for disciplinary grievances involving a suspension, loss of pay, demotion, or discharge which shall begin at Step 4 by filing a written appeal to the Chief of the Fire Department:
Step 1. The employee shall discuss the grievance with the employee's immediate supervisor (with the rank of Captain or higher). The supervisor shall attempt to adjust the grievance, within the supervisor's scope of authority, and shall respond orally within seven (7) calendar days of the discussion. The employee, at the employee's sole option, may bypass this Step 1 and proceed directly to Step 2.
Step 2. If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, the employee may, within seven (7) calendar days of the Step 1 response, file a written grievance with the employee's Battalion Chief or Division Chief if the employee does not report to a Battalion Chief. A meeting between the Battalion Chief or Division Chief and the employee shall be held within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the written grievance. The Battalion Chief or Division Chief shall submit an answer, in writing, and may accept, reject, increase, or decrease the disciplinary action within fourteen (14) calendar days after the meeting.
Step 3. If the grievance is not settled at Step 2, the employee or the employee's representative may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the Step 2 answer, file a written appeal of said answer with the Division Chief. A meeting between the Division Chief or the Chief's designee, the employee and the employee's representative shall be held within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the written appeal. The Division Chief, or the Chief's designee, shall submit an answer, in writing, and may accept, reject, increase, or decrease the disciplinary action within fourteen (14) calendar days after the meeting. The Assistant Chief or his/her designee shall hear the grievance at step 3 if a Division Chief hears Step 2.
In the event that a grievance involves a time sensitive matter, the employee, or the employee's representative, may elect to proceed immediately to this Step 3 in an attempt to resolve the grievance in an expeditious manner. The Division Chief, or the Chief's designee, shall submit an answer, in writing, within five (5) working days after the meeting. The employee may then appeal the answer to the Chief of the Department within five (5) working days, and in writing. The Chief of the Department, or the Chief's designee, has five (5) working days in which to give an answer.
Step 4. If the grievance is not settled at Step 3, the employee or the employee's representative may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the step 3 answer, file a written appeal of said answer with the Chief. A meeting between the Chief or the Chief's designee, the employee, and the employee's representative shall be held within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the written appeal. The Chief, or the Chief's designee, shall submit a written answer, and may accept, reject, increase, or decrease the disciplinary action within fourteen (14) calendar days after the meeting.
Step 5. If the grievance is not settled at Step 4, the employee may, within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the Step 4 written answer, file a written appeal of said answer with the Labor Commissioner or their designee. A meeting between the employee, the employee's representative, designated Administration representative, and the Labor Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee shall be held within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the written appeal. The Labor Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee shall submit a written answer, and may accept, reject, increase, or decrease the disciplinary action within fourteen (14) calendar days after the meeting.
11
Section 5.3 - Appeal to Arbitration. The Association or the Administration may appeal to arbitration any grievance under Section 5.1A or B which has been properly processed through the grievance procedures set forth in Section 5.2 of this Article 5, and has not been settled at the conclusion thereof, by serving the Labor Commissioner or their designee with written notice of intent to appeal within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the Step 5 answer.
Section 5.4 - Selection of Arbitrator. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the notice of intent to appeal to arbitration, the Labor Commissioner or their designee and the Association President or their designee shall meet to select an impartial arbitrator. If they are unable to agree on an arbitrator, they shall jointly request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to furnish a list of not less than seven (7) qualified and impartial arbitrators, one of whom shall be designated to hear the grievance. Selection shall be made by the Labor Commissioner or their designee and the Association President alternately striking names from the list until only one (1) name remains. The person whose name remains shall be designated arbitrator.
Section 5.5 - Arbitrator's Jurisdiction. The jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator of the grievance, and his opinion and awards, shall be confined exclusively to the interpretation and/or application of provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding and of the express rules and regulations of the department at issue between the Association and the County, as specified in the written grievance filed by the aggrieved employee at Step 4 of the procedure set forth in Article 5 of this Memorandum of Understanding. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, detract from, alter, amend, or modify any provision of this Memorandum of Understanding, or any rules and regulations of the Fire Department, or impose on either party hereto a limitation or obligation not explicitly provided for in this Memorandum of Understanding or the rules and regulations of the Fire Department, or to establish or alter any wage rate or wage structure. The arbitrator shall not hear or decide more than one grievance without the mutual consent of the County and the Association. The award of the arbitrator, in writing, on the merits of any grievance adjudicated within his jurisdiction and authority, shall be served on both the County and the Association. With respect to grievances as defined in Section 5.1 A and B of this Article 5, the arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on the aggrieved employee, the County and the Association.
Section 5.6 - Fees and Expenses. The cost of arbitration shall be shared equally by both parties, except that costs incurred in presenting or defending the grievance to the arbitrator shall be borne by the party incurring the expense.
Section 5.7 - Review by Personnel and Salary Advisory Board. With respect to grievances as defined in Section 5.1 C of this Article 5, which are not settled at Step 5 of Section 5.2, the grievance shall be presented to the Personnel and Salary Advisory Board within fourteen (14) calendar days of the Step 5 written answer. The Personnel and Salary Advisory Board shall render a final and binding decision on the grievance as soon as possible. It is expressly understood that the designated Administration representative has the same rights of Appeal to the Personnel and Salary Advisory Board from an adverse decision of the Labor Commissioner, subject to the time limits stated above.
Section 5.8 - Time Limitations. The time limits set forth in this Article 5 are of the essence of this Memorandum of Understanding. No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is submitted or appealed within the time limits set forth in Article 5; provided that the parties, by mutual written agreement,
12
may waive the time limits set forth herein; and provided further, that the parties, by mutual written agreement, may waive any step(s) of the grievance procedure and proceed directly to a higher level step. If the aggrieved employee or the Association fails to comply with the time limits set forth in this Article 5, the grievance shall be deemed to have been waived. If the Administration fails to comply with any time limit set forth in this Article, the Association may elect to proceed to the next step.
ARTICLE 6	- NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
Section 6.1 - Prohibition Against Strikes and Lockouts.
A.	Strikes, work stoppages and lockouts and secondary boycotts are forbidden. Employees or employee organizations shall not engage in, sponsor, initiate, support, direct or condone a strike or work stoppage or secondary boycott.
B.	Employee organizations shall be prohibited from engaging in, initiating, sponsoring, supporting, directly or indirectly, picketing of the Baltimore County government or any of its property or field or office facilities in furtherance of a strike, work stoppage or secondary boycott.

Section 8.2	- Merit Employee Priority at Entrance Level Positions. Dual-entry and entrance-level examinations will be pass/fail. For those sworn employees who meet Departmental criteria for the classification in question, the Fire Department will comply with Regulation 10.02 which states:
"Employees of the County government will take precedence for promotion over outside applicants for any vacancy or new position in the County government, provided that they are qualified and that the qualifications of the County employee are equal to the qualifications of an outside applicant."
When the Department is confident that its needs can be met by current sworn employees, it has the option to request a closed promotional examination for dual-entry positions, subject to the approval of the Director of Human Resources.
Section 8.3	- Promotional Lists. Promotional lists remain in effect until exhausted, but not for a period of more than two (2) years. Thereafter, a new list shall be prepared by those procedures in effect as prescribed by the Office of Human Resources; such list to be ready on the day after the previous list expires.
Section 8.4 - Promotional Eligible List. The Office of Human Resources will not round off composite scores to the nearest whole number but will, instead, compute final composite scores to as many decimal places as necessary to break ties. Names and scores will be submitted to the Fire Chief for promotional purposes in the order that they appear on the eligible list. The Office of Human Resources will comply with County Code Title 8, The Personnel Rules, Article 4-8-102, Special Personnel Rules for Fire and Police Departments, Special Rule No. 7 Promotions, Special Rule 7.06 of the Personnel Rules and Regulations which states:
“When a vacancy is to be filled in the Police or Fire Department, the Department Chief shall request the Director of Human Resources to certify the names of the persons eligible for promotion. The Director of Human Resources shall certify the names of the three (3) numerically highest employees on the promotional
14
eligibility list for the rank in which the vacancy exists; provided that in case more than one (1) vacancy is to be filled, the number of names certified shall be two (2) greater than the number of vacancies. The Department Chief, in his written request for certification, may specify qualifications of a special nature of candidates for appointment to the position; that is to say, qualifications relating to specialized training, experience, or knowledge involving factors of a special nature required in the position and not required of all positions in the class. Upon any such request for selective certification as outlined above, the Director of Human Resources shall certify the names of the three (3) numerically highest employees on the promotional list possessing such qualifications of a special nature as are required for the rank in which the vacancy exists; provided that in case more than one (1) such vacancy is to be filled, the number of names certified shall be two (2) greater than the number of vacancies.”
Section 8.5	- Test Scheduling. Promotional examinations for sworn employees will be given on the following schedule:
•	Fire Captain, February
•	Fire Specialist, April

Section 8.6	- Test Source Material. Source material will continue to be published by March 1 of each year. The Association may provide suggestions regarding source material to the Department by each December 1.
Section 8.7	- Job Analyses. The Office of Human Resources will update job analyses and, where Personnel deems it necessary, will conduct new job analyses according to current state-of-the-art methodology. Job analyses are long-term projects, and the number that can be performed is limited by staff availability. Parts and Weights will be based on job analyses data, when available, although seniority will be a component for classes of Fire Apparatus Driver/Operator to Battalion Fire Chief, inclusive. New Parts and Weights will be shared with the Department and Association prior to publishing.
Section 8.8	- Oral Examination. Oral examination, when a component of a promotional examination, will be closely monitored by the analyst. When differences of more than one level in rating occur, the analyst will ask the examiners to immediately resolve the discrepancy. Alternatives to oral examinations as a way of testing for certain knowledge, skills and abilities will be explored.
Section 8.9	- Seniority Points. Seniority points for promotional examination will continue to be computed according to the 75% credit for the first ten (10) years and 25% credit for the second ten (10) years' formula.
The formula for the calculation is illustrated below:
With ten (10) years or less seniority: Points = (First ten year multiplier)(Days) ______________________________________365_______________________________________ With greater than ten (10) years and less than twenty (20) years seniority: Points = (First ten year multiplier)(3650) + (Second ten year Multiplier)(Days-3650) ________________________________________________________________________________365_ With twenty or more years seniority: Points = Maximum
15
Definitions:
•	Days = The number of continuous days of service from the last appointment date or last promotion date (inclusive) whichever is applicable to the cutoff date (exclusive).
•	Maximum = The maximum number of points as determined in the promotional announcement.
•	First ten year Multiplier = The first point credit multiplier as determined in the promotional announcement.
•	Second ten year Multiplier = the second point credit multiplier as determined in the promotional announcement.
Notes: Start date 05/12/95, cut off date 05/13/95 results in one (1) day. Start date 12/13/90, cut off date 06/29/95 results in 1,659 days. Include extra days for leap years where applicable.
All components of the promotional scores are rounded to the fifth decimal place.
Section 8.10 - Performance Evaluation. Recognizing the importance of immediate supervisors input and observations, the Department shall continue to analyze performance records of candidates certified for promotion to ascertain whether past performance is indicative of leadership ability and, when appropriate, use past performance as a reason for not promoting a candidate.
Section 8.11 - Item Analysis. Since item analysis is the most objective method of identifying questionable items on promotional examinations, the Office of Human Resources will continue the process of bringing items so identified to the attention of the Item Review Board, which consists of departmental representatives as determined by the Fire Chief. The Association may designate an employee, of equal or higher rank than the exam being reviewed, to participate on the Item Review Board. Constructive input into the examination content will be a part of the Item Review Board process.
Section 8.12	- Examination Review. Once an eligible list is established, candidates may review the examination in the presence of an analyst for the purpose of improving their future performance.
A joint subcommittee shall meet periodically throughout the year (but not less than once during the first half of the year and once during the second half of the year) to develop improved methods of administering promotional exams within the Department. The subcommittee shall include up to two (2) members each from the Association, the Department, and the Office of Human Resources. The committee shall consider such matters as publishing benchmarks, third party review, assessment centers, separate testing for various divisions, length of service requirements, etc.
While this Agreement contains our current understanding, the Association in no way wishes to place restrictions upon, or inhibit the flexibility of, the Office of Human Resources. Accordingly, if more effective or viable methods become known within the life of this contract, the Association shall join with the Director of Human Resources and the Fire Department in making proper modifications.
Section 8.13	- Licenses and Certificates. All applicants for promotion must possess any licenses or certifications required of the position they are applying for prior to the end of the application period.

H.	Vacation Selection for Fire Prevention.
1.	Vacation selection must be made in four (4) full day increments with employees being charged ten (10) hours for each day. This rule also applies to E shift personnel.
2.	The vacation selection process shall be by shift starting with the Captain. Once the Captain has selected, the Lieutenants shall select by seniority.

Any day in the tour may be selected. All requests for leave received between 0700 hours and 0900 hours thirty two (32) days prior to the desired day for personnel assigned to A, B, C, and D shifts, and twenty eight (28) days prior to the desired day for personnel assigned to E shift, shall be considered as equal and determination of who is granted leave shall be made in the same selection order as the vacation selection listed in F above.
2.	Determination for who is granted leave for all requests made after 0900 hours thirty-two (32) days prior to the desired day, shall be determined by who requested the leave first.
3.	Annual leave (other than vacation selections) may be taken in full-shift increments; leave may also be taken in five (5) hour increments, contiguous with the beginning or end of shift.
J.	Battalion Leave List. Unused leave slots left open on the station calendars will be available to other employees within the battalion under the following conditions:
1.	Station calendars will be closed at 2200 hours on the first night of night duty for the next tour of duty.

3.	On the last night of night duty, the Battalion Chief will grant leave from the battalion leave calendar, if any leave is available.
4.	Determination of who is granted such leave shall be in accordance with Section 11.2 (I) of the Memorandum.
K.	It is agreed that any changes made to this Section 11.2 may be made by mutual agreement between the Department and the Association.
L.	The Department shall establish a policy for employees to use annual leave in emergencies.
Section 11.3 - Bereavement Leave. Four (4) days absence without loss of pay shall be permitted for the death of a parent, child, brother, sister, spouse, stepparent, stepchild.

Bereavement leave shall be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay, and must be taken during the period commencing the calendar day on which death occurs and ending two (2) calendar days after the funeral. The Chief of the Department has the authority to make exceptions to the above due to the religious preference of the employee.
Section 11.4	- Sick Leave.
A.	Effective January 1, 2002, employees will earn twelve (12) days of sick leave per year. For retirements effective December 31, 2001 and thereafter, employees shall receive retirement system membership service for unused sick leave in accordance with the formula that sixteen (16) days of unused sick leave are equal to one (1) month of membership service; one (1) additional month of membership service shall be granted if fractional days totaling eight (8) or more result from the application of this formula.
B.	Conversion. Because of the credit received at retirement (16 days = 1 month service), sick leave conversion to hours shall be calculated dependent upon your assignment.
1.	Personnel assigned to shift work in Emergency Operations, including Fire Investigation Division and personnel assigned to the Communications Division, shall earn 12 days x 12 hours = 144 hours per year.
2.	Personnel who work ten (10) hour days shall earn 12 days x 10 hours = 120 hours per year.
24
3.	Personnel who work eight (8) hour days shall earn 12 days x 8 hours = 96 hours per year.
4.	When personnel are transferred or reassigned to divisions working a different schedule, sick leave accrued shall be adjusted to reflect the same amount of days, but converted to hours.
Examples:
a.	Individual from shift work (10 hour day/14 hour night), or an individual from Communications, now has 125 sick days accrued, or 1,500 hours; (125 days x 12 hours = 1,500 hours). He/she is reassigned to Fire Prevention (10 hour days). He/she is credited with 1,250 hours sick leave: (125 days x 10 hours = 1,250 hours), or if he/she was reassigned to an 8 hour schedule, he/she would be credited with 1,000 hours sick leave: (125 x 8 hours = 1,000 hours).
b.	Individual from shift work has accrued 1,500 hours sick leave. He/she is transferred to the 8 hour work schedule. His/her new sick leave accrual would be 1,000 hours, computed as follows: (1,500 hours - 12 hours {old work schedule} x 8 hours {new work schedule} = 1,000 hours.
C.	In the future, when all personnel are credited with sick days in hours and a transfer or reassignment takes place, the Department will use the following equation in determining sick leave: total hours accrued at time of transfer divided by hours per day of their old work schedule times the hours per day of their new work schedule.
D.	The Department agrees to continue in effect its current sick leave policy, including SOP - Personnel 2.
E.	It is agreed that any changes made to this Section 11.4 may be made by mutual agreement between the Department and the Association.
Section 11.5 - Use of Accrued Leave and Compensatory Leave. The Department will continue to permit the use of accrued leave, provided the maximum number of personnel allowed off at their work site is not exceeded. To insure all personnel the opportunity to use their earned leave, personnel may not select accrued leave, compensatory leave, or any combination of different types of leave more than twenty-four (24) days in advance. If at any time this provision creates a staffing problem, the Department and Association will reach a mutually agreeable solution.
Section 11.6	- Personnel Guaranteed Leave per Shift.
A.	Effective July 1, 2005, the Administration will guarantee thirty two (32) Bargaining Unit employees leave on each shift.
B.	One bargaining unit employee per ten employees assigned to “E” shift shall be guaranteed leave in addition to the employees listed in subsection A above. The leave entitlement in this subsection is in addition to the Regularly Scheduled Day Off (RDO) afforded E Shift personnel.
C.	The standard guaranteed leave ratio at any workplace shall not exceed one (1) employee allowed off on leave per every eight (8) employees assigned, not including temporary assignments.
D.	In the event that the total hours of annual leave for all personnel assigned to a station/shift, exclusive of accrued leave, exceeds the amount of leave hours available according to the station calendar for said personnel, the Department agrees to structure a process to insure that all affected personnel may utilize their annual leave entitlement.
E.	It is agreed to that changes may be made to Section 11.6 by mutual agreement between the Department and Association.
Section 11.7 - Additional Leave Provision. In the event the County Executive grants additional leave to nonessential county employees for any reason, those employees required by the Fire Department to perform duties shall be entitled to receive one hour of "non work leave" ("F" Leave) for each hour granted, in addition to any pay which they are entitled to for that period.
25
Section 11.8 - Work-Related Injury. Unless the employee is physically incapacitated and therefore unable to comply, an employee may receive Accident Leave only if the employee notifies management of the accidental injury within two workdays of the time for which the employee requests such Accident Leave.
ARTICLE 12	- TRANSFERS
Section 12.1 - Station to Station or Shift to Shift Transfers. An employee desiring a transfer from one station and/or shift to another must submit a request specifying the shift and station to which the employee desires transfer; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to limit the number of transfer requests an employee has pending simultaneously. Any transfer request so submitted remains valid until cancelled or a higher priority is honored. If an Emergency Operations employee has more than one transfer request pending simultaneously, the employee must list on each such request its relative priority to other requests. An employee must accept any transfer offered by the Fire Department for which the employee has submitted a request. Transfers will be accepted for only the classification the employee presently holds.
Section 12.2 - Selection for Station to Station and/or Shift to Shift Transfers. When a vacancy becomes available for which two (2) or more Emergency Operations employees have requested a transfer, the employee whose transfer request has the earliest applying date shall receive the transfer; provided that if two (2) or more transfer requests for the same vacancy were received dated for the same date, the senior employee shall be transferred. For the ranks up to and including Lieutenant, seniority is determined by their time as a sworn employee of the Fire Department, with ties being broken by final academic standing from recruit training. Seniority for positions above Lieutenant will be broken by time in grade. The applying date shall be the date submitted at the station or location assigned.
Section 12.3 - Transfers to Support Divisions. When a vacancy occurs in a Support Division, an announcement will be made by the Division Chief responsible for that division. The announcement will specify the minimum requirements and any qualifications of a special nature of candidates for appointment to the position; that is to say, qualifications relating to specialized training, experience or knowledge involving factors of a special nature required in the position and not required of all positions in the class. The Chief of the Department may request the Office of Human Resources to identify persons on an eligibility list consistent with Special Regulation 7.06 who may be considered to fill any vacancy in Support Divisions. There will be at least a two (2) week opportunity for employees to submit transfers through the normal channels. Interviews will be conducted of all interested employees and the most qualified employee will be selected to fill the vacancy. The remaining names will be held for a period of thirty (30) days and be utilized to fill subsequent vacancies.
Section 12.4 - Transfers into Emergency Operations. Only an employee in a Support Division who has reached the employee’s present position by a transfer from Emergency Operations, may submit a transfer request in accordance with Section 12.1 which will be deemed valid without any additional qualifiers.
Section 12.5 - Transfer from One Job Classification to Another. Those employees who meet all job specifications of another position in the same pay classification, i.e., FADO or Fire Specialist, may be allowed to transfer laterally into the other job classification, after one (1) year in the job classification to which the employee was promoted. Lateral transfer requests may only be made in the thirty (30) day period preceding the effective date of the classification's promotional list for which the employee wishes to transfer. All lateral transfer requests submitted during this period shall be deemed the same in regard to the date submitted and then be honored by the department seniority. All lateral transfer requests that are not honored during the effective period of the promotional list must resubmit the request for lateral transfer within the next thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the classifications' next promotional list for which the employee wishes to transfer. Personnel who receive a lateral transfer shall be assigned to stations in the same manner as newly promoted
26
personnel. Effective for all promotional lists established after June 30, 1998, lateral transfers will be honored only when the promotional list for the desired job classification has been exhausted.
Effective for all promotional lists established after June 30, 2002, those employees who so desire may elect to compete in the promotional process within the same pay grade regardless of the job classification currently held, instead of requesting a lateral transfer. An employee who elects to take the promotional test for the desired job classification is not eligible to be on the lateral transfer list during the period covered by the promotional list generated by that test.
Section 12.6 - Voluntary Demotions. Employees shall be guaranteed the right to demote to another classification when an authorized vacancy exists. With respect to EMS employees demoting to fire suppression positions, the department may postpone demotions until a recruit class is scheduled.

TRAVEL POLICY
1.	Purpose
In order to provide a uniform policy for administration of required and authorized County business travel by employees of the Fire Department, the following guidelines and procedures are adopted.
This policy supersedes and replaces all previously existing official or unofficial travel policies presently applied by the Fire Department.
2.	Administration
Travel procedures will be based on information circulated and updated every fiscal year by the Office of Budget and Finance, which shall be charged with the responsibility for voucher verification, per diem averages for selected major cities, average travel timetables, air and train fare estimates, accommodation recommendations and other guideline information necessary to insure proper controls of travel expenses.
The individual agency heads shall be responsible for approving travel requests in their departments, and for insuring that travel reimbursement is neither excessive nor discriminatory in its application. Any supplementary procedures developed by the agencies shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Officer. The agency head shall have the responsibility to determine whether a County vehicle or a privately owned vehicle shall be used for such travel.
The County Administrative Officer, or the Administrative Officer's designee, shall monitor all travel expenses as reported quarterly by the Office of Budget and Finance.
3.	Mileage Allowance
A mileage allowance at the rate set by the Internal Revenue Service shall be paid to employees who use privately owned vehicles for official County travel necessary to carry out the required or authorized duties of their positions, including mileage for travel to and from required training classes, without regard for the number of passengers they may have. Any adjustment in the rate shall take place on the first of July following any adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service. The mileage chart on each station bulletin board shall be updated regularly.
In the application of this allowance, the employee will be entitled to reimbursement for official travel which is authorized by the agency head or designee, other than that required to and from the employee's regularly assigned office or duty station. All employees will be assigned regular office or duty station for the purpose of mileage allowance calculations.
When an employee is required to travel on official business from home to a location other than the regularly assigned office or duty station, whether on a workday or not, the employee shall be reimbursed for mileage in excess of the distance round-trip between the employee's home and the regularly assigned place of work or duty station. It is the employee's duty to keep accurate and timely records of travel, and to report such mileage as required by the agency for reimbursement.
43
When an employee is required on a non-workday to report to the County Medical Clinic at the request of the Clinic, or when required to do so because of a policy, the employee shall be reimbursed for round trip mileage from the employee’s home to the Clinic, not to exceed one hundred (100) miles.
4.	Temporary Change of Work Location
An employee who is required to report to a different work site will be reimbursed for all extra travel connected with the transfer, provided that the transfer is authorized or directed by the employee's supervisor and temporary (1 two-week pay period or less) in nature. This allowance will only be paid for mileage beyond that normally traveled by the employee to the employee's regularly assigned place of work.
Travel allowance payments for temporary changes of work location beyond the two week limitation must be specifically approved by the agency head, subject to the review of the Administrative Officer.
5.	Tolls, Parking
Should authorized County business require an employee to pay tolls or parking charges beyond that usually required by travel in the regular work area, the employee shall be reimbursed for such tolls or parking. Parking costs will not be paid to employees who are required to report to the Towson area offices on a temporary change of work location (see No. 4 above).
6.	Travel to Conferences, Workshops
Travel to approved conferences, meetings, workshops, training sessions and other work related events shall be considered official County business. The agency head shall have the responsibility to determine whether a privately owned or County owned vehicle should be used for such trips. In planning travel, consideration shall be given to routes which minimize both time and cost to and from the destination.
Employees traveling on official County business are expected to exercise care in incurring expenses, and to avoid excessive or unnecessary costs by planning for the minimum amount of travel and the most economical mode of transportation to the destination. In all cases, the agency head or designee shall have final approval on advances and/or reimbursements for the agency's employees, consistent with the guidelines issued by the Office of Budget and Finance.
If it is determined that the most economical means of travel is by County vehicle, the "General Rules and Regulations for County Vehicles" shall be followed. Requests for overnight or out of state use of pool vehicles must be made prior to the first day of travel.
7.	Receipts, Gratuities
Receipts will be required by the Office of Budget and Finance for expenses such as lodging, train/bus/airplane tickets, parking, tolls over $1.00, conference/registration fees, limousine fares and cleaning allowances. Actual expenses for items such as mileage, meals, gratuities, baggage handling charges and taxis will be reimbursed according to the schedule published by the Office of Budget and Finance.

2.	In order to be eligible to select the DROP, a retiring member must have at least thirty-two (32) years of credible service as defined in Section 23-36 of the Baltimore County Code. The length of the DROP a member may elect will be determined according to the following table. For employees hired after January 1, 2004, only actual time worked, accumulated sick leave, and accredited military time will be applied toward DROP.
Years of Eligible Service
32 or more years
33 or more years
34 or more years
Length of the DROP
3 years
3, 3-1/2, or 4 years
3,	3-1/2, 4, 4-1/5, or 5 years
3.	Retirement allowances credited to the DROP account, and paid after retirement, will be calculated according to the following enhanced formula:
a.	The length of the DROP period (three to five years) is selected by the employee.
b.	“DROP Service” equals service at retirement (including retirement credit for accumulated unused sick leave and military service) minus the length of the DROP period.
c.	Average Final Compensation is determined as if the member had retired at the beginning of the DROP period.
d.	The DROP Retiree Allowance equals 74% of Average Final Compensation for 29 years DROP Service, plus 2% of Average Final Compensation for each additional year of service.
4.	Retirement allowances credited to the DROP account will be increased for retirement system COLAs just as if the member had retired at the beginning of the DROP. The retirement allowance paid upon actual retirement will include retirement system COLAs provided during the period of the DROP.
5.	Member contributions to the Retirement System made during the period of the DROP will be credited to the member’s DROP account.
6.	The DROP account will be credited with interest each June 30, based on the administrative procedures currently used to determine the member’s accumulated contributions, except that the interest rate used will be the greater of (a) the rate of return on the actuarial value of assets for the prior calendar year, minus 50 basis points; or (b) the regular rate of interest (5% per annum).
7.	The DROP accumulation may be paid to the member in a single lump sum, or may be rolled over into an eligible plan such as an IRA, at the member’s option.
