LABOR AGREEMENT
Between
CITY OF MINNEAPOLIS
and
CITY EMPLOYEES LOCAL UNION NO. 363, AFL-CIO
THIS AGREEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the Labor Agreement or the Agreement, is made and has been entered into effective the 1st day of January, 2015 unless an alternative implementation date is expressly identified by and between the City of Minneapolis, the Employer, and the City Employees Union, Local Union No. 363 a/w Laborers’ International Union of North America, AFL-CIO, the Union. The Employer and the Union, the Parties, agree to be bound by the following terms and provisions:
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION AND UNION SECURITY
Additionally, in recognition of the Union’s commitment to support a work environment that is hospitable to all employees, the Union and the Employer agree to support training, policies and work rules that promote and sustain a positive work environment and prohibit abuse and harassment in the work place by any employee, manager or supervisor.
Section 1.01 - Recognition and Amendments to Unit
Subd. 1. Recognition
The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive certified collective bargaining representative of all employees whose job classifications and rates of pay are set forth in Appendix "A" of this Agreement, except those who are Supervisors and Confidential employees within the meaning of the Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act, as amended, those who are otherwise excluded by the Act, and all other employees.
Subd. 2. Amendment to Certified Unit
Disputes which arise between the Employer and the Union over the inclusion or exclusion of any
job classifications may be referred by either Party to the Commissioner, Bureau of Mediation Services, Page 1 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
State of Minnesota, for determination in accordance with applicable statutory provisions. Determination by the Commissioner shall be subject to such review and determination as is provided by statute and such rules and regulations as are promulgated there under. In the event the Employer has established a new job classification which is added to the bargaining unit by agreement between the Parties or by determination of the Commissioner, Bureau of Mediation Services, State of Minnesota, the Parties agree to negotiate with one another concerning wages and such other terms and conditions of employment as may be applicable to the position and which are not covered by this Agreement. However, it is agreed that all other terms and provisions of the Agreement shall apply to the new job classification.
Section 1.02 - Union Dues and Fair Share Fees Check-Off
Subd. 1. Union Dues Payroll Deductions
In recognition of the Union as the exclusive representative, the Employer shall deduct an amount sufficient to provide initiation fee and the payment of the regular monthly Union membership dues uniformly established by the Union from the wages of all employees who have authorized, in writing, such deduction on a form designated and furnished by the Union. The Union shall certify to the Employer, in writing, the current amount of regular monthly membership dues which it has uniformly established for all members. Such deductions shall only be cancelled by the Employer upon a written request made by the involved employee to the Union with a copy from the union to the appropriate departmental payroll office.
Subd. 2. Fair Share Fees Payroll Deductions
In accordance with Minnesota Statutes §179A.06, Subd. 3, the Employer shall, upon notification by the Union, deduct a fair share fee from all certified employees who are not members of the Union. This fee shall be an amount equal to the regular membership dues of the Union, less the cost of benefits financed through the dues and available only to members of the Union, but in no event shall the fee exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the Union's regular membership dues or such amount as may otherwise be allowable by law. The Union shall certify to the Employer, in writing, the current amount of the fair share fee to be deducted as well as the names of bargaining unit employees required by the Union to pay the fee.
Subd. 3. Time of Deductions
The Employer shall deduct Union dues and fair share fees as requested by the union. Such requests shall not exceed once each payroll period. In the event an employee covered by the provisions of this section has insufficient pay due to cover the required deduction, the Employer shall have no further obligations to effect subsequent deductions for the involved payroll period.
Subd. 4. Remittance
The Employer shall remit such Union dues and fair share fees deductions made pursuant to the provisions of this section to the appropriate designated officer of the Union within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of the deduction along with a list of the names of the employees from whose wages deductions were made and not made.
Page 2 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Subd. 5. General Administration
The following shall be applicable to the administration of the provisions of this section:
a.	All certifications from the Union as to the amounts of deductions to be made as well as notifications by the Union and/or bargaining unit employees as to changes in deductions must be received by the Employer at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the date upon which the deduction is scheduled to be made in order for any change to be effected.
b.	The Employer shall, upon the request of the Union, but no more frequently than once each calendar quarter, provide the Union with a report showing the names of those employees in the bargaining unit along with their classifications and department locations, mailing addresses of record, Union Code, current rates of pay, and classification/City seniority.
c.	When an employee on the dues deduction transfers from one work location within the bargaining unit to another, the deduction of dues shall not be terminated except as directed by the involved employee.
d.	No other employee organization shall be granted payroll deduction of dues for employees covered by the Agreement without the express written permission of the Union.
Subd. 6. Hold Harmless
The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Employer, its officers, agents and employees harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders or judgments brought or issued against the Employer, its officers, agents and employees as a result of any action taken or not taken in compliance with the specific provisions of this section or which are taken or not taken at the request of the Union.
Section 1.03 - Exclusive Representation
The Employer shall not enter into any agreements with the employees covered by this Agreement either individually or collectively or with any other employee organization which in any way conflicts with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Further, the Employer shall meet and negotiate, pursue the resolution of grievances and conduct arbitration proceedings only with the properly designated representative(s) of the Union.
Section 1.04 - Union Stewards
The Union may designate certain bargaining unit employees to act as stewards and shall certify to the Employer, in writing, their names, along with the names of business representatives and/or officers of the Union who shall be authorized by the Union to investigate and present grievances. The Employer agrees to recognize such representatives, subject to the following:
Page 3 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Subd. 1. Number of Stewards
The Union may designate one (1), but no more than one (1), steward on each shift for each of the Employer's principal work areas from among those employees who work therein.
Subd. 2. Activities of Stewards
Designated and certified Stewards and other designated representatives of the Union shall be granted reasonable time off, with pay, in order to investigate and/or present grievances to the Employer during their normal working hours. Such stewards, however, shall not leave their work stations without first obtaining the permission of their immediate supervisor and shall notify their immediate supervisor upon returning to work. The permission of the supervisor shall not be denied without good cause. When the Parties agree that it is mutually beneficial to have an officer of the Union participate in such presentation and/or investigation, such officer shall also be authorized time off with pay for this purpose. Stewards and other representatives of the Union shall not interfere in any way with the Employer's operation or with the performance of work by its employees. Nothing in this paragraph, however, shall be construed to limit the proper presentation of grievances provided for by this subdivision.
At the request of the employee, designated and certified stewards and other designated representatives of the Local Union shall be granted reasonable time off, with pay, in order to attend meetings at which an employee is formally questioned during an investigation into conduct which may lead to disciplinary action during their normal working hours. Such Union representative shall not be entitled to participate in such investigation except to advise and counsel the involved employee. Such, designated and certified stewards and other designated representatives, however, shall not leave their work stations without first obtaining the permission of their immediate supervisor and shall notify their immediate supervisor upon returning to work. The permission of the supervisor shall not be denied without good cause. Designated and certified stewards and other designated representatives of the Union shall not interfere in any way with the Employer’s operation or with the performance of work by its employees.
Section 1.05 - Visitation
With notice to an available supervisor at a worksite, non-employee representatives of the Union who have been certified to the Employer may come on the worksite for the purpose of investigating and presenting grievances. The Union agrees there shall be no solicitation for membership, signing up of members, collection of initiation fees, dues, fines or assessments, meetings or other Union activities on the Employer's time by such non-employee representatives, the Union's stewards or any officers of the Union.
Section 1.06 - Bulletin Boards
The Employer shall provide for the Union's use, reasonable space on designated bulletin boards for the purpose of posting official Union notices. Each posted notice shall bear the signature of the Union representative who has posted the notice and the date of the posting. Such person shall be required to remove the notice once it has served its purpose. The Union shall not post material of a political nature.

Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Section 1.07 - Union Membership
Employees have the right to join or to refrain from joining the Union. Neither the Employer nor the Union nor any of their respective agents or representatives shall discriminate against or interfere with the rights of employees to become or not become members of the Union, and further there shall be no discrimination or coercion against any employee because of Union membership or non-membership. The Union shall, in its responsibility as exclusive representative of the employees, represent all bargaining unit employees without discrimination, interference, restraint, or coercion.
Section 1.08 - Laborers Political League (L.P.L.) Deductions
The employer shall deduct a specified amount from the bi-weekly wages of all employees who have authorized, in writing, such deduction on a form designated and furnished by the Union for voluntary contributions to the Laborers Political League. Amounts deducted shall be separately accounted for and combined with the regular monthly dues deduction provided for in Subd. 1 of this Section and shall be transmitted to the Union in accordance with Subd. 4 of this Section.
Section 1.09 - Laborers Industrial Pension
The Employer and the Union explored the feasibility and processes necessary for implementation of the language and contributions required for employee participation in the Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund. The Employer and the Union determined that it was in the best interests of the employees to reduce their wages in order to allow Union members to participate in the Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund. The parties agree that the amount, which would otherwise be paid in salary or wages will be contributed instead to the Laborers' International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund as pre-tax employer contributions. The Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund is a supplemental pension fund authorized by Minnesota Statutes, Section 356.24, Subdivision 1(8) (2001). Employee wage reductions are the sole source of contributions to the Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund.
At the request of the Union, the employer agrees to re-open this provision of the contract annually to negotiate an additional allocation to the Laborers Industrial Pension Fund. The current pension contribution shall be one dollar and eighteen cents ($1.18) per hour for all hours paid. Effective January 1, 2016, the contribution shall be one dollar and thirty cents ($1.30) per hour for all hours paid. Effective January 1, 2017, the contribution shall be one dollar and forty-three ($1.43) per hour for all hours paid. The Employer shall pay this contribution directly to the Laborers’ International Union of North America National (Industrial) Pension Fund. The Union agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Employer, its officers, agents and employees harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders or judgments brought or issued against the Employer, its officers, agents and employees as a result of any action taken or not taken in reliance on the specific provisions of this section or which are taken or not taken at the request of the Union. This hold harmless clause does not hold the employer harmless for failing to electronically transfer the agreed upon contributions in the absence of the failure of the systems involved in the receipt or disbursement of the electronic transfers.

Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
For purposes of determining future wage rates, the Employer shall first restore the amount of the wage reduction, then apply the applicable wage multiplier, and then reduce the revised wage by the pension contribution amount.
Section 1.10 - Paid Union Leave
The employer agrees that upon written request from the union after approval of the membership, a designated employee shall be released from duty to perform union activities and paid at the top step Park Keeper Crew Leader rate along with all benefits as if s/he were continuing to be at work. In return, each covered employee shall have his or her compensatory balance reduced by three (3) hours annually. In the event an employee has insufficient hours in their compensatory bank their vacation bank shall be reduced by the balance needed up to three (3) hours. It is understood the released employee may be either a City or Park Board employee. Further, all of the designated employee(s) on a Union paid leave of absence approved by the Employer shall have full reinstatement rights to their original position, or a similar position, when returning from a union paid leave.
ARTICLE 2 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Union recognizes the right of the Employer to operate and manage its affairs in all respects in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of appropriate authorities. All rights and authority which the Employer has not officially abridged, delegated or modified by the express terms and provisions of this Agreement are retained by the Employer.
ARTICLE 3
NO STRIKE, NO LOCKOUT

SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
Section 4.01	- Scope
This article shall apply to all members of the bargaining unit.
Section 4.02	- Letter of Inquiry
Any employee may file a “letter of inquiry” which requests information on salary, working conditions and/or benefits. Such “letter of inquiry” is available from the business agent or steward. The business agent shall process the letter of inquiry. Where the business agent believes it necessary, he/she may request in writing from the Director, Employee Services or Labor Relations information to enable a response to the inquiry. The information requested shall be provided by the Director, Employee Services or Labor Relations within ten (10) workdays of receipt of the request. The business agent will respond to the member.
Section 4.03	- Informal Problem Resolution
From time to time, violations relating to the application of this agreement may arise. Many of these violations can be resolved informally. An alleged violation that cannot be resolved informally is called a grievance.

Subd. 1. Time Limits
Time limits, as specified in the grievance procedure, may be extended by written mutual agreement of the parties. The failure of the City to comply with any time limit herein means that the Union may automatically process the grievance to the next step of the grievance procedure. Failure of the Union or its employees to comply with any time limit herein renders the alleged violation untimely and no longer subject to the grievance procedure.
Subd. 2. Commencement of Grievance
A grievance must be commenced at step one no later than twenty-one (21) days from the Page 7 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
discovery of the grievable event(s) or fourteen (14) days from when the event(s) reasonably should have been discovered, or ten (10) days from the filing of a letter of inquiry, whichever is earlier.
Unless otherwise expressed, days shall mean calendar days.
Subd. 3. Grievance Forms
Forms for the grievance procedure will be developed jointly.
Subd. 4. Cooperation
The City will cooperate with the Union to expedite the grievance procedure to the maximum extent practical.
Section 4.05	- Step One (Immediate Supervisor)
An employee shall inform the immediate supervisor of the grievance in writing on the standard grievance form.
If an employee representative expressly requests a discussion with the immediate supervisor concerning the written grievance, such discussion shall take place within seven (7) days after filing the grievance unless the time is mutually extended. The discussion with the immediate supervisor shall be held with one of the following:
a.	The employee accompanied by a Union representative;
b.	The Union representative alone if the employee so requests.
Within ten (10) workdays after the grievance is filed or the discussion meeting concludes, whichever is later, the immediate supervisor shall state his/her decision, in writing, together with the supporting reasons, and shall furnish one (1) copy to the employee who filed the grievance, one (1) copy to the business agent, and one (1) copy to the Director, Employee Services or Labor Relations. Each step one decision shall be clearly identified as a “step one decision.”

Upon request of either party, all persons who participated at step one, or all necessary persons shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard at step two. If a meeting is requested by the Union, the department head shall schedule a meeting. Notification of at least three (3) workdays shall be given to the Union.
Within twenty (20) workdays after the meeting or the receipt of the appeal, whichever is later, the department head shall present a written decision to the Union. The step two decision shall clearly identify that answer as a “step two decision.”
Page 8 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Section 4.07	- Step Three (Director of Human Resources or his/her Designee)
If the step two decision is not satisfactory, a written appeal may be filed by the Union to the Director of Human Resources, or his/her designee, within ten (10) days of the date of the step two decision. Upon request of the Union, a meeting shall be held between the Director of Human Resources, or his/her designee, and a representative of the Union. The meeting shall be scheduled by the Director of Human Resources, or his/her designee, and held within twenty (20) days after receipt of the written appeal.
The Director of Human Resources, or his/her designee, shall have the full authority of the Mayor and the City Council to resolve the grievance.
Within twenty (20) workdays after the step three meeting or receipt of the step three appeal, whichever is later, the Director of Human Resources or his/her designee shall send a written response to the Union. The step three decision shall clearly identify that answer as a “step three decision.”
If the Parties have not resolved the grievance within seven (7) calendar days after the receipt of the Step three decision, the Union may initiate the arbitration process as provided for in Section 4.08 of this article. The Union shall notify the Human Resources Director or his/her designee of their intent to arbitrate the grievance. Once the Union has decided to arbitrate the matter, the Parties will identify the arbitrator pursuant to Section 4.08 and schedule a hearing date within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days.
By mutual agreement of the Parties, the grievance may be submitted to the Bureau of Mediation Services for grievance mediation. If the grievance is submitted for mediation, the timelines regarding initiating the arbitration process are waived until the completion of the grievance mediation process.
If the grievance remains unresolved after grievance mediation, the Union may initiate the arbitration process within seven (7) calendar days after the date of the mediation session. Notice of the initiation of the arbitration process shall be filed with the Human Resources Director or his/her designee.
Section 4.08	- Step Four (Regular Arbitration)
Within twenty (20) days of the date of the step three decision the Union shall have the right to submit the matter to arbitration by informing the Bureau of Mediation Services and the Director, Employee Services or Labor Relations that the matter is to be arbitrated.
If the matter is to be arbitrated, a single arbitrator shall be selected from the panel of mutually agreed upon arbitrators. The panel of arbitrators shall be determined by the parties within thirty (30) days of the ratification of this agreement. Arbitrators shall be selected from the panel on a rotating basis.
The arbitrator shall render a written decision and the reasons, therefore resolving the grievance, and order any appropriate relief within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties. The decision and award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Employer, the Union and the employee (s) affected.
Page 9 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
The arbitrator shall have no authority to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this agreement.
The arbitrator is also prohibited from making any decision that is contrary to law or to public policy.
Subd. 1. Pay During Proceeding
One representative of the Union, the Grievant and all necessary employee witnesses shall receive their regular salary and wages for the time spent in the arbitration proceeding if such proceeding is held during regular work hours.
Section 4.09	- Expedited Arbitration
The Union and the Employer may mutually agree to expedited arbitration. Upon such agreement, the Union and the Employer will make immediate (within twenty-four (24) hours) arrangements with the Bureau of Mediation Services for the expedited arbitration procedure and such procedure shall begin as soon as the Bureau can initiate a hearing. It shall be the specific request of both the Union and the Employer to have a decision within fourteen (14) days of the hearing, and that no briefs will be filed.
Section 4.10	- Mediation
The Parties may, by mutual agreement, utilize the grievance mediation process in an attempt to resolve a grievance before going to arbitration.
The objective of mediation is to find a mutually satisfactory resolution to the dispute. The parties shall mutually choose a mediator or have a mediator assigned by the Bureau of Mediation Services.

upon a remedy of the grievance at the mediation conference.
g.	One (1) Grievant will have the right to be present for each grievance.
h.	The issue mediated will be the same as the issue the parties have failed to resolve through the grievance process. The rules of evidence will not apply, and no transcript of the mediation conference shall be made.
i.	The mediator may meet separately with the parties during the mediation conference. The mediator will not have the authority to compel the resolution of a grievance.
j.	Written material presented to the mediator or to the other party shall be returned to the party presenting the material at the termination of the mediation conference, except that the mediator may retain one (1) copy of the written grievance to be used solely for the purposes of statistical analysis.

Employees covered by Civil Service systems created under Chapter 43a, 44, 375, 387, 419, or 420, by a Home Rule Charter under Chapter 410, or by laws 1941, Chapter 423, may pursue a grievance through the procedure established under this section.

Nothing in this contract shall prevent an employee from pursuing both a grievance under this contract and a charge of discrimination brought under Title VII, The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or the Equal Pay Act.
ARTICLE 5
DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
Section 5.01	- Just Cause
Disciplinary action may be imposed upon an employee who has satisfactorily completed the initial probationary period only for just cause. Discipline shall be imposed in a timely manner.
Section 5.02	- Progressive Discipline
Disciplinary action shall normally include only the following measures and, depending upon the seriousness of the offense and other relevant factors, shall normally be administered progressively in the following order:
Subd. 1. Reprimands, either oral or written;
Subd. 2. Suspension from duty without pay;
Subd. 3. Demotion in position and/or pay or discharge from employment.
If the Employer has reason to reprimand an employee, it shall normally not be done in the presence of other employees or the public. Oral reprimands shall not be grievable.
Section 5.03	- Discharge Due Process
No regular employee (i.e., an employee who has satisfactorily completed the initial probationary period) shall be discharged without having been afforded an opportunity to hear the reason(s) for the discharge and without an opportunity to offer an explanation of the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the events which preceded the discharge and/or any extenuating or mitigating circumstances which the Page 12 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
employee believes is relevant to the discharge decision. Whenever possible and practicable, such opportunities shall be provided in a conference with the Employer which shall be conducted after advance notice to the employee and his/her Union representative who shall be permitted to attend the conference. If a conference is to be conducted, the involved employee(s) shall remain in pay status until the conference has been completed.
Section 5.04	- Appeals
Disciplinary actions within the meaning of this article, excluding oral reprimands, imposed upon an employee who has completed the initial probationary period, may be appealed through the grievance procedure outlined elsewhere in this Agreement. Grievances filed concerning suspensions, demotions and/or discharges may be initiated at Step 2 of such procedure. Such matters shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the grievance procedure; and, if necessary, through the arbitration procedure.
Section 5.05	- Disciplinary Action Records
A written record of all disciplinary actions within the meaning of this article, excluding oral reprimands, shall be provided to the involved employee(s) and may be entered into the employee's personnel record. Investigations into conduct which do not result in disciplinary action, however, shall not be entered into the employee's personnel record. When a disciplinary action more severe than a written reprimand is imposed, the Employer shall notify the employee in writing of the specific reason(s) for such action at the time such action is taken and provide the Union with an informational copy. Written reprimands shall not be relied upon to form the basis for further disciplinary action after two (2) years following the date of the written reprimand. In addition, an employee may request that a written reprimand be removed from their personnel file and destroyed once during the term of their employment with the Employer provided that three (3) years have passed from the date the written reprimand was issued and there has been no subsequent discipline. Upon such a request, the matter shall be removed to a “disputed information” file kept by the Human Resources department for destruction processing. The right to have a written reprimand removed and destroyed will not exist where the underlying infraction that caused the discipline was the violation of another individual’s civil rights; e.g. sexual harassment, race discrimination, gender discrimination. Such matters will remain as an active file in the employee’s official personnel file.
Section 5.06	- Disciplined Employee's Response
Any employee who is disciplined by written reprimand, suspension, demotion or discharge (and/or such employee's Union representative) shall be entitled to have a written response, if any, included in their personnel record, if filed with the Employer within twenty (20) calendar days of the issuance thereof.
Section 5.07	- Union Representation
Employees have the right to request Union representation if they are formally questioned during an investigation into conduct that may lead to disciplinary action. Employees may be represented by designated and certified Union stewards and/or other Union representatives. However, if the employee desires representation, it is the employee’s responsibility to ensure representation at the appointed time.
Page 13 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Designated and certified Union stewards and/or other Union representatives shall be granted reasonable time off, with pay, in order to represent such employees. It shall be the Employer’s policy to inform its managers and supervisors that employees must be advised of that right before formal questioning.

Effective for employee’s hired on or after January 1, 1998, city seniority is defined as the length of uninterrupted employment with the Employer and based on the date of the employee’s first day of employment.
Subd. 2. Classification Seniority Defined

Subd. 3. Seniority During Workers' Compensation Absences
City and classification seniority shall not be lost and shall continue to accumulate without limitation during all workers' compensation absences.
Subd. 4. Ties in Seniority
Ties in classification seniority shall be broken by City seniority. Ties in City seniority shall be broken by rank if available. If employee rank is not available ties shall be broken randomly by computer.
Section 6.02	- System Seniority Credit
Upon hiring an applicant who was previously employed by the Minneapolis Board of Education and/or the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the Employer shall grant City and classification seniority credit for all purposes provided such applicant's employment is continuous between such Boards and the Employer and to the extent that such Boards afford reciprocal recognition of seniority credit to the employees covered by this Agreement.
Page 14 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Section 6.03	- Seniority as a result of Mergers or Collapsing of Titles
Employees shall retain their respective classification seniority when merging or collapsing titles under the same jurisdiction and grade level.
When merging or collapsing titles where the result provides a promotion or is cross-jurisdictional, classification seniority shall be established as the date the new title becomes effective. Further, affected employees shall retain their relative seniority amongst each other in the new title with the grade level establishing seniority between grades merged; highest grade has the greatest seniority.
Section 6.04	- Loss of Seniority
An employee's seniority shall be lost and his/her employment shall be terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following:

An applicant's eligibility for promotion begins on the date their name was added to a
Page 15 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Requisition List. Job Postings for newly created positions and/or for positions for which the title, salary, nature of work to be performed and/or minimum qualifications are materially different from the Job Postings previously used, shall not be finalized by the Employer until the affected Union representative has had an opportunity to review the proposed Job Posting and provide the Union's input into the Job Posting development process. A copy of the Job Posting in its final form shall be furnished to the Union.
Subd. 2. Stated Qualifications
The minimum qualifications set forth in the Job Posting shall be related to the job duties of the involved position and shall include applicable education, training, experience, skills and abilities required. Such minimum qualifications shall not, however, include artificial and/or irrelevant time-in-grade, promotional line and/or grade level requirements.
Subd. 3. Application for Promotion
All employees may make application for any Job Posting provided they meet the minimum, stated qualifications for the involved position; provided, however, that employees who have failed a promotional probationary period in a classification shall not be permitted to take an examination for promotion to that classification within twelve (12) months of the date of such failure. If an employee who has not successfully completed his/her initial probationary period, the City and the Union shall, on a case by case basis, meet and determine the length of probation and wage.
Subd. 4. Job Postings
The Employer may, in its discretion, conduct an External Job Posting (i.e., one which includes employee and non-employee or outside applicants) in the event there are fewer than seven (7) internal applicants who meet the stated minimum Job Posting requirements for positions below grade level seven (7) or fewer than ten (10) such internal applicants for all other positions. In such cases, all internal qualified applicants shall be permitted to take the required examination and in all cases, the Employer may advertise an open position internally and externally simultaneously and a maximum of seven (7) outside applicants may be tested. For purposes of this article, applicants from the Minneapolis Board of Education and the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board shall be considered as "outside" applicants.

Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
the basis of the applicants' City seniority and on the basis of an objective review of each applicant's relevant education, training and experience, i.e., an application review and/or on the basis of successive testing limitations subject to the following provisions:
a.	If seniority/application review limitations apply, an equal number of applicants shall be selected on the basis of seniority and application review, respectively.
b.	If successive testing limitations apply, tested applicants shall be selected for further testing on the basis of their actual test scores and the highest scoring applicants only shall be further tested.
c.	If either of the testing limitations described above are to be used, the details of the limitation(s) shall be outlined by the Job Posting referred to in Section 7.02, Subd. 1 of this article.
When utilized, the Employer may elect to test all or any percentages of the applicants for any given Job Posting on the announced basis.
Subd. 3. Examination Scores
Applicants shall receive a total examination score, the components of which shall be weighted as follows:
a.	Eighty percent (80%) of the total examination score shall be based upon the results of each applicant's test score(s). Such tests shall be developed by the Employer and may consist of more than one component.
b.	Twenty percent (20%) of the total examination score shall be based upon each applicant's relative seniority standing with the Employer.
In the event an internal applicant is tested pursuant to an External Job Posting, one hundred percent (100%) of the total examination score shall be based upon the results of the applicant's test score(s).
Section 7.04 - Eligibles and Requisition Lists
Subd. 1. Passing Score
Each applicant whose 1) total examination score and 2) test score(s) as defined in Section 7.03, Subd. 3 of this article equals or exceeds seventy percent (70%) shall be considered to have passed the examination. There is no passing score for the seniority component.
Subd. 2. Requisition List - Job Postings

Page 17 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
if applicable. In the event two (2) or more eligibles hold identical total examination scores, their names shall be placed on the Requisition List in random order; however, the names of veterans shall always be placed over the names of non-veterans who hold identical scores.
Subd. 3. List Expiration
The staffing division of the Human Resources Department shall inform applicants of the length of their eligibility by stating it on the job posting and/or by letter.
Section 7.05 - Selection of Certified Eligibles
The seven (7) highest scoring eligibles on a Requisition List shall be certified to the appointing authority for selection on promotional examinations. On External Job Postings, the three (3) highest scoring eligibles from the bargaining unit will be certified to the appointing authority for selection along with any of the eligibles on the eligibility list which may be certified to the appointing authority for selection. In the event the expanded certification procedures outlined by Section 7.05 of this Agreement are in effect, up to three (3) additional eligibles who are women, minorities and/or protected class members may be certified to the appointing authority for selection. Any of the eligibles certified to the appointing authority may be selected to fill the vacant position. The name of the eligible selected shall be removed from the Requisition List.
Section 7.06 - Probationary Periods
An eligible selected to fill a vacant position shall serve an initial or promotional probationary period as applicable. All initial probationary periods shall normally be twelve (12) months in duration and all promotional probationary periods shall be three (3) months in duration provided that promotional probationary periods may be extended for up to an additional three (3) months upon prior notice to the involved employee with a copy to the Union. An employee may be removed from the position at the discretion of the appointing authority. Such removal shall not be subject to the grievance/arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Removal during an employee's initial probationary period shall result in termination of employment. An employee removed during a promotional probationary period, however, shall have the right to return to a vacant position in his/her previous classification or, if none is available, to his/her previous position. For purposes of this section, one (1) month shall be deemed to be one hundred seventy-four (174) hours of work. Time spent in temporary duty in the position immediately preceding the appointment shall count toward satisfaction of the probationary period, benefits eligibility (without retroactivity), and pay progression requirements.
Section 7.07 - Position Audit and Class Maintenance Studies
Subd. 1. Position Audit
Unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, an employee who believes their individual position has changed due to gradual changes over a period of time in the kind, responsibility, or difficulty of the work performed may request that their position be audited to assure proper classification. To request a position audit, the employee must submit a Job Analysis Questionnaire provided by the Human Resources Department. Requests for study of an employee’s individual position
Page 18 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
may be submitted no more than once per every 24 calendar months unless the Parties agree that substantial changes have occurred in the position justifying the need for a new audit.
If the audit results in a reclassification of the individual position, no vacancy shall be deemed to have been created. Upon reclassification to a position providing a higher maximum salary, the incumbent employee shall be appointed to the reclassified position and the incumbent employee's pay shall be determined in accordance with Section 9.03, Subd. 1 of this Agreement. The effective date of the reclassification for pay and seniority purposes shall be the date upon which the involved employee submitted a properly completed request for reclassification to the Employer's Human Resources Department with a copy to the involved Department Head or Manager. The provisions of this section shall apply only to the incumbent employee who has been permanently certified to the involved position.
Upon reclassification to a position providing a lower maximum salary, the involved incumbent employee may request that the reclassification be considered to be a layoff. If so requested, the provisions of Article 8 (Layoff and Recall From Layoff) shall be applied. In the alternative, the involved incumbent employee may elect to remain in the reclassified position and the incumbent employee's pay shall be “frozen” until such time as the new wage exceeds the old wage.
Subd. 2. Class Maintenance Studies
The Employer may initiate class maintenance studies related to a specific class or a group of positions within a department/division as needed to maintain the integrity of the Employer’s classification system. The Employer will consider requests by the Union to initiate such studies. The format of these studies may include an informal survey of changes in the kind, responsibility, or difficulty of work performed since the classification was last studied or an in-depth study of the changes in the kind, responsibility, or difficulty of work performed since the classification was last studied.
If a class or group of positions is reclassified pursuant to a class maintenance study to a class providing a higher maximum salary, no vacancy shall be deemed to have been created. Upon reclassification, the incumbent employees shall be appointed to the reclassified position and the incumbent employee’s pay shall be determined in accordance with Section 9.03, Subd. 1 of this Agreement. The effective date of the reclassification for pay purposes shall be January 1st of the calendar year following completion of the study. Incumbent employees shall maintain the classification seniority date of their previous classification as the classification seniority date of the new classification. The provisions of this section shall apply only to the incumbent employees who have been permanently certified to the involved positions.
If a class or group of positions are reclassified pursuant to a class maintenance study to a class providing a lower maximum salary, the involved incumbent employees may request that the reclassification be considered to be a layoff. If so requested, the provisions of Article 8 (Layoff and Recall From Layoff) shall be applied. In the alternative, the involved incumbent employees may elect to remain in the reclassified position and their pay shall be “frozen” until such time as the new wage exceeds the old wage.
Human Resources will develop an ongoing schedule of class maintenance studies that provides for a maintenance study on a rotating basis at least every four (4) calendar years. Such studies may be done

Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
more frequently as needed to maintain the integrity of the classification system.
Section 7.08 - Lateral Transfers
Employees may request to be transferred to a vacant position within their classification in another division of the Public Works Department and may be transferred pursuant to such request with the written approval of their division head, the involved appointing authority and the Employer's Director, Employee Services or Labor Relations. Such transferred employees shall serve a three (3) month probationary period in the new position. If removed by the appointing authority during the probationary period, the involved employee shall be reassigned to a vacant position within the classification or, if none is available, to their previous position.
Section 7.09 - Permits and Details
The Employer may select employees for temporary duty in other classifications and/or positions (details) and/or utilize temporary employees (permits) for periods not to exceed the length of an incumbent employee's absence or six (6) consecutive calendar months, or Item 4. Below, whichever is longer. Such limitations shall not be exceeded except by the express written mutual agreement between the Parties.
The Employer may also solicit temporary workers with needed skills through the Local 563 Hiring Hall. Such workers:
1.	Unless otherwise agreed to in advance by the Parties, the number of “temporary Local 563 workers shall not exceed 30% of the total number of available Seasonal Construction and Maintenance Laborers workforce.
2.	Will be “at-will” employees, with no expectation for continued employment;
3.	Will not be subject to other terms and conditions of this agreement, except Section 8.01, Subd. 1;
4.	Will not be used to supplant positions budgeted for Local 363 members unless the budgeted position(s) becomes available after the beginning of the construction season and there are no eligible candidates on a certified list;
5.	Will not be for more than the construction season unless there are no qualified and interested members of Local 363;
6.	Will not be provided with overtime opportunities, except under the following conditions below; however, temporary workers will always be considered the least senior member(s) of the crew:
a.	Daily work in progress; or
b.	Weekly work in progress when there is a reason for work unit continuity. If there is a perceived violation of this specific item, the Union may request a “meet and confer” with the Employer; however, the decision of the Employer shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure contained in Article 4.

Section 7.10 - Master Transfer List: Assignment to Year Round Positions for PWSW-l’s Resulting in Status Change from Seasonal to Regular
Seasonal Public Works Service Worker-1’s (PWSW-1’s) will be offered year round positions where they exist in Public Works, and permanent intermittent positions in the Solid Waste & Recycling (SW&R) Division based on their classification seniority on the Master Transfer List as administered by Human Resources.
Further, Seasonal PWSW-1’s who transfer to permanent intermittent positions in SW&R shall, in order of their start date in SW&R, become permanent (HRIS regular status) PWSW-1’s in SW&R. The Parties acknowledge that some permanent intermittent PWSW-1’s in SW&R may experience diminished work hours and be subject to temporary or seasonal layoffs based on their seniority as a permanent intermittent PWSW-1, and be subject to the provisions of Section 17.04.
The Employer agrees to meet and confer with the Union before making changes to the administration of the Master Transfer List.
ARTICLE 8 LAYOFF AND RECALL FROM LAYOFF
Section 8.01	- Layoffs and Bumping
Whenever any permanent position is to be abolished or it becomes necessary because of lack of funds, lack of work to reduce the number of employees in the classified service in any department, the department head shall immediately report such pending layoffs to the City Coordinator or his/her designated representative. The status of involved employees shall be determined by the following provisions and the involved employees will be notified.
Subd. 1. General Order of Layoff
Layoffs shall be made in the following manner:
1.	Permit employees shall be first laid off;
2.	Temporary employees (those certified to temporary positions) shall next be laid off;
3.	Persons appointed to permanent positions shall then be laid off.
Subd. 2. Layoff Based on Classification Seniority Within Division
The employee first laid off shall be the employee who has the least amount of classification seniority in the classification in which reductions are to be made. Provided, however, employees retained must be deemed qualified to perform the required work and employees who possess unique skills or qualifications which would otherwise be denied the Employer may be retained regardless of
Page 21 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
their relative seniority standing. For the purposes of this article, there shall be separate seniority between permanent year-round employees and permanent intermittent employees.
Subd. 3. Bumping
Employees who are laid off shall have their names placed on a layoff list for their classification. Such employees who have at least two (2) years of City seniority shall have the right to displace (bump) the employee of lesser City seniority who was last certified to classifications previously held permanently (i.e., one in which the probationary period was satisfactorily completed) by the laid off employee and in which job performance was deemed by the Employer to be satisfactory which is lower than the original classification of the laid off employee; however, there shall be no bumping or displacements across divisional lines. In all cases, however, the bumping employee must meet the current minimum qualifications of the claimed position and must be qualified to perform the required work.
Section 8.02	- Notice of Layoff
The Employer shall make every reasonable effort under the circumstances to provide affected employees with at least fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice prior to the contemplated effective date of a layoff.
Section 8.03	- Recall from Layoff
An employee in the classified service who has been laid off may be re-employed without examination in a vacant position of the same class within three (3) years of the effective date of the layoff. Similarly, an employee who has been placed in the seasonal labor pool due to reductions within a year round division may be re-employed to a year round vacant position within the division from which he/she was removed.
In all cases, however, the recalled employee must continue to maintain the minimum qualifications required of them as of the date of their layoff and must be qualified to perform the required work. The Employer shall make reasonable efforts to assure the more senior employees are working.
Failure to receive an appointment within three (3) years will result in the eligibles name being removed from the list.
Section 8.04	- Application and Scope
For purposes of this article, bargaining unit employees may displace (bump) non-bargaining unit employees. Further, non-bargaining unit employees shall be permitted to displace bargaining unit employees. Specifically, the provisions of this article respecting layoff, bumping and recall, shall be applicable to those employees excluded from the bargaining unit by virtue of their supervisory or confidential status.

Section 8.05	- Exceptions
The following exceptions may be observed:
Subd. 1. Mutual Agreement
If the Employer and the Union agree upon a basis for layoff and reemployment in a certain position or group of positions and such agreement is approved by the City Coordinator or his/her designated representative, employees will be laid off and re-employed upon that basis.
Subd. 2. Emergency Retention
Regardless of the priority of layoff, an employee may be retained on an emergency basis for up to fourteen (14) calendar days longer to complete an assignment.

Page 23 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
b.	Job classes shall be established which group positions that have identical or similar primary duties. Within each classification, the nature of the work shall be significantly different from other job classes.
c.	Positions shall be classified based upon their job-related contributions and/or assessed value to the Employer’s functions.
d.	New positions shall be evaluated and placed into job classes based upon a comparison of the similarity of the assigned duties to other positions in the job class. New positions shall be placed into existing job classes unless the duties or conditions of employment are found to be substantially different from other existing classes in the classified service.
e.	The MCSC shall maintain appropriate records relating to classification studies and actions, and shall maintain a written class specification for each job class in the classified service describing typical duties and responsibilities of positions in the job class.
f.	The MCSC, in coordination with the Employer's Affirmative Action Program, shall assign appropriate Federal Job Category (FJC) designations to each job class.
Disputes respecting the classification of jobs within any bargaining unit shall be directed to the MCSC for review and final action. No dispute respecting the classification of jobs shall be subject to the grievance/arbitration provisions of this Agreement. In the event, either by law or otherwise, the MCSC loses its legal authority to administer the Employer's job classification system during the life of this Agreement, the provisions of this section shall be null and void and the Parties shall meet and negotiate with one another, at the request of either of them, over an appeal procedure or other job classification dispute resolution process.
Section 9.02	- Pay Progressions
Subd. 1. General
All employees shall be hired at the Initial Rate (probationary step) and remain at that step through their first four (4) months of employment. Thereafter, they may be advanced according to the following schedule:
Months 5 through 12 shall be paid at the First Step Rate
Months 13 through 18 shall be paid at Step Two, and thereafter the employee shall be eligible for advancement at the end of each 6-month period.
Any increase beyond the twelfth (12th) month rate may be withheld or delayed in cases where the employee's job performance has been of a less than satisfactory level in which case the employee shall be notified that the increase is being withheld or delayed and of the specific reasons therefore. All such denials or delays shall be grievable under the provisions of Article 4 (Settlement of Disputes) in this Agreement. All increases approved pursuant to this section shall be made effective on the work day immediately following the employee's meeting of these eligibility requirements. All increases approved
Page 24 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
pursuant to this section shall be made effective at the beginning of the pay period nearest the anniversary date.
Subd. 2. Water Treatment Plant Operator
Water Treatment Plant Operators hired after February 9, 1992 must obtain a Class "D" Water Treatment Operator license within eighteen (18) months of hire. Failure to secure such license shall result in the termination of employment. A Class "D" license must be obtained before advancing to the third pay progression step.
Section 9.03	- Advances and Transfers
Subd. 1. Pay Upon Promotion
The salary of an employee who advances from one grade to a higher grade shall be the increment nearest the salary last received by such employee in the lower classification plus 5%. For the purpose of this section “wage“ shall include, the higher of the average wage, excluding shift differentials, of the prior forty (40) work days immediately preceding the detail or promotion or the higher of the dual certifications held whichever is higher. The employee shall be advanced thereafter in accordance with Section 9.02 (Pay Progressions) of this article. The provisions of this subdivision shall also be applicable whenever an employee is detailed to perform all or substantially all of the duties of a higher-paid classification but they shall not be applicable to the apprenticeship progressions set forth in Appendix "A" of this Agreement. However, in all instances the employee’s rate of pay while serving in the detail shall be calculated using his/her anniversary date in his/her last permanently certified classification. Apprentice employees shall be compensated at the appropriate step based upon their actual paid service within the meaning of Section 9.02 (Pay Progressions) of this Agreement and the number of service hours at each apprentice level. An employee who voluntarily demotes to their previously held position within twelve (12) calendar months following promotion shall be returned to the same pay step which was applicable immediately prior to the promotion.
Subd. 2. Pay Upon Transfer
When an employee attains a position in another classification which provides for an identical pay progression schedule he/she shall retain the same pay step as was applicable in his/her previous position and the employee shall retain the same anniversary date for future pay increase effective dates.
Subd. 3. Pay Upon Demotion
The salary of an employee who voluntarily demotes shall be placed on the salary step on which they would be if they remained in their position.
The salary of an employee who is demoted for disciplinary reasons from one classification to another which provides for a lower maximum salary, shall be the same step which the employee had before the promotion; however, the employee shall not be placed on a step which provides for a lower salary than the employee had prior to the demotion.

Subd. 1. Normal Work Day and Work Week Configuration
The normal workday shall be eight (8) hours of work and the normal workweek, regardless of shift arrangements, shall be an average of forty (40) hours of work. Nothing herein shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week.
Subd. 2. Departures From the Normal Work Schedule
Should it be necessary for the department to temporarily establish work schedules departing from the normal work schedule, seventy two (72) hours of notice of such change shall be given to the employee and the Union. This notice requirement shall be waived in the event of a bona fide emergency, as determined by the Employer that could not be foreseen. In such event the Employer shall give notice as soon as is reasonably practicable.
Subd. 3. Ten-hour Schedule Pilot Program (Current Contract Duration Only)
If the Employer has a need to establish a ten (10) hour day four day a week regular work schedule, the schedules shall be filled by first requesting volunteers in order of seniority from among the qualified employees. If there are an insufficient number of volunteers, the Employer may assign qualified employees in reverse seniority order. Under such assignments, employees will be eligible for overtime at the rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times their regular hourly rate of pay after ten (10) hours in a workday, or after forty (40) hours of work, inclusive of sick, vacation, and holiday pay. Such
Page 26 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
employees shall also be eligible for overtime at the rate of two (2) times their regular hourly rate of pay on the 6th and 7th consecutive workday inclusive of sick, vacation, and holiday pay. Additionally, such schedules and employees shall be subject to the following:
a.	The affected employees will be provided with fourteen (14) or more calendar days of notice before the effective date of the schedule.
b.	The notice will clearly identify the days to be worked, and the schedule will consist of consecutive days of work from Monday through Friday.
c.	The notice will project the duration of the schedule.
d.	If the project is to end prior to the projected duration, employees will be provided with at least fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice.
e.	While the schedule is in effect, employees will be assured work unless work is canceled due to inclement weather.
f.	Employees will be required to use ten (10) hours of accrued leave time for each day of sick or vacation used.
g.	Employees will be granted eight (8) hours of pay for each paid holiday; however, the employee may use up to two (2) hours of vacation or compensatory pay to complete their workweek.
Section 10.02 - Rest Periods
One fifteen (15) minute break in the morning shall be granted at a time compatible with the state or progress of the job as defined by the Foreman. The break shall be taken on the work site unless explicitly permitted otherwise by the Foreman with the concurrence of the General Foreman.

Section 10.04 - Show-Up Time
Employees not otherwise notified who report for regularly scheduled work at the job site or at an equipment dispatching site shall receive two (2) hours pay. To qualify for such show-up time pay, the employee shall be obligated to remain on the work site until such time as released by the Foreman, and to work during this time if called upon to do so by the Foreman. If required to work into the third hour or any succeeding hour, the employee shall receive pay for the full hour. Employees shall be permitted to use available vacation up to eight (8) hours (less show-up time pay and pay for hours actually worked) for days upon which they are prevented from working because of rain. Such provisions, however, do not apply to Solid Waste and Recycling Division task assignment employees.
Section 10.05 - Catastrophic Events, Disasters, and Emergencies
In the event of a major disaster or catastrophe (not Snow Emergencies as defined by City Ordinance), assignment protocol is suspended; employees work as assigned without regard to seniority. Overtime
Page 27 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
shall be paid after forty (40) hours at one-and- one half (1 ^) times their hourly rate and double time after forty eight (48) hours of work. The employer shall make a reasonable effort to notify the union prior to implementing this provision.
Section 10.06 - Overtime
For the purpose of this section vacation, sick leave, funeral leave and holidays shall be considered as time worked.
Subd. 1. Overtime Work and Pay
Employees may be required to work a reasonable amount of overtime as assigned by the Employer. All overtime work must be approved in advance. Further, the employer shall make an attempt to accommodate employees when working overtime creates a hardship for them. In no case shall overtime pay be granted to employees in grades twelve (12) and above. Overtime pay shall be granted to employees at the rate of one and one-half (P/2) times their regular hourly rate of pay for all time worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day or for all time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week and at the rate of two (2) times their regular hourly rate of pay for all time worked on the seventh (7th) consecutive day of actual work. Thereafter, upon the employee’s written request and subject to approval by the employer, overtime pay shall be banked as compensatory time up to a maximum of sixty-four (64) hours, unless the City Council has authorized up to one hundred twenty (120) hours for employees assigned to work on a special project basis or has authorized pay for compensatory time on a special project basis when funds are available for such purposes.
Due to their unique schedule, Water Treatment Plant Operators at the Water Department will only receive the seventh (7th) day premium if the seventh (7th) day is within the same workweek.
Subd. 2. Regular Rates of Pay and Overtime Calculations
a.	Compensatory time used will not be included in the calculation of hours worked for the purpose of reaching overtime thresholds;
b.	Approved sick, bereavement, jury duty, paid holidays, and accrued vacation leaves from work will be included in the calculation of hours worked for the purpose of reaching daily and weekly overtime thresholds;
c.	Employees may replace compensatory time used with accrued vacation time to meet the weekly overtime threshold. An employee may not use this provision to accrue or increase a negative balance of vacation time. This replacement must be done within the payroll period in which the overtime is worked;
d.	Hourly premiums, shift differentials, hazard pay, longevity and any other negotiated pay benefits will be included in the calculation of the employee’s “regular rate of pay;”
e.	All eligible paid leave time is eligible for overtime earnings when the total paid hours within a work week exceeds forty (40) hours, regardless of the sequential order of the applied leave;
Page 28 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
f.	The Employer shall calculate the regular rate of pay for overtime payments in accordance with the U.S. Department of Labor’s guidance on the FLSA;
g.	“Seventh day worked” means seven consecutive days of actual work (any day where work is performed for 4 hours or more) independent of the Employer’s pay periods;
h.	The seventh day worked premium rate of pay of two (2) times the weekly regular rate of pay will be paid for all work performed on the seventh consecutive day of actual work, notwithstanding the timing of pay periods or unscheduled shift changes, except where specifically exempted within other negotiated agreements. The extension of a shift into the next pay day shall not be counted as a separate day of work. Use of any paid time off of more than four (4) hours on any work day within the seven consecutive days is disqualifying for the seventh day worked premium, though the employee remains eligible for the regular time and a half overtime premiums if the work exceeds forty (40) hours in any work week.
i.	All seventh day worked premium earnings will be paid in cash; no compensatory time earned will be granted in lieu of cash compensation for this premium.
Subd. 3. No Duplication
There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of overtime and/or premium rates of pay under the provisions of this Agreement. Compensation shall not be paid more than once for the same hours under any provisions of this Agreement.
Subd. 4. Assignment of Overtime
Unless an established procedure exists to the contrary, overtime opportunities will be offered first on a seniority basis and then assigned based on reverse seniority.
Subd. 5. Emergency Response Pay
Water Works employees when responding to a Chlorine or Ammonia emergency which requires the use of Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (S.C.B.A.) will receive two (2) times their rate of pay for the time actually worked to resolve the emergency. Each employee required to use a S.C.B.A. in such situations shall be compensated for a minimum of four (4) hours at this rate.
Subd. 6. Employees Who Regularly Work Weekends
Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, those employees who are regularly scheduled to work on weekends shall work their regularly scheduled shift and their regular, year round work schedules shall take the number of holidays referenced in Section 12.03 of this Agreement into account in determining the total number of days off per year. Such employees shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (P/2) times their regular rates of pay if required to work on any actual holiday. Holidays falling on weekends shall not be observed on Fridays and/or Mondays by such employees.
Page 29 of 55
Laborers Local 363 • 2015-2017
Further, Water Works employees shall be paid at a rate of two (2) times their regular rate of pay when called in or held over to work on said Holidays.
Subd. 7. Twelve-hour Shifts
On occasions when employees are required to work a twelve-hour shift or longer, the shift shall include a paid lunch period.
Section 10.07 - Standby Pay: Certain Sewer Maintenance Employees
In the event certain Sewer Maintenance Division employees are required to stand by for duty during normal off-duty hours, they shall be compensated in accordance with the following schedule:
Mondays through Fridays:	2 Hours Straight-Time Pay/Day
Saturdays and Sundays:	5 Hours Straight-Time Pay/Day
Holidays:	8 Hours Straight-Time Pay/Day
Employees shall also be paid for hours actually worked during such standby periods at the appropriate rate of pay. Standby compensation paid in accordance with the above schedule (exclusive of pay for hours actually worked) shall not be construed as pay for hours worked for overtime or any other purpose.
Section 10.08 - Inclement Weather
The Employer may temporarily suspend all or a portion of its normal operation in response to inclement weather or other emergency conditions. Such interruptions may be on an official basis as determined by the Employer's Mayor and/or Council President in which case closure announcements shall be made by the Employer through internal means and, where appropriate or necessary, be broadcast by WCCO-AM radio (830 kHz) and/or other suitable public media or on an unofficial basis as determined by lower authority in which case employees will be notified at the job site. Employees shall be permitted to draw upon accumulated vacation or sick leave benefits or accumulated compensatory time, at their option, to the full extent of the lost compensation due to any interruption in scheduled work.

Upon return to work, employees shall be credited for time served on workers' compensation (those returning to active employment after January 1, 1995) or disability pension as the result of disability incurred on the job. Such time shall be used for the purpose of determining the amount of vacation to which they are entitled each year thereafter.
Subd. 4. Credit During Military Leaves of Absence
Employees returning from approved military leaves of absence shall be entitled to vacation credit as provided in applicable Minnesota statutes.
Section 11.03	- Eligibility: Intermittent and Part-Time Employees

If the employee is not able to regain his/her license, including the CDL when applicable, within thirty (30) days, the employee will be assigned work not requiring a license or CDL, when applicable, at the sole discretion of the Employer. Such assignment will not result in “bumping”, and the assigned employee will be paid at the appropriate rate for the title in which he/she is assigned. If no such work assignment is available, the employee will be placed on unpaid administrative leave for up to one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the loss of the license or CDL or until the employee regains his/her license or CDL, whichever is less.

Subd. 3. Second Loss of Driver’s License, including CDL
Any employee losing his/her license for a second time may be subject to termination. When considering whether to terminate, the Employer shall consider the following:
a.	The employee’s work record, length of employment, performance,
b.	The reason for the loss of license, and
c.	The likely duration of the loss of license
The decision to terminate or identify additional options shall be solely at the discretion of the Employer.
Subd. 4. Special provisions for employees originally hired without a DL or CDL requirement
For the purpose of this section employees who regain the driving privileges that were required of them for their initial hire shall be recalled from layoff.

ATTACHMENT “A”
LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Reasonable Drug and Alcohol Testing
1.	PURPOSE STATEMENT - Abuse of drugs and alcohol is a nationwide problem. It affects persons of every age, race, sex and ethnic group. It poses risks to the health and safety of employees of the City of Minneapolis and to the public. To reduce those risks, the City has adopted this LOA concerning drugs and alcohol in the workplace. This LOA establishes standards concerning drugs and alcohol which all employees must meet and it establishes a testing procedure to ensure that those standards are met.
This drug and alcohol testing LOA is intended to conform to the provisions of the Minnesota Drug and Alcohol Testing in the Workplace Act (Minnesota Statutes §181.950 through 181.957), as well as the requirements of the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-690, Title V, Subtitle D) and related federal regulations. Nothing in this LOA shall be construed as a limitation upon the Employer's obligation to comply with federal law and regulations regarding drug and alcohol testing.
The Human Resources Director is directed to develop and maintain procedures for the implementation and ongoing maintenance of this LOA and to establish training on this LOA and applicable law.
2.	WORK RULES
A.	No employee shall be under the influence of any drug or alcohol while the employee is working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery, or equipment, except pursuant to a legitimate medical reason or when approved by the Employer as a proper law enforcement activity.
B.	No employee shall use, possess, sell or transfer drugs, alcohol or drug paraphernalia while the employee is working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment, except pursuant to a legitimate medical reason, as determined by the Medical Review Officer, or when approved by the Employer as a proper law enforcement activity.
C.	No employee, while on duty, shall engage or attempt to engage or conspire to engage in conduct which would violate any law or ordinance concerning drugs or alcohol, regardless of whether a criminal conviction results from the conduct.
D.	As a condition of employment, no employee shall engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the Employer's workplace.
E.	As a condition of employment, every employee must notify the Employer of any criminal drug statute conviction no later than five (5) days after such conviction.
F.	Any employee who receives a criminal drug statute conviction, if not discharged from employment, must within thirty (30) days satisfactorily participate in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for such purposes by a federal, state or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.
G.	The Employer shall notify the granting agency within ten (10) days after receiving notice of a criminal drug statute conviction from an employee or otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction.
Page 1 of 10
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
3.	PERSONS SUBJECT TO TESTING
Unless otherwise specified, all employees are subject to testing under applicable sections of this LOA. However, no person will be tested for drugs or alcohol under this LOA without the person's consent. The Employer can request or require an individual to undergo drug or alcohol testing only under the circumstances described in this LOA.
4.	CIRCUMSTANCES FOR DRUG OR ALCOHOL TESTING
A.	Reasonable Suspicion Testing. The Employer may, but does not have a legal duty to, request or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the Employer or any supervisor of the employee has a reasonable suspicion (a belief based on specific facts and rational inferences drawn from those facts) related to the performance of the job that the employee:
1.	Is under the influence of drugs or alcohol while the employee is working or while the employee is on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery, or equipment; or
2.	Has used, possessed, sold, purchased or transferred drugs, alcohol or drug paraphernalia while the employee was working or while the employee was on the Employer's premises or operating the Employer's vehicle, machinery or equipment; or
3.	Has sustained a personal injury as that term is defined in Minnesota Statutes §176.011, Subd. 16, or has caused another person to die or sustain a personal injury; or
4.	Was operating or helping to operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work-related accident resulting in property damage or personal injury and the Employer or investigating supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that the cause of the accident may be related to the use of drugs or alcohol.
Whenever it is possible and practical to do so, more than one Agent of the Employer shall be involved in reasonable suspicion determinations under this LOA.
B.	Treatment Program Testing - The Employer may request or require an employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing if the employee is referred for chemical dependency treatment by reason of having a positive test result under this LOA or is participating in a chemical dependency treatment program under an employee benefit plan. In such case, the employee may be required to submit to drug or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following notification that he/she will be subjected to Treatment Program Testing.
C.	Unannounced Testing by Agreement - The Employer may request or require an employee to submit to drug and alcohol testing without prior notice on terms and conditions established by a written “lastchance” agreement between the Employer and employee’s collective bargaining representative.
D.	Testing Pursuant to Federal Law - The Employer may request or require an employee to submit to testing as may be necessary to comply with federal law and regulations. It is the intent of this LOA that federal law preempts both state drug and alcohol testing laws and City policies and agreements. If this
Page 2 of 10
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
LOA conflicts with federal law or regulations, federal law and regulations shall prevail. If there are conflicts between federal regulations and this LOA, attributed in part to revisions to the law or changes in interpretations, and when those changes have not been updated or accurately reflected in this policy, the federal law shall prevail.
5.	REFUSAL TO UNDERGO TESTING
A.	Right to Refuse - Employees have the right to refuse to undergo drug and alcohol testing. If an employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing requested or required by the Employer, no such test shall be given.
B.	Consequences of Refusal - If any employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing requested or required by the Employer, the Employer may subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including discharge from employment.
C.	Refusal on Religious Grounds - No employee who refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing of a blood sample upon religious grounds shall be deemed to have refused unless the employee also refuses to undergo alternative drug or alcohol testing methods.
D.	Failure to Provide a Valid Sample with a Certified Result - Includes but is not limited to: 1) failing to provide a valid sample that can be used to detect the presence of drugs and alcohol or their metabolites; 2) providing false information in connection with a test; 3) attempting to falsify test results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution; 4) failing to provide a specimen without a legitimate medical explanation; and 5) demonstrating behavior which is obstructive, uncooperative, or verbally offensive, and which results in the inability to conduct the test.
6.	PROCEDURE FOR TESTING
A.	Notification Form - Before requesting an employee to undergo drug or alcohol testing, the Employer shall provide the individual with a form on which to (1) acknowledge that the individual has seen a copy of the Employer's Drug and Alcohol Testing LOA, and (2) indicate consent to undergo the drug and alcohol	testing.
B.	Collecting the Test Sample - The test sample shall be obtained in a private setting, and the procedures for taking the sample shall ensure privacy to employees to the extent practicable, consistent with preventing tampering with the sample. All test samples shall be obtained by or under the direct supervision of a health care professional.
C.	Testing the Sample - The handling and testing of the sample shall be conducted in the manner specified in Minn. Stat. §181.953 by a testing laboratory which meets, and uses methods of analysis which meet, the criteria specified in subdivisions.1, 3, and 5 of that statute.
D.	Thresholds - The threshold of a sample to constitute a positive result alcohol, drugs, or their metabolites is contained in the standards of one of the programs listed in MN Statute §181.953, subd 1. The Employer shall, not less than annually, provide the unions with a list or access to a list of substances tested for under this LOA and the threshold limits for each substance. In addition, the Employer shall notify the unions of any changes to the substances being tested for and of any changes to the thresholds at least thirty (30) days prior to implementation.
Page 3 of 10
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
E.	Positive Test Results - In the event an employee tests positive for drug use, the employee will be provided, in writing, notice of his/her right to explain the test results. The employee may indicate any relevant circumstance, including over the counter or prescription medication taken within the last thirty (30) days, or any other information relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result.
7.	RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES
Within three (3) working days after receipt of the test result report from the Medical Review Officer, the Employer shall inform in writing an employee who has undergone drug or alcohol testing of:
A.	A negative test result on an initial screening test or of a negative or positive test result on a confirmatory test;
B.	The right to request and receive from the Employer a copy of the test result report;

E.	The right of an employee for whom a positive test result on a confirmatory test was the first such result for the employee on a drug or alcohol test requested by the Employer not to be discharged unless the employee has been determined by a Minnesota Licensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC) or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency to be chemically dependent and the Employer has first given the employee an opportunity to participate in, at the employee's own expense or pursuant to coverage under an employee benefit plan, either a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program, whichever is more appropriate, as determined by the Employer after consultation with a Minnesota LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency, and the employee has either refused to participate in the counseling or rehabilitation program or has failed to successfully complete the program, as evidenced by withdrawal from the program before its completion;
F.	The right to not be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation on the basis of a positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmatory test;
G.	The right, if suspended without pay, to be reinstated with back pay if the outcome of the confirmatory test or requested confirmatory retest is negative;
H.	The right to not be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or required to be rehabilitated on the basis of medical history information revealed to the Employer concerning the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result unless the employee was under an affirmative duty to provide the information before, upon, or after hire;
Page 4 of 10
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
I.	The right to review all information relating to positive test result reports and other information acquired in the drug and alcohol testing process, and conclusions drawn from and actions taken based on the reports or acquired information;
J.	The right to suffer no adverse personnel action if a properly requested confirmatory retest does not confirm the result of an original confirmatory test using the same drug or alcohol threshold detection levels as used in the original confirmatory test.
K.	The right to suffer no adverse personnel action based solely on the fact that the employee is requested to submit to a test.
8.	ACTION AFTER TEST
The Employer will not discharge, discipline, discriminate against, or request or require rehabilitation of an employee solely on the basis of requesting that an employee submit to a test or the existence of a positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmatory test.
A.	Positive Test Result - Where there has been a positive test result in a confirmatory test and in any confirmatory retest (if the employee requested one), the Employer will do the following unless the employee has furnished a legitimate medical reason for the positive test result:
1.	First Offense - The employee will be referred for an evaluation by an LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency.
a.	If that evaluation determines that the employee has a chemical dependency or abuse problem, the Employer will give the employee an opportunity to participate in, at the employee's own expense or pursuant to coverage under an employee benefit plan, either a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program, whichever is more appropriate, as determined by the Employer after consultation with an LADC or a physician trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency.

B.	Suspensions and Transfers.
1.	Pending Test Results From an Initial Screening Test or Confirmatory Test - While awaiting the results from the Medical Review Officer, the employee shall be allowed to return to work unless the Employer reasonably believes that restrictions on the employee’s work status are necessary to protect the health or safety of the employee, other City employees, or the public, and the conduct upon which the employee became subject to drug and alcohol testing would, independent of the of the results of the test, be grounds for discipline. In such circumstances, the Employer may temporarily suspend the
Page 5 of 10
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
tested employee with pay, place the employee on paid investigatory leave or transfer the employee to another position at the same rate of pay.
2.	Pending Results of Confirmatory Retest - Confirmatory retests of the original sample are at the employee’s own expense. When an employee requests that a confirmatory retest be conducted, the Employer may place the employee on unpaid leave, place the employee on paid investigatory leave or transfer the employee to another position at the same rate of pay provided the Employer reasonably believes that restrictions on the employee’s work status are necessary to protect the health or safety of the employee, other City employees, or the public. An employee placed on unpaid leave may use his/her accrued and unused vacation or compensatory time during the time of leave. An employee who has been placed on unpaid leave must be made whole if the outcome of the confirmatory retest is negative.
3.	Rights of Employee in Event of Work Restrictions - In situations where the employee is not allowed to remain at work until the end of his/her normal work day pursuant to this paragraph B, the Employer may not prevent the employee from removing his/her personal property, including but not limited to the employee’s vehicle, from the Employer’s premises. If the Employer reasonably believes that upon early dismissal from work under this paragraph the employee is about to commit a criminal offense by operating a motor vehicle while impaired by drugs or alcohol, the Employer may advise the employee that 911 will be called if the employee attempts to drive or call 911 before dismissing the employee from work so that a law enforcement officer may determine whether the employee is able to operate a motor vehicle legally. This LOA is not applicable with regard to any such determination by a law enforcement officer.
C.	Other Misconduct - Nothing in this LOA limits the right of the Employer to discipline or discharge an employee on grounds other than a positive test result in a confirmatory test, subject to the requirements of law, the rules of the Civil Service Commission, and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement. For example, if evidence other than a positive test result indicates that an employee engaged in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the Employer's workplace, the employee may receive a warning, a written reprimand, a suspension without pay, a demotion, or a discharge from employment, depending upon the circumstances, and subject to the above requirements.
D.	Other Consequences - Other actions may be taken pursuant to Civil Service Rules, collective bargaining agreements or laws.
E.	Treatment Program Testing - The Employer may request or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the employee has been referred by the Employer for chemical dependency treatment or evaluation or is participating in a chemical dependency treatment program under an employee benefit plan, in which case the employee may be requested or required to undergo drug or alcohol testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following completion of any prescribed chemical dependency treatment program.
9.	DATA PRIVACY
The purpose of collecting a body component sample is to test that sample for the presence of drugs or alcohol or their metabolites. A sample provided for drug or alcohol testing will not be tested for any other purpose. The name, initials and social security number of the person providing the sample are requested so that the sample can
Page 6 of 10
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
be identified accurately but confidentially. Information about medications and other information relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result is requested to ensure that the test is reliable and to determine whether there is a legitimate medical reason for any drug or alcohol in the sample. All data collected, including that in the notification form and the test report, is intended for use in determining the suitability of the employee for employment. The employee may refuse to supply the requested data; however, refusal to supply the requested data may affect the person's employment status. The Employer will not disclose the test result reports and other information acquired in the drug or alcohol testing process to another Employer or to a third party individual, governmental agency, or private organization without the written consent of the person tested, unless permitted by law or court order.
10.	APPEAL PROCEDURES
A.	Employees may appeal discipline imposed under this LOA through the Dispute Resolution Procedure contained in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (i.e. grievance procedure) or to the Minneapolis Civil Service Commission.
B.	Concerning disciplinary actions taken pursuant to this drug and alcohol testing LOA, available Civil Service Commission appeal procedures are as follows:

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Return to Work/Job Bank and Related Matters
The above-entitled Parties are signatory to a Labor Agreement which is currently in effect (the “Labor Agreement”). This Letter of Agreement outlines additional agreements reached by the Parties during the course of collective bargaining which resulted in the making of the Agreement and which the Parties now desire to confirm.
GENERAL PROVISIONS:
The employee’s Return to Work Policy provides for the timely return to work of employees injured on the job who have temporary and/or permanent restrictions. The Return to Work Program offers services to assist employees injured on the job who have temporary and/or permanent restrictions. This program will assist active employees; it is not intended to provide services to temporary employees or sworn employees. Participation in the Return to Work Program is based on a medical release to return to work. Upon receipt of the medical release, the employer shall make every effort to provide appropriate work activity. Our goal is to assist the work injured on the job by providing temporary job duties within three (3) working days of the receipt of the medical release.
If there is a question about the employee’s medical release, the City’s consulting physicians shall make the final determination of an employee’s ability to return to work. If the employer is unable to offer appropriate temporary job duties within the employee’s limitations, the employer shall provide for the employer’s portion of the health care benefit while the employee is in the Return to Work Program. The employer shall strive to provide appropriate temporary job duties commensurate with the employee’s medical work release.
Continuing eligibility in the Return to Work Program is based upon receipt of medical data documenting the employee’s functional improvement. In addition, compliance with the Workers’ Compensation Statutes, Return to Work Policy, Minneapolis Code of Ordinances §20.860, applicable rules and this Agreement is mandatory. Compliance will be monitored by the Claims coordinator/ Return to Work Coordinator. Failure to comply with the requirements of this program may result in termination of the program. Compliance with the program will be determined by the employer.

GENERAL PROVISIONS OF THE RETURN TO WORK/JOB BANK PROGRAM:
The employer has created a Return to Work/Job Bank Program as a component of its resources allocation (budget) process. The Return to Work/Job Bank Program will share some common resources with the restructuring/economic job bank, but it will have different rights and responsibilities. The Return to Work/Job Bank Program will assist both the employer and its employees during a time of unplanned change caused by an injury on the job.
The purpose of the Return to Work/Job Bank Program is to assist the injured worker in returning to a different assignment within the City if they are unable to perform their original position as a result of work injury arising out of and in the course of employment for the City. It is the employer’s intention, to the extent feasible under the circumstances, to identify employment opportunities for employees through reassignment, retraining and out-placement support. One of the goals of the Return to Work/Job Bank is to minimize, to the extent possible, the disruption normally associated with work-related injuries and return to work in alternative job duty assignments.
The Return to Work/Job Bank process shall be administered in a manner which is consistent with the employer’s desire to treat employees with dignity and respect. The administrators will strive to provide as much information and assistance as may be reasonably possible and practical within the resources available. Our objective is to assist employees in making informed choices about their future with the City and at the same time to utilize the competency of City employees, whenever possible, in staffing vacant City positions. Mutual cooperation and participation is necessary in order to accomplish this objective.
RETURN TO WORK/JOB BANK POLICIES:
1.	Injured, non-sworn, City employees who have been permanently certified or appointed and were
injured on the job after June 1, 1995, and who have been assigned permanent restrictions that prevent the employee from returning to the pre-injury job, will be afforded the opportunities available in the Job Bank, Return to Work component. This policy will also cover employees injured on the job who are actively working for the City now and whose jobs are eliminated as a result of economic or restructuring decisions.
2.	The services and benefits of the Job Bank will apply to employees injured on the job as long as
the employee complies with the Workers’ Compensation Statutes, Return to Work Policy, Minneapolis Code of Ordinances §20.860, applicable rules and this Agreement. Employee compliance will be determined by the City. These services and benefits include:
a)	120-day tenure
b)	Job interviews/Placement opportunities
c)	Skills assessment
d)	Training opportunities
e)	Job-seeking classes
Page 2 of 5
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
f)	Health insurance continuation, if separated from employment, as provided for in the
Minneapolis Code of Ordinances, §20.900.
3.	The Workers’ Compensation fund will pay for the salaries of those injured employees while in
the Job Bank.
4.	The department that the employee came from has the primary responsibility for finding
temporary job duties for the employee while they are in the Job Bank. The, Return to Work Coordinator/Claims Coordinator, and Qualified Rehabilitation Consultant will aid in determining alternate temporary assignments if the original department is unable to identify temporary job duties.
5.	If the injured worker has not been placed after one hundred twenty (120) calendar days, they will
be separated from City service.
6.	Failure to participate in a diligent job search or to comply with requirements of Workers’

made.

10.	There will be no exception to this Agreement without the approval of the Oversight Committee.
RETURN TO WORK/JOB BANK PROCESSES:
Job Assignment
1.	Injured, non-sworn, City employees who have been permanently certified or appointed and were
injured on the job after June 1, 1995 and who have been assigned permanent restrictions that prevent the employee from returning to their pre-injury job, will be afforded the opportunities available in the Return to Work/Job Bank Program. This policy will also cover injured employees who are actively working now for the City and whose jobs are eliminated as a result of economic or restructuring decisions.

Code of Ordinances §20.860.
3.	Permit-temporary employees and certified-temporary employees are not eligible for Return to
Work/Job Bank services.
RETURN TO WORK/JOB BANK ACTIVITIES
1.	When injured employees are assigned to the Job Bank, they shall continue in temporary assignments with pre-injury salary and benefits. While so assigned, however, injured employees may be required to perform duties outside of their assigned job classifications and/or they may be required to perform such duties in a different location, as determined by the Employer.
2.	While injured employees are assigned to the Job Bank, the Employer and Employee shall make reasonable efforts to identify vacant positions within the Employer’s organization which may provide continuing employment opportunities.
a.	Lateral Transfer. Employees may request to be transferred to a vacant position in another job classification at the same MCSC grade level provided they meet the minimum qualifications for the position.

their new title, transferred employees shall continue to accrue job classification seniority in their former title and they shall have the right to return to their former title if the position to which they have transferred is later eliminated as long as the job requirements are consistent with the employee’s permanent restrictions. In the event the transfer is to a formerly held job classification, seniority in the new (formerly held) title shall run from the date upon which they were first certified to the former classification.
ii.	Pay Upon Transfer. The employee’s salary in the new position will be
supplemented, if necessary, to comply with the Worker’s Compensation Statutes. Lateral transfers shall not affect anniversary dates of employment for pay progression purposes.
iii.	Probationary Periods. Employees transferring to a different title will serve a six (6) calendar month probationary period. In the event the probationary period is not satisfactorily completed (either because the involved supervisor has concluded that the employee’s performance in the new position is not satisfactory or because the employee is not satisfied with the position), the injured worker shall be returned to a Job Bank assignment for the remaining duration of the one hundred twenty (120) calendar day Job Bank period (or a minimum of thirty (30) calendar days, whichever is greater).
b.	Reassignment. In accordance with the provisions of the Agreement or other applicable
Page 4 of 5
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017

c.	Filling Vacant Positions. During the time the procedures outlined herein are in effect, position vacancies will be filled based on the employee’s qualifications. During their assignment to Job Bank, the injured worker will be provided an opportunity to meet with a City Placement Coordinator to discuss such matters as available employment opportunities with the City, skills assessments, training and/or retraining opportunities, out placement assistance and related job transition subjects. Further, affected employees will be granted reasonable time off with pay for the purpose of attending approved skills assessment training and job search activities.
SEPARATION AND RETIREMENT CONSIDERATIONS:

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
Job Bank and Related Matters
The above-entitled Parties are signatory to a Labor Agreement which is currently in force (the “Labor Agreement”). This Letter of Agreement outlines additional agreements reached by the Parties during the course of collective bargaining which resulted in the making of the Agreement and which the Parties now desire to confirm.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
The Employer has created a Job Bank as a component of its resources allocation (budget) process. The purpose of the Job Bank is to assist the Employer and its employees during a time of major restructuring and change caused by unyielding demands for municipal service in the face of decreasing funding. It is the Employer’s intention, to the extent feasible under these circumstances, to identify employment opportunities for employees whose positions are eliminated through reassignment, retraining and outplacement support. One of the purposes of the Job Bank process is to minimize, to the extent possible, the disruption normally associated with contractual “bumping” and layoff procedures to both the Employer and affected employees.
The Job Bank process shall be administered in a manner which is consistent with the Employer’s desire to treat affected employees with dignity and respect at a difficult time in their relationship and to provide as much information and assistance to them as may be reasonably possible and practical within the limited resources available.
The term “Recall List” as used in this Agreement means the list of employees who are laid off from employment with the City or removed from their position by reason of a reduction in the size of the workforce, and who retain a right to return to their prior job classification pursuant to the terms of the Labor Agreement and/or Civil Service rules.
JOB BANK PROCESS AND PROCEDURE
I.	Job Bank Assignment
1.	Regular (permanently certified) employees whose positions are eliminated shall receive
formal, written notification to that effect from the appointing authority of the department to which they are assigned. If a position is to be eliminated in any department, the
Page 1 of 6
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
employee with the least amount of seniority in the particular job class within the impacted division/department will be placed in the job bank, regardless of performance, assignment, function or other consideration. For the purposes of this section, a division is defined as an operational unit headed by a supervisory director or deputy who reports directly to a department head. If a department is of such a size as to have no distinct divisions, the department shall be treated as a division. Whether the layoff will be implemented relative to the least senior in a division or department will be determined by the terms of the Labor Agreement covering the impacted positions.
2.	Such employees shall be assigned to the Job Bank. Employees whose positions have
been eliminated based on the Employer’s regular annual budget process, including the Mayor’s proposed budget and/or the final annual City budget as passed by the City Council, or as otherwise ordered by the City Council, are entitled to a sixty (60) day tenure in the job bank. All positions eliminated based on the Mayor’s proposed budget and/or the final annual City budget as passed by the City Council must be so eliminated after the Mayor’s proposed budget is announced but no later than January 1, of the next budget cycle (unless the department/division intends to eliminate at a later date as part of their final annual budget for that year). Employees whose positions have been eliminated based on any mid-cycle budget or revenue reductions not controlled by the Mayor and the City Council, are entitled to a thirty (30) day tenure in the job bank, or until they are reassigned, whichever may first occur. All such employees in the Job Bank shall have extended job bank services for as long as they remain on a recall list. During such period such laid off employees shall form a pool for “restricted examination” for positions for which they may be qualified. The employee will notify the City of their interest in being considered. The Union will assist in notifying these employees of vacancies to be filled. A permit position shall be considered a “vacancy” if it is in a job classification impacted by the workforce reduction and if more than 60 days remain on the permit.
3.	Permit and temporary employees whose employment is terminated are not eligible for
Job Bank assignment or benefits. Certified temporary employees shall, however, be eligible for the Job Bank activities described in paragraphs 2(c) below.
II.	Job Bank Activities
1.	While affected employees are assigned to the Job Bank, they shall continue in their
positions with no change in pay or benefits. While so assigned, however, affected employees may be required to perform duties outside of their assigned job classifications and/or they may be required to perform such duties at a different location as determined by the Employer.
2.	While affected employees are assigned to the Job Bank, the Employer shall make
reasonable efforts to identify vacant positions within its organization which may provide continuing employment opportunities and which may be deemed suitable for affected employees by all concerned.
a.	Lateral Transfer. Employees may request to be transferred to a vacant position
Page 2 of 6
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
in another job classification at the same MCSC Grade level provided they meet the minimum qualifications for the position.
i.	Seniority Upon Transfer. In addition to earning job classification seniority
in their new title, transferred employees shall continue to accrue job classification seniority in their former title and they shall have the right to return to their former title if the position to which they have transferred is later eliminated. In the event the transfer is to a formerly held job classification, seniority in the new (formerly held) title shall run from the date upon which they were first certified to the former classification.
ii.	Pay Upon Transfer. The employee’s salary in the new position will be
their former salary or that of the next available step in the pay progression schedule for the new title which provides for an increase in salary if no equal pay progression step exists. If the employee’s salary in the former position is greater than the maximum salary applicable to the new title, the employee’s salary will be red circled until the maximum salary for the new title meets the employees’ red circled rate. Such employees shall, however, be eligible for fifty percent (50%) of the negotiated general increase occurring during the term of the Agreement. Lateral transfers shall not affect anniversary dates of employment for pay progression purposes.
iii.	Probationary Periods. Employees transferring to a different title will serve a six (6) calendar month probationary period. In the event the probationary period is not satisfactorily completed, the affected employee shall be returned to Job Bank assignment and the employee’s “bumping”, layoff or transfer rights under the Agreement or other applicable authority shall be restored to the same extent such rights existed prior to the employee taking the probationary position. Upon the affected employee’s first such return to the Job Bank, the employee shall be entitled to remain in the Job Bank for the greater of ten (10) business days, or the duration of the applicable Job Bank period, as determined under Article I, paragraph 2, that remained as of the date the employee began in the probationary position. The rate of compensation for the remainder of the employee’s time in the Job Bank will be the same as the rate in effect as of the employee’s last day in the probationary position. Return to the Job Bank terminates the employee’s work in the probationary assignment and, therefore, time served following the return to the Job Bank shall not be construed to count toward the completion of the probationary period.
b.	Reassignment. The Employer reserves the right to transfer an employee in the
Job Bank to a new position and/or duty location within their job classification at a time determined to be appropriate by the Employer. Such reassignments terminate the affected employee’s assignment to the Job Bank. If the Labor Agreement covering the job classification of the employee reassigned under this
Page 3 of 6
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
paragraph specifically permits a probationary period upon reassignment, the provisions of subparagraph a.iii., above, shall apply as if the reassignment had been a transfer.
c.	Recall Rights. Employees who accept a position out of the Job Bank or who
bump into a previously held position, or leave City employment on layoff shall retain recall rights to the title they held when assigned to the Job Bank in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement at the time of placement in the Job Bank.
d.	Filling Vacant Positions. During the time the procedures outlined herein are in
effect, position vacancies to be filled shall first be offered to regular employees who have a contractual right to be recalled to a position in the involved job classification or who may have a right to “bump” or transfer to the position, as the case may be. In such circumstances, the seniority provisions of the Agreement shall be observed. If no regular employee has a contractual right to the position, the following shall be given consideration in the order (priority) indicated below:
1st Priority:	Qualified Job Bank employees
2nd Priority:	Employees on a recall list
3rd Priority:	Employee applicants from a list of eligibles
4th Priority:	Displaced certified temporary employees
5th Priority:	Non-employee applicants from a list of eligibles
The qualifications of an employee in the Job Bank or on a recall list shall be reviewed to determine whether he/she meets the qualifications for a vacant position. Whether the employee can be trained for a position within a reasonable time (not to exceed three months) shall be considered when determining the qualifications of an employee. If it is determined that the employee does not meet the qualifications for a vacant position, the employee may appeal to the Director of Human Resources. If it is determined that an employee in the Job Bank is qualified for a vacant position, the employee shall be selected. The appointing authority may appeal the issue of whether the employee is qualified. The dispute shall be presented to and resolved by the Job Bank Steering Committee.
If it is determined that an employee on a recall list is qualified for a vacant position, the employee will be given priority consideration and may be selected. Appeals regarding employees on a recall list and their qualifications for a position will be handled by the Civil Service Commission.
The grievance procedure under the Labor Agreement shall not apply to determinations as to qualifications of the employee for a vacant position.
3.	During their assignment to the Job Bank, affected employees will be provided an
opportunity to meet with the Employer’s Placement Coordinator to discuss such matters as available employment opportunities with the Employer, skills assessments, training
Page 4 of 6
Laborers Local #363 • 2015-2017
and/or retraining opportunities, out-placement assistance and related job transition subjects. Involvement in these activities will be at the discretion of the employee. Further, affected employees will be granted reasonable time off with pay for the purpose of attending approved skills assessment, training and job search activities. Displaced certified temporary employees are eligible for the benefits described in this paragraph. These services shall be provided to the Job Bank employee at no cost to the employee.
III.	Layoff, Bumping and Retirement Considerations
1.	A “Primary Impact Employee” is an employee who enters the Job Bank due to the
elimination of his/her position. A “Secondary Impact Employee” is an employee who enters the Job Bank because he/she may be displaced by a Primary Impact Employee. All affected employees may exercise the displacement, “bumping” and/or layoff rights immediately. A Primary Impact Employee must exercise displacement or bumping rights within forty-five (45) days of entering the Job Bank (or within twenty-two [22] days of entering the Job Bank for an employee entitled to 30-days in the Job Bank). A Primary Impact Employee who exercises his/her displacement or bumping rights within the first thirty (30) days from entering the Job Bank (within the first fifteen [15] days for an employee entitled to 30-days in the Job Bank) shall have 8 hours added to the employee’s vacation bank. A Secondary Impact Employee must exercise his/her displacement or bumping rights within seven (7) calendar days of being displaced or bumped. Displacement and bumping rights shall be forfeited unless exercised by the deadlines specified in this paragraph or in the provisions of 2.a iii, Lateral Transfers, above. Regardless of when bumping rights are exercised, any change in the compensation of the employee resulting from the exercise of bumping rights shall not take effect until after the employee’s term in the Job Bank would have expired had the employee remained in the Job Bank for the maximum period.
2.	If an affected employee is unable to exercise any “bumping” rights, or forfeits their
bumping rights, under the Agreement or other authority and has not been placed in another City position, the employee shall be laid off and placed on the appropriate recall list with all rights pursuant to the relevant Labor Agreement provisions, if any, and all applicable Civil Service rules. In addition, they shall be eligible for the benefits described as follows:
(a)	The level of coverage, single or family, shall continue at the level of coverage in effect for the laid off employee as of the date of layoff.
(b)	The health/dental plan that shall be continued shall be the plan in effect for the employees as of the date of layoff.
(c)	The City shall pay one hundred (100) percent of the premiums for the first six (6) months of COBRA continuance at the level of coverage and plan selected by the employee and in effect on the date of the layoff.
The terms of this provision relating to the continuation of insurance benefits will expire on December 31, 2013. The City Council must take specific action to extend these terms relating to the continuation of insurance benefits if the City Council wants those specific insurance benefits to apply to laid off employees after December 31, 2013.

3.	If eligible, affected employees may elect retirement from active employment under the
provisions of an applicable pension or retirement plan. In such event, affected employees will be eligible for any available Retirement Incentive that is agreed to by the Parties.
IV.	Dispute Resolution. Disputes regarding the application or interpretation of this Agreement are subject to the grievance procedure under the Labor Agreement between the parties, except as specifically provided here. A dispute regarding the application or interpretation of this Agreement that needs to be resolved during an employee’s time in the Job Bank may be submitted to the Job Bank Steering Committee. The decision of the Job Bank Steering Committee will be binding on the parties. Submission to the Job Bank Steering Committee shall not preclude the filing of a grievance on the issue. However, the decision of the Steering Committee shall be admissible in an arbitration hearing on such grievance.
The provisions of this Letter of Agreement associated with the Job Bank Program shall become effective upon the approval of the Employer’s Council and Mayor. The Job Bank procedures outlined herein shall be observed after the negotiated termination date of the Labor Agreement between the Parties, and expire on December 31, 2014.
To the extent that there is any conflict between the terms of this Letter of Agreement and the Labor Agreement, the Labor Agreement shall prevail.
NOW THEREFORE, the Parties have caused this Letter of Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representative whose signatures appear below.

Employee response to Snow Emergencies
Communication is absolutely necessary to ensure that service is provided with the least amount of disruption to both Employees and the City. This includes both communication amongst employees and between Employees and the Field Resource Office. Good communication will ensure a standard of reasonableness can be proactively applied to individual case by case situations.
1.	Seasonal PWSW-1’s assigned to Winter Work in the Transportation Maintenance & Repair Division - Street Department are required to respond to all declared Snow Emergencies and shall be subject to progressive discipline for non-responsiveness, and
2.	At the time of the bid, seasonal PWSW-1’s assigned to Winter Work in the Transportation Maintenance & Repair Division - Street Department may identify one (1) work shift that he/she may be excused from responding for Snow Emergencies (i.e., no penalty if called) so long as the total number of Core and Reserve Laborers on a given shift that are able to respond does not fall below 90%. If a Reserve employee so identifies a shift and it is one of their regularly scheduled shifts, he/she shall forfeit availability pay for the day but may use six (6) hours of accrued leave the same as for vacation. If, however, the Reserve employee is called and works, he/she shall be paid for all hours actually worked and need not use accrued leave.
Additional time may be approved at the sole discretion of the employer upon the written request by the employee.
