5.7	Per Diem Nurse. A nurse classified as such on the Employer's personnel records who is hired to work on an intermittent basis or during any period when additional work of any nature requires a temporarily augmented work force, or in the event of an emergency or employee absenteeism. Per diem nurses shall be paid in accordance with the wage rates set forth in Article 10 of this Agreement plus a fifteen percent (15%) wage differential as set forth in Section 10.4. Per diem nurses shall receive longevity steps and shall be eligible for standby, callback, shift differentials, weekend premium pay, certification pay and continuing education and professional development expenses. Seniority shall accrue based upon all hours worked but shall not be applicable during employment as a per diem nurse. After return to or upon acquiring full-time or part-time status, any prior benefit accruals shall be reinstated for benefit eligibility purposes. Per diem nurses may be pre-scheduled for a shift, but only after regularly scheduled nurses assigned to that unit have had the opportunity to sign up for additional (non-overtime) shift(s). Per diem nurses will not be regularly utilized in lieu of filling or creating regular full-time and/or part-time positions. In the event of low census, per diem nurses will be cancelled in accordance with Section 8.12.

Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
6.1	Equal Opportunity. The Employer and the Union agree that conditions of employment shall be consistent with applicable federal, state and local laws regarding nondiscrimination. The Employer and the Union shall not discriminate against any employee by reason of race, creed, age, color, sex, national origin, religious belief, marital status, sexual orientation, political ideology, ancestry, or the presence of any sensory mental or physical disability. Allegations of discrimination shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration, provisions of Article 19 of this Agreement.
6.1.1	Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Where the requirements of the ADA conflict with this Agreement, the ADA shall supersede this Agreement.
6.1.2	Consistent with Swedish Medical Center’s policy on disabled employees, if a new bargaining unit position can be created to accommodate an incumbent nurse’s permanent disability, the Union agrees to waive seniority rights for that position. The position will not be posted, and the position will be offered to the disabled nurse.
6.2	Notice of Resignation. Nurses shall be required to give at least twenty-one (21) calendar days' written notice of resignation. Failure to give notice shall result in loss of accrued annual leave. Failure to work the notice period, unless approved by the employee’s supervisor, shall result in loss of accrued annual leave, with the exception of previously scheduled and approved time off.
6.2.1	Notice of Termination. Nurses who have completed the required probationary period shall receive twenty-one (21) calendar days’ notice of termination or three (3) weeks pay in lieu thereof, except in cases of discharge for just cause.
6.3	Discipline and Discharge. No full-time or part-time nurse shall be disciplined or discharged except for just cause. "Just cause" shall be defined to include the concept of progressive discipline (such as verbal and written reprimands and the possibility of suspension without pay). A copy of all written disciplinary actions shall be given to the nurse. Nurses shall be required to sign the written disciplinary action for the purpose of acknowledging receipt thereof. Progressive discipline shall not be applied when the nature of the offense requires immediate suspension or discharge. A nurse may request the attendance of a Union representative during any investigatory meeting which may lead to disciplinary action.
6.4	Personnel File. Personnel records will be maintained by the organization for each nurse. Information retained by the organization will include: employment application and supporting materials, performance appraisals, records of payroll activity, licensure and training records, letters of commendation and recognition, and records of disciplinary action. By appointment, nurses may inspect their Human Resources records on the next business day (24 hours). Every effort will be made to make all other records available within 72 hours. If records cannot be made available within 72 hours nurses will receive notice of when material will be available and an explanation for the delay. A human resources representative may be in attendance. Documentation regarding employment conditions, such as rate of pay, unit, shift, hours of work, reason for termination, change in employment status, and leaves of absence, shall be maintained. Upon request, a nurse will be given a copy of any material in the nurse’s record. A copy fee may be charged. Nurses may respond in writing to any documents contained in their record.

Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
6.5	Parking. On-call nurses shall be provided parking within close proximity to the Swedish Medical Center.
6.6	Travel. A nurse who in accordance with Swedish Medical Center policy accompanies a patient traveling by ambulance, helicopter, etc., shall be considered to be in the employ of the Swedish Medical Center. The Employer will be responsible for providing and approving travel arrangements for the nurse to and from the Swedish Medical Center.
6.7	Evaluations. All nurses will be formally evaluated in writing prior to completion of the probationary period and annually thereafter. Interim evaluations may be conducted as required. The evaluation is a tool for assessing the professional skills of the nurse and for improving and recognizing the nurse's performance. The nurse's participation, including a self-evaluation, is an integral part of the evaluation process. The nurse will be given a copy of the evaluation, if requested. Nurses will be required to sign the evaluation acknowledging receipt thereof. Nurses will be given the opportunity to provide a written response to the evaluation which will be retained with the evaluation in the nurse's personnel file. Peer evaluation in addition to supervisory evaluation may be utilized on a unit-by-unit basis at the discretion of the Employer utilizing input from the nursing staff. Work time will be provided for peer and selfevaluations when the evaluations are required by the Employer.
6.8	Communication. Nurses who have concerns about their working conditions are encouraged to raise those concerns through the appropriate levels of supervision. Nurses concerned about safety issues must report them to their supervisor and the Safety Committee utilizing appropriate Swedish Medical Center reporting forms.
6.9	Job Openings. Notice of all job openings on a unit will be posted on the affected unit. Internal transfers from within the unit to fill the initial vacancy will take place prior to considering other applicants for the position. Unit postings and housewide postings will each occur for seven (7) days prior to the filling of the position and may be simultaneous.
When a vacant position within the bargaining unit is to be filled, seniority shall be the determining factor in the selection of the applicant, providing skill, competence, ability and prior job performance are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. The nurse selected for the position will be notified in writing of the selection and the date of transfer. This job application procedure shall only apply to vacant positions or newly created positions the Employer seeks to fill. If the Employer seeks to expand the hours of an existing FTE on a specific shift and unit, the additional hours will be posted internally on the unit and filled by seniority.
6.10	Employee Transfers. Nurses shall be required to give at least twenty-one (21) calendar day’s written notice of transfer to their current manager. Whenever possible, the effective date of transfer should coincide with the start of a pay period, following the twenty-one (21) day notice period. Nurse transfers will occur at the end of the twenty-one (21) day period, except under exceptional circumstances due to patient care considerations. Some examples of appropriate patient care considerations are that a department will go without enough staff to provide an essential skill set or patients will be diverted. Chronic staffing shortages will not be considered exceptional circumstances. If the transfer is not made in twenty-one (21) days the
8
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
nurse will be notified in writing. In any case the transfer will be made within ninety (90) days. Management will consider a variety of solutions, including the use of temporary coverage, to ensure that transfers occur in accordance with this section.
A nurse who accepts a transfer may not apply for another opening for a period of three (3) months from the effective date of the transfer unless approved by the nurse’s manager.
6.10.1	Performance Review Period. Nurses transferring to a new position will be subject to a sixty (60) day review period. If the nurse does not successfully complete the review period in the opinion of the Employer, the nurse will be assigned a preceptor for an additional thirty (30) days. If after this thirty (30) day period the nurse does not meet performance expectations based on established criteria, the nurse will be returned to the nurse's prior position, if vacant. If the position has been filled, the nurse will be eligible for other available open positions for which the nurse is qualified or shall be released from duty and will be placed on the Recall Roster (8.9) and provided with recall rights.
6.11	Subcontracting. There shall be no subcontracting of any bargaining unit work for the life of the contract. This shall not apply to work that is done on an occasional or temporary basis by non-bargaining unit personnel or contractors, existing work that has been customarily and historically subcontracted, to work requiring specialized and unique skills and/or equipment not generally available within the unit and where training cannot reasonably be provided, to overload work (providing such work does not result in a reduction of the FTE status or layoff of any bargaining unit member), and new work that cannot feasibly be performed by bargaining unit employees. This section does not apply to the customary and historical use of agency and travelers for RN and technical work.
ARTICLE 7	- FLOATING
7.1	Floating. The float pools on each campus (7.3) will serve as primary resources for meeting floating
needs within a campus. The Multi-Campus Float Pool will serve as primary resources for meeting floating needs between campuses. The Employer retains the right, however, to change the nurse's daily work assignment on a shift by shift basis to meet patient care needs. Provided safe and cost effective staffing alternatives are available, every effort will be made to limit floating assignments to designated work groupings or to areas where the nurse has been cross-trained. Nurses who float will be adequately oriented and have the appropriate basic skills for the units to which they float. Volunteers will be sought first when floating is necessary. Per-diem and Traveling nurses will be floated in rotation along with all other unit based staff. Each unit will decide if permanent charge nurses will float in rotation. This will be decided by secret ballot majority vote. If a nurse on standby is called in and that unit needs to float a nurse, that unit will float a nurse by mutual agreement except in extreme emergencies where a patient would go without care. These extreme emergency situations will be on a staffing exception form to be made available by the Employer, and forwarded to the Unit Based Staffing Co-chairs. The Co-chairs will evaluate whether the matter needs further review, and if so, will bring the matter to the Unit Based Staffing Committee for evaluation and review. For ongoing and unresolved issues, the matter may be forwarded to the Labor Management Committee.
9
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
Each affected nurse will receive orientation to the unit and will be assigned a resource person from the unit's permanent staff for clinical guidance as needed. Orientation will be appropriate to the assignment and will be dependent upon the nurse's previous experience and familiarity with the nursing unit and patients to which such nurse is assigned. Floating assignments will be made based on matching the skills of the nurse to her/his assigned unit/patients. If a nurse is floated off the nurse's own unit when there is either (1) another nurse floated in from another unit or (2) an agency nurse or a management nurse working on that unit, these occurrences will be tracked according to the process described above.
Nurses will be expected to perform all basic nursing functions but will not be required to perform tasks or procedures specifically applicable to the nursing unit for which they are not qualified or trained to perform. If during the floating assignment a nurse is asked to perform a task or procedure for which the nurse does not feel qualified or trained to perform or is otherwise unable to provide the appropriate care for the patient, the nurse should immediately discuss the matter with the charge nurse or manager or if the situation continues, the house supervisor should be paged immediately. Newly hired nurses will not float during the first ninety (90) days of their employment. Resident nurses shall not float during the first six (6) months of their employment.
Nursing managers in consultation with staff nurses regularly assigned to the unit will develop unit specific orientation tools (including but not limited to examples of charting, a map of the unit, unit specific protocols, special procedures and the assignment of a resource person) to be used by staff nurses floated to the unit. It is the responsibility of the charge nurse/resource nurse to assure the tool is given to the nurse floated. The Employer will make a good faith effort not to assign float nurses as charge without mutual consent.
7.2	Floating Workgroups. Nurses will be eligible for a $3.50 per hour float premium for work performed outside their Floating Workgroup. Nurses who work within an identified "Floating Workgroup" will only be eligible for a float premium for work performed outside the working group. The float premium will only be paid for time actually worked. Nurses who volunteer to work in two (2) or more work groups (either by regular schedule, voluntary sign up for shifts, or who hold a shared FTE) will not be eligible for the float premium. The Floating Work Group premium will not be triggered when patients overflow from one work group into another. In the event a nursing unit is merged with a unit in a different work group, the float premium will no longer apply. In the event a unit is temporarily closed for more than seven (7) consecutive days but not merged with another unit, nurses will be eligible for the five dollar ($5) Float Pool Premium for all hours worked starting on the eighth (8th) day. This will continue until the unit is reopened. When a float pool nurse comes to a unit and the unit based nurse floats to any other unit, the unit based nurse will receive three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) per hour.
7.2.1	Multi-Campus Floating. If a nurse scheduled (on a posted or published work schedule) to work at one campus volunteers to perform work at a different campus, a premium of three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) per hour shall be paid for all hours worked at the other campus. If the employee returns to the original scheduled work site during the shift, this pay premium shall continue to be paid. This premium shall not apply to an employee that works in a position that was designed to cover multiple campuses (see section 7.5). Delays resulting from transportation between
10
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
campuses shall not be counted as a dependability occurrence. Parking will be provided to employees floating during a shift to another campus at no additional charge. If an employee incurs an additional parking fee, the Employer will reimburse the employee within two (2) weeks.
7.2.2	It is not the intention of Swedish Medical Center to regularly use staff from a department on one campus to fulfill staffing needs on another campus, and the use of such assignments on a regular basis shall be minimized.
Nurses will not be floated outside their workgroup and to another campus (both conditions simultaneously) except by mutual agreement. Nurses who float outside of their work group and to another campus will receive a total of $7.00 per hour. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Employer from responding to emergency situations or urgent patient care needs. Delays resulting from transportation between campuses shall not be counted as a dependability occurrence. Parking will be provided to nurses floating during a shift to another campus at no additional charge. If a nurse incurs an additional parking fee, the nurse will be reimbursed by Swedish Medical Center within two (2) weeks.
7.2.3	Floating Work Groups.1/ As service line leadership evolves and care processes become more standardized, then either the Union or the Employer may request the Work Groups be revised. Any changes will be by mutual consent.

7.3	Float Pools. 2 / Float pools shall be continued and/or established as follows:
A.	First Hill Campus.
1.	Critical Care Float Pool. The Critical Care Float Pool will be staffed with nurses who have current adult critical care nursing. This Critical Care Float Pool services the ICU, ED, PACU, telemetry, cath lab, stat team, and other areas as needed. Nurses will be trained to all of these areas. Nurses within the Critical Care Float Pool assigned to the stat team carry a pager and work multiple units.
2.	Medical Surgical Float Pool. The Medical Surgical Float Pool will be staffed with nurses with current acute care medical surgical experience. Medical Surgical Float Pool nurses will be chemotherapy certified and EKG trained, where the need exists. Nurses within the Medical Surgical Float Pool may be assigned to the stat team to carry a pager and work multiple units.
3.	OB Float Pool. The OB Float Pool will be staffed with nurses with current ante partum, postpartum and labor and delivery experience.
4.	Peds Float Pool. The Peds float pool will be staffed with nurses with current PICU, NICU, ISCU and Peds experience.
B.	Ballard Campus.
1.	The Ballard Float Pool will be staffed with nurses who have current adult critical care nursing or acute care medical surgical experience and are able to float to Med/Surg, Telemetry and other specialty services. Float Pool nurses will be EKG trained.
C.	Cherry Hill Campus.
1.	Critical Care Float Pool. The Critical Care Float Pool will be staffed with nurses that
have current adult critical care nursing. This Critical Care Float Pool may service ICUs, ED , PACU, telemetry, cath lab, Stat team, and other areas as needed. Nurses will be trained to all
2 nurses assigned to the following float pools will not be required to float to another campus. if a nurse volunteers to work at another campus, the nurse will receive the five dollar ($5) float pool premium plus the multi-campus float premium.
14
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
of these areas. Nurses within the Critical Care Float Pool assigned to the Stat team carry a pager and work multiple units.
2.	Medical Surgical Float Pool. The Medical Surgical Float Pool will be staffed with nurses with current acute care medical surgical experience. Medical Surgical Float Pool nurses will be chemotherapy certified and EKG trained where the need exists. Nurses within the Medical Surgical Float Pool assigned to the Stat team carry a pager and work multiple units.
Each float pool nurse will receive orientation to the physical unit and the nursing care requirements of the patients on that unit and campus. During her/his orientation, the nurse shall be assigned to an RN preceptor from the unit's permanent staff for clinical guidance as needed. Orientation will be appropriate to the assignment and will be dependent upon the nurse's previous experience and familiarity with the nursing unit and patient population. If issues arise resulting from floating between campuses, such matters may be brought to the Labor Management Committee.
7.4	Multi-Campus Float Pool. During the term of this Agreement, the Employer will establish a Multi-
Campus Float Pool. The Multi-Campus Float Pool will be staffed with nurses who have current inpatient adult critical care nursing, acute care medical/surgical experience or specialty (eg. OR, ED) and will be oriented to departments at all campuses. Nurses in this float pool will be expected to float to all campuses.
An ad hoc committee of float pool nurses, float pool support staff, and management will develop recommendations for the successful implementation of the float pool program, including training and orientation of multi-campus float nurses prior to implementing the Multi-Campus Float Pool. The committee will be co-chaired by a union-appointed staff employee from the float pool and a manager.
Nurses assigned to the Multi-Campus Float Pool shall receive a premium of eight dollars and fifty cents ($8.50) per hour, which shall be included in the nurses' regular rate of pay.
THE FOLLOWING ARTICLES 7.5, 7.5.1 and 7.5.2 SHALL ONLY APPLY TO THE MEDICAL TELEMETRY UNITS, GI LAB, EP LAB, CATH LAB, CARDIAC REHAB, CANCER INSTITUTE AND DIALYSIS.
7.5	Inter-Campus Assignment Premium (within a designated cross campus work group only). If a nurse begins work at one campus and goes to another campus to perform work in the same work group during the same shift, a premium of three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) per hour shall be paid for hours worked at the second campus. If the nurse returns to the original work site during the shift, the pay premium shall be continued. The premium shall only apply to the Medical Telemetry Units, GI Lab, EP Lab, Cath Lab, Cardiac Rehab, Cancer Institute and Dialysis. This premium shall not apply to call shifts worked (11.3).
7.5.1	Inter-Campus Schedule Change Premium. If a nurse is scheduled (on a posted or published schedule) to work at one campus but is reassigned in advance of his or her shift to perform work on a different campus, a premium of three dollars and fifty cents ($3.50) per hour shall be paid for all
15
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
hours worked at the other campus. If the nurse returns to the original scheduled work site during the shift, this pay premium shall continue to be paid. This premium shall not be paid to nurses that voluntarily initiate a change in campus (e.g., “trades”). This premium shall not apply to call shifts worked (11.3).
7.5.2	Volunteers. Swedish agrees that “Inter-Campus Assignments” and “Intercampus Schedule Changes” will be minimized as reasonably possible. When it is necessary to float a nurse to another unit or department or to assign an employee to another campus, the Employer agrees to first seek volunteers from the employees working or scheduled, provided skill, ability and competence are substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. In the event there are no volunteers, the Employer will rotate floating or reassignments equitably among all employees in the affected job classification on a unit on each shift, starting with the least senior employee first, provided skills, competence, ability and availability are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. If an individual volunteers to float or to go to another campus that shall be counted for purposes of the rotation list. The rotation list will be restarted January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning with the least senior employee.
7.5.3	There shall be no pyramiding of the Inter-Campus Schedule Change Premium and/or the Inter-Campus Assignment Premium. These premiums shall not be paid for any non-productive time such as annual leave or sick leave.
7.6	New Multi-Campus Units. In the event the Employer decides to expand the use of cross campus assignments to a department where the practice does not currently exist, the Union will be notified at the earliest opportunity. The Employer will meet with the Union and representatives of staff to address staff concerns and convene a change team. All applicable contractual practices will be followed. In the event a new multi-campus unit is created, all affected employees shall be assigned a home campus pursuant to the contractual procedures identified by the change team, potentially including but not limited to 6.9 Job Openings, and/or 8.4 Unit Mergers.
ARTICLE 8	- SENIORITY/LAYOFF/LOW CENSUS
8.1	Seniority Defined. Seniority is defined as a nurse's continuous length of service as a registered nurse in the bargaining unit based upon hours worked with the Employer from most recent date of hire. Seniority shall not apply to a nurse until completion of the required probationary period. Length of service as an employee of the Swedish Medical Center shall be used to determine annual leave accruals and benefits.
8.2	Layoff Defined. A layoff is defined as a permanent or prolonged reduction in the number of nurses employed by the Swedish Medical Center resulting from a need for fewer nurses as determined by the Employer. Prior to implementing the provisions of this section, the Employer will seek volunteers for layoff or voluntary leaves of absence from among those nurses on the units affected by the layoff. Open (vacant) positions requiring comparable skills will not be filled during the period beginning with the notice of layoff
16
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
to the date of the layoff. Thirty (30) days' advance notice of layoff (or pay in lieu thereof to the nurse) will be given to the Union and to nurses subject to potential layoff except for unforeseeable conditions preventing such notice which are beyond the Employer's control. Upon request, the parties will meet for the purpose of reviewing the order of layoff. Subject to skill, competence and ability being substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer, agency/traveler nurses and probationary nurses on the affected unit will be the first to be laid off. Any nurse subject to actual layoff as a result of this process shall receive a final layoff notice of ten (10) days (or pay in lieu thereof based on scheduled days of work).
8.3	Unit Layoff. If a unit layoff is determined by the Employer to be necessary, nurses will first be designated for layoff on the shift in the unit affected by the reduction with the least senior nurse(s) on the shift being designated for layoff, providing skill, competence and ability to perform the required work is considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. The nurse(s) designated for layoff on that shift may displace the position (FTE) of the least senior nurse(s) on another shift on that unit or the position (FTE) of the least senior nurse in the clinical group, providing the nurse displaced on the other shift or in the clinical group has less seniority. Any nurse subject to layoff will be given the opportunity to select another position from a listing of vacant positions within the Swedish Medical Center or, if eligible, a position from the Low Seniority Roster (8.6), providing the nurse is qualified for the position (8.7) in the opinion of the Employer, or the nurse may elect to terminate with severance pay (8.11).
8.4	Unit Merger and/or Restructure. In the event of a merger of two (2) or more units into a single unit or a restructuring of an existing unit, the Employer will determine the number of full-time and part-time FTEs by shift required for the new or restructured unit. Prior to determining the schedule, the Employer will meet with the nurses on the affected unit(s) to receive input on their preferences. Pursuant to 8.2, the Employer will notify the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to a unit merger or restructure. A listing of the FTEs for each shift on the new/restructured unit, including any qualification requirements, shall be posted on the unit(s) for at least ten (10) days. Other vacant positions within the Medical Center will also be posted on the unit(s) at that time. By the end of the posting period, each nurse shall have submitted to the Employer a written list which identifies and ranks the nurse's preferences for all available positions (first to last). Based upon these preference lists, the Employer will assign nurses to positions on the new/restructured unit based upon seniority, providing skill, competence and ability are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. Nurses who are not assigned a position on the new or restructured unit may take voluntary layoff or select a position from a listing of vacant positions within the Medical Center, may select the position (FTE) of the least senior nurse in the clinical group, providing the nurse displaced in the clinical group has less seniority, or, if eligible, a position from the Low Seniority Roster (8.6), providing the nurse is qualified for the position (8.7) in the opinion of the Employer, or the nurse may elect to terminate with severance pay (8.11).
8.5	Unit Closure. If a unit is closed, a listing of vacant positions within the Medical Center and the Low Seniority Roster (8.6) will be posted on the unit for at least ten (10) days. At the end of that ten (10) day period, nurses may take voluntary layoff, or, in the order of their seniority, shall be allowed to select a position from the list of vacant positions, or may select the position (FTE) of the least senior nurse in the clinical group, providing the nurse displaced in the clinical group has less seniority, or, if eligible, a position from the Low Seniority Roster (8.6), providing the nurse is qualified (8.7) in the opinion of the Employer, or the nurse may elect to terminate with severance pay (8.11).
17
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
8.6	Low Seniority Roster. The "Low Seniority Roster" shall be a listing of nurses most recently hired into regular full-time or part-time positions by the Medical Center. The listing shall include campus, unit, department, outpatient clinic, or service, employment status (FTE) and shift. Any nurse identified for layoff whose name already appears on the Low Seniority Roster, and any nurse on the Low Seniority Roster whose position has been assumed as a result of the selection process specified above, shall be subject to layoff. The size of the Low Seniority Roster shall be specified prior to the bidding process with positions on the roster remaining fixed. The Low Seniority Roster will be posted house wide. The Low Seniority Roster shall be a listing of the most recently hired employees in the bargaining unit consisting of a number equal to the number of positions (i.e. employees) to be laid off plus fifty (50) of the most recently hired nurses.
8.6.1	The Low Seniority Roster is intended to provide eligible nurses with alternative employment opportunities in lieu of layoff, provided that the number of nurses to be oriented on any one work unit or shift at any given time is limited so as to not compromise total patient care. If there is a need to restrict the number of Low Seniority Roster nurses within a shift or work unit whose positions may be assumed so as not to compromise patient care, the Employer, prior to making a final determination, will meet with the Union in a good faith effort to reach agreement on the need for such a restriction. If there are any restrictions placed on the number of Low Seniority Roster employees within a particular work unit or shift, whose position is subject to being assumed, the Low Seniority Roster will be adjusted in order to provide the contractually required number of employees.
8.7	Orientation. A nurse will be considered eligible for a vacant position or to select a position from the Low Seniority Roster, if in the Employer's opinion, the nurse can become oriented/trained to the vacant position or a position from the Low Seniority Roster within four weeks. If the nurse has not achieved a satisfactory level of performance in the judgment of the Employer based upon established criteria within four (4) weeks, the nurse will be subject to layoff. During a layoff, if a nurse has previously floated to a unit and has taken a full patient assignment, the nurse will be considered qualified for orientation/training under this section.
8.8	Rosters. If a layoff is announced, a current seniority roster will be available at the Human Resources Department with a copy immediately provided to the Union, together with the Low Seniority Roster (8.6) and a listing of any vacant positions. The listing shall include campus, unit, department, outpatient clinic or service, employment status (FTE) and shift.
8.9	Recall. Nurses on layoff status shall be placed on a reinstatement roster for a period of eighteen (18) months from the date of layoff. When vacancies occur, nurses will be reinstated in the inverse order of seniority providing skill, competence and ability are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. Any recall of nurses out of seniority will be communicated to the Union at the time of the recall. Acceptance of per diem work while on layoff will not affect an employee's recall rights. Nurses not on layoff assigned to a specific unit will be given preference for transfer to an increased FTE on the same shift or to another shift on that unit over all other nurses on layoff except more senior nurses returning from layoff status to their previous unit. Subject to the above qualifications, a nurse on layoff shall be offered
18
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
reinstatement to vacant positions on the employee's former unit prior to any nurses being newly hired or any housewide transfers to that unit after any appropriate internal transfers have occurred.
8.9.1	Notification to Employer. Nurses on layoff must submit to the Employer a written statement expressing a continuing interest in employment with the Swedish Medical Center. These statements must be sent by certified mail to the Employer's Human Resources Department during the ten (10) day period following six (6) months, nine (9), twelve (12) and fifteen (15) months of layoff, respectively. If the nurse fails to meet this notification requirement by the specified dates, or if the nurse fails to keep the Employer notified of a current mailing address and home telephone number, the nurse's name shall be eliminated from the recall list and the Employer's recall commitments shall terminate.
8.10	Termination. Seniority shall terminate upon cessation of the employment relationship; for example, discharge, resignation, retirement, refusal to accept a comparable job opening (same clinical group, FTE and shift) offered by the Employer while on layoff, after eighteen (18) consecutive months of layoff, or failure to comply with specified recall procedures.
8.11	Severance Pay. Upon completion of the probationary period, any full-time or part-time nurse subject to layoff may elect to voluntarily terminate employment with the Swedish Medical Center and receive severance pay as set forth below. Any nurse electing this option shall not have recall rights (8.9).
Severance Pay	Years of Service (see 5.10)
2	weeks of pay 3	weeks of pay 4	weeks of pay 5	weeks of pay 6	weeks of pay 8 weeks of pay	less than 2 years 2 - 4 years 5 - 9 years 10 - 14 years 15 - 19 years 20+ years
Part-time nurses are eligible for severance pay prorated to the nurse's FTE. The severance payment will be paid to the nurse in a lump sum on the nurse's last paycheck.
8.12	Low Census. Low census is defined as a decline in patient care requirements resulting in a temporary staff decrease. During temporary periods of low census, the Employer will first ask for volunteers to take time off before determining and implementing the reduced staffing schedule required. In the event there are no volunteers, the Employer will endeavor to rotate low census equitably among all nurses on a unit on each shift (on each campus) starting with the least senior nurse first, providing skills, competence, ability and availability are considered substantially equal in the opinion of the Employer. If an individual volunteers to take a low census day off, that day off shall be counted for purposes of the rotation list. The rotation list will be restarted January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning with the least senior nurse. Subject to skill, competency and ability, agency nurses and per diem nurses on the unit subject to low census shall be released from work prior to implementing mandatory low census. A traveling nurse who is
19
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
employed on a contract basis for a defined period of weeks shall participate in the rotation of low census with other full-time and part-time employees.
8.12.1	Low Census Standby. If a low census day is offered and it is uncertain whether the nurse will be needed for part of the shift, a nurse who agrees to be on standby will be paid standby pay. If a nurse has been notified of low census but will be needed and agrees to a later start time on that shift, the nurse will not receive standby pay. If the nurse chooses not to take off a portion of the scheduled shift, the option will be offered to other staff.
8.12.2	Low Census Fund. Where mandatory low census (as opposed to voluntary low census) hours are required, the Employer will assign other nursing related duties, skill development or cross training consistent with organizational and patient care needs as determined by the Employer, up to a maximum of 8000 hours (1000 shifts) per calendar year. Where low census hours exceed 8000 hours on a Swedish Medical Center-wide basis within a calendar year, then nurses will be released from work due to low census conditions, as provided for in Section 8.12. The Low Census Fund is utilized for non-patient care projects but may involve some patient contact. The Employer will determine appropriate projects and will assign these projects to the staff. Projects appropriate for staff utilizing the Low Census Fund may include, but are not limited to:
Skill development/cross training
Patient chart audits
Non-mandatory, continuing education modules
Department specific projects such as:
re-ordering supplies
organizing equipment rooms
assisting other departments in auditing, organizing follow-up calls to patients.
If, during the course of a shift, the needed staffing hours increase on a unit as determined by the Charge RN, the Charge RN will notify the Nursing Supervisor and the remaining hours of the RN's shift will be charged to the unit budget rather than to the Low Census Fund. The Low Census Fund shall not be available to nurses during that period of time that the Employer is subject to a ten (10) day strike notice, as provided for by Section 8(g) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, as amended.
8.12.3	Additional Hours. Nurses desiring additional hours should notify the Employer in writing, identifying their specific availability. Management will first attempt to offer additional scheduled hours in the assigned unit to those nurses who have made the request who have lost hours due to low census during their current or prior posted work schedule.
ARTICLE 9	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
9.1	Work Day/Work Period. The normal work day shall consist of eight (8) hours' work to be completed within eight and one-half (8 1/2) consecutive hours. The normal work period shall consist of
20
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
forty (40) hours of work within a seven (7) day period or eighty (80) hours of work within a fourteen (14) day period.
9.2	Flexible Work Schedules. A flexible schedule is defined as a work schedule that requires a change, modification or waiver of certain provisions of this Agreement. Flexible work schedules may be established in writing by mutual agreement between the Swedish Medical Center and the nurse involved. See Addendum’s for specific work schedules. Prior to the implementation of a new flexible work schedule, the Employer and the Union will review and determine conditions of employment relating to that new work schedule. Where flexible work schedules are utilized, the Employer retains the right to revert back to an eight (8) hour per day schedule or a flexible schedule recognized by this Agreement after at least thirty (30) days' advance notice to the nurse, or pay in lieu of notice.
9.3	Work Schedules. The Employer retains the right to adjust work schedules to maintain an efficient
and orderly operation. Monthly work schedules shall be posted ten (10) days prior to the beginning of the scheduled work period. Except for emergency conditions involving patient care and low census conditions, individual scheduled hours of work set forth on the posted work schedules may be changed only by mutual consent.
9.4	Overtime. Overtime shall be compensated for at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay (5.9) for time worked beyond the normal full-time work day or normal full-time work period. All additional overtime hours after twelve (12) consecutive hours of work within the twenty-four (24) hour period shall be paid at the rate of double (2x) the nurse's regular rate of pay. Time paid for but not worked shall not count as time worked for purposes of computing overtime pay. All overtime must be approved by supervision. The Employer and the Union agree that overtime should be minimized. If in the Employer's opinion overtime is necessary, volunteers will be sought first and if there are insufficient volunteers, reasonable overtime may be assigned equitably. Overtime shall be computed to the nearest quarter hour. There shall be no pyramiding or duplication of overtime pay or premium pay paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) or double time (2x). When a nurse is eligible for both time and one-half (1 1/2) and double time (2x) pay, the nurse shall receive the higher of the two pay rates. The double time provisions of this section shall not apply to time spent for educational purposes (CE days, education leave, educational offerings, etc.).
9.4.1	Work in Advance of Shift. A nurse who reports to work in advance of the assigned shift will not be released from duty prior to the completion of that scheduled shift for the purpose of avoiding overtime pay unless there is mutual consent.
9.4.2	Work on Day Off. Full-time nurses who work on their regularly scheduled day off shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular rate of pay for the hours worked. Parttime nurses who work on a day not regularly scheduled shall be paid at the applicable rate of pay.
9.5	Meal/Rest Periods. Meal periods and rest periods shall be administered in accordance with state law (WAC 296-126-092). Nurses shall be allowed an unpaid meal period of one-half (1/2) hour. Nurses required by the Employer to remain on duty or in the Medical Center during their meal period shall be
21
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
compensated for such time at the appropriate rate of pay. All nurses shall be allowed a rest period of fifteen (15) minutes on the Employer's time, for each four (4) hours of working time.
9.6	Report For Work. Nurses who report for work as scheduled, including mandatory meetings or training (unless otherwise notified in advance), and are released from duty by the Employer because of low census or meeting cancellation, shall receive four (4) hours work or four (4) hours pay at the regular rate of pay or their scheduled shift pay, whichever is less. This commitment shall not apply when the Employer has made a good faith effort to notify the employee in advance of shift cancellation at least one (1) hour in advance of the scheduled day shift or one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance of the scheduled evening or night shift. It shall be the responsibility of the nurse to notify the Swedish Medical Center of the employee's current address and telephone number. This section shall not apply to optional continuing education, committee meetings, staff meetings or to time spent on standby, or callback assignments
9.7	Weekends. The Swedish Medical Center will make a good faith effort to schedule all regular full-time and part-time nurses for every other weekend off. In the event a full-time or part-time nurse works two successive weekends, all time worked on the second weekend shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay. The third regularly scheduled weekend shall be at the nurse's regular rate of pay. This section shall not apply to per diem employees. Every other weekend off cycles (i.e., first and third or second and fourth) may be altered at the discretion of Nursing Administration subject to the notification requirements set forth in Section 9.3. Subject to management approval, nurses may request to trade weekends providing the schedule does not place the Employer into a premium pay or overtime position. Premium pay provided for in this section shall not apply to nurses who voluntarily agree to more frequent weekend duty, to work every weekend, or to nurses filling more than one (1) position. To cover the weekends normally worked during vacations and holidays, nursing managers will first utilize nurses desiring extra weekend work by seeking coverage from volunteers on the unit, from part-time staff, from per diems or by seeking coverage from the staffing offices. Only if the Employer is unable to find voluntary weekend coverage will the Employer schedule nurses to temporarily alter weekends or work extra weekend shifts to provide vacation and holiday coverage. Nurses with temporarily altered schedules will be advised subject to the notification requirements set forth in Section 9.3. The availability of weekend work shall be determined by the Employer. The weekend shall be defined for day and evening personnel as both Saturday and Sunday; for night personnel, the weekend shall be both Friday and Saturday night. Premium pay provided for in this section shall not apply to time spent for educational purposes.
9.8	Rest Between Shifts. In scheduling work assignments, the Employer will make a good faith effort to provide each nurse with at least twelve (12) hours off duty between shifts. If a nurse is required to work with less than twelve (12) hours off duty between shifts, all time worked within this twelve (12) hour period shall be paid at time and one-half (1 1/2). This section shall not apply to continuing education, committee meetings, staff meetings or to time spent on standby and callback assignments performed pursuant to Article 11. If attendance at a staff meeting or in-service is required and there are no other options, with prior approval, the staff meeting or in-service will be considered time worked for purposes of this section.
9.9	Shift Rotation. A good faith effort will be made to limit shift rotation. Except for emergent situations, leaves, vacancies, or where minimal staff are on a shift and rotation is needed to provide vacation coverage, shift rotation will not be utilized without mutual consent. Where shift rotation is required,
22
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
volunteers will be sought first. If no one volunteers, the Employer will rotate shifts starting with the least senior nurse provided skills and needs are matched. The Employer will endeavor not to rotate shifts for any nurses with fifteen (15) or more years of service with the Employer.
9.10	Change in FTE Status. If a reduction in FTE is determined by the Employer to be necessary, the least senior nurse(s) on the shift on that unit will receive the FTE reduction. The Employer will first seek volunteers from the unit and shift to accomplish these changes. Any nurse subject to an involuntary reduction in their FTE will be given preference up to their prior position (FTE) if the Employer seeks to expand the hours of an existing FTE on the nurse's unit and shift. Any nurse subject to an involuntary reduction in their FTE of greater than a .2 FTE, or an involuntary reduction resulting in a loss of employee or dependent medical insurance coverage will be placed on the Recall Roster (8.9).
ARTICLE 10	- COMPENSATION
10.1	Wage Rates. Nurses covered by this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the following hourly wage schedule effective:
		Effectiv e	Effective	Effective	Effective	Effecti ve	Effective

10.2 Compensation Increases. Longevity steps (an employee’s individual step increase) set forth in this Agreement shall become effective at the beginning of the first full payroll period after the employee works (is paid) at least 1664 hours or twelve (12) months, whichever happens last. Wage scale increases and increases in other forms of compensation shall become effective at the beginning of the pay period closest to the date designated by the contract.
10.3 Recognition for Past Experience. All nurses hired during the term of this Agreement shall be given full credit for continuous recent nursing experience when placed on the wage scale. For purposes of this section, continuous recent nursing experience shall be defined as experience in an accredited hospital, ambulatory care setting, home health agency or equivalent health care experience (including temporary employment with an employer, without a break in nursing experience which would reduce the level of nursing skills in the opinion of the Employer).
10.3.1 Prior LPN Experience. Nurses hired during the term of this Agreement shall be credited with prior applicable clinical LPN experience based on one (1) year of experience on the registered nurse wage schedule for each two (2) full years of prior Licensed Practical Nurse experience. Applicable clinical LPN experience shall be defined as continuous recent experience in an accredited hospital, ambulatory care setting, home health agency, skilled nursing facility, or equivalent health care experience without a break in nursing experience which would reduce the level of licensed practical nursing skills in the opinion of the Employer.
10.4 Wage Premium in Lieu of Benefits. In lieu of all benefits provided for in this Agreement except for shift differential pay, callback pay, standby pay, weekend premium (11.6), charge pay, preceptor pay, certification pay, continuing education and professional development expenses, longevity steps, and retirement benefits if eligible, full-time and part-time nurses may elect a fifteen percent (15%) wage
24
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
premium. This election must occur within the first ten (10) days of employment or annually on dates designated in advance by the Employer, providing the nurse presents the Employer with written evidence that the nurse is covered by health insurance elsewhere, and providing the application for enrollment is approved by the insurance carrier. Nurses will be given advance notice of enrollment dates. After the decision to receive either wages plus benefits or wages plus premium pay in lieu of benefits has been made by the nurse, no change in that compensation status will be allowed except as provided herein.
ARTICLE 11	- OTHER COMPENSATION
11.1	Shift Differential. Unless otherwise provided in this section, nurses assigned to work the second shift (3-11:30 p.m.) shall be paid a shift differential of two dollars and seventy-five cents ($2.75) per hour over the hourly contract rates of pay. Nurses assigned to work the third shift (11 p.m. - 7:30 a.m.) shall be paid a shift differential of three dollars and seventy-five cents ($3.75) per hour over the hourly contract rates of pay. Nurses shall be paid shift differential for those hours worked on a second or third shift if four (4) or more hours are worked on the designated shift.
11.2	Standby Pay. Nurses placed on standby status off Swedish Medical Center premises shall be compensated at the rate of four dollars and twenty-five cents ($4.25) per hour. A nurse shall receive five dollars and fifty cents ($5.50) per hour for all standby hours over fifty (50) standby hours per pay period. Standby duty shall not be counted as hours worked for purposes of accruing longevity steps or benefits. Nurses on standby shall be provided with signal devices for the time the nurse is on standby. Nurses who are on low census shall not be required to be on standby for that low census shift. Effective July 1, 2009, a nurse shall receive six dollars ($6.00) per hour, and on July 1, 2010, six dollars and twenty-five cents ($6.25) per hour, for all standby hours in excess of fifty (50) standby hours per pay period.
11.3	Callback Pay. Any nurse on standby who is called to work shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay. Callback pay shall be paid in addition to any standby pay. If a nurse has been released from duty and is called back, the nurse shall receive time and one-half (1 1/2) for a minimum of three (3) hours. The three (3) hour guarantee shall not apply more than once during the same three (3) hours of time. Travel time to and from the Swedish Medical Center shall not be considered time worked. When an employee on standby is called to work in advance of the scheduled shift and continues working during the scheduled shift, the minimum callback hours shall not apply however, all hours worked prior to the scheduled shift shall be paid at time and one-half (1 1/2) the regular rate of pay. Work performed during the scheduled shift shall be paid at the regular straight time rate of pay, except for employees who are placed on stand-by during a regular scheduled shift as a result of low census.
11.3.1	Callback Relief. Subject to patient care considerations, the Employer will make a good faith effort to provide relief for an employee who requests the immediate next scheduled shift off, or a change in the employee’s start time or end time for the immediate next scheduled shift, when the employee has been working on call within 8 hours of the start of his or her next scheduled shift. To be considered, the employee must notify the Employer no later than one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance of the employee's scheduled shift if making such a request. At the employee's request, an
25
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
annual leave day or sick leave can be used. This schedule adjustment will not count as an occurrence per the Employer's Dependability Policy.
11.3.2	Callback Guidelines. Stand-by time shall not be used to avoid filling vacant positions. The Swedish Medical Center will schedule procedures in the best interests of the patient and will make a good faith effort to schedule such patient procedures so that call back is not required.
Each affected unit or department with mandatory call will establish a Call Staffing Committee with a Management co-chair and a Union appointed staff co-chair. The committee shall have an equal number of representatives from management and physicians, and staff from the unit. The committee shall:
•	Develop utilization guidelines specific to the type of unit and unit’s patient population that will include urgent/emergent definitions.
•	Discuss methods by which staff and physicians can be held accountable for meeting the expectations developed by the committee.
•	Participate in a regular review of the call cases in relation to the developed utilization guidelines. The schedule for these review meetings will be developed by the Unit Based Call Staffing Committee.
•	Serve as the units committee to resolve any other issues relevant to stand-by.
11.3.3	Stand-By Hours. In order to recruit and retain employees who take call as part of their jobs, there shall be established in each department a maximum number of mandatory scheduled stand-by hours per employee. If the maximum number of mandatory scheduled stand-by hours per employee is exceeded then 11.3.3 (b) below will be triggered. The maximum number of scheduled stand-by hours per employee that will trigger 11.3.3 (b) will be 132 hours per month unless the Call Staffing Committee exempts the department from the maximum by consensus. Employees are permitted to trade, volunteer or signup for a greater number of stand-by hours voluntarily, but to a safe and reasonable level as determined by the manager.
a.	The maximum mandatory scheduled stand-by will be implemented within 90 days of ratification of the contract.
b.	When the total average stand-by per group of employees (who have an expectation to share in the unit’s collective stand-by) hit the mandatory maximum number of stand-by hours, the Call Staffing Committee will be called to a meeting to determine a course of action to lower the stand-by hours. Management, with the committee, will make every effort to immediately lower the overall mandatory stand-by hours per employee. The committee will continue to meet to determine a course of action to lower the stand-by hours long term. If, after 30 days, the mandatory scheduled stand-by hours remain over the established mandatory maximum, the next level of management for the department will participate in the committee’s work to facilitate a course of action to lower the standby hours.
NOTE: LOW CENSUS - An employee that is on stand-by that is called back, can be released and put back
26
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
on stand-by due to low census prior to seeking volunteers. The reason is that an employee called back is not on a regular scheduled shift.
11.4	Charge Nurse Pay. Any nurse assigned by the Employer as a Charge Nurse shall receive a premium of two dollars and twenty-five cents ($2.25) per hour. A nurse shall be compensated for all hours assigned by the Employer as a Charge Nurse.
11.5	Preceptor Pay. Any nurse assigned by the Employer as a Preceptor shall receive a premium of one dollar and twenty-five cents ($1.25) per hour. Nurses assigned to preceptor students will be eligible for preceptor pay provided the instructor is not on site.
11.6	Weekend Premium Pay. Any nurse who works on a weekend shall receive four dollars ($4.00) per hour premium pay for each hour worked on the weekend in addition to the nurse's regular rate of pay. Weekend premium pay shall not be included in the nurse's regular rate of pay for overtime pay calculations, unless required by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The weekend shall be defined as all hours between 11:00 p.m. Friday and 11:00 p.m. Sunday. Premium pay provided for in this section shall not apply to time spent for educational purposes.
11.7	Float Pool Premium. Nurses assigned to the Float Pools (7.3) shall receive a premium of five dollars ($5) per hour.
11.8	Certification Pay. Nurses certified in a specialty area by a national organization and working in that area of certification shall be paid a premium of one dollar ($1.00) per hour, provided the particular certification has been approved by the Vice President of Patient Care, or designee, and further provided that the nurse continues to meet all educational and other requirements to keep the certification current and in good standing. A certified nurse is eligible for only one certification premium, regardless of other certifications the nurse may have. Certified nurses will notify their respective Director/Manager in writing at the time certification is received, providing a copy of the original certification document. Certification pay will be effective the first full pay period after the date documentation is received by the Director/Manager.
11.9	Change in Classification. A change in classification shall not alter a nurse's accrued seniority for purposes of accrual of benefits or placement in the wage schedule.
ARTICLE 12	- ANNUAL LEAVE
12.1	Accrual. Full-time and part-time nurses shall receive annual leave benefits based upon hours of work in accordance with the following schedule:

Per diem nurses and part-time nurses who have selected the wage premium in lieu of benefits option (Section 10.4) shall not be eligible for annual leave.
12.2	Scheduling. Annual leave shall begin accruing the first day of employment. Annual leave may be used as it accrues.

When approved by supervision, partial days may be granted.
12.2.1	Annual Leave/Prime Time. Prime time will be defined from June 1 through September 15 of each year. Requests for prime time vacation submitted by February 15 for the current calendar year will be approved on a seniority basis if there are no conflicting requests. In the event there are conflicting requests, then the same vacation period may not be granted to the same person annually so that equitable access exists in obtaining vacation time. The annual leave schedule will be posted by each March 15. This is the posting of annual leave time only; the actual work schedule for this period will be posted in accordance with section 9.3.
Requests for prime time submitted after February 15 will be granted on a first come first serve basis after the annual leave schedule is posted on March 15. Nurses will be notified in writing within three (3) weeks after the request is submitted as to whether the annual leave is approved. When developing the vacation schedule, no more than three (3) calendar weeks of annual leave will be granted during prime time. Thereafter, additional annual leave may be granted.
12.2.2	Annual Leave/Non-Prime Time. Annual leave during non-prime time for that calendar year or the first quarter of the next calendar year will be granted on a first come first serve basis. In the case of conflicting requests by nurses for annual leave, all annual leave requests will be considered on the basis of the date the request was submitted and seniority. Nurses shall present written requests for annual leave as far in advance as is possible, but not less than two (2) weeks before the work schedule is posted. Nurses will be notified in writing within three (3) weeks after the request is submitted as to whether the annual leave is approved.
12.2.3	Annual Leave/Holiday. Holiday annual leave will be defined from November 15 to January 2 of each year. Requests for holiday leave submitted by October 1 will be approved on a seniority basis if there are no conflicting requests. If there are conflicting requests, then the same vacation period may not be granted to the same person annually so that equitable access exists in obtaining vacation time. The holiday schedule will be posted by October 15. Annual leave granted during holidays shall be in conjunction with the holiday rotation. Adequate core staffing will be maintained.
28
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
12.3	Loss of Annual Leave. Annual leave accrues each pay period based on the number of hours worked in that pay period, not to exceed 2080 paid hours in a calendar year. The accruals accumulate if not used to a maximum of two times (2x) the annual accrual depending upon years of service. Employees may not accumulate annual leave beyond two times (2x) their respective annual accrual. Annual leave not accrued because of the accumulation cap cannot be made up. Once hours have been used to bring the employee's accrued balance under the cap, accruals resume up to the proscribed limit.
12.4	Cash Out. Eligible employees may choose to cash out forty (40) hours of annual leave once in a calendar year if there will be a minimum of one hundred (100) hours left in the employee's account after the cash out has been made.

12.5	Work on Holidays. Any nurse who works on the following holidays, New Year's Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day shall be paid at the rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times the nurse's regular rate of pay for all hours worked on the holiday. For purposes of this Agreement, the holiday shall begin at 11:00 p.m. on the day preceding the holiday and end at 11:30 p.m. on the day of the holiday.
12.5.1	Pay for Time Off on Holiday. Eligible employees receive annual leave pay for scheduled time off for each of the observed holidays. Annual leave will be paid in relationship to the assigned FTE.
Employees that do not have sufficient hours in their annual leave balance will be paid the balance of their hours (not to exceed one (1) full day at their FTE level) or no annual leave payment.
Employees that work in departments that close or substantially reduce their staffing on holidays will automatically be paid annual leave if they are normally scheduled, do not work, and have sufficient annual leave hours accrued.
Nurses working in units or departments that close or substantially decrease staffing on holidays will not be required to use more than one (1) annual leave day in conjunction with the closure during that holiday period.
12.6	Rotation of Holiday Work. Holiday work shall be rotated by the Employer to the extent possible.
12.7	Payment on Termination. After completion of one (1) year of employment, nurses shall be paid upon termination of employment for all annual leave earned; provided, however, this provision shall not apply to those nurses who terminate their employment without giving the required twenty-one (21) days' prior written notice, or to those nurses who are discharged for cause.

ARTICLE 13	- SICK LEAVE
13.1	Sick Leave Accrual. Full-time and part-time nurses shall accumulate sick leave (wage continuation insurance) at the rate of .04616 hours for each hour worked. The maximum accumulation of sick leave shall be limited to 800 hours per nurse.
13.2	Compensation. If a full-time or part-time nurse is absent from work due to illness or injury, the Employer shall pay the nurse sick leave pay for each day of absence to the extent of the illness or injury or to the amount of the nurse's unused sick leave accumulation, whichever is less. Sick leave may be used for the illness or injury of a dependent child. A nurse shall not be eligible for paid sick leave during the first ninety (90) days of employment.
13.3	Notification. Nurses working the first (day) shift shall notify the Employer at least one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance of the nurse's scheduled shift if the nurse is unable to report for duty as scheduled. Nurses working the second (evening) and third (night) shift shall notify the Employer at least three (3) hours in advance of the nurse's scheduled shift if the nurse is unable to report for duty as scheduled. The nurse must notify the Employer each day of absence if the nurse is unable to work unless prior arrangements have been made with supervision. Failure to comply with the above specified notification requirements may result in loss of paid sick leave for that day. Payroll checks shall reflect the number of sick leave hours available.
13.4	Proof of Illness. Prior to payment for sick leave, reasonable proof of illness may be required. Proven abuse of sick leave may be grounds for discharge.
ARTICLE 14	- MEDICAL AND INSURANCE BENEFITS

Employees regularly assigned and designated a 0.5 to 0.8 FTE will pay a share of health insurance premiums for their dependent coverage as determined by the actuary.
30
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
Participation in medical, dental and any other insurance benefits shall be subject to specific plan eligibility requirements. Effective January 1, 2010 the premium share for eligible employees’ dependent coverage will be six percent (6%) and shall remain six percent (6%) for the life of the agreement.
14.1.2	Advantage Medical Plan and other buy-up type plans. All employee premium levels (employee only and dependent coverage) for these plans will be set as in the past. That is, the actuary reviews markets trends, the plan's experience, and healthcare cost projections and determines the appropriate premiums for these plans on an annual basis.
14.2	Health Tests. As required by law, the Employer shall provide a Tuberculin skin test at no cost to the nurse. In the event of a positive reaction to this test, the Employer will provide a chest X-Ray at no cost.

14.5	Other Insurance. The Employer will provide Workers' Compensation Insurance and Unemployment Compensation Insurance in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington. When an employee is eligible to receive payments under the Workers' Compensation Act, accrued sick leave and/or annual leave may be used to supplement such payments to make up the difference between compensation received under the Workers' Compensation Act and the nurse's regular rate of pay, but not to exceed the net earnings the employee would have normally received during a normal work week. Nurses who were receiving Employer-paid medical insurance prior to a workplace injury shall continue to receive Employer-paid medical insurance for an additional three (3) months.
14.6	Retirement Plan.
14.6.1	Defined Benefit Retirement Plan. The Employer agrees to continue its present Defined Benefit Retirement Plan in full force and effect for eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2007 and will not reduce or diminish in any way the benefits, eligibility requirement and the rights of employees thereunder. Retirement benefits and eligibility requirements for participation are defined by the current Employer’s plan. The Employer agrees to maintain the Defined Benefit Retirement Plan as long as there are eligible employees covered by the Plan and will not seek in any way to eliminate or modify the plan in any future negotiations. Article 14.7 Plan Changes does not apply. This defined benefit plan will be maintained as long as there are eligible employees covered by the plan and consistent with regulations of the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor. This provision shall remain in effect until there are no longer eligible employees covered by the defined benefit plan. After many years if the number of remaining plan participants makes it unfeasible to continue the plan, the Employer will negotiate with the Union to ensure that any remaining plan participants are kept whole.
31
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
14.6.2	Defined Contribution Retirement Plan. Employees hired after December 31, 2006 and current employees hired on or before December 31, 2006 and who choose the defined contribution plan will be eligible to participate in the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan only.

The Defined Contribution Pension Plan will be funded according to the following formula:
A.	The Employer will make a base contribution of 5% of gross pay to the employee’s account
B.	The Employee may voluntarily contribute up to 2% of gross pay, which is not required.
C.	If the Employee voluntarily contributes, the Employer will make a matching contribution of 100% of the voluntary employee contribution up to an additional 2%.
The Employer agrees to continue the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan in full force and effect as mutually agreed to by the Union and management during the term of the Agreement and will not reduce or diminish in any way the benefits, eligibility requirement and the rights of employees there under. The final plan document will be incorporated herein by reference. Article 14.7 Plan Changes does not apply.
14.6.3	403(b) Plan. Swedish Medical Center agrees to continue to offer the current 403(b) plan in full force and effect based on existing eligibility requirements and will not reduce or diminish in any way the benefits, eligibility requirement and the rights of employees there under.
Swedish agrees that eligible employees may choose to participate in the 403(b) plan in addition to either the proposed defined contribution plan or current defined benefit plan consistent with IRS and Department of Labor regulations.
14.7	Plan Changes. In the event the Employer modifies its current benefit plans, or provides an alternative plan(s), the Employer will review the plan changes with the Union prior to implementation. The Employer shall notify the Union at least ninety (90) days prior to the intended implementation date. The implementation date is the effective date of the new plan.
ARTICLE 15	- LEAVES OF ABSENCE
15.1	In General. All leaves of absence are to be requested from the Employer in writing as far in advance as possible, stating the reason for the leave and the amount of time requested.

If the nurse's absence from work for health reasons does not exceed twelve (12) weeks, the nurse shall return to work on the same unit, shift and former full-time or part-time status. Thereafter for the duration of the six (6) month leave, upon requesting return to work, the nurse shall be offered the first available opening for which the nurse is qualified. The nurse may use previously accrued sick leave and annual leave thereafter to the extent accrued. The Employer may require a statement from a licensed medical practitioner verifying the employee's health condition and attesting to the nurse's capability to perform the work required of the position.
15.3	Maternity Leave.

Except in special circumstances, employees must give at least thirty (30) days' advance written notice of family leave. The Employer shall guarantee the nurse's position if the nurse returns from leave on or before the first day of the 13th week.

Family leave shall be consistent with and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth by state law. This section shall also apply to the children of the nurse's domestic partner.
A nurse may guarantee her position (same unit, shift and FTE status) for a period of up to the period of temporary disability plus twelve (12) weeks by combining her maternity and family leave. The total amount of combined maternity and family leave cannot exceed the longer of six (6) months or the period of disability plus twelve (12) weeks.

previous twelve (12) months shall be granted up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave to: (a) care for the employee's child after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care; or (b) to care for the employee's spouse/domestic partner, son or daughter, or parent, who has a serious health condition; or (c) for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the employee's job. The Employer shall maintain the employee's health benefits during this leave and shall reinstate the employee to the employee's former or equivalent position at the conclusion of the leave. The use of family leave shall not result in the loss of any employment benefit that accrued prior to the commencement of the leave. Under certain conditions, family leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced work schedule.
If a leave qualifies under federal law, state law or this collective bargaining agreement, the leave shall run concurrently. Ordinarily, the employee must provide thirty (30) days' advance notice to the Employer when the leave is foreseeable. The Employer may require or the employee may elect to use accrued paid leave time for which the employee is eligible during family leave. Family leave shall be interpreted consistently with the conditions and provisions of the state and federal law.

ARTICLE 19	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Purpose. The grievance procedure provides a forum for bargaining unit members to address and resolve alleged contract violations in an efficient and expedient manner. To ensure that this purpose is met, the parties will attempt to resolve issues at the lowest possible level within the management structure. Additionally, the parties will engage annually in joint union/management training on contract interpretation and effective resolution of grievances.
The parties agree that potential grievances should be resolved informally whenever possible. To that end, the parties agree in ordinary circumstances to meet informally prior to submitting a written grievance. In the event these informal meetings are not occurring when they should be (in the opinion of either party) the matter may be taken to the Labor Management Committee for discussion and resolution.
19.1	Grievance Defined. A grievance is defined as an alleged breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. It is the desire of the parties to this Agreement that grievances be adjusted informally wherever possible and at the first level of supervision.
19.2	Time Limits. Time limits set forth in the following steps may only be extended by mutual written consent of the parties hereto. A time limit which ends on a Saturday, Sunday or a holiday designated in Section 12.5 hereof shall be deemed to end at 4:30 p.m. on the next following business day. Failure of a nurse or the Union to file a grievance on a timely basis or to timely advance a grievance in accordance with the time limits set forth below will constitute withdrawal of the grievance by the nurse and the Union. If the
46
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
Employer fails to comply with the time limits set forth below the Union may advance the grievance to the next step, in writing.
19.3	Grievance Procedure. A grievance shall be submitted to the following grievance procedure:
Step 1. Immediate Supervisor or Manager.
If a nurse has a grievance, the nurse shall first present the grievance in writing to the nurse's immediate supervisor within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the nurse was or should have been aware that the grievance existed. The Union Delegate shall be present, if requested by the nurse. If the Union Delegate participates in the meeting, a Human Resources representative (or designee) may also be present at this Step 1 meeting. Upon receipt thereof, the immediate supervisor shall attempt to resolve the problem and shall respond in writing to the nurse within fourteen (14) calendar days following receipt of the written grievance.
A grievance concerning a termination or suspension may be initially presented at Step 2 of the grievance procedure.
Step 2. Department Director.
If the matter is not resolved to the nurse's satisfaction at Step 1, the nurse shall present the grievance in writing to the Department Director (and/or designee) within fourteen (14) calendar days of the immediate supervisor's written decision. A meeting between the nurse (and the Union Delegate/Representative, if requested by the nurse) and the Department Director (or designee) and a Human Resources representative (or designee) shall be held within ten (10) days for the purpose of resolving the grievance. The Department Director shall issue a written reply within fourteen (14) calendar days following the Step 2 grievance meeting.
Step 3. Vice President.
If the matter is not resolved at Step 2 to the nurse's satisfaction, the grievance shall be referred in writing to the Vice President (and/or designee) within fourteen (14) calendar days of the Department Director's Step 2 written decision. The Vice President (or designee) and a Human Resources representative (or designee) shall meet with the nurse and a Union Representative within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the Step 3 grievance for the purpose of resolving the grievance. The Vice President (or designee) shall issue a written response within fourteen (14) calendar days following the Step 3 meeting.
Step 4. Arbitration.
If the grievance is not settled on the basis of the foregoing procedures, and if the grievant and the Union have complied with the specific time limitations specified in Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4 herein, the Union may submit the issue to arbitration by providing written notification to the arbitrator (with a copy to the Employer) within fourteen (14) calendar days following the receipt of the written reply
47
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
from the Administrator (or designee). In that arbitration submission letter, the arbitrator will be requested to provide available dates within the sixty (60) day period following receipt of the letter. The arbitrator will be determined from the listing of arbitrators listed below. The first arbitration case (under this Agreement) will be assigned to the first arbitrator identified below. Thereafter, each arbitration case will be assigned on a rotating basis to the next arbitrator appearing on the list. In the event of unavailability of an arbitrator to hear a case, the next arbitrator will be promptly notified of the request for hearing. The parties agree to schedule the hearing date within five (5) days of receipt of the arbitrator's letter listing available dates for hearing.
The parties have agreed to the following permanent panel of arbitrators:
1.	Mike Beck
2.	Eric Lindauer
3.	Allen Krebs
4.	Janet Gaunt
5.	Richard Humphreys
Any arbitrator accepting an assignment under this Article agrees to issue an award within forty-five (45) calendar days of the close of the hearing or the receipt of post-hearing briefs, whichever is later. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or otherwise change or modify the provisions of this Agreement, but shall be authorized only to interpret existing provisions of this Agreement as they may apply to the specific facts of the issue in dispute. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages, nor shall the arbitrator be authorized to make a back pay award for any period earlier than the beginning of the pay period prior to the pay period in effect in which the grievance was first presented to the Employer at Step 1 of this grievance procedure. However, this limitation shall not apply for any period the nurse was unaware and could not have known that the grievance existed. Each party shall bear one-half (1/2) of the fee of the arbitrator for an Award issued on a timely basis and any other expense jointly incurred incident to the arbitration hearing. All other expenses, including but not limited to legal fees, deposition costs, witness fees, and any and every other cost related to the presentation of a party's case in this or any other forum, shall be borne by the party incurring them, and neither party shall be responsible for the expenses of witnesses called by the other party.
19.	4 Union Grievance. The Union may initiate a grievance if the grievance involves a group of nurses and if the grievance is submitted in writing within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date the nurses were or should have been aware that the grievance existed. If such a grievance is filed, it shall be processed in accordance with the specific provisions of Section 19.3 with reasonable representation from the directly affected parties designated to represent the group of nurses for purposes of processing the grievance.
19.	5 Termination. Step 4 of this grievance procedure shall terminate on the expiration date of this Contract unless the Contract is extended by the mutual written consent of the parties. Grievances arising during the term of the Contract shall proceed to resolution (including step 4) regardless of the expiration
48
Agreement Between
Swedish Medical Center
and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
date of this Agreement. Grievances arising after the expiration date of this Contract may be pursued through Step 3 only, and shall not be subject to arbitration.
ARTICLE 20	- UNINTERRUPTED PATIENT CARE
It is recognized that the Swedish Medical Center is engaged in a public service requiring continuous operation and it is agreed that recognition of such obligation of continuous service is imposed upon both the nurse and the Union. During the term of this Agreement, neither the Union nor its members, agents, representatives, employees, or persons acting in concert with them shall incite, encourage, or participate in any strike, picketing, walkout, slowdown, or other work stoppage of any nature whatsoever. In the event of any strike, picketing, walkout, slowdown or work stoppage, or a threat thereof, the Union and its officers will do everything within their power to end or avert same. Any nurse participating in any strike, picketing, walkout, slowdown, or work stoppage will be subject to immediate dismissal.
ARTICLE 21	- GENERAL PROVISIONS
21.1	State and Federal Laws. This Agreement shall be subject to all present and future applicable federal and state laws, executive orders of the President of the United States or the Governor of the State of Washington, and rules and regulations of governmental authority. Should any provision or provisions become unlawful by virtue of the above or by declaration of any court of competent jurisdiction, such action shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Any provisions of this Agreement not declared invalid shall remain in full force and effect for the term of the Agreement.

The Agreement between the Swedish Medical Center and the Union shall apply to Home Health, Hospice and Home Infusion nurses with the following modifications:
1.	Transportation. Each nurse whose assigned duties may require any travel away from the Employer's office shall, as a condition of employment, furnish his or her own automobile transportation in order to complete any such assigned duties in a timely and efficient manner. As a condition of continued employment, each nurse must maintain a valid Washington State driver's license and minimum automobile liability insurance coverage as required by Washington State.
2.	Mileage. Nurses shall be reimbursed for business use of their personal automobiles at the mileage rate authorized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which is currently in effect. If the IRS mileage rate changes during the term of this Agreement, the mileage reimbursement rate shall be adjusted to the new rate, effective at the beginning of the month of the publication date of the IRS rate change. Travel (mileage) records shall be maintained by the nurse in the manner required by the Employer. The Employer will make a good faith effort to have automobile reimbursement checks available the Friday of the week of the 15th day of the month, contingent upon timely submission of required record keeping.
No mileage shall be paid for travel to and from meals or rest periods. No mileage shall be paid for travel to and from work unless the distance from the nurse's residence to the patient visit exceeds the distance from the nurse's residence to the Employer's office (i.e. work shall commence and end either at the Employer's office or the home of the first or last patient seen, whichever is less).
If a nurse's car is unavailable because of a job-related accident, the Employer shall pay the cost of an “economy” rental car for a maximum of five (5) days, providing there is no other insurance coverage available. The Employer shall reimburse nurses for emergency roadside and towing services during working time providing the service is not covered by insurance, not to exceed three (3) occurrences per calendar year. The Employer will designate the authorized towing/roadside service firm(s) to be utilized by nurses if reimbursement is requested.
3.	Parking. Free parking will continue to be provided at the current office sites. Any parking charge
incurred while in the field on work time, excluding parking tickets, will be reimbursed.

•	Weekends: 4:00 p.m. Friday to 8:00 a.m. Monday
•	Holidays: 24 hour coverage
•	Change of staff takes place at 8:00 a.m. Wednesday.

An additional $9256 will be added to the annual rate to cover all premiums. Certification pay premium is not included in this annual rate. Future adjustment to the lump sum will be negotiated. Annual leave and sick leave shall accrue each month. Each seven (7) day work schedule taken as annual leave shall result in eighty (80) hours being deducted from the annual leave accrual account. Each day of sick leave shall result in 11.43 hours being deducted from the sick leave account. Five (5) days per year are available to be taken as holiday time.
5.	After Hours Telephone Calls; Laptop Transfers. As a general rule, employees are not expected to take patient or patient-related calls after their regular work day.

Telephone time spent when assigned by the Employer to be "on call" will be paid at the nurse's regular rate of pay to the nearest fifteen (15) minutes, except for telephone calls occurring between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. which will be paid to the nearest thirty (30) minutes. Home visits occurring during the time the nurse is on standby/call, including shift differential, shall be paid in accordance with the Agreement.
Subject to patient care considerations, the Employer will make a good faith effort to provide relief for a nurse who requests a day off or a change in the nurse's start time the following day where the nurse has been called out after 11:00 p.m. the previous night for a home visit. The nurse must notify the Employer not later than one and one-half (1 1/2) hours in advance of the nurse's scheduled day shift if making such a request.
7.	Personal Safety. Personal safety training shall be included as part of the department's orientation for new nurses and shall annually be included as part of the in-service curriculum. Nurses are not expected to subject themselves to unreasonable risk of harm during the course of their duties. If an employee is concerned about personal safety in a particular situation, the employee should immediately call the employee's supervisor. In order to emphasize prevention, the Intake Worksheet in Home Health, Hospice and Home Infusion will be modified to include a section on safety concerns to alert visiting staff.

8.	Expense Reimbursements. Nurses will be reimbursed for all patient related expenses such as all cell phone charges, pay phones, faxes and long distance phone charges from home, in accordance with Swedish Medical Center policy. This shall not apply if the Employer provides the required method for business communications (e.g. cell phones, pre-paid telephone cards, etc.).
9.	Technology Training. Swedish Medical Center will provide nurses with any technology training related to patient care and documentation that the nurses need to perform their duties.

I, the undersigned _________________________________________________________________
(insert employee's name)
agree to fulfill the financial and service obligations as outlined below.
1.	Loan
I understand that upon completion of the Critical Care Course, I will owe Swedish Medical Center (Swedish Medical Center) a total sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).
2.	Service Requirements
I hereby agree that I will remain employed as a professional nurse at Swedish Medical Center for a period of at least one (1) year after graduation from the course and until my loan has been repaid. If I voluntarily terminate my employment relationship with Swedish Medical Center or request an alternative employment arrangement that is unacceptable to the Swedish Medical Center, Swedish Medical Center will have the legal rights listed below. I also agree that if I drop out of the Critical Care Course before graduation, I will still have an outstanding loan based upon the time spent in the Program. In such event, the loan balance will be based upon the percentage of the course taken times $1,000.
3.	Payback Provisions
I understand that during the time I remain employed at Swedish Medical Center after my graduation from the Critical Care Course, my loan will be reduced at the following rate:
Hours Scheduled	Amount	Loan

32	60
24	40
16	20
8	10
I understand that if I	fail to be available to perform	such service on the Critical Care Unit or Bone
Marrow Unit (or as otherwise assigned), Swedish Medical Center shall be entitled to recover the full balance due and may withhold any funds or benefits I have accrued, i.e., termination pay, including accrued annual leave and/or final paycheck, to apply towards my unpaid debt. If there remains a loan balance due after application of the above-identified funds, any amount which Swedish Medical Center is entitled to recover shall be paid by me in monthly installments beginning thirty (30) days after the date of termination. The monthly installment payments shall be at the same rate as the payback provision schedule (e.g., if previously scheduled to work thirty-two (32) hours per week at date of termination, the monthly payment is $60). I understand that interest on the balance due will begin upon termination of employment and the first installment will be due thirty (30) days from

termination. I will be billed for the installment, together with interest at the same percentage that is currently being charged by the Swedish Medical Center Credit Union at the time of my termination. Failure to pay any installment when due will cause the entire loan balance to be accelerated and the entire loan balance will immediately become due and payable, no longer giving me the option to pay the loan off on a monthly basis.
4.	Conditions for Break in Service, Waiver and Cancellation
I hereby understand that Swedish Medical Center will suspend the loan repayment obligation and extend the period for repayment during (1) any period of temporary physical disability that prevents me from working, or (2) if I am subject to any involuntary layoff.
Swedish Medical Center will cancel the repayment obligation (1) upon my death, or (2) where circumstances beyond my control prevents me from maintaining employment which would give me the financial resources to repay the loan, such as permanent or total disability or not being recalled from layoff or an act of God, or national emergency. If I am discharged for cause from Swedish Medical Center, any funds or benefits including termination pay, accrued annual leave and/or final pay checks will be applied to this loan with no further payments required.
5.	Change of Address and/or Name
I agree to keep Swedish Medical Center advised of any change of address and/or name until such time as my total obligation is fulfilled.

SEIU HEALTHCARE 1199NW
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
During negotiations that resulted in the 2008 - 2011 Agreement between the parties, certain additional understandings were reached. This letter will serve to memorialize those understandings.
1.	Delegation of Tasks. The parties acknowledge that the professional staff nurse is responsible for determining to whom to delegate a task, based on patient assessment. As provided for in the Nurse Practice Act (RCW 18.88), a nurse may only delegate a task (including medication administration) to unlicensed personnel in situations where it can be performed safely and competently.
2.	Pay Check Errors. It is recognized that the nurse is responsible for completing his or her time card accurately according to Swedish Medical Center policy. When an error is made by the Employer of four (4) hours or greater, the Employer will provide the employee with a corrected amount via direct deposit within two business days. If the Employer error is for less than four (4) hours, then the nurse will receive the corrected amount in the next pay cycle. Notice of errors must be submitted in writing to the Payroll Department by the employee’s manager.
Employee errors will be corrected on the next full pay cycle provided the notice of errors is submitted in writing to the Payroll Department by the employee’s manager no later than one week following the pay period in which the error occurred.
3.	Bulletin Boards. The Union agrees that materials to be posted on cafeteria bulletin boards must be approved by the Employer prior to posting.
4.	Work Day. The normal work day referred to in Section 9.1 is intended to include scheduled
shifts of less than eight (8) hours in duration when required by the dictates of the particular clinical service (ex. Tumor Institute).
5.	Family Leave; Bereavement Leave. For definitional purposes, the term "domestic partner" when used in this Agreement will be based upon the City of Seattle definition.
6.	Seniority. Prior to ratification of the 1994 - 1997 Agreement, all Swedish Medical Center registered nurses accrued seniority for bargaining unit purposes whether they were in or outside the bargaining unit. This previously accrued seniority shall be retained for all of these employees. Effective June 7, 1994, seniority will only accrue while a registered nurse is in the bargaining unit. If a nurse leaves the bargaining unit, all previously accrued seniority shall be retained, but no additional seniority shall accrue outside the bargaining unit. Should a nurse working outside the bargaining unit wish to return to the bargaining unit without a break in service, the nurse shall be entitled to utilize those seniority hours previously accrued for contract purposes.
1
Prior to the year 2000 strategic alliance, all Cherry Hill Seattle Medical Center (PSMC) registered nurses accrued seniority for bargaining unit purposes whether they were in or outside the bargaining unit. The Union and the Swedish Medical Center agree that registered nurse seniority accrued at PSMC up to June 7, 1994, shall be retained by all non-bargaining unit PSMC nurses on the same basis as Swedish non-bargaining unit registered nurses. Should a former PSMC nurse working outside the bargaining unit in any capacity wish to enter the bargaining unit without a break in service, the nurse shall be entitled to utilize those seniority hours accrued prior to June 7, 1994, for contract purposes.
7.	Past Practices. The intent of the third sentence of Section 21.3, Past Practices, is that if there
is a past practice that previously applied to all Swedish Medical Center employees, the practice won't be changed to the detriment of the 1199NW bargaining unit, while it remains in effect for the other Swedish Medical Center employees.
8.	Expanded Hours of Work on a Specific Shift and Unit. It would be the intent of the Employer that ongoing increased hours of work on a specific unit and shift that are not the result of temporary leaves, vacancies, scheduling requests for time off, or seasonal peaks in patient volume or acuity would be made available for current staff on the specific unit and shift to increase their FTE in accordance with 6.9.
9.	Skill, Competence and Ability. Where utilized in this Agreement, the term "skill, competence and ability" is intended to include a nurse's prior experience as a registered nurse.
10.	Traveler Nurses. Travelers shall not accrue seniority while employed as a traveler at the Swedish Medical Center.
11.	Recall Procedure. The "specified recall procedures" referred to in Section 8.10 will be discussed with the Union and all affected nurses will be notified of the procedures in writing.
12.	Mutual Commitment. For the duration of this Agreement, Swedish Medical Center and the Union desire to work together to ensure the long term stability of Swedish. In order to maximize the ability of employees to work in a stable environment, Swedish Medical Center pledges that it will not seek to reach its financial goals through cyclical layoffs. While this assurance does not restrict the ability of Swedish Medical Center to make changes in programs or services that impact jobs, or layoff employees as a result of an acquisition or merger, it does commit Swedish Medical Center to find means other than cyclical layoffs in order to achieve its financial goals. The Union, Swedish Medical Center and each member of the Swedish Medical Center team, employees and management alike, are fully committed to use their best efforts to provide the highest quality patient care, maintaining a long term sense of security, and ensuring that Swedish Medical Center is the premier healthcare provider in the Northwest.
13.	Retraining (Critical Care/Specialty Areas). For the purpose of providing adequate staffing, filling vacancies, and for the retention of nurses, the Employer will provide a retraining program for nurses to work in designated shortage areas where vacancies exist. To be eligible for
2
this retraining program, the nurse must meet the minimum clinical qualifications based on established criteria for that position. The positions will be posted as provided for in Section 6.10 of the collective bargaining agreement. Training for nurses will be provided on paid time at the nurse’s regular rate of pay with the nurse’s complete benefit package and accrual rate for up to twelve (12) weeks. The actual training commitment will be based on recognized Swedish Medical Center standards for training to the particular area. These retraining commitments will be determined by the Swedish Medical Center based on quality, efficiency and cost effectiveness. This commitment does not apply to Section 8.6, Low Seniority Roster, or 8.7, Orientation. Employees participating in this retraining program, who receive six (6) or more weeks of formal training, must commit to twelve (12) months of employment after completion of training in that position. Nurses choosing to leave prior to completion of the twelve (12) month period will forfeit their accrued annual leave.
14.	FSS Nurses - Grandfathered Employees. Grandfathered current FSS incumbents as long as they continue to accept assigned work as per prior FSS understanding. This commitment will include prior FSS nurses who have been reassigned to the Med-Surg Float Pool as identified in the attached listing. Flexible Staffing Service nurses referred to in the Swedish Medical Center’s proposal deleting prior Section 10.8 to be included in a letter of understanding who will retain the prior Flexible Staffing Premium on a “Grandfathered” basis:
Anderson, Jacquie
Balagot, Anna-Marie
(Med-Surg Float Pool)
Carlyle, Nancy
Graling, Mary
Grio, Marilyn
Hussein, Salih
(Med-Surg Float Pool)
Moritz, Lisa
(Med-Surg Float Pool)
Nicoulin, Betty
15.	Vacation Scheduling. Once a vacation has been approved, it would be the Employer’s objective and intent thereafter not to change or cancel that vacation. This understanding is subject to emergencies beyond the Employer’s control where, in the judgment of the Employer, patients would go without care.
16.	Safety Committee and Safe Patient Handling Subcommittee
The Safety Committee
The objective of this committee is to develop, implement and evaluate the overall environment of care safety program and the incident/accident/injury prevention program; to identify hazardous conditions, unsafe practices or trends, and recommend plans for improvement; and to maintain and report safety hazards to appropriate regulatory agency. The Union shall appoint six (6) employees representing each campus and Home Care Services and the Employer will have managers representing all campuses. The Committee will meet at least monthly. The Union and the Employer agree to share any information they may have concerning injury prevention programs at other hospitals in order to facilitate the Committee's action plan.
The Employer and the Union are committed to working together in the Safety Committee
3
and Safe Patient Handling Subcommittee to evaluate the environment of care performance data, number of injuries, lost work days, and employer worker compensation and medical costs, caused from manual lifting and transferring patients and other non-clinical events, and to work together to reduce such injuries and safety hazards.
Safety Patient Handling
In addition, Swedish will maintain a Safe Patient Handling subcommittee with membership representation in compliance with Washington State Engrossed House Bill (EHB) 1672 (Chapter 165, Laws of 2006). The purpose of the committee is to design and recommend the process for implementing a safe patient handling program. At least half of the members of the safe patient handling committee shall be frontline nonmanagerial employees who provide direct care to patients. Bargaining Unit participants will be appointed by the Union.
Acknowledging that back, neck and shoulder injuries are some of the most prevalent occupational hazards for employees, management agrees to continue its comprehensive ergonomic and injury reduction program.
17.	Parking. There will be no increases in Parking rates for the remainder of 2008.
The Union and the Swedish Medical Center will create a special task force within forty five (45) days to:
•	Work with transportation authorities to advocate for services that meet employee needs
•	Review current parking, transportation policies, regulatory requirements, security issues and procedures and make recommendations for improvement including measures to assist employees whose shift hours prevent them from accessing public transportation.
18.	Medical Telemetry Multi-Campus Cross Campus Assignments. Campus assignment and scheduling for Medical Telemetry Multi-Campus Unit will follow these procedures:
1.	Employees will be assigned to a home campus. The procedure for making home campus assignments shall be according the contract language governing selection processes for positions.
2.	Assignment off home campus shall not be a strategy for routine staffing and shall be minimized. When there is a need to assign staff off the home campus the following will apply:
a.	Volunteers will be sought first. If there are no volunteers, assignments off the home campus shall be rotated starting with the least senior bargaining unit employee as per Floating provisions of Article (Service 8.3 Volunteers, and RN 7.5.2 Volunteers).
4
b.	All employees required to be assigned off their home campus in the unit shall be adequately cross trained on both campus such that they are familiar with procedures on each campus and are able to provide appropriate levels of care or quality services.
c.	To optimize patient safety and achieve Swedish Medical Center standards for face to face patient handoffs, mid-shift reassignment shall be minimized and not used for routine staffing. Mid shift reassignment should not occur when there is available staff (i.e. float pool) to assume assignments on the affected campus. Use of mid-shift reassignment for RN and Service employees shall be evaluated by the Medical Telemetry unit staffing committee on a quarterly basis.
19.	Voluntary Political Action Fund Deductions. In consideration for the Employer’s Agreement regarding voluntary PAC Fund deductions, the Union agrees that neither bargaining unit nurses nor Union representatives will solicit for political action fund deductions in patient care areas nor will there otherwise be any disruption to patient care.
The parties recognize that the Union is obligated under the Federal Election Campaign Act (“FECA”) to reimburse Swedish for its reasonable cost of administering the Healthcare Leadership Fund check off in the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. Swedish and the Union agree that one-quarter of one percent (.25%) of all amounts checked off is a reasonable amount to cover Swedish’s costs of administering this check off. Accordingly, the parties agree that Swedish will retain one-quarter of one percent (.25%) of all amounts deducted pursuant to the Healthcare Leadership Fund check off provision in the parties’ collective bargaining agreement to reimburse Swedish for its reasonable costs of administering the check off.
20.	Preceptor Program. In order to provide consistency and continuity in the preceptor training program, the Employer will attempt, to the extent practical, to place the preceptor and preceptee on the same schedule. The parties recognize that the Employer’s efforts may be affected by differing FTEs, vacations, illness, other absences or the training classes for the preceptee.
To the extent feasible, the Employer will make a good faith effort not to float a preceptor while the preceptor is precepting a nurse during the clinical orientation phase that includes one-to-one precepting of a resident nurse.
21.	Dependability Policy. The Swedish Medical Center agrees that the following absences will not count as occurrences under the Employer's Dependability Policy:
*
*
*
*
*
Family Care Leave
FMLA Leave
Time loss for workers comp
Any reasonable accommodation for a qualifying disability
Pre-approved scheduled absences
5
22.	Joint Labor Management Action on Health Care Issues. The parties recognize that decisions made by elected officials and policy makers in Olympia and Washington, D.C. can have a significant impact on the financing of health care and how care may be delivered at Swedish Medical Center. The parties further agree that one effective way to advocate for a better health system is to work in partnership on issues of common concern and interest. Swedish Medical Center Senior Leadership and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW Leadership agree to meet on a semi-annual basis to discuss health care policy issues and to determine if there is interest in developing joint action plans on any issues of common concern. If so, these issues will be referred to the LaborManagement Committee for specific planning and implementation.
23.	Vacation Donation for Negotiations. Nurses will be able to donate vacation hours to a vacation donation pool for use by the Union’s negotiating team during negotiations as follows:
1.	All members of the Union’s bargaining unit may donate earned vacation/annual leave hours to a common pool, out of which members of the Union’s negotiating team will be able to draw at their regular rate of pay to make up for wages lost through participation in bargaining sessions. Hours paid from the vacation pool will be paid as vacation time and will accrue benefits for the recipients.
2.	Management will collect the donated vacation hours into the pool, and disburse them as additional hours to the normal paychecks received by negotiating team members. This process will be separate from the timecard-payroll online system, and will rely on electronic Excel spreadsheets; no cost center will be needed for the purpose. After each payout from the pool, HR will provide to the Union an accounting of the hours disbursed and the hours remaining in the pool, including the balance remaining of each donor’s pledged hours.
3.	Only those donated hours authorized by the Union for payouts will be deducted from donors’ vacation banks. At the end of the bargaining process, any vacation hours pledged by a donor which are not paid out to cover lost wages will remain in that donor’s vacation bank.
4.	The Union will be responsible for providing management the following:
a.	A signed authorization from all RN donors, modeled on the Swedish Medical Center Vacation/Annual Leave Donation form language, with the additional clarification that the donor is entering an agreement with the Union and also authorizing Swedish Medical Center to debit the donated hours from the RN’s vacation bank. The authorizing language on the Union’s petition reads as follows:
By signing this petition, I agree with our union 1199NW to donate no less than four*(4) vacation hours to help our nurse negotiators with missed shifts as a result of negotiations and I authorize Swedish Medical Center to deduct these hours from my vacation bank.
6
* Hours not needed by nurse negotiators will not be charged.
Donors’ names will be both printed and signed. A copy of the authorizing signatures will be provided to the Swedish Medical Center on numbered signature pages and numbered lines for ease of verification.
b.	An Excel spreadsheet of all donors, the page and line number of their signatures, employee identification numbers, and the number of hours authorized for donation (minimum of four [4] hours) will be provided to the Employer. Additional columns will be included to show the number of hours approved for debiting for each bi-weekly payout. Data needs to be submitted to the Human Resources Department by the second Tuesday of the pay period for it to be paid on the next regularly scheduled payday.
c.	For each payout, Swedish Medical Center will need an Excel spreadsheet of all negotiating team members who are to receive payments from the pool, employee identification numbers and the number of hours to be paid. This must be received in payroll by noon on the Thursday before the end of the PP. For future negotiations, the Swedish Medical Center will provide the Union with advance notification of the appropriate payroll periods. There will be no individual exceptions for requests for payouts which do not meet this deadline. The biweekly payouts will continue as long as needed to cover all bargaining dates, or until the pool is depleted.
5.	Additionally, we have agreed on the following points:
a.	Donated time will take priority over the donor’s own time for purposes of vacation requests.
b.	Donated hours will be paid out as hours, and will not be converted to dollars prior to payout.
c.	The Union will work with the Swedish Medical Center payroll manager to format the Excel spreadsheets.
d.	Donated time will be charged against the negotiating team member’s home department.
24.	Recognition for Patient Care Employees Who Become RNs. The following understanding shall apply to an employee's base pay adjustment when a Swedish employee becomes licensed and transfers from one patient care job classification to a registered staff nurse position. In such case, the employee will be placed at the base rate of pay on the RN wage schedule. If the employee's prior wage rate was higher than the RN base rate, the employee will be placed on that step of the RN wage schedule that is closest to the employee's prior wage rate and provides for an increase in rate of pay, 7
providing that in the opinion of the Employer the employee has substantial and relevant professional or technical skills in another patient care job classification. Only experience at Swedish will count in this determination. This provision does not apply to external hires. The employee will move to the next longevity step upon completion of 1664 hours of work or twelve (12) months from the transfer date, whichever comes last (Section 5.10)
25.	Union Organizing. Absent unexpected circumstances, Swedish Medical Center's (Swedish Medical Center) philosophy is that on occasions where non-represented employees seek representation by SEIU Healthcare 1199NW, each employee in the group being organized is given the opportunity to make an informed decision through a voting process as agreed upon by both Swedish Medical Center and the Union. Swedish Medical Center and the Union will determine the appropriate bargaining unit. Swedish Medical Center will provide information to employees when requested by an employee regarding their rights under federal law, may respond to factual inaccuracies should that occur, and answer any other related employee questions without offering an opinion for or against union representation.
26.	Paid Release Time for Negotiations. For contract renegotiation occurring in the year 2011, Swedish Medical Center will provide twelve hundred (1200) hours of paid release time for the Union's negotiating committee. These monies are intended to supplement the bargaining unit's vacation donations to negotiating team members.
27.	Prime Time Vacation Scheduling. Acknowledging that annual leave is important to both the health and well being of nurses and to nurse retention, it is agreed that if requested and approved, nurses should receive unbroken consecutive days of prime time annual leave. It is not the responsibility of the nurse to find coverage for approved annual leave.
To facilitate this objective by January 1 of each year, management will post a blank schedule covering the entire prime time period of June 1 through September 15. Staff will be listed, ranked by seniority, for each shift. Guidelines stated in Section 12.2.1 will be posted. The purpose of this posting is for informal communication of plans, so that nurses can view the requests of those with higher seniority. Nurses must still submit requests in writing to their manager as provided for in Section 12.2.1. In the event there are conflicting requests, then the same vacation period may not be granted to the same person annually so that equitable access exists in obtaining vacation time.
After the February 15 deadline for requests, management will post a preliminary (temporary) prime time schedule by March 1 with requested annual leaves filled in and needed coverage indicated. Nurses will then, on a voluntary basis, work to cover open shifts and even out the core numbers. Options include, but are not limited to, pre-scheduling per diem nurses, picking up extra shifts, and trades between nurses.
The temporary schedule will be taken down by March 10 with a final schedule posted on March 15. Final approval of vacations, trades and replacements will be the responsibility of the Manager. Staff with denied vacation requests will be provided rationale.
8
On larger units, or any units where coverage is particularly challenging, a vacation work group consisting of staff RNs, other staff, the manager, and unit scheduler may be formed to assist with this process. This work group may develop other innovative methods for increasing vacation coverage.
28.	Pharmacy Benefit Manager. In the event that the Employer changes PBM’s, the Union and Management will work collaboratively concerning the selection of the PBM.
29.	Accumulation Cap on Pay Check. Effective no later than the first pay period in January 2005, the employee's maximum two times (2x) accumulation cap will be displayed on the employee's pay check.

Between
SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER and
SEIU HEALTHCARE 1199NW
APPLIES TO REGISTERED NURSES, SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE AND TECHNICAL UNITS
1.	Maintenance of Benefits. The Swedish Medical Center agrees that during the term of this Agreement it will not reduce the current level of medical plan benefit coverage provided in the Standard Plan, nor raise the cost to employees by increasing co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance, or out-of-pocket maximums. This commitment shall not apply to administrative changes (including physician panels) that may occur to the plan.
For pharmacy co-pay,: the cost of a ninety-day (90) supply of all three tier drugs filled at Swedish pharmacies will be maintained at a “3 months” for 2 months discounted co pay level.
Out of pocket maximums for in-network services are $2,000 for an individual and $4,000 for a family.
2.	Contract Term. Beginning with the 2008 contracts, Swedish will agree to negotiate all three collective bargaining agreements (RN, Service & Maintenance, Technical units) simultaneously. Following negotiations, the parties agree to discuss the 2008 bargaining process to assist in planning for 2011 negotiations. This will include recommendations for a more streamlined and efficient process.
3.	Mental Health Parity. Effective January 1, 2007, Swedish's self insured benefit plans shall include mental health benefits that are at least equal to the terms and conditions of member health benefits as mandated by the Mental Health Parity Law of 2005, substitute House Bill 1154.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT #2
Between
SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER and
SEIU HEALTHCARE 1199NW
ADDITIONAL FACILITIES
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Swedish Medical Center unless superseded by law agrees that:
(a)	if Swedish Medical Center builds or opens a new facility and Swedish Medical Center is the legal employer of the employees, the employees at that facility who perform the same or similar work to that which is covered by this Agreement will be covered by the terms of this Agreement and will be included in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement;
(b)	if Swedish Medical Center acquires an existing operation and some of the employees at that facility are represented by SEIU Healthcare 1199NW, then all such employees at that facility who perform the same or similar work to that which is covered by this Agreement will be covered by the terms of this Agreement and will be included in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement if the acquired operation is in King, Snohomish, or Pierce, County. The parties will promptly meet to bargain the terms and conditions of employment of employees at that facility who are represented by SEIU Healthcare 1199NW who do not perform the same or similar work to that which is covered by this Agreement. In the event the acquired operation is located elsewhere, Swedish Medical Center agrees to immediately recognize SEIU Healthcare 1199NW as the representative for the employees already represented by the Union, and will promptly meet to bargain the terms of employment for covered employees;
(c)	if Swedish Medical Center acquires an existing operation and some of the employees at that facility are represented by another union or are unrepresented, the Employer will cooperate fully with the Union to determine promptly and efficiently whether accretion is appropriate under established principles of labor law, and if so, to effectuate it. Following an accretion the parties will promptly meet to bargain any outstanding issues;
(d)	if Swedish Medical Center acquires an existing operation and some of the employees at that facility are represented by another union or are unrepresented and an accretion is not appropriate, the parties agree to be bound by the Neutrality Agreement below. In the event the Union files a representation petition with the NLRB, Swedish Medical Center will agree to have the case processed through the NLRB Consent Election procedures;
(e)	The preceding provisions apply to Swedish Medical Center employees of any facility which becomes part of the Swedish Medical Center healthcare operations during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited to a hospital, urgent care facility, clinic, or ambulatory
Agreement Between

and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW
surgical center. These provisions do not apply to the operation of a facility for which Swedish Medical Center is a not the employer, or where Swedish Medical Center is a joint employer with some other entity, and does not exercise authority over terms and conditions of employment;
(f)	In the event the new facility or acquisition is geographically located in a significantly different market such that an economic adjustment based on market conditions is necessary to maintain competitiveness, the parties will promptly meet to bargain such market adjustment in wages, hours and working conditions.
Neutrality Agreement
The parties establish the following rules for the purpose of ensuring an orderly environment for the exercise of the rights of employees under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Swedish Medical Center (including its administrators, supervisors, agents and other representatives) will remain neutral and will not oppose attempts by employees to organize or select a collective bargaining representative and will not take any action or make any statement that degrades unionization, promotes “no union” as a choice in the election or that directly or indirectly states or implies any opposition by the Employer to the selection by employees of the Union, or preference or opposition to any particular union as a bargaining representative. Swedish Medical Center will provide information to employees when requested by an employee regarding their rights under federal law, may respond to factual inaccuracies should that occur, and answer any other related employee questions without offering an opinion for or against union representation;
2.	In the event the Union files a petition with the National Labor Relations Board: a.) Swedish Medical Center will immediately provide the Union with a current roster of employees including name, job title, department, work location, home address and most recent date of hire; and b.)Swedish Medical Center will provide the Union with access to non-work areas of its facilities for the purpose of communicating with employees on non-work time;
3.	The parties agree that any disputes over the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be submitted to expedited arbitration before an impartial arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. Should the parties be unable to agree upon an impartial arbitrator, then the impartial arbitrator shall be chosen from a list of seven (7) arbitrators submitted by the American Arbitration Association, pursuant to its rules for expedited arbitration, upon the written request of either party. The parties shall request that the list of arbitrators contain only names of individuals familiar with labor law and with experience in the field of arbitration. It is understood and agreed between the parties that the impartial arbitrator shall not have the power to add to or subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement. The fees of the impartial arbitrator and administrative expenses shall be shared equally between the parties. Each party shall pay its own counsel. The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to resolving the dispute, and issuing a cease and desist order, or other forms of injunctive relief, but does not include delaying, postponing or otherwise affecting the normal NLRB election process.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT #3
Between
SWEDISH MEDICAL CENTER and
SEIU HEALTHCARE 1199NW HEALTHCARE RETIREMENT FUND
SEIU Healthcare 1199NW and Swedish Medical Center have a joint commitment to address the retirement security needs of bargaining unit employees in light of a volatile and uncertain pension environment. Swedish Medical Center and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW agree to partner with the SEIU International Union and other interested employers to continue to jointly study a healthcare Taft-Hartley retirement plan.
Swedish Medical Center and SEIU Healthcare 1199NW along with other employers will reconvene a series of meetings during the term of this Agreement to further investigate a Healthcare Retirement Fund with a plan design that manages risks and costs for both employers and employees and creates a plan for more effective and predictable planning toward retirement security.
Assuming a new plan is developed, the employer and the union will engage in good faith bargaining on this issue, in the next round of contract bargaining.
