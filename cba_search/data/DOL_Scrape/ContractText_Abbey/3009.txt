OVERTIME
Section 1.
Employees Covered Under 207(k)
a.	207 (k) Partial Exemption
The Forester and Fire Warden shall adopt and implement a 207 (k) partial exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act (hereinafter FLSA) for employees in the Fire Fighter, Pilot and Firefighting Construction Equipment Operator Series. Such employees shall be treated as if covered by FLSA without prejudice to the parties' position regarding exemptions which may be legally available under the FLSA for certain classes in the Unit.
b.	Work Period
The work period for employees regularly assigned to a platoon schedule shall be eight (8) shifts in 24 consecutive days. Each shift shall be 24 hours, (from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. the following day).
The work period for employees regularly assigned to a 40-hour schedule who are covered by the 207 (k) partial exemption shall be 28 consecutive days.
c.	Definition of Hours Worked
All benefit time, such as holidays, sick leave, vacation, etc., shall be counted as hours worked for overtime purposes. Benefit time is compensated leave time for which an employee does not actually work.
18
601AM
d.	Regular Rate of Pay and Hourly Rate of Pay For a Platoon Shift
Effective July 1,1991, an employee's regular rate of pay for overtime purposes shall include base pay plus all non-discretionary bonuses, e.g. longevity, EMT, post and non-post paramedic, etc.
The regular hourly rate of pay for an employee assigned to platoon duty shall be derived by dividing his/her monthly base pay plus all non-discretionary bonuses by 243.6.
e.	Overtime Compensation
(1)	Platoon Personnel
(a)	Employees regularly assigned to a platoon schedule shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in their regular classification and position (i.e. a position which does not involve a different type of work for which different straight-time rates have been established) on a platoon schedule in excess of 182 hours in a 24 consecutive day period.
(b)	If an employee regularly assigned to a platoon schedule, in a single work period, works one or more overtime shifts in his/ her regular classification but in a position(s) with a different type of work for which different straight-time rates have been established, the first 10 hours
19
601AM
of overtime (between 182 and 192) shall be compensated in accordance with subparagraph (a) above, and the remaining overtime hours, in excess of 192, shall be compensated by the weighted average method provided under FLSA. That is, the straight-time compensation from the employee's regular scheduled hours of work and from overtime shift(s), if any, in his regular position is added to the straight-time compensation from overtime shift(s) in the different position and the total straight-time compensation is divided by the total number of hours worked. The result is the weighted average hourly rate. The straight-time compensation for the employee's regular scheduled hours of work and overtime shift(s) in his regular position will be based upon the employee's regular rate of pay, as set forth in Section 1, subsection d. above. The straight-time compensation for the overtime shifts in the different position will be based on the established regular rate for the position, including EMT bonus, any bonuses applicable to the position, and longevity bonus, if applicable to the employee. The half-time overtime premium for the extra shifts is derived by multiplying the total number of hours worked in excess of 192 by one-half the weighted average hourly rate.
(c)	If an employee regularly assigned to a platoon schedule in a single work period works down, i.e. works an overtime shift in a lower job
20
601AM
classification, overtime for the work-down shift(s) shall be calculated •4
by the rate-in-effect method provided under FLSA. That is, the employee shall be paid time and one-half of the top step, EMT rate of pay (including any bonuses applicable to the position) of the position(s) worked. Overtime worked by the employee in his regular classification will be compensated in accordance with subparagraph (a) above.
(2)	40-Hour Personnel
(a)	Hours worked in regular classification and position on a 40-hour schedule
Employees regularly assigned to a 40-hour schedule shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in their regular classification on a 40-hour schedule in excess of 160 hours in a 28 consecutive day period.
Employees assigned to a 40-hour work schedule may elect to receive compensatory time off at the straight time rate in lieu of pay for work performed in excess of 160 hours but less than 212 hours on a 40-hour schedule. An employee who elects compensatory time off for such hours worked may take such time off subject to the approval of
21
601AM
departmental management. In approving compensatory time off Management will accommodate employee convenience to the degree possible in light of operational requirements.
Accumulated compensatory time off shall remain to the employee’s credit until it is taken off at the employee's request, subject to the approval of Management. The Fire Chief may compensate an employee at the employee's straight time rate of pay for accumulated compensatory time off in lieu of retaining it on the books.
(b)	Hours worked on a platoon shift(s) in addition to regular 40-hour schedule
If an employee on a 40-hour schedule works a platoon shift(s) in a work period, the employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half the regular rate of pay (including EMT bonus, any bonuses applicable to the position and longevity bonus, if applicable to the employee) of the position worked for all hours worked on the platoon shift(s) pursuant to Section 1, subsection d. above.
f.	Henninger Flats Duty
The provisions of this Article shall not apply to Forestry personnel assigned to extra service as a watchperson at Henninger Flats. Such duty shall be compensated pursuant to County Code Section 6.76.020 (D).
22
601AM
Section 2.	Employees Not Covered Under 207(k)
The parties agree that employees in the Unit who are not covered by the 207 (k) partial exemption will be paid for all hours worked in excess of 40 in one week. "Hours worked" will be calculated as provided for by the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. §201. et seq.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.
Purpose
The purpose of the grievance procedure is to provide a just and equitable method for the resolution of grievances.
Section 2.
Definitions
A grievance is any complaint concerning the interpretation or application of this memorandum or rules or regulations governing personnel practices or of Departmental rules or regulations or Manual of Operations or concerning working conditions, which complaint has not been resolved satisfactorily in an informal manner between an employee and his/her immediate supervisor. "Business Days" mean calendar days exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.
Section 3.	General Provisions
1.	Departmental management will inform an employee of any limitation of the department's authority to fully resolve the grievance; and supply the employee with the necessary information to process his/her grievance to the proper agency or authority.
2.	If an employee fails to initiate a grievance or to appeal from one level to the next level within the time limits established in this grievance procedure, the grievance
41
601AM
shall be considered settled and not subject to further appeal. By mutual agreement of both parties, the various steps and time limits set forth in this grievance procedure may be waived or the grievance may revert to a prior level for reconsideration.
3.	An employee may present his/her grievance on County time, but the use of County time for this purpose shall not be excessive, nor shall this privilege be abused in any manner. The Department shall determine what constitutes abuse, but such determinations shall be grievable and subject to review under this grievance procedure.
4.	If the aggrieved employee wishes, he/she may be assisted at the first step of the formal grievance procedure or any subsequent step by an authorized representative of Local 1014. The representative of Local 1014 must have his/her name on file and be accepted in accordance with the Employee Relations Ordinance of the County of Los Angeles or other such applicable employee Relations law.
5.	If an employee grievance involves disciplinary action resulting in discharge, reduction or suspension, the aggrieved employee may waive all preliminary steps in the formal grievance procedure and proceed directly to the final step of the grievance procedure.
42
601AM
The aggrieved employee shall submit the grievance procedure form within ten (10) business days from the date of implementation of disciplinary action. If he/she does not appeal the discharge, reduction or suspension, the disciplinary action taken shall be deemed accepted by the employee. The grievance form shall contain the employee's objections to the disciplinary action and the employee's suggestion as to what he/she considers appropriate corrective action.
In those cases where proper written notice of a contemplated discharge, reduction or suspension is served on and discussed with the employee, the grievance procedure shall be considered completed.
6.	If the grievance does not involve a discharge, reduction or suspension, but the aggrieved employee definitely believes that his/her grievance cannot be resolved at any grievance step except by the Fire Chief or his designated representative, he/she may, with the concurrence of the concerned supervisors and managers, waive all the intervening steps.
7.	To waive the grievance steps, the aggrieved employee must obtain the signature of all levels of supervisors and managers in the signature spaces on the grievance form. In the alternative, if time precludes the previous step, the employee's Deputy Fire Chief may consent to the waiver of any or all steps up to, and including, Deputy Fire Chief, and so note on the grievance form. The aggrieved employee shall also
43
601AM
write the word "waived" and sign his/her name in the decision section for both steps and forward the form to the Fire Chief or his designated representative.
8.	The grievance form shall be prepared by the employee for the formal grievance process. The Union agrees to encourage an employee who files a formal written grievance to state clearly and concisely the specific action(s) being grieved, the Article(s) violated and the specific remedy requested. The original shall be presented by the employee at the various grievance steps and returned to the employee with the written response. A copy of the original form shall be sent to the Employee Relations Office. A second copy of the original should be retained as the Bureau's record of the grievance discussions. Copies reflecting the outcome of the final step shall be sent to the Personnel Officer and the Bureau's files.
Section 4.	Informal Procedures
Most problems or complaints can be settled if the employee will promptly, informally and amicably discuss them with his/her immediate supervisor. This desired initial discussion, a part of the day-to-day supervision, should ideally precede any use of the formal grievance procedure.
Within fifteen (15) business days from the occurrence of the matter on which a complaint is based, or within fifteen (15) business days from his/her knowledge of such occurrence, an employee shall either discuss the complaint with his/her immediate supervisor or file a formal grievance.
44
601AM
If the immediate supervisor either fails to reply within five (5) business days or gives an answer which the employee feels is not satisfactory, the employee may initiate the first step of the formal grievance procedure.
Section 5.	Formal Procedure
First Step (Immediate Supervisor) If the problem has not been resolved within ten (10) business days of the date of the initial discussion with the immediate supervisor (or fifteen (15) business days from the occurrence or knowledge of the occurrence of a grievable matter if informal discussion has not occurred), the employee shall file a formal written grievance with his/her immediate supervisor. The grievance form shall be completed by the employee describing the problem and the remedy he/she believes is merited.
The immediate supervisor shall promptly notify the Employee Relations Office. The supervisor shall consider available pertinent information and give his/her decision in writing (on the original grievance form) to the employee within ten (10) business days. The supervisor shall include the reasons for his/her decision and forward a complete copy of the grievance form to the Personnel Officer, Personnel Section.
If, upon receipt of the decision, the employee takes no further action within ten (10) business days, the grievance will be assumed to have been settled.
45
601AM
If the supervisor has not answered the employee's complaint within ten (10) business days, or if the answer is unsatisfactory in the employee's opinion, the employee may appeal to the next level.
Intermediate Steps
All intermediate steps shall follow the same procedures as described in the First Step until the grievance has passed through all levels of supervision and management with the exception of the Fire Chief or his designated representative, which shall be the Final Step of this grievance procedure.
The Fire Chief or his designated representative shall meet with the employee at the earliest possible date, evaluate the grievance and afterward determine a course of action. Supervisors of all levels who have previously dealt with the grievance may be called by the Fire Chief or his designated representative to appear at the grievance meeting. Within ten (10) business days from his receipt of the grievance, the Fire Chief or his designated representative shall give a written decision to the employee using the original copy of the grievance.
Section 6.	Arbitration

d.	Any subject matter relating to County-sponsored employee group insurance plans that could impose on the carrier, the provider or the County an obligation which would be in conflict with the applicable law and/or contracts or service agreements between the County and the carrier or provider.

ARTICLE 20	MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
It is the exclusive right of the County to determine the mission of each of its constituent departments, boards, and commissions, set standards of service to be offered to the public, and exercise control and discretion over its organization and operations. It is also the exclusive right of the County to direct its employees, take disciplinary action for proper cause, relieve its employees from duty because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons, and determine the methods, means and personnel by which the County's operations are to be conducted; provided, however, that the exercise of such rights does not preclude employees or their representatives from conferring or raising grievances about the practical consequences that decisions on these matters may have on wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment. The parties recognize the Board of Supervisors' authority to take legislative action necessary to meet their fiscal responsibility.

ARTICLE 21	EMPLOYEE RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS
In the event the County enters into any agreement with another public employer or private entity which involves the transfer of functions now being performed by employees in this representation unit or the law provides for the transfer of functions now being performed by employees in this unit to another public or private agency, the County will advise such public or private entity of the existence and terms of this Memorandum of Understanding and will immediately advise the Union of such agreement or law. In addition, the County will consult with the employer absorbing a County function to encourage utilization of affected employees by the new employer. When a department's Request for Proposal is approved by the Chief Administrative Officer, the Labor Relations Office will arrange to meet with representatives of the Union to advise them of this action within five (5) days. When advance knowledge of the impact of pending changes in function, organization, or operations is available which will result in the abolishment of functions from one department to another or to another agency, management will make an intensive effort to either reassign or transfer affected employees to other positions for which they qualify, or train affected employees for new positions in order to retain their services. It is understood and agreed that Management shall have no obligation to negotiate the decision of any reorganization by the County during the life of this agreement. Management acknowledges an obligation to negotiate the impact on wages, hours and working conditions of the employees in this bargaining unit insofar as such subjects are not set forth in Memoranda of Understanding or Civil Service Rules.
