USW-DELPHI - GM MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING and SPECIAL ATTRITION PROGRAM - VANDALIA DELPHI RESTRUCTURING AUGUST 16, 2007
The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union and USW-Local 87L (together, “USW”), Delphi, and the General Motors Corporation (“the Parties”) have a critical interest in Delphi’s successful emergence from bankruptcy with certain USW-represented operations. The Parties acknowledge that restructuring actions are necessary and commit to take specific actions to protect the needs of the Parties and their constituencies, continuing progress already made toward transforming Delphi’s labor cost structure and ongoing business operations. To enable continued transformation to more competitive wage and benefit levels, to address capacity, divestiture, work rules and staffing level issues, and to better position Delphi to retain existing business and attract new business, the Parties agree as follows on a two-party or three-party basis, as applicable, (the “Agreement”) subject to ratification by the membership as provided in G below.
A.	DURATION
Delphi and the USW agree that:
1.	This Agreement will continue until 11:59 p.m. on September 14, 2011.
2.	The agreement between Delphi Automotive Systems and Delphi Energy and Chassis Systems and Local Union 87, USW, dated December 8,1999 (the “USW-Delphi Master Agreement”) including all applicable modifications resulting from the Memorandum of Understanding - Home Avenue - Delphi Restructuring dated August 16, 2007 and resulting from this Agreement will be extended until 11:59 p.m. on September 14, 2011. The agreement between Delphi Corporation and Thermal and Interior Systems Vandalia and USW Local 87, dated June 22, 1998 and the “Survival Plan” effective January 3, 2005 (the “Vandalia Local Agreements”), and all related agreements and understandings, as modified by this Agreement, are extended until 11:59 p.m. on September 14, 2011. With respect to the Vandalia operations, the terms of this Agreement supersede and govern in the event of a conflict between this Agreement and the other agreements cited above.
3.	With respect to the Ronald Pirtle letter dated December 17, 2004, it is understood between Delphi and the USW that this letter stays in full effect, except as modified by this Agreement including, without limitation, Section B.2.

8/16/07
4.	The agreements comprising the USW-Delphi collective bargaining agreements, master and local, following the effective date of this Agreement are set forth in Attachment E.
B.	SITE PLAN
The USW and Delphi agree as follows concerning the transformation of the Vandalia plant operations (see Attachment A):
1.	In order to keep the Vandalia Thermal Operation open it is necessary to achieve an all-in blended labor wage and benefit rate of $19.57 per hour, consisting of E-ll and up to a maximum of 43 E-l production employees, as soon as possible and maintain that rate for the life of the Vandalia local agreement. Methods to maintain the $19.57 all-in blended rate may include, as an example, conversion of E-l personnel to the E-ll wage and benefit structure, as mutually agreed by the USW and Delphi.
2.	Failure to accomplish and maintain this all-in blended wage and benefit rate will result in the Vandalia Thermal Operations being closed during the term of the Vandalia local agreements.
C.	WORKFORCE TRANSITION
Delphi, the USW and GM, as applicable, agree on the following Special Attrition Program (the “Program”) for Delphi-Vandalia Operations employees:
1.	Delphi-Vandalia Operations employees who are active or on leave status will be offered lump sum buyouts, less applicable withholding, to sever all ties with Delphi and GM except vested pension benefits (as such no pension supplements are payable) on a date no later than January 1,2008. Employees with 10 or more years of seniority or credited service as of January 1,2008, whichever is greater, are eligible for $140,000; employees with three (3) but less than 10 years seniority or credited service as of January 1, 2008, whichever is greater, are eligible for $70,000; and employees hired prior to January 1,2005, but with less than three (3) years of seniority or credited service as of January 1, 2008, whichever is greater, are eligible for $40,000 (the "Buyout Payments"), paid in lump sum, less withholdings.
2.	Those employees hired after January 1,2005 will receive lump sum payments (less withholding) of $5,000 on January 1, 2008 and January 1,2009, provided they remain on the active roll as of the payment dates. Receipt of these payments is contingent upon a release of claims consistent with Paragraph C.5 of this agreement. These payments will not count towards the all-in wage and benefit
USW Vandalia 1113 MOU_Final_081607
Page 2 of 24
8/16/07
rate referred to in Paragraph B.1 of this Agreement.
3.	The parties agree that the approximately twenty-five (25) employees at the Delphi Vandalia Operations who meet the retirement or pre-retirement program criteria contained in the Memorandum of Understanding - Home Avenue - Delphi Restructuring dated August 16, 2007 may, at the employee’s election, be transferred to Home Avenue Operations. Such employees who accept transfer to the Home Avenue Operations will be eligible to participate in the retirement or pre-retirement options of the USW-Delphi-GM Special Attrition Program -Transformation. If the employees elect to remain at the Vandalia plant, their base wage rates and benefits will be modified to E-l status, and they will be subject to the terms of Section C.7.
4.	The application period will begin as soon as possible and will end no later than the earlier of December 31, 2007 or 60 days after the application period begins.
5.	All participants will be required to sign a release form releasing all claims against Delphi, GM, and the USW except workers' compensation claims.
6.	Delphi will use temporary employees as needed to bridge any difficulties arising from the implementation of the Special Attrition Program subject to the approval of Delphi and USW-Local 87L. Temporary employees will be paid at the rate of $8.00 per hour for production and $17.10 for skilled trades. Employees who have accepted a Buy Out under Section C.1 of this Agreement may be rehired as temporary employees. Such employees will be eligible for conversion to permanent status after 120 days of continuous employment per the Vandalia Local Agreement. Such converted employees will not be eligible for any coverage under the Term Sheet or for any transition options provided under this Agreement.
7.	In the event an insufficient number of E-l employees elect a buy out, the lowest seniority E-l employees over the maximum of 43 will be converted to E-l I status effective December 31,2007, and the plant staffing level will thereafter be adjusted in accordance with the local seniority agreement.
8.	The parties acknowledge the following matters:
a)	Delphi’s participation in this Program is subject to the approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court; which approval Delphi will seek in Delphi's Chapter 11 cases. In the event such participation is not allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, no party will have any obligations under this Agreement. GM's obligations in respect of the Program are subject to approval of the Program by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court pursuant to entry of an order that provides for the allowance and/or treatment of GM's claims as described in this Program and is otherwise reasonably satisfactory to GM and Delphi.
b)	The Program shall not be subject to abrogation, modification or rejection without the mutual consent of the USW, GM and Delphi and the order obtained
USW Vandalia 1113 MOU_Final_081607
Page 3 of 24
8/16/07
in the Bankruptcy Court by Delphi approving this Program shall so provide. The parties further agree (and the Bankruptcy Court order shall also provide) that this Agreement is without prejudice to any party-in-interest (including the parties to this Program and the official statutory committees appointed in Delphi's chapter 11 cases) in all other aspects of Delphi’s Chapter 11 cases, including by illustration, Delphi’s and GM’s respective positions in all commercial discussions and claims matters between them, all collective bargaining matters involving the parties, in any proceedings under Sections 1113 and/or 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the USW and under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to GM’s contracts with Delphi, in any pension termination proceeding under ERISA and/or the Bankruptcy Code, and all claims administration and allowance matters.
c)	For the avoidance of doubt, any obligations assumed by GM under this Program with respect to OPEB under Paragraph C.3 above or active health care and life insurance shall be conclusively deemed to be comprehended by, included within, and shall constitute a prepetition, general unsecured claim assertable by GM against the estate of Delphi Corporation under Delphi’s general indemnity of GM under the Master Separation Agreement.
d)	Nothing in this Agreement, the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of such Agreement, or the performance of any obligation hereunder, shall limit or otherwise modify (a) Delphi’s rights under Section 4041 of ERISA, or (b) Delphi’s rights under Section 1113 and/or 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code with regard to any obligations which pre-existed this Agreement, such as (by way of illustration only) the obligation to maintain the hourly pension plan or provide retirees or active employees with levels of healthcare or other benefits as specified in pre-existing labor agreements. Under no circumstances shall Delphi freeze its pension plan covering USW represented employees in a manner that prevents employees in the pre-retirement program from receiving on-going credited service sufficient to reach 30 years of credited service. Delphi shall provide the same healthcare and life insurance coverage to employees participating in the pre-retirement program that it provides to its other active USW employees; provided, however, that if Delphi reduces or eliminates such coverage provided to its active USW employees, GM shall subsidize such coverage provided to employees participating in the pre-retirement program up to the level provided to GM active employees in accordance with the applicable plan provisions in effect between GM and the UAW at the time Delphi reduces or eliminates such coverages as amended from time to time. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall limit, expand or otherwise modify the rights or obligations of any party under the Benefit Guarantee between GM and the USW.
e)	Nothing contained herein, in the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of this Program, or the performance of any obligation hereunder, shall constitute an assumption of any agreement described herein, including, without limitation (a) any
USW Vandalia 1113 MOU_Final_081607
Page 4 of 24
8/16/07
collective bargaining agreement between the USW and Delphi or (b) any agreement between GM and Delphi, nor shall anything herein, in the Bankruptcy Court’s approval of this Agreement, or the performance of any obligation hereunder, be deemed to create or give rise to an administrative or priority claim with respect to, in favor of, or for the benefit of GM or convert a prepetition claim into a postpetition claim or an administrative expense with respect to any party.
D.	PENSION AND OPEB / BENEFIT GUARANTEE
1.	The Parties have agreed to a Term Sheet - Delphi Pension Freeze and Cessation of OPEB and GM Consensual Triggering of Benefit Guarantee (the “Term Sheet") with respect to the freezing of Delphi’s pension plan, the cessation of Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) for Delphi employees and retirees and the consensual triggering of the Benefit Guarantee. That agreement the “Term Sheet” is attached as Attachment B, and is incorporated by reference herein.
2.	GM and the USW agree that the period of time on or before which GM’s obligations under sections b., c., d., and e. of the Benefit Guarantee Agreement between GM and the USW, dated December 13,1999 and signed December 22,1999 (“Benefit Guarantee”), may be triggered shall be extended to December 31,2007 (and to March 31,2008 if Delphi has commenced solicitation of acceptances of its chapter 11 plan of reorganization prior to December 31, 2007 but the plan has not been confirmed and substantially consummated or such later date as GM shall agree to extend ), provided, however that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, this extension shall be without prejudice to any rights, defenses or claims of any Party with respect to the Benefit Guarantee.

Effective January 1,2008, the following changes are applicable to all Vandalia employees, skilled and production who are not retired (subject to the provisions of Attachment B), excluding E-1 employees (Benefit Code F4), whose benefits will remain unchanged. Delphi will seek to continue to provide the applicable health care plan (HMO) to these E-l employees as long as it is cost effective and the carrier will administer the plan. In the event the plan is no longer available, E-l employees will be placed in the Traditional Care Network.
Active Health Care
•	Medical and Drug coverage will be the Basic Medical Plan (BMP). The new plan will be referred to as the BCBS Basic Medical Plan, Delphi plan code 5607.
USW members affected by this change, who are currently enrolled in other plans, will be automatically enrolled in the BMP effective January 1, 2008. The benefit summary for this plan appears later in this attachment.
•	Dental and Vision coverages will be available after reaching 36 months of seniority.
Post-employment Health Care
•	Upon retirement from Delphi, eligible employees will be able to continue any health care coverages then in effect. Continuation of such coverages will be at the retiree’s own expense and will be the full cost of any coverages continued.
•	Delphi will provide a Retiree Health Care Credit Balance (“Balance”) that retirees can use to pay for continued coverages. Delphi will credit each balance with $0.50 for every compensated hour during the employee’s active employment after January 1, 2008. In no event will calculation of a per hour cost (i.e. a pennysheet) for Vandalia include more than $0.50 per hour to account for the cost of this Retiree Medical Account. Hours for which credit will generally be granted include any time for which pay is received, including straight-time hours, for such things as:
o Bereavement Pay;
o Call-in Pay;
o Holiday Pay;
o Jury Duty;
o Overtime;
o Short-term Military Duty; and o Vacation
•	The Balance will also be credited with interest on an annual basis. The interest rate is that for the 30-year U.S. Treasury Bond. Any interest will be credited based on the accrued Balance at the end of each calendar year and will be recorded no later than May 1 of each year. This Balance continues to accrue until retirement or death at which time all credits and interest will cease to accrue.

8/16/07
•	The Retiree Health Care Credit Balance will be a “notional” account and will not be funded but paid out of the general assets of the Corporation.
•	At retirement or death, as applicable, the retiree or eligible surviving spouse may begin to draw down the balance. Credits may only be used to pay for the cost of health care coverages continued through Delphi or health care coverages purchased on an individual basis or through another group. In other words the credits can be used for premiums or contributions towards premiums, but cannot be used to reimburse medical expenses such as deductibles and co-payments.
•	The Balance has no cash value and may not be transferred. Employees who leave Delphi without retiring forfeit any accumulated Balance.
•	Upon the death of the retiree or if an employee dies after an employee becomes eligible to retire voluntarily under the Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan, health care coverages that were available may be continued for an eligible surviving spouse and eligible dependents on a self-pay basis. If the retiree/employee was eligible for and had any remaining Balance, the surviving spouse will be allowed to draw from such Balance on the same basis as the retiree until the Balance is exhausted.
•	A surviving spouse age 65 or older who is eligible, but is not enrolled for Medicare Part B coverage is not eligible to draw upon the Balance. Coverages may be continued on a self-paid basis until Medicare Part B coverage is obtained. After enrollment in Part B, the surviving spouse may draw upon the Balance while Medicare Part B enrollment is maintained.
LIFE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS
•	Corporation-paid Life Insurance while active will be based on the reduced base hourly rate.
•	Corporation-paid Life Insurance will cease upon retirement; the employee may continue any employee-paid coverage.
•	Sickness and Accident Coverage based on the reduced base hourly rate and limited to 26 weeks of benefits over any rolling 12-month period. In no event will any employee be eligible for more than 60 weeks of benefits over the life of the Agreement.
•	For current recipients, Extended Disability Benefit Coverage will be based on the reduced base hourly rate. For new recipients, the Parties agree EDB will be made available on a self-pay basis, Extended Disability Benefits for a maximum of 36 months of disability at an amount determined in accordance with Schedule I of the table found in Article II, 5 of Exhibit B (Life & Disability Supplement to the 2003 Master Agreement). Note: The joint parties will aggressively pursue an insurance provider in an effort to make available a self-paid EDB program.
OTHER BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS

•	Pension benefits will be provided under a defined contribution plan via a Corporation contribution to the employee’s PSP account of 7% of eligible wages. If the Union discovers instances where the Corporation contribution is other than 7% of eligible wage, the Corporation will investigate and rectify any error so that the employee is credited with the appropriate contribution amount.
•	Applicable terms and conditions of the Supplemental Agreement, Exhibit D, and all local agreements that concern any income security plans, benefits, payments or practices shall not apply to E-ll employees. Any funds in an individual’s account will remain that of the employee for disbursement in accordance with plan regulations.
•	GIS. will be eliminated
