All layoffs will be conducted in compliance with the provisions of the arbitration award of 1997 in the dispute between the Union and the Stardust Hotel-Casino concerning the layoff of Decker, modified here to mean that when a layoff occurs and/or positions are to be eliminated, the senior employees whose shifts are to be eliminated shall displace the junior employees on that shift within the unit.

•	Every cash-handling associate must understand and sign the SSP Cash Handling Policy stating that they understand and will abide by the policies and procedures.

•	All cash and cash equivalents are the property of SSP and are subject to audit by any authorized
-16-
CHS/SSP representative at any time.
•	Cash Shortages/Overages and Procedural deficiencies—the following will result'based on progressive discipline:
►	Any one incident of a cash variance (over or short) of $5 dr more will result in formal verbal warning with unit manager.
►	Any two cash variance verbal warnings within a rolling 90-day period will result in a formal . written warning.

Time limits may be waived by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union.

In the event the Employer and the Union cannot agree upon a mediator, either or both parties may apply to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to submit a list of 5 names.

Nothing said or done by the mediator may be referred to at arbitration. Nothing said or done by either party for the first time in the mediation hearing may be used against them at arbitration.
As an alternative, by mutual agreement in advance of the Grievance Mediation hearing, the neutral third (3rd) person may be designated a mediator/arbitrator who will attempt to mediate the dispute. When this occurs, in the event a mediated settlement cannot be reached, the decision of the mediator/arbitrator shall be binding onbothparties.
Training: For purposes of implementing the procedure set forth in this Article, the parties may apply to a joint training program in grievance mediation to be conducted by the FMCS under the sponsorship of the Joint Labor Management Team.

Policy:
After successful completion of the probationary/evaluation period, employees in their first year of employment will receive three (3) days after 90 days of service to be used within the accrual year (no carryover will be allowed). Employees hired in September, October, November, or December will receive these three (3) days in January and will not accrue any additional time.

Tipped employees will receive two times (2x) their regular hourly base weekly wages or the state mandated minimum wage (if 2x regular salary does not meetstate requirements) as pay for each hour of PTO.
