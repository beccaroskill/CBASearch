CSEA (the Civil Service Division) agrees to hold the State harmless, defend and indemnify the State and its officers, agents, and employees for fees, costs, and damages resulting from a challenge, in any forum (administrative or judicial) by any person or entity, to the provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION

ARTICLE 2	- UNION REPRESENTATION RIGHTS
2.1	Union Representatives
A.	The State recognizes and agrees to deal with designated Union stewards, elected bargaining unit council representatives, and/or Union staff on the following:
1.	The enforcement of this Contract;

The Union shall notify the State promptly of any changes of such stewards. Union stewards shall not be recognized by the State until such lists or changes thereto are received.
C.	Area of Representation - A Union steward's "area of primary representation" is defined as an institution, office, or building. However, the parties recognize that it may be necessary for the Union to assign a steward an area of representation for several small offices, department, or buildings within close proximity. Disputes regarding this paragraph may be appealed directly to Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure (Section 6.9)
2.2	Access
A.	Union stewards, Union staff, and/or elected bargaining unit council representatives may have access to employees to represent them pursuant to Section 2.1 A. above. Access shall not interfere with the work of the employees. Union stewards, Union staff, or elected bargaining unit council representatives seeking access to employees must notify the department head or designee in advance of the visit.

Union Stewards shall be permitted minimal and incidental use of State equipment for representational activities as defined in Section 2.1, if said equipment is available and utilized as a normal part of his/her duties.

C.	Use of State equipment or the time used for activities permitted in this section shall be subject to prior notification and approval by the employee's immediate supervisor.
2.4	Distribution of Union Information
A.	The Union may use existing employee organization bulletin boards to post materials related to Union business.

A copy of all materials posted must be distributed to the facility or office supervisor at the time of posting.
B.	The Union may, before or after work hours or during meal and rest periods, distribute Union literature. Distribution of Union information shall not be unreasonably denied or disrupt the work of others. However, if access for distribution of information is restricted for safety, security, or patient care including patient privacy, other reasonable accommodation will be made in accordance with department procedures.
C.	The Union may continue to use existing employee mailboxes and in-baskets for distribution of literature. Such information will be distributed to departmental employees based on the department's policies and procedures in distributing other non-business information.
D.	The Union agrees that any literature posted or distributed on site will not be libelous, obscene, defamatory, or of a partisan political nature.
E.	The Union shall be permitted incidental and minimal use of State electronic communication systems for communication of Union activities as the departments permit for other non-business purposes.
F.	The use of electronic communication systems (devices) are not considered private or secure information and are subject to being monitored by the department.

BU 3
02-03
2.6	Steward Time Off
Upon request of an aggrieved employee, a steward shall be allowed reasonable time off during working hours, without loss of compensation, for representational purposes in accordance with Section 2.1 A. of this Contract, provided the employee represented is in the steward's designated area of representation. Release time for these purposes is subject to prior notification and approval by the steward's immediate supervisor. Upon mutual agreement of the parties, a reasonable number of additional stewards can also be granted reasonable time off under this section.
2.7	Employee Time Off
Employees shall be entitled to reasonable time off without loss of compensation to confer with a Union representative on representational matters at the work site in accordance with Section 2.2 above during work hours, subject to approval of the employee's supervisor.
2.8	Union Steward Protection
The State shall be prohibited from imposing or threatening to impose reprisals, from discriminating or threatening to discriminate against Union stewards, or otherwise interfering with, restraining, or coercing Union stewards because of the exercise of any rights given by this Contract.
2.9	Union Information Packets
Upon initial appointment to any position as a probationary or permanent employee, the employee shall be informed by the employer that the Union is the recognized employee organization for the employee in said classification.

ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY
3.1	Union Security
The State agrees to deduct and transmit to the Union all membership dues authorized on a form provided by the Union. Effective with the beginning of the first pay period following ratification of this Contract by the Legislature and the Union, the State agrees to calculate, deduct, and transmit to the Union, Fair Share fees from State employees who do not have membership dues deductions for the Union, based upon an amount or formula furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions. The State further agrees to recalculate, deduct, and transmit Fair Share fees to the Union based upon any revised amounts or formulas furnished by the Union for Fair Share fees deductions during the term of this Contract. The State and the Union agree that a system of authorized dues deductions and a system of Fair Share fee deductions shall be operated in accordance with Government Code Sections 3513(h), 3513(j), 3515, 3515.6, 3515.7, and 3515.8, subject to the following provisions:
1.	When Fair Share fees are in effect, an employee may withdraw from membership in the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy to the State Controller at any time. An employee who so withdraws his/her membership shall be subject to paying a Fair Share fee, if such a fee is applicable.
2.	The Union agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the State and its agents harmless against any claims made of any nature and against any suit instituted against the State arising from this section and the deductions arising therefrom.
3.	The Union agrees to annually notify all State employees who pay Fair Share fees of their right to demand and receive from the Union a return of part of that fee pursuant to Government Code Section 3515.8.
4.	No provisions of this section or any disputes arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Contract.
5.	Should a recession election be successful, the written authorization for payroll deductions for Union membership shall remain in full force and effect during the life of this contract except that any employee may withdraw from the Union by sending a signed withdrawal letter to the Union with a copy of the State Controller's Office within thirty (30) calendar days prior to the expiration of this Contract.
3.2	Release of Home Addresses: Non Law Enforcement Employees
A.	Home Addresses - Generally
1.	Consistent with PERB regulations and State law, the State shall continue to provide the Union with home addresses on a monthly basis for all employees covered by this Contract until it expires.
14
BU 3
02-03
2.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, any employee may have his/her home address withheld from the Union at any time by submitting a written request to his/her appointing power on a form provided by the State.
B.	Home Address Withholding
The State will no longer use an Employee Action Request form that provides employees with the option of having their home address withheld from the Union. Instead, bargaining unit employees will, upon request on their own initiative, be given a separate form by their appointing power that permits two choices: (1) withhold their address from the Union, or (2) to cancel a previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to the Union.
C.	Home Address Withhold Notification to Employees
Within one month following ratification of this Contract by both parties, the State will send a letter drafted by the Union to all existing employees that have previously requested their home address be withheld. The letter will provide said employees with the option of canceling their previous withhold request thereby permitting release of their home address to the Union.
D.	Release and Use of Addresses
The State Controller's Office shall send the Union a list of all Bargaining Unit 1, 3, 4, 11, and 15 employees who, pursuant to subsection C. above, either did not respond or responded by indicating they wanted to continue withholding their home address from the Union. Said list(s) will contain the employee's name, agency, and reporting unit.
E.	Home Address Mailings by the State
The State will mail Union information once per year to the home address of bargaining unit employees who have requested their home address be withheld from the Union. Said material shall be provided by the Union. The cost of this mailing shall be paid for by the Union. The Union agrees to hold the State harmless for any annual mail that does not reach Bargaining Unit 1, 3, 4, 11, or 15 employees.
F.	Address Confidentiality
Employee work and home addresses shall be maintained as confidential by the Union. The Union shall take all reasonable steps to ensure the security of work and home addresses, and shall not disclose or otherwise make them available to any person, entity, or organization.
G.	Costs Reimbursable
The Union agrees to pay necessary and reasonable costs incurred by the State Controller’s Office to produce the necessary name/home/work address tape file on a monthly basis.

ARTICLE 8	- LEAVES
8.1	Vacation Leave
A.	Employees shall not be entitled to vacation leave credit for the first six (6) months of service. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying monthly pay periods of continuous service, all full-time employees covered by this section shall receive a one-time vacation bonus of forty-two (42) hours of vacation credit. Thereafter, for each additional qualifying monthly pay period, the employee shall be allowed credit for vacation with pay on the first day of the following month as follows:
7 months to 3 years
37 months to 10 years
121 months to 15 years
181 months to 20 years
20 years and over
7 hours per month
10 hours per month
12	hours per month
13	hours per month
14	hours per month
An employee who returns to State service after an absence of six (6) months or longer, caused by a permanent separation, shall receive a one-time vacation credit on the first monthly pay period following completion of six (6) qualifying pay periods of continuous service in accordance with the employee's total State service before and after the absence.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn vacation credits as set forth under Item A. above. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven (11) consecutive working days which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
C.	Employees working less than full-time accrue vacation in accordance with the chart shown in Section 7 L. of this Contract.
D.	Vacation credits may be taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
33
BU 3
02-03
E.	Employees are authorized to use existing fractional vacation hours that may have been accumulated.
F.	Upon termination from State employment, the employee shall be paid for accrued vacation credits for all accrued vacation time.
G.	Subject to operational needs, the time when vacation shall be taken by the employee shall not be unreasonably denied. Employee vacation requests shall be submitted and granted or denied in writing in a timely manner. Vacations can only be cancelled when unanticipated operational needs require it.
H.	Vacation requests must be submitted in accordance with departmental policies on this subject. However, when two (2) or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same vacation time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred vacation period in order of seniority (defined as total months of State service in the same manner as vacation is accumulated). When two (2) or more employees have the same amount of State service, department seniority will be used to break the tie. Vacation schedules, which have been established in a work unit, pursuant to the seniority provisions in this Article, shall not be affected by employee(s) entering the unit after the schedule has been established.
I.	By June 1 of each calendar year those employees whose vacation balance exceeds, or could exceed by December 31, the vacation cap of Section 8.1 J. must submit to their supervisor for approval a plan to use vacation to bring their balance below the cap. If the employee fails to submit a plan, or adhere to an approved plan, the department head or designee has the right to order an employee to take sufficient vacation to reduce the employee's vacation balance or potential balance on December 31 below the cap specified in Section 8.1 J.
J.	If an employee does not use all of the vacation that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued vacation credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of 400 hours (with Annual Leave 640 hours). A department head or designee shall permit an employee to carry over more than 400 hours (with Annual Leave 640 hours) of accrued vacation leave hours if an employee was unable to reduce his/her accrued hours because the employee: (1) was required to work as a result of fire, flood, or other extensive emergency; (2) was assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time; (3) was absent on full salary for compensable injury; (4) was prevented by department regulations from taking vacation until December 31 because of sick leave; or (5) was on jury duty.
8.2	Sick Leave
A.	As used in this section, "sick leave" means the necessary absence from duty of an employee because of:
1.	Illness or injury, including illness or injury relating to pregnancy;
34
BU 3
02-03
2.	Exposure to a contagious disease which is determined by a physician to require absence from work;
3.	Dental, eye, and other physical or medical examination or treatment by a licensed practitioner;
4.	Absence from duty for attendance upon the employee's ill or injured mother, father, husband, wife, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), son, daughter, brother, sister, or any person residing in the immediate household. Such absence shall be limited to six (6) workdays per occurrence or, in extraordinary situations, to the time necessary for care until physician or other care can be arranged.
B.	A full-time employee who has eleven (11) or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall be eligible for up to eight (8) hours of sick leave credit. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each qualifying pay period of service, each full-time employee shall earn eight (8) hours of credit for sick leave with pay.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro rata basis, the fractional part of his/her appropriate accrual rate of credit for sick leave with pay in accordance with the schedule in Article 7.
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in State service in addition to the primary full-time position with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position;
b.	Where an employee holds two (2) or more "less than full-time positions," the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but such credits shall not exceed the amount earned for (8 hours per pay period) full-time employment credit.
D.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification. The State recognizes the confidential nature of the relationship between the health care provider and patient. However, such substantiation shall include, but not be limited to, the general nature of the employee's illness or injury and prognosis (i.e., the anticipated length of the absence, any restrictions upon return to work that prevent the employee from performing the full range of his/her normal work assignment and anticipated future absences). If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved. Upon request, a denial of sick leave shall be in writing stating the reason for denial.
35
BU 3
02-03
E.	An employee may be required to provide a physician's or licensed practitioner's verification of sick leave when:
1.	The employee has a demonstrable pattern of sick leave abuse; or
2.	The supervisor has good reason to believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason. A supervisor has good reason if a prudent person would also believe the absence was for an unauthorized reason.
F.	Sick leave may be accumulated without limit.
G.	Sick leave may be requested and taken in fifteen (15) minute increments.
H.	A full-time employee whose continuity of employment is broken by a permanent separation of six (6) months or longer and is subsequently reemployed cannot be credited with any unused sick leave accumulated prior to the employee's separation and the full-time employee must complete one month of continuous service before being granted one day of sick leave credit. In addition, when a full-time employee has a break in the continuity of employment because of a permanent separation of less than six (6) months or because of a temporary separation, the full-time employee's prior unused sick leave balance is restored.
I.	When an employee's sick leave balance is zero, other leave credits such as vacation, CTO, PLP, personal holiday, or holiday leave may be substituted with the supervisor's approval, and shall not be unreasonably denied.
8.3	Bereavement Leave
A.	A department head or designee shall authorize bereavement leave with pay for a permanent or probationary full-time State employee due to the death of his/her parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, brother, sister, stepchild, or death of any person residing in the immediate household of the employee at the time of death. An intervening period of absence for medical reasons shall not be disqualifying when, immediately prior to the absence, the person resided in the household of the employee. Such bereavement leave shall be authorized for up to three eight-hour days (24 hours) per occurrence. The employee shall give notice to his/her immediate supervisor as soon as possible and shall, if requested by the employee's supervisor, provide substantiation to support the request upon the employee's return to work.
B.	A department head or designee shall authorize bereavement leave with pay for a permanent full-time or probationary full-time employee due to the death of his/her grandchild, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, mother-in-law, father-in-law, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, or immediate family members of domestic partners as defined in paragraph A. above. Such bereavement leave shall be authorized for up to three (3) eight-hour days (24 hours) in a fiscal year.

BU 3
02-03
C.	If the death of a person as described above requires the employee to travel over 400 miles one way from his/her home, additional time off with pay shall be granted for two (2) additional days which shall be deducted from accrued leave. Should additional leave be necessary, the department head or designee may authorize the use of other existing leave credits or authorized leave without pay. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.
D.	Employees may utilize their annual leave, vacation, CTO, or any other earned leave credits for additional time required in excess of time allowed in A. or B. above. Sick leave may be utilized for Bereavement Leave in accordance with sick leave provision of this Contract in Section 8.2. Any such request shall not be arbitrarily or unreasonably denied.
E.	Fractional time base (part-time) employees will be eligible for bereavement leave on a pro rata basis, based on the employees' fractional time base. (See schedule in Article 7.)

The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee's serious health condition, for the care of a child, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in Family Code Section 297), or parent who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
B.	For the purposes of providing the FMLA benefits the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA;
2.	An employee's child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. "Care" as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition;
3.	An employee's parent means a parent or an individual standing in loco parentis as set forth in the FMLA;
4.	Leave may include paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, personal leave, catastrophic leave, holiday credit, excess hours, and unpaid leave. In accordance with the FMLA, an employee shall not be required to use CTO credits, unless otherwise specified by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
a.	FMLA absences due to illness and/or injury of the employee or eligible family member, may be covered with the employee's available sick leave credits and catastrophic leave donations. Catastrophic leave eligibility and sick leave credit usage for a FMLA leave will be administered in accordance with Section 8.8 and 8.2 of this Contract.
b.	Other leave may be substituted for the FMLA absence due to illness and/or injury, at the employee's discretion. An employee shall not be required to exhaust all paid leave, before choosing unpaid leave, unless otherwise required by Section 8.8 of this Contract.
44
BU 3
02-03
c.	FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e., adoption or care of an eligible family member), may be covered with leave credits, other than sick leave, including unpaid leave, at the employee's discretion. Except in accordance with Section 8.8 of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave. Additional certification may be requested if the department head or designee has reasonable cause to believe the employee's condition or eligibility for FMLA leave has changed. The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (480 hours) FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA. This entitlement shall be administered in concert with the other leave provisions in Article 8 of this Contract. Nothing in this Contract should be construed to allow the State to provide less than that provided by the FMLA.
E.	Within 90 days of the ratification date of this Contract, and on January 1 of each year thereafter, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year.
Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year. Employees who have taken FMLA leave under the previous 12 month rolling period, shall be entitled to additional leave up to a total of 12 weeks for the current calendar year.
F.	An employee on FMLA leave has a right to be restored to his/her same or "equivalent" position (FMLA) or to a "comparable" position (CFRA) with equivalent pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.
G.	For the purposes of computing seniority, employees on paid FMLA leave will accrue seniority credit in accordance with the Department of Personnel Administration Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
H.	Any appeals regarding an FMLA decision should be directed to the department head or designee. FMLA is a Federal law and administered and enforced by the Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division. The State's CFRA is a State law which is administered and enforced by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. FMLA/CFRA does not supersede any Article of this Contract which provides greater family and medical leave rights. This section is not subject to grievance or arbitration.
8.17	Mentoring Leave
A.	Eligible employees may receive up to forty (40) hours of "mentoring leave" per calendar year to participate in mentoring activities once they have used an equal amount of their personal time for these activities. "Mentoring leave" is paid leave time which may only be used by an employee to mentor. This leave does not count as time worked for purposes of overtime. "Mentoring leave" may not be used for travel to and from the mentoring location.
45
BU 3
02-03
B.	An employee must use an equal number of hours of his or her personal time (approved annual leave, vacation, personal leave, personal holiday, or CTO during the workday and/or personal time during non-working hours) prior to requesting "mentoring leave." For example, if an employee requests two (2) hours of "mentoring leave," he or she must have used two (2) verified hours of his or her personal time prior to receiving approval for the "mentoring leave." "Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his or her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this contract and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave," an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment;
2.	Have successfully completed their initial probationary period; and
3.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards in accordance with the California Mentor Program Directory, under the guidance of the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year, however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	An employee is not eligible to receive “mentoring leave” if:
1.	He or she is assigned to a “post” position in the Departments of Corrections or Youth Authority; or
2.	He or she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education or Veterans’ Affairs.
G.	Permanent part-time and Permanent Intermittent employees may receive a pro-rated amount of Mentoring leave based upon their time base. For example, a half time employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of Mentoring leave per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a qualifying monthly pay period (equivalent to 160 hours) to earn 3.3 hours of Mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the Complaint procedure specified in Article 6 of this Contract.

8.18	Work and Family Participation
A.	Family Activity
Subject to operational needs and reasonable notice to the employer, employees shall be permitted to use accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or non-school family-related activities such as sports events, recitals, 4-H, etc., in which the employee’s child is participating.
However, use of such leave shall not diminish an employee’s entitlement under the Family School Partnership Act (Labor Code 230.8) to, upon reasonable notice to the employer, use up to eight (8) hours per month but not to exceed forty (40) hours per calendar year of accrued leave credits (vacation, annual leave, personal holiday, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or pre-school related activities in which the employee’s child is participating.
Family is defined as the employee’s son, daughter, or any child the employee stands in loco parentis (to the child).
Employee leave requests for family activities shall be in accordance with the appropriate departmental procedures.
B.	Family Crisis
Subject to operational needs, and upon reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor, employees shall be eligible to use accumulated leave credits for the purpose of dealing with family crisis situations (e.g., divorce counseling, family or parenting conflict management, family care urgent matters and/or emergencies). If the employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave.
Family is defined as the parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner (as defined in accordance with Family Code Section 297), child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or any person residing in the immediate household.
If eligible, any family crisis leave that meets the definition of serious health condition will run concurrently with Subsection 8.16 of this contract, Family and Medical Leave Act.
The State shall consider requests from employees to adjust work hours or schedules or consider other flexible arrangements consistent with a department’s operational needs and the provisions of this Contract.
Employee requests related to family crisis or domestic violence shall be in accordance with departmental procedures and, except in emergencies, shall be made with reasonable notice to the employee’s immediate supervisor.
The State shall maintain the confidentiality of any employee requesting accommodation under this section, but may require substantiation to support the employee’s request.

8.19.3	Educational Leave
A.	The State and the Union recognize the importance of Educational Leave. Each department may review the current departmental educational leave policy within 120 days of the ratification of this agreement. Each department will meet and confer with the Union on the impact of changes made in the current policy based upon the department’s review. This policy will at a minimum contain: criteria for course approval, an appeal of denial mechanism to an individual other than the immediate supervisor of the individual making the denial and time specific application process for employees to request usage of education leave, and documented verification of successful completion of approved course work.
B.	The department head or designee may approve educational leave with pay to attend programs at accredited schools, colleges (including 2 year and 4 year), universities (including independent studies) or programs recommended by a Trade Advisory Council for the purpose of further instruction in subjects related to the employee's work assignment and/or achievement of departmental goals. Approved educational leave shall be granted for reasonable travel time, instructional/classroom time and required field work during regular work hours.
1.	Only Unit 3 civil service employees in classes currently eligible for educational leave are eligible under this provision.
2.	The department head or designee may, at any time, limit the number of persons on educational leave commensurate with departmental work requirements, fiscal resources and availability of an appropriate substitute. A teacher/instructor whose written request for educational leave is denied shall be informed in writing of the reasons for such action within 14 calendar days. If an employee is denied education leave on three consecutive occasions he/she may request a review of the criteria upon which the leave was denied by a department head or designee.
3.	Eligible employees must have at least one (1) year of permanent full-time service in a classification which accrues educational leave before being granted such leave.
4.	Eligible employees will be credited with educational leave at a rate of 10 hours per month. Portions of months of service shall not be counted or accumulated.
5.	Tuition and all other expenses incurred as a result of educational leave will be the responsibility of the employee.

7.	When on educational leave, employees shall retain their merit salary adjustment date, and shall receive credit for vacation, sick leave, educational leave, or any other benefit which would normally accrue during such work period.
48
BU 3
02-03
8.	The Department of Personnel Administration shall provide by rule for the regulation, accumulation, and transfer of educational leave, and shall prescribe methods by which employees leaving the employment of one State agency and entering the employment of another State agency may receive proper credit for their accumulated educational leave.
9.	Requests under this Section shall not be unreasonably denied by the State nor shall employees make unreasonable requests to use education leave.
10.	An employee returning from educational leave shall have the right to return to his/her former position. Every reasonable effort will be made to return the employee to the same position.
C.	The State and the Union agree to the implementation that allows the conversion of educational leave into retirement service credit under the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS). Upon the retirement of an employee, all accrued hours of educational leave would be converted to CalPERS service. This conversion shall be at the same rate of conversion as is presently done with sick leave.
Pursuant to government code section 20963.1, a Unit 3 employee whose effective date of retirement is within four months of separation from employment of the State, shall be credited at his or her retirement with 0.004 year of service for each unused day of educational leave credit, as certified to the board by the employer. The provisions of this Section shall be effective for eligible State members who retire directly from State employment on and after January 1, 2000, provided a memorandum of understanding has been agreed upon by the State employer and the recognized employee organization to become subject to this Section.
D.	This Section does not apply to the exempt employees of the Special Schools of the Department of Education and Librarians.
8.20.3	9-12, 10-12 and 11-12 Leave

1.	Not to exceed 95 calendar days to permanent or probationary civil service employees or
2.	Not to exceed any three (3) pay periods during the period designated by the department head for release from performance of duties to full-time permanent or probationary employees. These need not be consecutive pay periods. Such leaves shall be without pay for persons employed and paid under the provisions of DPA Regulation 599.666 and with deferred pay for persons employed and paid under the provisions of DPA Regulation 599.667.
B.	Leaves of absence granted under the provisions of these rules shall be counted as qualifying service for merit and special in-grade salary adjustments, for seniority and for computation of months of total State service to determine changes in the monthly credit for vacation or annual leave. For all other purposes, leaves of absence granted pursuant to this Section shall not be counted as qualifying service.

Leave of absences without pay may be granted by the department head or designee upon the recommendation of the Employee Assistance Program Coordinator if all sick leave, holiday credits, vacation, and compensating time off have been exhausted, and the employee is not eligible to use Industrial Disability Leave or Non-Industrial Disability Insurance. A list of all Employee Assistance Program Coordinators and a telephone number to contact the appropriate coordinator shall be furnished to the Union within a timely manner after the execution of this Contract. Changes to such lists and phone numbers shall be promptly furnished to the Union when such changes occur.

When required by Cal/OSHA provisions, the State shall provide medical examinations for employees working in occupations which expose them to health risks. Examinations shall be in accordance with Cal/OSHA regulations.
9.10	Employee Injury on the Job
A.	In the event a disabling injury occurs to an employee while on the job, the State agrees to furnish prompt and appropriate transportation to the nearest physician or hospital. If circumstances permit, the employee's personal choice of physician will be utilized. Employees may submit, in writing, their choice of personal physician to be utilized in the event of an injury on the job.
55
BU 3
02-03
B.	An employee who is directed by his/her supervisor to accompany or transport an injured employee to a physician or medical facility shall suffer no loss of compensation for the time spent.
C.	If the treating physician advises the injured employee to go home or the employee is admitted and remains in a hospital or clinic for treatment, the employee shall be paid for his/her full shift.
D.	The State shall not use the Department of Industrial Relations Rating Bureau's Advisory Rating form as the vehicle to justify removing a worker from his/her normal work assignments.
9.11	Employee Injury or Disability
Employees shall be eligible for Industrial and Non-Industrial Disability Leave as provided in Government Code Sections 19869 through 19885, except as provided in Section 9.12 (Non-Industrial Disability Insurance), Section 9.13 (Enhanced Industrial Disability Leave), and Section 9.17 (Industrial Disability Leave).
9.12	Non-Industrial Disability Insurance
A.	Non-Industrial Disability Insurance (NDI) is a program for State employees who become disabled due to non-work related disabilities as defined by Section 2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code.
B.	For periods of disability commencing on or after October 1, 1984, eligible employees shall receive NDI payments at 60 percent (60%) of their full pay, not to exceed $135 per week, payable monthly for a period not exceeding twenty-six (26) weeks for any one disability benefit period. An employee is not eligible for a second disability benefit due to the same or related cause or condition unless they have returned to their regular time base, and work for at least ten (10) consecutive workdays. Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) workdays.
C.	The employee shall serve a ten (10) consecutive calendar day waiting period before NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued vacation or sick leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived when the employee is a registered bed patient in a hospital or nursing home, or receives treatment in a hospital or surgical unit or licensed surgical clinic. Procedure rooms and doctor's offices are not included.
D.	If the employee elects to use vacation, annual leave, personal leave, or sick leave credits prior to receiving NDI payments, he/she is not required to exhaust the accrued leave balance.
E.	Following the start of NDI payments, an employee may, at any time, switch from NDI to sick leave, vacation leave, annual leave, personal leave, or catastrophic leave but may not return to NDI until that leave is exhausted.
56
BU 3
02-03
F.	In accordance with the State's "return to work" policy, an employee who is eligible to receive NDI benefits and who is medically certified as unable to return to full-time work during the period of his or her disability, may upon the discretion of his or her appointing power work those hours (in hour increments) which, when combined with the NDI benefit, will not exceed 100 percent (100%) of their regular "full pay." This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period under B. of this section. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
G.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, NDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.

ARTICLE 11 - SALARIES
11.1	Salaries
Effective July 1, 2003, all Unit 1, 3, 4, 11 and 15 classifications shall receive a general salary increase of five percent (5%). The increase shall be calculated by multiplying the base salary by 1.05. The parties recognize that the actual salary increase for each classification may vary slightly due to rounding.
11.2	Salary Definitions
Units 1, 3, 4, 11 and 15 hereby agrees to support putting the following changes to Article 5. of the Department of Personnel Administration regulations into effect provided all bargaining units agree to the same.
As used in this Article, terms are defined as follows:
A.	“Salary range” is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class; Top Step Rounding: Classes shall be adjusted to reflect 5 percent increments between the minimum and the maximum salary rates. Each 5 percent shall be calculated by multiplying by 1.05 and rounded to the nearest dollar. To calculate 5 percent for daily and hourly rates multiply by 1.05 and round to the nearest dollar and cents amount, subject to the availability of funds.
B.	“Step” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a five percent (5%) differential above or below a rate rounded to the nearest dollar and cents amount. One-step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415). One-step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 + 1.05 = $2,300).
C.	“Rate” for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
D.	“Range differential” is the difference between the maximum rate of two salary ranges.
E.	“Substantially the same salary range “ is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two-steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
F.	“Higher salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two-steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
G.	“Lower salary range” is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
70
BU 3
02-03
Unless otherwise provided, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes except for deep classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movement between classes and salary ranges.

A.	When a permanent full-time employee receives no pay warrant on payday, the State agrees to issue a salary advance, consistent with departmental policy and under the following conditions:
1.	When there are errors or delays in processing the payroll documents and the delay is through no fault of the employee, a salary advance will normally be issued within two (2) workdays after payday for an amount close to the actual net pay (gross salary less deductions) in accordance with departmental policy;
2.	When a regular paycheck is late for reasons other than 1. above (e.g., AWOL, late dock), a salary advance of no less than 50 percent (50%) of the employee's actual net pay will normally be issued within five (5) workdays after payday. No more than four (4) salary advances per calendar year may be issued under these circumstances;
3.	The difference between the employee's net pay and the salary advance shall not be paid until after receipt of the Controller's warrant for the pay period.

Addendum I - Time off for Victims of Domestic Violence
State of California
M E M O R A N D U M

REFERENCE CODE: 2001-025
THIS MEMORANDUM SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO:

SUBJECT:	Time Off for Victims of Domestic Violence

Email: CharlotteGehringer@dpa.ca.gov
The purpose of this memo is to notify departments of an addition to existing law regarding time off for an employee who is a victim of domestic violence.
Effective January 1, 2001, Assembly Bill 2357 added Section 230.1 to the Labor Code to specify that employers with 25 or more employees may not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in Section 6211 of the Family Code, for taking time off to seek medical attention for injuries caused by domestic violence, obtain psychological counseling related to an experience of domestic violence, obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, program, or rape crisis center, or to participate in safety planning to increase safety from future domestic violence.
As a condition for taking time off, the employee shall give the employer reasonable advance notice of the employee’s intention to take time off for any of the purposes summarized above, unless advance notice is not feasible. When an unscheduled absence occurs, the employer may require the employee to certify that the absence is a result of domestic violence in the form of a police report, a court order, or medical documentation. An employer would be required to maintain the confidentiality of any employee’s request for time off pursuant to provision of this law.

The law does not require an employer to compensate an employee for the time taken off under these circumstances, but the employee may use vacation, personal leave, or other compensating time off that is otherwise available to the employee.
An employee whose rights are violated under this section may be entitled to lost wages and reinstatement. An employer who willfully refuses to reinstate an employee under this section may be guilty of a misdemeanor. This law also allows an employee to file a complaint with the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement of the Department of Industrial Relations.
This section does not create a right for an employee to take unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave time allowed under, or in addition to the unpaid leave time permitted by, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
The provisions of this bill apply to the State as an employer and to State employees. The entitlement of any employee under this law shall not be diminished by a collective bargaining agreement.
If you have any questions, please contact Charlotte Gehringer at (916) 323-6938.
