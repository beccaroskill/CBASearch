It is the purpose of this Agreement and it is the intent of the parties hereto to establish and promote mutual harmonious understanding and relationships between the Employer and Unit 156-Sergeants, to promote departmental efficiency and effectiveness, to establish wages, hours, standards and other terms and conditions of employment of Sergeants covered by this Agreement, and to provide for the equitable and peaceful adjustment and resolution of differences which may arise from time to time over the negotiations, interpretation and application of this Agreement.
In consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto, by their duly-authorized representative and/or agents, do mutually covenant and agree, as follows:

Any present Sergeant who is not a member of Unit 156-Sergeants shall, as a condition of employment, be required to pay fair share (not to exceed the amount of Unit 156-Sergeants dues) of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration. All Sergeants promoted into Unit 156-Sergeants on or after the effective date of this Agreement and who have not made application for membership shall, on or after the thirtieth day following their promotion, also be required to pay a fair share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration.
Section 3.2	Dues Deduction
A.	With respect to any Sergeant on whose behalf the Employer receives written authorization in a form agreed upon by Unit 156-Sergeants and the Employer, the Employer shall deduct from the wages of the Sergeant the dues and/or financial obligations uniformly required and shall forward the full amount to Unit 156-Sergeants by the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month in which the deductions are made. The amounts deducted shall be in accordance with aschedule to be submitted to the Employer by Unit 156-Sergeants. Authorization for such deduction shall be irrevocable unless revoked by written notice to the Employer and Unit 156-Sergeants during the fifteen (15) day period prior to the expiration of this contract.

B.	With respect to any Sergeant on whose behalf the Employer has not received a written authorization as provided for in 3.2 A above, the Employer shall deduct from the wages of the Sergeant, the fair-share financial obligation (including any retroactive amount due and owing), and shall forward said amount to Unit 156-Sergeants by the 10th day of the month following the month in which the deduction is made, subject only to the following:
1.	Unit 156-Sergeants has certified to the Employer that the affected Sergeant has been delinquent in his/her obligation for at least 60 days;

Section 3.4	Bona Fide Religious Belief
This Article shall not be enforced in a manner inconsistent with Section 6(g) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act based upon the bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a church or religious body of which such employees are members provided, however, that such employees may be required to pay an amount equal to a lawful fair share to a non-religious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the affected employees and Unit 156.

In the event that the results of a polygraph examination become admissible as evidence before the Police Board and the Department determines a polygraph examination is necessary, the complainant will be requested to take a polygraph examination first. If the complainant refuses to take a polygraph examination, the accused police Sergeant will not be requested to take a polygraph examination. If the complainant takes the polygraph examination and the results indicate deception, the accused Sergeant may be requested to take a polygraph

109508.1
examination covering those issues wherein the examiner determines that the complainant is truthful.
When the polygraph is used, the accused member will be advised twenty-four (24) hours prior to the administering of the test, in writing, of any questions to which the Department will request an answer.
Section 6.7	Disclosure
A Sergeant shall not be required to disclose any item of his/her property, income, assets, source of income, debts, or personal or domestic expenditures (including those of any member of his/her family or household) unless such information is reasonably necessary to monitor the performance of the Sergeant's job, violations of reasonable Employer rules, statutes, ordinances, or this Agreement. In the administration of fringe benefits applicable to all employees of the Employer, Sergeants covered by this Agreement may be required to disclose any coverage they (including any member of their families or households) may have under health or medical insurance and the name and appropriate identification of the carrier and coverage. Except for Ethic Statements legally required to be filed, the parties agree that the disclosure of such personal information shall not be made available for public inspection or copying because such would be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of the Sergeant, and/or is intended to otherwise be exempt from any state or local freedom of information statute, ordinance or executive order.
Section 6.8	Media Information Restrictions
The identity of a Sergeant under investigation shall not be made available to the media unless there has been a criminal conviction or an adverse decision has been rendered by the Police Board (or by the Superintendent where no appeal is taken to the Police Board). However, if the Sergeant is found innocent, the Sergeant may request and the Department shall issue a public statement.
ARTICLE 7
SUMMARY PUNISHMENT
Summary punishment action shall be considered as an alternative to formal disciplinary procedures, provided that in each such action the following shall apply:
10
109508.1
A.	The summary punishment which may be administered conforms to the “Notice to Supervisors Regarding Progressive Discipline,” as set forth in this Agreement as Appendix B, and is limited to:
1.	reprimand;
2.	excusing a member for a minimum of one (1) day to a maximum
of three (3) days without pay.
In lieu of days off without pay, a Sergeant shall be permitted to utilize accumulated elective time to satisfy the summary punishment.
B.	The Department shall promulgate, maintain and publicize reasonable guidelines
which will specify those acts, omissions or transgressions, the violation of which will subject a Sergeant to summary punishment action, and the penalties for each such violation, which shall be uniformly applied.
ARTICLE 8
EMPLOYEE SECURITY
Section 8.1	Just Cause Standard
No Sergeant covered by this Agreement shall be suspended, relieved from duty or disciplined in any manner without just cause.
Section 8.2	File Inspection
The Employer's personnel files, disciplinary history files and completed inactive investigative files, except for information which the Employer deems to be confidential, shall be open and available for inspection by the affected Sergeant during regular business hours.
Section 8.3	Limitation on Use of File Material
It is agreed that any material and/or matter not available for inspection, such as provided in Section 8.2 above, shall not be used in any manner or any forum adverse to the Sergeant's interests.
11
109508.1
Section 8.4	Use and Destruction of File Material
Disciplinary Investigation Files, Disciplinary History Card Entries, OPS disciplinary records, and any other disciplinary record or summary of such record other than Police Board cases, will be purged from the online file system five (5) years after the date of the incident or the date upon which the violation is discovered, whichever is longer and, therefore, will not be used against the Sergeant in any future disciplinary proceedings, unless the investigation relates to a matter which has been subject to either civil or criminal court litigation or arbitration prior to the expiration of the five-year period. In such instances, the Complaint Register case files will be purged from the online file system five years after the date of the final arbitration award or the final court adjudication, unless a pattern of sustained infractions exists.
Any information of an adverse employment nature which may be contained in any unfounded or exonerated file, shall not be used against the Sergeant for any reason. A “not sustained” finding shall not be used against the Sergeant in any future proceeding.
A finding of "Sustained - Violation Noted, No Disciplinary Action" entered upon a member's disciplinary record or any record of summary punishment may be used for a period of time not to exceed one (1) year and shall thereafter be removed from the Sergeant’s disciplinary record and not used for disciplinary action. The Department's finding of "Sustained - Violation Noted, No Disciplinary Action" is not subject to the grievance procedure.
Information relating to a "preventable" traffic accident involving a Department Vehicle may be used and/or considered in determining future discipline for a period of time not to exceed two (2) years from the date of such "preventable" traffic accident and shall thereafter not be used and/or considered in any employment action provided there is no intervening "preventable" traffic accident involving a Department Vehicle and if there is, the two-year period shall continue to run from the date of the most recent "preventable" traffic accident and any prior incidents which were determined to be "preventable" traffic accidents may be used and/or considered in employment actions. In no event shall any prior "preventable traffic accident" five (5) or more years old be used and/or considered.
Section 8.5	Notification
In the event the Employer receives subpoena or other legal process (excluding discovery material) requiring the inspection, tender or submission of personnel, disciplinary or investigative records and/or files (other than Grand Jury subpoena or other subpoena or process which would preclude disclosure), the Employer will promptly send a copy of such subpoena or process to the Sergeant whose records have been requested. However, failure to furnish such notice shall not in any way affect the validity of any disciplinary action or personnel action
12
109508.1
taken by the employer, provided that Unit 156-Sergeants will not be barred from asserting and does not waive any right(s) a Sergeant may have to inspect or to otherwise challenge the use of files under applicable rules, statutes or this Agreement including ARTICLE 8.	.
ARTICLE 9
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 9.1	Definition and Scope
Agrievance is defined as a dispute or difference between the parties to this Agreement concerning interpretation and/or application of this Agreement or its provisions. The separation of a Sergeant from service and suspensions in excess of thirty (30) days are cognizable only before the Police Board and shall not be cognizable under this procedure, provided, however, that the provisions of ARTICLE 17 shall be applicable to separations. The CRP process shall not be applicable to Sergeants covered by this Agreement.
The grievance procedure provisions herein and the Police Board procedure are mutually exclusive and no relief shall be available under both, provided that, if the Police Board reduces a discipline of over thirty (30) days to thirty (30) days or under, the Sergeant may grieve the reduced discipline.
Section 9.2	Procedures, Steps, and Time Limits
A grievance may be initiated by Unit 156 or an aggrieved Sergeant. Any Sergeant shall have the right to present a grievance at any time, although it is understood that the Sergeant should attempt to satisfy his/her concerns on an informal basis before invoking the procedure. In the event an informal resolution proves to be unsatisfactory, a grievance may be filed in a form to be agreed upon between Unit 156 and Employer and shall be processed in accordance with this Agreement. Upon request, the grievant shall be represented by an appropriate Unit 156 representative, provided, however, the grievant Sergeant may have the grievance adjusted without a Unit 156 representative, so long as such adjustment is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
Step One: The grievant will first attempt to resolve the grievance with the first exempt command officer in his/her chain-of-command. This attempt at resolution shall be made by the Sergeant within ten (10) of the Sergeant’s working days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or where first known by the grievant, or forty (40) days, whichever period is shorter. A Unit 156 representative may accompany the grievant if requested by the grievant. The superior shall give his/her decision to the grievant within ten (10) of the superior's working days of its presentation.
13
109508.1
Step Two: If the response at Step One is not satisfactory to the grievant, the grievant may pursue an adjustment through his/her designated representative by filing a request for determination, with his/her written grievance attached, with Unit 156 within ten (10) days of the Step One response or within ten (10) days of the expiration of the response period in Step One, whichever is sooner. Unit 156 shall then determine whether in its opinion a valid grievance exists. Unless Unit 156 elects to proceed, there shall be no further action taken under this procedure. If Unit 156 chooses to proceed, it may seek a resolution or adjustment of the grievance by presenting in person the written grievance to the MLAS within ten (10) days from the time Unit 156 receives the grievant's request. Following a hearing on the issue, a decision, in writing, shall be rendered within ten (10) days of receiving the grievance. If the grievant is directed by the Employer to meet concerning his/her grievance at a time when the Sergeant is not scheduled to work, he/she shall be compensated for such time at the applicable rate provided for in this Agreement, provided a Sergeant shall not be compelled to attend a hearing on his/her regular day off without his/her consent.
Step Three - Mediation: If the response at Step Two is not satisfactory to the grievant and Unit 156, Unit 156 and the Management and Labor Affairs Section will meet for the purpose of mediation of the grievance. Either party may request the presence of a Mediator at such meeting, the selection of whom shall be mutually agreed upon. The mediation meeting shall be conducted no less than once each month, unless waived by mutual agreement, between a Unit 156 representative and a Department representative having authority to resolve the grievance. The parties shall split evenly the cost of the Mediator's expense and fees.
Step Four - Arbitration: Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Step Two decision, Unit 156 may, upon written request, refer the grievance to arbitration.
Section 9.3	Arbitration of Standard Grievances
Either party may seek arbitration. If the Employer desires to proceed to arbitration, Section 9.2 does not apply. If either Party proceeds to arbitration, the following procedure shall apply:
A.	Within ten (10) days, the Employer and Unit 156 shall attempt to mutually agree upon an Arbitrator. If they fail to agree, a list of seven (7) qualified neutrals shall be requested from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Within ten (10) days after receipt of the list, the parties shall select an Arbitrator. Both the Employer and Unit 156 each shall alternately strike names from the panel. The remaining person shall be the Arbitrator; or
B.	The Employer and Unit 156, by mutual agreement, may submit the matter for mediation before a mediator, but mediation shall not be a pre-condition for arbitration. If the
14
109508.1
case is not resolved, the parties may exercise their right to arbitrate under this section by request made by either party within thirty (30) days of the mediation. The mediator shall not be selected as the arbitrator for the same case. The parties shall split evenly the cost of the -mediator's expenses and fees.
C.	The Employer or Unit 156, by mutual agreement, may submit the matter to expedited arbitration under rules in Appendix C.
Whenever discipline cases are processed pursuant to the parties' Expedited Arbitration Rules, the parties shall submit the cases to a screening process, and the arbitrator designated by the parties for the screening process shall issue a screening Advisory Report. This report shall be submitted to the parties and reviewed by them each month. The parties shall meet and discuss the recommendations contained in the screening Advisory Report for a minimum of two days each month, unless waived by mutual agreement. In the event the cases are not resolved based upon discussions of the parties, the arbitrator's screening recommendations will not be binding upon the parties. Any cases not resolved by the screening process shall be submitted to arbitration under the parties' expedited Arbitration Rules.
In all discipline cases, Department Complaint Register files shall be provided to Unit 156 promptly after request by Unit 156 or Unit 156 representatives who are sworn members of the Department, and these members shall be allowed to use Department copying equipment to copy the requested Complaint Register files, with appropriate supervision.
D.	The parties shall develop a roster of 12 arbitrators who shall commit to prescheduled hearing dates on a regular basis. From this roster the parties shall schedule a minimum of two (2) arbitration hearing dates per month, unless waived by mutual agreement. The parties shall make every effort (including the substitution of cases in the event of settlement or inability to try a case when scheduled) to insure that such dates are not canceled.
The parties shall avoid continuances. Requests for continuances are disfavored and shall be granted only upon showing good cause.
Section 9.4	Authority of the Arbitrator
A.	Except as specified in sub-section B below, the Arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, disregard, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The Arbitrator shall only consider and make a decision with respect to the specific issue or issues presented to the Arbitrator and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issues not so submitted. The Arbitrator shall submit, in writing, his/her decision to the
15
109508.1
Employer and to Unit 156 within thirty (30) days following the close of hearing unless the parties agree to an extension thereof. The decision shall be based upon the Arbitrator's interpretation of the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement to the facts of the grievance presented, and shall be final and binding upon the parties.
B.	Any Sergeant who is amember of, and adheres to, the established and traditional
tenets or teachings of a bonafide religion, body or sect which has historically held conscientious objections to financially supporting organizations such as Unit 156, upon proof thereof, may be excused from the obligations set forth in Section 3.1 ARTICLE 3; and the Arbitrator may require, in lieu of such obligations, the payment by such Sergeant of a sum equal to the fair share agency fee to a non-religious charitable fund exempt from taxation under Section 501 C (3) of Title 26 chosen by such Sergeant from a list of at least three such funds to be submitted by Unit 156. The Employer shall not participate in but shall be bound by such an arbitration.
If a Sergeant who holds conscientious objections pursuant to this Section requests Unit 156 to use the grievance-arbitration procedure on the Sergeant’s behalf, Unit 156 may charge the Sergeant the reasonable costs of using the procedure.
Section 9.5	Expenses of the Arbitrator
The fee and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be borne by the party whose position is not sustained by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator, in the event of a decision not wholly sustaining the position of either party, shall determine the appropriate allocation of his/her fees and expenses. Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representative(s) and witness (es). The cost of a transcript, where requested by either party, shall be paid by the party so requesting it. The party requesting a cancellation, rescheduling or other postponement of a set hearing date shall pay the Arbitrator's cancellation fee.
Section 9.6	Processing and Time Limits
The resolution ofa grievance satisfactory to Unit 156 at any step shall be deemed a final settlement, and any grievance not initiated or taken to the next step within the time limit specified herein will be considered settled on the basis of the last answer by management. The time limits specified in this Article may be extended or waived by mutual agreement. Grievances may be initiated at any appropriate step corresponding with the nature of the grievance and the manner in which it arose.

109508.1
ARTICLE 9A MEDICAL GRIEVANCES
Section 9A.1 Psychological Review
Grievances concerning involuntary removal from active duty due to psychological or psychiatric reasons will comply with the following procedures:
Step One: A Sergeant who wants to challenge the City’s decision to place him/her involuntarily on the medical roll will file a grievance with the Medical Administrator within ten (10) calendar days of being placed on the medical roll, or if the member was on authorized furlough during his/her involuntary placement, within thirty-five (35) calendar days of being placed on the medical roll or within thirty-five (35) calendar days of the Sergeant on furlough being notified of placement on the medical roll.
If the City's psychiatrist/psychologist recommends that the Sergeant is fit for full duty and also was fit when he/she was involuntarily placed on the medical roll due to psychological or psychiatric reasons, the Sergeant shall have any paid medical time used during such period of being involuntarily placed on the medical roll restored and will be made whole for lost pay and other benefits to which he/she is entitled.
Step Two: For a member who has filed a timely grievance at Step One, and/or when the City's psychiatrist/psychologist recommends that the Sergeant is unfit for full duty and was also unfit when he/she was involuntarily placed on the medical roll due to psychological or psychiatric reasons, then upon written request made by Unit 156-Sergeants within ten (10) calendar days of notice to the member that he/she is unfit for duty, Unit 156-Sergeants may file a grievance at Step Two and may request review of that decision by a three-member psychological review panel. The Sergeant shall, as promptly as feasible, be evaluated by a panel of three psychiatrists or psychologists, one appointed by Unit 156-Sergeants, one appointed by the City and a third knowledgeable about police duties appointed by mutual agreement of the City's and Unit 156-Sergeants’ psychiatrist or psychologist. This panel shall have the authority to examine and evaluate the Sergeant, and recommend whether the Sergeant is fit for duty. In making its recommendations, the primary considerations of the panel shall be the protection and safety of, and need for effective service to, the public. These considerations shall prevail over all others in any case of conflict of interests between the Sergeant and the City.
If the panel recommends that the Sergeant is fit for duty, and was also fit when he/she was placed involuntarily on the medical roll due to psychological or psychiatric reasons, then the Sergeant shall have any paid medical time used during such involuntary period on the
17
109508.1
medical roll restored, and will be made whole for lost pay and other benefits to which he/she is entitled.
If the panel determines that the member was unfit for duty at the time he/she was involuntarily placed on the medical roll, but became fit for duty sometime thereafter, the panel shall identify the point at which the member was fit for duty and the member will be made whole for lost pay and benefits from the date that the panel determined he/she was fit for duty.
Each party shall bear the full cost of the panel member appointed by it, with the cost of the mutually-appointed panel member to be split equally between the parties. The recommendations of the panel shall be binding upon the City, Unit 156-Sergeants and the Sergeant.
Section 9A.2 Medical Grievances
Grievances concerning medical issues (excluding issues covered under Section 9.A. 1.) shall follow the procedure below. Medical issues are defined as grievances involving medical issues, including, but not limited to, the non-payment of IOD bills; removal of a Sergeant from duty for medical reasons; refusal to return a Sergeant to duty from medical roll, classification of an injury as non-IOD and the Benefits Management Office's denial of payment of medical and hospital bills of a Sergeant or his/her covered dependent under the City's self-funded health care plan.
Step One: Initiating a Medical Grievance. Grievances concerning the Benefits Management Office's denial of payment of medical and hospital bills will be filed with the Management and Labor Affairs Section within ten (10) working days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or when first reasonably known by the grievant.
All other grievances concerning medical issues will be filed with the Medical Administrator within ten (10) working days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or where first known by the grievant, but in no event later than thirty-five (35) calendar days following the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance or within thirty-five (35) days of a Sergeant on furlough being notified of the events or circumstances giving rise to the grievance. If the determination at Step One is not satisfactory, Unit 156-Sergeants may by written request made within fifteen (15) days of the Step One response or the expiration of the period for said response submit the matter for mediation.
Step Two: Mediation of Medical Grievances. At mediation, representatives of Unit 156-Sergeants, the Police Department, the Benefits Management Office and the Finance Committee of the City Council, shall participate, as needed. Any settlements reached in the
18
109508.1
mediation proceedings shall be binding upon the parties. Medical mediation sessions shall occur each thirty (30) days, unless waived by mutual agreement. The parties shall split evenly the cost of the mediator's fees and expenses.
The grievant shall be provided with the relevant medical records within the possession of the Medical Section, the Committee on Finance, Benefits Management Office and Management & Labor Affairs Section. A release shall be required for production of medical records. The relevant medical records shall include the Medical Administrator’s determination of the grievant's status and the response to the grievance. The above records shall be submitted to Unit 156-Sergeants by the Department within forty-five (45) days of the Department's receipt of Unit 156-Sergeants’ releases and mediation agenda, setting forth the grievants' names. Relevant records from the Medical Section, the Committee on Finance, the Benefits Management Office and Management & Labor Affairs Section shall be provided as stated above and throughout the grievance process until the grievance is fully resolved.
Relevant documents to be produced by the Benefits Management Office in mediation are limited to medical records, claim forms, medical bills, explanation of benefits, and recommendation to and decision of the Benefits Committee regarding the claim. This definition of relevant records to be produced by the Benefits Management Office does not preclude Unit 15 6-Sergeants from subpoenaing additional relevant documentation in response to the scheduling of an arbitration of a grievance.
Step Three: Arbitration. If the grievance is not resolved at Step Two, Unit 156-Sergeants, upon written request within thirty (30) days of the date of mediation, may demand arbitration. The Mediator shall not be selected as the Arbitrator for the same case. The arbitration hearing shall be scheduled to commence within thirty (30) days of the selection of the Arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. Within ten (10) days of Unit-156 Sergeants’ demand for arbitration, the Employer and Unit 156-Sergeants shall attempt to mutually agree upon an Arbitrator. If they fail to agree, a list of seven qualified neutrals shall be requested from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Within five (5) days after receipt of the list, the parties shall select an Arbitrator. Both the Employer and the Unit 156-Sergeants shall alternately strike names from the list. The remaining person shall be the Arbitrator.

The Employer will continue to provide equal employment opportunity for all Sergeants, and develop and apply equal employment practices.
19	109508.1
Section 10.2	Non-Discrimination
The Employer shall not discriminate against Sergeants with regard to race, color, sex, religion, age, or national origin of the Sergeant nor shall the Employer discriminate against Sergeants as a result of membership in the PBPA. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to preclude the mandatory retirement of any Sergeant upon or after the attainment of age 63. Sergeants shall not be transferred, assigned or reassigned for reasons prohibited by this Section 10.2.
Section 10.3	Religious Holiday Accommodation
The obligation to accommodate the religious beliefs of Sergeants covered by the Agreement is fulfilled if those Sergeants whose religious beliefs require that they not work but who are scheduled to work on a recognized religious holiday are permitted at the Sergeant’s option one of the following choices in order to be excused from their regular tour of duty: (a) the use of elective time; or (b) excused from duty non-disciplinary (Code 89). This option may be applied for certain recognized religious holidays of faiths whose tenets require abstinence from work, subject to the determination of the Commanding Officer that this accommodation does not unduly interfere with operational needs.
Section 10.4	Americans with Disabilities Act
In the event the Employer shall be required to make a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act to the disability of an applicant or incumbent Sergeant that may be in conflict with the right of a Sergeant under this Agreement, the Employer shall bring this matter to the attention of Unit 156. In the event the parties cannot reach an agreement on such accommodation, the provisions of ARTICLE 9 shall be available and the Arbitrator shall consider the Employer’s and Unit 156's (if any exists) obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and this Agreement, provided that no Sergeant shall be displaced by such decision.

A holiday specified in Section 11.1 may not be selected as a personal day. Sergeants may elect to be paid for three (3) unused personal days per year in lieu of taking the time off. Where Sergeants elect such payment, the payment shall be made by April 1 of the following year. Sergeants may carry over two unused personal days for use in the following year.

Section 11.5	Holiday Declaration

A.	The plans for both medical and dental benefits, including the provisions on eligibility and self-contribution rules and amounts in effect as of the date of this Agreement, may not be changed by the City without the agreement of Unit 156; however, any changes during the terms of this Agreement relating to health care (including, but not limited to, changes in employee contributions, deductible or out-of-pocket) agreed to with Lodge 7 and applicable to bargaining unit members represented by Lodge 7 or Fire Lieutenants represented by Local 2, shall be applicable to Sergeants covered by this Agreement.

Formal recommendations of the Committee shall be submitted, in writing, to the Superintendent or his/her designee with a copy to Unit 156-Sergeants, but such recommendations shall not be binding upon the Employer or Unit 156-Sergeants. In addition to Committee recommendations, Unit 156-Sergeants may submit additional written recommendations to the Superintendent.
For purposes of this Section, the term “investigating” shall be limited to the right of Unit 15 6-Sergeants Committee members to obtain information upon request, receive minutes of other Department safety meetings (if any) and observe conditions regarding identified safety and health hazards and to discuss such matters with Sergeants and members of management provided such discussions do not unduly interfere with the performance of duty by any Sergeant or Committee member.
In the event the Employer agrees, in writing, to adopt the recommendation of the Committee or Unit 156-Sergeants, the recommendation shall be implemented within a reasonable period of time, unless the failure to implement in a timely fashion was beyond the reasonable control of the Employer. However, no monetary relief shall result from the failure to implement any such recommendation.
If the Superintendent or the Superintendent’s designee disagrees with the recommendation of the Committee or Unit 156-Sergeants, he/she shall so notify the Committee or Unit 156-Sergeants in writing, within ten (10) days. Within ten (10) calendar days of such notice, Unit 156-Sergeants may request arbitration of any such dispute if such dispute raises a good faith issue regarding the use of equipment or materials which are alleged
25
109508.1
to present a serious risk to the health or safety of a Sergeant beyond that which is inherent in the normal performance of police duties. The decision of the Arbitrator under this Section shall be advisory only and shall not be binding upon the Employer, provided that this procedure shall not be exclusive and shall not affect the right of a Sergeant or Unit 156-Sergeants to invoke ARTICLE 9 where otherwise appropriate.

Further, a Sergeant who voluntarily leaves a watch or unit after his furlough selection will have his furlough segment changed if there is a Sergeant on the new watch or unit who already has the same furlough segment which results in an overage of Sergeants on furlough for that watch or unit, in which event the incoming Sergeant shall have the opportunity to select from available furlough segments.
The day off group of a sergeant on furlough (full or split) will not be changed during the remainder of the week in which the sergeant is scheduled to return, unless a sergeant who is required to work on his scheduled day(s) off during that week is compensated by the payment of premium benefits under Article 20 for all hours worked on his scheduled day off.
Sergeants who elect to split their annual furloughs into two segments or take a full annual furlough will, if they so desire and at their option, be returned to the day off group they were in at the time of their furlough or furlough segments were selected. Affected sergeants who desire to be returned to the day off group they were in at the time they scheduled their furlough will notify their unit commanding officer, in writing, two (2) weeks prior to the beginning of the furlough or furlough segment if their day off group must be changed to match

1.	Personal days shall receive first priority;
2.	Baby furlough days shall receive second priority;
3.	Surplus vacation days shall receive third priority; and
4.	Compensatory time shall receive fourth priority.

Requests for days off that are submitted less than ten (10) days from the requested day off may only be authorized after all requests submitted ten (10) or more days prior to the requested day have been authorized. Requests submitted less than ten (10) days from the requested day off shall not be subject to this priority schedule or seniority.

4.	Temporary vacancies for purposes of relief (e.g. vacation, medical, suspension, detail) shall be no longer than the duration of the temporary vacancies. Temporary vacancies and details will not be used to circumvent a vacancy that is required to be filled by seniority bid in accord with this Article.

the selection process therefore, the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator is for the purpose of addressing problems that may arise which unreasonably interfere with the effective performance of the Department’s mission;
3.	The Arbitrator shall render a decision within seventy-two (72) hours of the close of the hearing, or such other time upon which the parties mutually agree.

The Committee may make recommendations to the Superintendent and to the PBPA, but shall not have the authority to modify any express provision of this Agreement. Any such modification shall require the written agreement of the Superintendent and the PBPA.
E.	Sergeant’s Unit Selection
1.	Annually, between November 01 and November 30, a Sergeant may submit a PAR form stating up to two (2) preferences for a unit assignment for the following year. The Sergeant may attach a one-page resume to the PAR form.
2.	The Unit Commander will consider a Sergeant’s declared preference for a unit when a vacancy is declared in such unit except for those vacancies filled according to Article 31 A. The Unit Commander is under no obligation to select the Sergeant. The PBPA-Sergeants 156 will be advised of the Sergeants who have been selected to fill unit vacancies.
ARTICLE 33
COMPLETE AGREEMENT
The parties acknowledge that, during the negotiations which preceded this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining. The understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Except as may be stated in this Agreement, each party voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to, or covered in this Agreement or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated and signed this Agreement.

ARTICLE 34
SAVINGS CLAUSE
If any provisions of this Agreement or any application thereof, should be rendered or declared unlawful, invalid or unenforceable by virtue of any judicial action, or by any existing or subsequently enacted Federal or State legislation, or by Executive Order or other competent authority, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In such event, upon the request of either party, the parties shall meet promptly and negotiate with respect to substitute provisions for those provisions rendered or declared unlawful, invalid or unenforceable.

APPENDIX B
NOTICE TO SUPERVISORS REGARDING PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE
Supervisors, including Commanders, retain the flexibility, authority and discretion where circumstances warrant to issue reprimands to offending officers for infractions. Second or even repeated infractions of minor rules may, but do not always, require increased punishment (particularly including loss of time or income) when a reprimand will suffice to achieve the goal of correcting improper behavior.
There is some belief that a progressive system of discipline requires enhanced penalties no matter how insignificant the infraction. This is not correct.
You are permitted and urged to use your judgment in determining the appropriate level of discipline. Officers in this department are a valuable resource which should not be wasted or unduly restricted.

109508.1
APPENDIX J
HIGH RISK PREGNANCY SCREENING PROGRAM
In order to reduce the risk of a premature birth and the attendant health risks to mother and child and to avoid the costs associated with same, the City offers a high risk pregnancy screening program. The program is part of the medical advisor program.
Under the program, a pregnant employee, spouse or dependent is encouraged to notify the medical advisor during the first trimester of pregnancy. During the telephone interview, the nurse reviewers will collect information on the health status of the prospective mother, her medical history, and conduct a health risk assessment to determine if she meets criteria for a high risk pregnancy.
If the prospective mother does not meet criteria, the medical advisor will offer educational materials on pregnancy and advise her that an advisor will be following up with a call in her second trimester of pregnancy. Further, the advisor will advise her that an advisor is available if she has any questions about her pregnancy. Subsequent follow-up will depend on the course of the pregnancy. As delivery approaches, the advisor will advise her about expected lengths of stay postpartum.
If the prospective mother meets criteria for a high risk pregnancy, the medical advisor will contact her physician to discuss the risk factors and identify what steps, if any, are appropriate to reduce the risk of early delivery. A designee of the medical advisory will follow the case as appropriate. If home health or other services available under the plan are necessary, the advisor will approve the care plan and negotiate discounts for approved services. A designee of the medical advisory will be available as a resource to both the prospective mother and her physician.
76
109508.1
APPENDIX K PROCEDURES FOR INJURY ON DUTY AND RECURRENCE CLAIMS
A Sergeant who has been certified as injured on duty shall be provided a group of three available physicians for treatment. Groupings of three available physicians will be randomly selected from a pool of physicians who are members in good standing of a network of workman's compensation physicians qualified to render appropriate medical care for the injury claimed. The groupings of physicians will be rotated on a weekly basis until all members of the pool have appeared in a group which was available for Sergeant selection, at which point the process will repeat itself. The Sergeant will select a physician from the group provided by the Employer. The Medical Services Section will refer the Sergeant to the physician selected by the Sergeant.
A Sergeant claiming a recurrence of an injury on duty will have his/her claim evaluated by a physician from the Medical Services Section. If that physician finds the condition complained of is not a recurrence, the Medical Services Section will provide the Sergeant with a list of three physicians chosen in the manner described above. Should the physician who treated the original injury on duty be a member in good standing of the pool of workman's compensation physicians from which the group of three physicians was chosen, then that physician will be added to the group of three physicians provided to the Sergeant. The Sergeant will select a physician from the group provided by the Employer. The Medical Services Section will refer the Sergeant to the physician selected by the Sergeant.
Should the Sergeant or the Department not agree with the medical finding, of the referral physician, either party may seek another opinion. The Sergeant will select another physician from a different group of three physicians chosen in the manner described above. The Medical Services Section will refer the Sergeant to the physician selected by the Sergeant. Should that physician's opinion agree with the finding of the first referral physician, it will be binding on both the Sergeant and the Employer. Should that medical opinion disagree with the first opinion, the parties may accept the second opinion or seek a third opinion. The process for obtaining a third opinion shall follow the same procedure as selection of the second opinion. The finding of the third physician agreeing with either of the previous opinions shall be binding on both the Sergeant and the Employer.
77
109508.1
APPENDIX L
SUBROGATION LANGUAGE FOR CITY
OF CHICAGO
In the event the Plan provides benefits for injury, illness, medical care or other loss (the “Injury”) to any person, the Plan is subrogated to all present and future rights of recovery that person, his/her parents, heirs, guardians, executors, or other representatives (individually and collectively called the “Participant”) may have arising out of the Injury. The Plan’s subrogation rights include, without limitation, all rights of recovery a Participant has: 1) against any person, insurance company or other entity that is in any way responsible for providing or does provide damages, compensation, indemnification or benefits for the Injury; 2) under any law or policy of insurance or accident benefit plan providing No Fault, Personal Injury Protection or financial responsibility insurance; 3) under uninsured or underinsured motorist insurance; 4) under motor vehicle medical reimbursement insurance; and 5) under specific risk or group accident and health coverage or insurance, including, without limitation, premises or homeowners medical reimbursement, athletic team, school or workers compensation coverages or insurance.
Upon notice of an Injury claim, the Plan may assert a subrogation lien to the extent it has provided, or may be required to provide, Injury-related benefits. Notice of either the Plan’s right of subrogation or the Plan’s subrogation lien is sufficient to establish the Plan’s rights of subrogation and entitlement to reimbursement from insurers, third parties, or other persons or entities against whom a Participant may have an Injury-related right of recovery. The Plan shall be entitled to intervene in or institute legal action when necessary to protect its subrogation or reimbursement rights.
The Participant and anyone acting on his/her behalf shall promptly provide the Plan or its authorized agents with information it deems appropriate to protect its right of subrogation and shall do nothing to prejudice that right and shall cooperate fully with the Plan in the enforcement of its subrogation rights. Reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of Participant’s attorney shall be paid first from any recovery by or on behalf of a Participant, and the amount of the Plan’s subrogation claim shall be paid next from such recovery. Neither a Participant nor his/her attorney or other representative is authorized to accept subrogation or other Injury-related reimbursement payments on behalf of the Plan, to negotiate or compromise the Plan’s subrogation claim, or to release any right of recovery prior to the payment of the Plan’s subrogation claim.
The Participant and all other parties to a recovery are required to contact the Plan to determine, and arrange to pay the Plan’s subrogation claim at or prior to the time an Injury-related payment or settlement is made to or for the benefit of the Participant. If the Participant
78
109508.1
obtains a payment or settlement from a party without the Plan’s knowledge and agreement, the Plan shall be entitled to immediate reimbursement of its total subrogation claim from the Participant or any party providing any Injury-related payment. In the alternative, the Plan, in its sole discretion, may deny payment of benefits to or on behalf of the Participant for any otherwise covered claim incurred by the Participant until the amount of the unpaid coverage is equal to and offset by the unrecovered amount of the Plan’s subrogation claim. -
The Plan Administrator or its authorized agents are vested with full and final discretionary authority to construe subrogation and other Plan terms and to reduce or compromise the amount of the Plan’s recoverable interest where, in the sole discretion of the Plan Administrator or its authorized agents, circumstances warrant such action. The Plan shall not be responsible for any litigation-related expenses or attorney fees incurred by or on behalf of a Participant in connection with an Injury claim unless the Plan shall have specifically agreed, in writing, to pay such expenses or fees.
The payment of benefits to or on behalf of the Participant is contingent on both the Participant’s full compliance with the Plan’s provisions, including the subrogation provision, and, when the Plan deems appropriate, the Participant’s signing of a reimbursement agreement. However, the Participant’s failure to sign this reimbursement agreement will not affect the Plan’s subrogation rights or its right to assert a lien against any source of possible recovery and to collect the amount of its subrogation claim.

Dear Marv:
This letter confirms our discussion that currently neither Section 20.10, Rank Credit, nor Section 26.2, Quarterly Differential, is applicable to any rank below Sergeant. As the City has advised you, it is our position that those two benefits should not be extended, and we have no plans to extend them, to any rank below Sergeant. However, in order to resolve this contract, and in an effort to allay any concerns that the Association might have (regardless of how remote those concerns might be), please regard this letter as an assurance that, should the City extend either of these benefits to any rank below Sergeant, we will re-open for negotiation, upon written notice from the Sergeants’ Association, the collective bargaining agreement with regard to these two items.
Assuming that this letter comports with your understanding, please so indicate by signing below.
Very truly yours,.■ s''	/" \	I

Re: Notification of Legal Action and Creation of Lien
Dear Marv:
This letter confirms our understanding, as follows:
Whenever a Sergeant covered by this Agreement is absent from work on account of injury or illness and receives salary during such absence pursuant to the provisions of Article 18 (Disability Income), the Sergeant shall notify the Employer of the name and address of any attorneys the Sergeant retains for the purpose of prosecuting a claim on his behalf because of said iryury or illness and, as a condition for receiving such salary, shall acknowledge on the Employer’s form the creation of a lien in favor of the City of Chicago which shall attach to any recovery which the Sergeant has or may effect from the person or party whom it is claimed is responsible for the injury or illness in the full amount the City of Chicago has or may expend on the Sergeant’s behalf for said salary. Said lien is in addition to any other lien the City may possess with respect to payment of medical and/or hospital expenses.

Re: Educational Reimbursement
Dear Marv:
This letter confirms our conversation that, in connection with ARTICLE 24, Educational Reimbursement, “college or university” in Section A4. has been applied under the FOP contract to mean a college or university accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities and is a college or university within die State of Illinois. We agreed that this is the interpretation which will be used under this provision for the Sergeants, Lieutenants and Captains. In the event that this interpretation is changed by agreement with the FOP or through arbitration with the FOP, any such change will also apply to Sergeants, Lieutenants and Captains.
Please indicate your agreement by signing below.

RE: Hours and Overtime
Dear Mr. Franczek:
This will confirm the discussions and agreements reached during negotiations relating to the subject of compensation for overtime. The parties understand and agree, as follows:
The normal work day shall mean the regular tour of duty of eight (8) hours or, where applicable, a regular tour of duty of ten (10) hours, both exclusive of the one-half hour lunch period.
The overtime rate in excess of 171 in a 28-day period (the FLSA rate) shall be calculated to include, in addition to the base salary, the value of quarterly payments, duty availability pay and the one-half hour (referred to as "rank credit" in the contract).
In the event the Employer agrees to provide or authorizes the uses of the FLSA rate or any higher rate to calculate overtime or related benefits for hours of 170 or less for a 28-day work period with any other bargaining unit, such calculation shall be made applicable to the Sergeants' unit of 156.
Please indicate your acknowledgment and agreement in the space provided below.
