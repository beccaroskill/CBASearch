and towns of Rhode Island covered by this collective bargaining agreement. The practice outside of  
Rhode Island shall not be considered in making work assignments.  
In the event a jurisdictional dispute arises, then the disputing unions shall! request the other union  
or unions involved to send representatives to a mutually agreed upon site to meet with representatives of  
the Union and Employer to settle the dispute.  
If the above procedures, or any other mutually agreed upon procedure, fails to resolve the  
problem, then the Employer, at the request of the Union, agrees to participate in a tripartite arbitration  
with all the disputing parties. The impartial umpire to hear the dispute can be mutually agreed upon by  
the parties, or appointed by the American Arbitration Association. Shall rotate among the following  
arbitrators: Tim Bornstein, Mark Irvings, and Lawrence Katz. The parties agree to make themselves  
available for an arbitration hearing within thirty (30) days of the filing for arbitration, and if the parties  
cannot agree upon a daytime date within the thirty day period, the parties will make themselves available  
for an evening hearing. If the parties cannot agree on a hearing date within the thirty days, the arbitrator
